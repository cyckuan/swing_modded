STEPHENS GIVES BRUINS A SAFETY NET
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At first glance, Jason Stephens appears an
unlikely answer to UCLA's most pressing problem. He lacks the size
and experience to fill the ever-expanding hole at strong safety
alongside All-American Larry Atkins.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Whitfield, Tod McBride and DuVal Hicks _ all tried and
faltered. Either they were improperly aligned or they missed
tackles or they blew coverages. It was so bad against Oregon that
Atkins played both positions at the same time, which meant he
played neither.
</P>
<P>
   One option remained. A 190-pound redshirt freshman from
Redlands, Stephens is wide-eyed and lanky. In his first career
start, against Cal, he had eight tackles and a sack. He provided
ample run support. He was properly aligned. He did not blow
coverages.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the strong safety, you have to force the run,'' Stephens
said. ``That was the No. 1 thing I emphasized. I don't have the
size, so I want to be tough. Once I got my first tackle (on Cal's
opening possession), I got my groove.''
</P>
<P>
   Can he keep it up? The Bruins are optimistic; Stephens has
superb instincts and loads of athletic ability. But they are
cautious, as well, because he had a chance in training camp and was
outplayed by Whitfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``All last year I was thinking I'd be starting at free safety as
a redshirt freshman,'' he said. ``It got to the point that I felt
myself timid during spring with (first-year defensive coordinator)
Nick Aliotti and the changes and fighting for the position. It
discouraged me a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, after learning the system and switching from
free to strong safety, he's a different player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing with more confidence,'' coach Bob Toledo said.
``He's learning through experience to do things better. When he was
given the opportunity, he didn't take advantage of it. He didn't
prove to be better than the others. But it got to the point we
said, `We'll give you a chance.' And he has responded very well.''
</P>
<P>
   More BCS: UCLA's No. 1 ranking in the Bowl Championship Series
poll is based, in part, on its strength-of-schedule. UCLA's six
opponents have a combined winning percentage of 62.7, while Ohio
State's seven opponents have a winning percentage of 54.
</P>
<P>
   Each time Miami, Texas and Houston win, it helps the Bruins. And
in case you haven't noticed, the Hurricanes upset West Virginia
last week and are 4-2, while the Longhorns have won four in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford stat of the week: The Cardinal is one of two teams in
Pacific-10 history to allow at least 30 points in seven consecutive
games. Oregon, in 1986, is the other.
</P>
<P>
   Short and sweet: With a plethora of minor injuries, Toledo ended
Tuesday's practice 15 minutes early. The Bruins will practice in
helmets and shoulder pads today and forgo their full-contact work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do alignments and assignments,'' Toledo said. ``With
daylight (standard) time, it's getting cold and late. I don't want
to beat them up. We need to teach.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the depleted practice roster, only one regular, tailback
DeShaun Foster, won't play Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: The Bruins have excelled in two of the most
important categories: They lead the Pac-10 in turnover margin
(plus-1.5), and they have scored on 85 percent of their red zone
opportunities (inside the 20-yard line).
</P>
<P>
   Top 10: Toledo is one of 10 finalists for the Football Writers
Association Coach of the Year Award.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Toledo are: Missouri's Larry Smith, Oregon's Mike
Bellotti, Arizona's Dick Tomey, Tennessee's Phil Fulmer, Arkansas'
Houston Nutt, Wisconsin's Barry Alvarez, Kansas State's Bill
Snyder, Tulane's Tommy Bowden and Georgia Tech's George O'Leary.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Houston won the bathing-suit competition.
</P>
<P>
   Everything in its well-packaged NFL expansion proposal was in
the right place, and the figures were quite impressive.
</P>
<P>
   But Los Angeles group No. 1 _ the New Coliseum Ventures _ won
the talent competition. Despite completely revamping its proposed
stadium design just weeks ago, the group managed to wheel in a
scale model of its stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The model came complete with miniature cars in the parking lot
and miniature people in the grandstands. The group also cleverly
left out the miniature muggers lurking in the shrubs outside.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Los Angeles group No. 2 _ Michael Ovitz's Hollywood
stars _ won the evening-gown competition. Have we mentioned Sharon
Stone is a partner in this group? No further explanation required.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite the impressive day Tuesday at the NFL meetings, but
the search for a leading candidate to become the NFL's 32nd team
was futile.
</P>
<P>
   It merely was a beauty contest. It was three contestants dressed
to the nines, searching for NFL team No. 32 and looking out for No.
1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not any different from Houston,'' Coliseum leader Ed
Roski pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   Responded Houston's Steve Patterson, a partner in Bob McNair's
group: ``Do they have signed documents?''
</P>
<P>
   They don't. Then there was Ovitz, all but demanding a quick
decision from NFL owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not be here next year,'' Ovitz said. ``We cannot sit
on this project for three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz, the marketing genius, even tried to pull heartstrings,
apparently unaware that many NFL owners have been accused of not
having them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My 11-year-old son never has watched an NFL game in Los
Angeles,'' Ovitz said, all but wiping a tear from his cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone postured. Everyone posed. And at the end of the day,
NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue even played the role of master of
ceremonies, all but telling the potential NFL owners, ``You're all
winners in my book.''
</P>
<P>
   But nobody handed out the latest NFL crown or even told the NFL
hopefuls when they might expect an expansion decision from the
judges. Today? Next month? At the Super Bowl meetings in January?
At the NFL meetings next March?
</P>
<P>
   The owners simply sat there in the hotel ballroom, watched the
three presentations and walked away doing more sidestepping than
Charles Durning in The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney: ``I was impressed with
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen: ``They all look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Vikings owner B.J. ``Red'' McCombs: ``Houston was
fantastic but I wouldn't say anyone was better than the other.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what it would take for one of these three potential
NFL groups to distinguish itself, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones
actually said the following: ``That's the answer. And I don't know
the answer. Hopefully, it will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Huh? If it was an answer to Houston's NFL dreams you were
looking for, you had to look hard. But finally, Buffalo Bills owner
Ralph Wilson stripped this beauty contest down to what it's really
all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of money,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course. The owners spent most of Tuesday playing one group
off the next and off the next. And they will continue to do so
until the price for expansion is right and pretenders fall out of
the contest like so many Miss South Dakotas.
</P>
<P>
   It is the reason a decision on expansion did not come Tuesday
and probably won't for a long while. The longer owners can force
these contestants to keep posing and primping for the judges _ and
keep pulling promises from their cities' leadership _ the more
likely the eventual expansion fee will keep rising.
</P>
<P>
   Had owners agreed Tuesday that an expansion group distinguished
itself, that there was a clear leader in the race, they might have
cost themselves about $100 million. The expansion price to play the
game would have been locked at about $350 million to $375 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the longer all three candidates look good, the longer they
strut and posture and politic, the more likely they will keep
digging deeper and doing more. Eventually, the expansion fee could
reach $400 million or even $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Only then will a decision be made and an expansion crown handed
out. Clearly, most NFL owners want Los Angeles to get the eventual
expansion team, but they wouldn't mind if Houston won or if another
team landed in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Like Patterson said, ``Los Angeles is Los Angeles, but we're not
exactly Dime Box or even Old Dime Box.''
</P>
<P>
   And this isn't a penny-ante game. Tuesday's shows were
impressive, but they were simply cosmetic. All the Houston group
can do is keep smiling, keep wooing the judges with high-dollar
promises, keep waiting, keep playing the game. And keep their
checkbooks open.

was the man who on the morning of Feb. 20, 1962, pressed the black

way in a Mercury capsule to be the first American to orbit the
planet. He is 83 now, still full of sass and gruff charm, and

about Clinton had receded as voters raised concerns about

   MILLET-VANGOGH-EXHIBIT (Paris) _ At first sight, the new show at
the Musee d'Orsay in Paris suggests a bizarre attempt to
resuscitate a neglected 19th-century French painter by exhibiting
him alongside a rather more famous name. In truth, the idea of
uniting Jean-Francois Millet and Van Gogh is far more interesting.
Since the Dutchman looked to the Frenchman as a role model,
Millet's life and work serve as a mirror that reveals much about
Van Gogh. By Alan Riding.

<P>
   MEMORY (Boston) _ In the moral universe, especially the one that
postdates the Holocaust, remembering is almost always enlisted on
the side of good, and forgetting on the side of bad. But in a
symposium ``The Claims of Memory,'' held at Boston University over
the last few days to celebrate Elie Wiesel's 70th birthday, it was
memory's difficult skirmishes _ battles where it has clashed with
artistic freedom, with morality, with fact, with survival, with
writing, with sanity _ that were evoked. By Sarah Boxer.

FOOTBALL COLUMN: BRONCOS TALK OF A PERFECT SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ There is an aura enveloping the Denver
Broncos, an invincibility, a feeling that this Bronco season could
be as special as last year's. Maybe even more so.
</P>
<P>
   Denver toppled Jacksonville, 37-24, on Sunday afternoon at Mile
High Stadium, and that made the Broncos 7-0. They saw one of their
own, Jason Elam, boot a record-tying 63-yard field goal, and
another, Terrell Davis, reach 1,000 yards rushing in his seventh
game, matching more league history. The quarterback, John Elway,
made his 7,000th pass attempt, a mark reached previously by only
Dan Marino. The team won its 20th consecutive regular-season home
game.
</P>
<P>
   The coach, Mike Shanahan, is keeping his players hungry and
focused, and he is staying a step ahead of the National Football
League coaching curve.
</P>
<P>
   The owner, Pat Bowlen, here among his peers at the NFL's annual
fall meeting, is feeling good. He is unmistakably noticed now. So
is his team.
</P>
<P>
   How about an unbeaten regular season? How about 16-0?
</P>
<P>
   ``People are talking about that, but it's all but impossible,''
Bowlen said of his team's chances of joining the 1972 Miami
Dolphins, who went 14-0, as the NFL's only unbeaten team. ``What I
worry about is being undefeated in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Really, though, he does not look worried at all. Neither do his
defending Super Bowl champions.
</P>
<P>
   The team has this look we have seen before. That swagger, that
look-you-in-the-eye persona. That feeling of confidence that the
49er teams with Joe Montana used to always exhibit, or the strut of
those Cowboy Super Bowl teams. The old Halas Bears, the old Jim
Brown Browns. Those scary teams that made opponents feel as if they
were at a disadvantage well before kickoff. Teams that made others
feel as if they were battling history and destiny as much as the
present.
</P>
<P>
   We know that in Davis, the Broncos have a special running back.
If he maintains his current pace, he will finish with 2,288 rushing
yards this season, an NFL record. We know that Elway is Elway. That
the Denver defense can rush the passer and stop the run and make
enough plays to keep the team's big-play offense front and center.
We know that Shanahan mixes his play-calling and he attacks
weaknesses as well as any coach today. We know that with
special-team players such as Vaughn Hebron, the Broncos can beat
you there, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Vikings are also 7-0. But what separates Denver
from most teams, maybe even the Vikings, is its offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   This is the team's wheel in the middle of the wheel. This is the
juice. The glue. The pedal. The engine and the energy.
</P>
<P>
   Elway says about this Denver line, about this offense, ``It's
nice to know that we can pretty much do whatever we want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   This line _ with Tony Jones at left tackle, Mark Schlereth at
left guard, Tom Nalen at center, Dan Neil at right guard and Harry
Swayne at right tackle _ is big and mobile. It can smack you in the
face and pull and sweep and trick. It is a treat to watch.
</P>
<P>
   This group excels at setting up cut-back running lanes, and it
is as adept at protecting Elway. It seems to gain strength as the
game goes along.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not even the same group that knocked the Green Bay
Packers backward in Super Bowl XXXII. Left tackle Gary Zimmerman
retired after last season. Right guard Brian Habib left as a free
agent for Seattle. Actually, entering this season, the offensive
line was the team's biggest question. It was supposed to be the
weak link that prevented Denver from being a serious contender to
repeat as champions.
</P>
<P>
   This is when you know you have a special team: When your
supposed weak link becomes your strength.
</P>
<P>
   This line is coached by Alex Gibbs, with Barney Chavous as an
assistant. Gibbs, 57, is in his fourth year in Denver and his 15th
in the NFL as a coach. He is a crusty fellow, a guy who is
respected throughout the league and admired by most in the Broncos'
organization. The guy is a guru at offensive line play. He knows
when to push a player and when to embrace him. He knows that
football is won in line play and makes sure that the Broncos'
offensive linemen understand that, too.
</P>
<P>
   All of the owners here at the league meetings congratulated
Bowlen months ago. They slapped him on the back and told him how
great he was and how great his team was. Now they all chase him and
his team.
</P>
<P>
   In a very short time, the Broncos have raced to the head of the
class, and they are steamrolling toward more glory. They are in a
tussle at home, hoping that financing to help build a new stadium
will be approved, but who believes that ballistic Broncos fans
won't comply, that they would let their beloved team leave? Unheard
of. They have Cincinnati and San Diego next, and then come to
Kansas City for a Monday night game against the Chiefs. Later they
play at the Giants (Dec. 13) and at Miami (Dec. 21).
</P>
<P>
   The Miami game will be intriguing if the Broncos are unbeaten
then, because it was Miami that toppled the 12-0 Bears in 1985 in
Miami. Denver will be 15-0 if it hasn't lost by the time it leaves
Miami. Unbeaten? Is it possible?
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the Super Bowl, the first time in four tries,'' Bowlen
said. ``The thing about that is, making the playoffs or winning the
AFC championship is not good enough anymore. You set out at the
beginning to win that Super Bowl again. However you win it,
unbeaten or with losses, does not matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure it does to men and teams of style. Sure it does to history.
It is that kind of season being built in Denver. A Super Bowl
victory and then 7-0. A team and owner with a big, bright balloon
that each franchise wants to pop. A team laying it on the line.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line. Not a bad place, at all.

D'AMATO ADMITS HE MISSED VOTES DURING '80 SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (DUPLICATION WARNING: The following story is also being transmitted
with an ``a'' category code) 
 (bl) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last 27 days, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., has hammered
at a single theme, attacking his Democratic challenger, Rep.
Charles Schumer, for skipping votes in the House to tend to his
Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You haven't been there to vote,'' D'Amato scolded Schumer in a
debate Saturday. ``Chuck Schumer always puts politics over
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, a week before the election, the senator's campaign
acknowledged that when he was the vice chairman of the Nassau
County Board of Supervisors, D'Amato had done much the same thing
when he first ran for the Senate, in 1980. The board held six
meetings during that fall election season, and D'Amato, then the
presiding supervisor of Hempstead Town, was absent for five of
them. County records show that he stopped attending board meetings
altogether after Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The information about D'Amato's voting record was released
because the Schumer campaign had aggressively and enthusiastically
circulated minutes of the board meetings to newspapers and
television stations Tuesday in an attempt to set the tone for the
final week of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The D'Amato campaign countered that D'Amato's attendance at
county board meetings almost 20 years ago was peripheral to this
contest. ``I suppose he also missed a few days of school in
elementary school,'' said his spokesman, Robert Bellafiore.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, the disclosure about D'Amato's lax attendance
record in 1980 would appear to go directly to the heart of each
candidate's campaign: D'Amato's criticism of Schumer's absences
this year, and Schumer's attacks on D'Amato's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, it would appear to give Schumer, who until
last week seemed beleaguered by D'Amato's attacks, ammunition to
counter the charges that D'Amato has made the central part of his
campaign. Beyond that, Schumer's aides, said the disclosure
bolstered Schumer's attempt to portray D'Amato as hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   It also could mean that D'Amato, who spent last week responding
to criticism that he used an offensive Yiddish expression to
describe Schumer and then denied having done it, may now have to
spend the next few days discussing his own attendance record.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   D'Amato was asked about the disclosure as he traveled across the
state with Gov. George Pataki after Schumer's aides tipped off
reporters about the information and after word had spread that The
Village Voice had posted an article on D'Amato's attendance on its
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Although political campaigns, particularly ones as well financed
as D'Amato's, typically examine the background of their own
candidate to anticipate any attack, the senator and his aides
seemed unprepared for this. On the very day that the information
surfaced, D'Amato released a new television advertisement attacking
Schumer's attendance record, this one illustrated with a desk
covered with cobwebs.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, who grew slightly testy as he responded to questions
about the subject throughout the day, accused Schumer of raising
the issue to divert attention from his own attendance record in
Congress. Schumer had an attendance record of about 77 percent this
year, and has a career attendance record of 92 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 18 years, I've delivered for the people of New York,''
D'Amato told reporters as his chartered plane flew from Rochester
to Niagara. ``I've performed my duties, day in and day out. Whether
it is campaign time or not. I think what we find is that Schumer is
engaged in a desperate attempt to divert attention from his failed
record for the last two sessions, the last two years of the
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in Buffalo, when asked by a television reporter to
elaborate on the differences between his missed votes and Schumer's
absences, D'Amato snapped: ``I wasn't in the Congress, son.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's campaign seized gleefully on the incident. ``Al
D'Amato lives in a glass house and for the past six weeks he's been
throwing stones,'' said Howard Wolfson, the Schumer campaign
spokesman. ``Today, Al D'Amato's glass house shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   It also seems likely that Schumer's campaign will quickly
spotlight these developments in a television advertisement.
Tuesday, one of Schumer's advisers easily ticked off examples in
which D'Amato had appeared before the cameras discussing how
important it was for legislators to tend to their governmental
duties before their political interests _ the kind of clip that
might lend itself to an advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, it now seems increasingly likely that this
campaign, no matter what the outcome, is going to be remembered for
the fighting over attendance records.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer campaign manager Josh Isay said the congressman's
organization _ which had at first appeared flummoxed in trying to
respond to D'Amato's attacks _ has been actively investigating
D'Amato's attendance record for some time, but declined further
comment. He credited The Village Voice with being the first to
report the disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato began using the attendance issue against Schumer in a
television advertisement Oct. 1, and has not dropped it since. The
senator's advisers have looked at the missed-votes issue as perhaps
the key to the senator's re-election, and returned to the theme,
virtually to the exclusion of all others, through the last month.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's advisers said that their polls had showed that the
attacks were working. However, a series of recent public polls,
including a New York Times/CBS News poll, have shown the race in a
dead heat, and suggested that the issue had not yet taken hold. The
latest Times/CBS News poll, conducted Oct. 21 through Oct. 25,
found that most respondents considered the attacks to be politics
as usual. &QL;

SOARING MARKET COULD PRICE M'S OUT OF CONTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Citizens of Marinerville did not need Mike Piazza and
the Mets to tell them they're out of luck when it comes to keeping
up with the Joneses, which in baseball are the Yankees, Orioles,
Atlanta and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   These are baseball's heaviest hitters _ teams willing to cough
up more than $60 million in annual payroll or commit huge contracts
to single superstars.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have accomplished that by bequeathing $91 million over
seven years to Piazza, who is going to save the Mets in the box
score and at the box office, or else.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Piazza deal is being heralded as a prudent
business decision. The Mets are not just competing against the
National League East for a playoff berth. They also have to worry
about competition from that nice little team in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   And now it looks likely that the Piazza deal will also help
dissolve the relationship between the Yankees and their center
fielder, Bernie Williams, whose heavy-hitting agent, Scott Boras,
can smell blood.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have accomplished the most significant thing a pro
sports franchise can do in these days of spectacular risk and
reward: they have altered the market. They have made every single
baseball club in the land look around, look at its own roster and
wonder how the heck they are going to make this puppy work.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners should be among the top head scratchers now, since
they are still grappling with how to sustain the expectation of
fielding a World Series contender with a middle-class budget.
</P>
<P>
   As one Mariner player recently told me, the M's give the
appearance of ``wanting to be like the Yankees, but they act like
the Pittsburgh Pirates.'' This is a bit of an exaggeration since
the M's well exceeded the Pirates' payroll, and Ken Griffey Jr. at
$8.5 million a year did once sit on top of baseball's salary
mountain. But he makes his point: the M's aren't wheeling and
dealing at any cost for a ring.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it did not take ``Piazza money'' to show Marinerville
citizens that the M's are not willing or able to jump whenever the
free-agent market salary jumps.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, when Randy Johnson was all better from
back surgery and throwing smoke again, the Mariners got their dose
of smelling salts from Ted Turner's juggernaut when Greg Maddux
signed a deal worth $11 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, everyone understood what was coming for Johnson
and the M's. Even before the infamous November 1997 announcement
that there would be no deal for Johnson, the handwriting was on the
wall. The M's were not going to pay ``Maddux money'' to their
34-year-old, franchise-saving pitcher, no matter how great a draw,
no matter how much Johnson all but guaranteed 18 or 20 wins a
season.
</P>
<P>
   This may all seem like ancient history now, but there is a point
to bringing it up again. If ``Maddux money'' killed the Mariners'
resolve to re-sign Johnson (or made him unwilling to sign), does
``Piazza money'' destroy the Mariners' willingness or ability to
re-sign both Alex Rodriguez and Ken Griffey Jr., whose current
contracts expire after the 2000 season?
</P>
<P>
   Not many teams could stomach locking 40 percent of their payroll
in two players, even two future Hall of Famers. So who would be
surprised if the M's have a very tough time resolving this issue,
especially since their Japanese-led consortium of owners is a hard
sell.
</P>
<P>
   This is a bittersweet dilemma, trying to find a way to keep two
of the game's most gifted and attractive young stars and still
field a competitive team in this day of the $13 million man.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intent is to keep both of them here,'' Lee Pelekoudas, the
M's vice president of baseball operations, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't always point to one signing and say that is now the
market. There's always an odd signing, although it's hard to tell
if this $13 million-a-year-deal (with Piazza) is an aberration.''
</P>
<P>
   These are harsh times in pro sports. The greater the financial
glory for the players, the greater the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Fans can't begin to account for a market that all but demands
the dismantling of good teams, the separation of superlative
talent. And it's not much easier for club presidents or general
managers.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, before the Mariners are forced to tackle this
franchise-defining decision on Griffey and Rodriguez, they will no
doubt find the Johnson debacle staring them in the face.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers, with their deep pockets and will to succeed,
will make a run at Johnson. Texas will try to lure the Big Unit to
an American League club that already promises to be a contender. If
they are successful, the Rangers will no doubt have a fantastic
chance of haunting the Mariners for all of 1999, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to commend the Rangers if they get him because it
means they are committed to winning,'' Rodriguez said Tuesday from
his home in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy Johnson is the guy we should go after. He's the No. 1
guy out there. Say what you want about Randy, he's going to win. We
have a small window of opportunity. We're not the youngest team,
but we have a $400 million stadium, and we are drawing big crowds.
It's a shame. A guy like that should play the rest of his career
here.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, heaven forbid, we all might be saying the same thing
about our A-Rod.

WILLIAM IRWIN, 91, PIANIST AND CONDUCTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ky., N.Y., Ill.)   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William C.K. Irwin, a pianist and conductor, died
Oct. 23 at the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged in Manhattan.
He was 91 and had lived for many years on Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin spent much of his career in musical theater. He was
introduced to George Gershwin by composer Vernon Duke in the 1920s
and was a regular dinner guest at Gershwin's Manhattan apartment,
where he would sit in on impromptu piano improvisations with
Gershwin and pianist Oscar Levant.
</P>
<P>
   Gershwin introduced Irwin to Irving Berlin, starting a musical
relationship that lasted six years. Irwin worked alongside Berlin,
writing melodies as they were composed, and often had to hurry over
to Berlin's studio in the middle of the night to write down a new
tune that had popped into the composer's head.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s Irwin was music director for the national tours of
``Oklahoma!,'' ``South Pacific'' and ``The King and I.'' He became
choral director for Radio City Music Hall in the 1960s and later
was the staff composer and musical director for the music hall. He
retired in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Born in San Francisco, Irwin grew up in Louisville, Ky. As a
teen-ager, he studied piano in Chicago with the composer Percy
Grainger and then moved to New York to continue his studies at the
Manhattan School of Music.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin's wife, Helen, died in 1984. He is survived by a son,
Dean, a producer for ABC News.

   As new local phone companies have taken on old communications
giants, some of the upstarts have come to rely on a quirk of
negotiation and technology that has grown into a cash cow. It goes
by the name of reciprocal compensation.

   Reciprocal compensation, which is meant to make up for some of
the new carriers' expenses, is costing the regional Bell companies
and GTE Corp. hundreds of millions of dollars a year, so it is not
surprising that they think it is little more than an unfair
loophole. By the end of this week, the Federal Communications
Commission will almost certainly begin heading down a regulatory
road that could mean the cash cow's demise.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are regulatory jurisdiction over the Internet and the
ways in which companies will be allowed to profit from it. In the
battle over reciprocal compensation, old phone companies, new phone
companies and regulators have entered a new stage in figuring out
the structure of a communications industry based on data, rather
than voice conversations.
</P>
<P>
   When new local phone companies began to emerge a few years ago,
they negotiated deals with the incumbents to determine how to share
costs for local calls. When a customer using Acme Phone Co., for
instance, calls someone who uses Bell Atlantic, Acme pays Bell
Atlantic a small fee to compensate Bell Atlantic for carrying its
end of the call, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   In those negotiations, the incumbents often held out for higher
rates, up to eight-tenths of a cent a minute, according to people
close to the commission. The incumbents thought that higher rates
would hurt the new carriers because, naturally, there would be
proportionally more traffic flowing from the new carriers' small
customer bases to the incumbents' big rosters of customers than the
other way around.
</P>
<P>
   But the new companies outsmarted the giants. They began to focus
sales efforts on Internet service providers, with their thousands
of phone lines. The beauty of that strategy is that phone calls for
Internet providers are almost entirely incoming. At the same time,
most of the people making the calls use the incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   One result is that the Bells and GTE are on track to pay more
than $500 million in reciprocal compensation to new local phone
companies this year. Another result is that for the upstarts as a
group, the fees provide 26 percent of their earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a benchmark for
small companies, according to Daniel Reingold, a Merrill Lynch
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   The incumbents say they should not have to pay the fees for
Internet calls, because calls to cyberspace are long distance, not
local. Twenty-three states have disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   But the FCC has not given concrete guidance on that question,
leading to a patchwork of reactions. BellSouth, for instance, is
refusing to pay the fees for Internet calls and is fighting in
court while Bell Atlantic is paying. SBC Communications is paying
into an escrow account in California while the question remains
unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a tariff filing from GTE for a high-speed data service,
digital subscriber lines, is forcing the issue. If the FCC, which
generally has jurisdiction only over interstate matters, approves
GTE's prices, it could be interpreted to have affirmed that
Internet communications are inherently long distance. And
long-distance communications are not eligible for reciprocal
compensation. Such confusion is almost sure to lead to more
explicit guidance from the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond all this, most of the contracts between new and old phone
companies are to expire over the next two years anyway, prompting
new negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   That could leave the commission some wiggle room. It could, for
instance, support the current contracts but try to force down
future fees.
</P>
<P>
   The haggling and debate continued at the commission yesterday,
with some regulators hoping to lower the fees while not wounding
the new carriers. Some sort of official action is expected by this
weekend.

LEONARD SITS OUT SEASON ON THE FARM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a week Matt Leonard wouldn't eat. Couldn't eat. He lost 12
pounds and vomited until his stomach muscles strained and ached.
Trainers thought it was a virus, but a week of testing offered no
scientific conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   It was homesickness and as homesickness goes, this was
insufferable. Intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   And it came during two-a-day football workouts at Stanford but
happened much more than twice a day. Leonard had no family near, no
friends at Stanford and no cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not fully back as far as strength is concerned,''
Leonard said. ``I was really, really homesick. But I never thought
about leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, a 6-foot-4, 290-pound defensive end, was the Daily
News' Defensive Player of the Year at Palmdale High last fall. He
was also expected to push for a starting spot at some point this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Then he took ill. Violently ill. And that, more than being a
freshman, has kept Leonard out of the Pacific-10 trenches this
season.
</P>
<P>
   If Leonard was healthy in training camp, he would be playing
this week against No. 2 UCLA at the Rose Bowl on Saturday. Instead,
he'll be inactive as he finishes up his redshirt season.
</P>
<P>
   ``All things being equal, he would have had a chance to do a
lot,'' Stanford defensive-ends coach Phil Zacharias said. ``It was
tough for him. The one thing about going somewhere new is you don't
know anybody, and he ran into that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be a good player. He was very raw in terms of
what we do, but he's learning, just like every young player we've
got.''
</P>
<P>
   As it's worked out, redshirting this year hasn't been all
terrible for Leonard. He admits to having the excitement of game
day muffled and feeling too far removed from the team when the
Cardinal takes road trips.
</P>
<P>
   But other sides exist. While at Palmdale, Leonard dominated
opposing offenses with sheer speed and athleticism. Then he started
practicing against experienced offensive linemen at Stanford and
wondered how the heck he ever made a play at Palmdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high school I got by because I was bigger and stronger than
anyone else, but here you're going on technique more than anything,
and I'm just learning that,'' Leonard said. ``I had no technique,
no nothing.... This year I was not mentally prepared to play. It
was like a year of prep school.''
</P>
<P>
   And Leonard isn't just talking about the ABCs of using his hands
to fend off blockers or reading gap assignments. Leonard is also
speaking of Stanford's academics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to all the lectures and it seems like I have a good grasp
on what's going on,'' said Leonard, who hasn't declared a major.
``Then I get the exams and see the (instructors' comments) and it's
like, `Say what?' `Where did this come from.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even through the sickness that zapped his strength and his
admitted unpreparedness, injuries to Stanford's defensive line
forced the coaching staff to contemplate playing Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   But during the past few weeks, when the Cardinal defensive line
was most desperate for healthy bodies, the overwhelming variable in
not playing Leonard was Stanford's standing. The Cardinal is 1-6,
0-4 in the Pacific-10, and going nowhere but to spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only have four games left so you'd have to be in a train
wreck to suit somebody up who's redshirting, and then you might
forfeit the game instead,'' Stanford defensive coordinator Bill
Harris said jokingly. ``You don't know how much he could have
helped, but the way we've played he couldn't hurt. He seems to have
a lot more athleticism than what we usually get here. I'll be
looking for him in the spring.''

J. REESE PHIFER, 82, FOUNDER OF ALUMINUM SCREEN EMPIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala.)   By ROBERT DeWITT  
 (The Tuscaloosa News)   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times Regional Newspapers    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. _ J. Reese Phifer, who turned a tiny aluminum
screen factory into a business that dominates its worldwide market,
died Oct. 25 at DCH Regional Medical Center in Tuscaloosa. He was
82.
</P>
<P>
   Phifer Wire Products Inc., which was started in 1952 in an old
warehouse by Phifer, a lawyer with no previous manufacturing
experience, now employs more than 1,000 people to produce more than
half the world's aluminum insect screening and more than 60 percent
of the world's fiberglass insect screening.
</P>
<P>
   The company Phifer founded also produces Sunscreen, which blocks
out solar rays and reduces heat, and Phifertex, a vinyl coating
used on outdoor furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Feb. 19, 1916, Phifer was the son of William and Olga
Gough Phifer. His father operated a grocery store, and Phifer and
his brother grew up delivering groceries and stocking shelves.
</P>
<P>
   He earned a bachelor's degree in commerce and a law degree from
the University of Alabama. He also learned to fly, and airplanes
would later play an important role in his business. He set up a law
practice and trained French and British pilots in Tuscaloosa County
when World War II broke out, said his brother, Joseph Tyler Phifer
of Tuscaloosa. Later, Phifer ferried airplanes needed in the war
effort from the United States to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he resumed his law practice, but he sought new
challenges. ``He told me that he wanted to get into
manufacturing,'' his brother said. ``He said that's where the money
was. He looked all over for something that wasn't manufactured in
the South. He came up with screen because we use more screen in the
South than anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he started Phifer Aluminum Screen Co. in 1952, Phifer did a
little of everything. ``He was doing the selling himself,'' Joseph
Phifer said. ``He'd get in his plane and sell the wire and then
come home and help make it. He had a little bitty office with one
secretary and the guy who helped him set up the looms.''
</P>
<P>
   The company was renamed Phifer Wire Products in 1956. In 1973,
the company moved to its current site and has experienced almost
constant expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Though he preferred to keep a low profile, Phifer was also
widely known as a civic leader and philanthropist. In honor of his
contributions to the University of Alabama, the university's
trustees renamed the old student union building Reese Phifer Hall
in 1991. It now houses the School of Communication. He also
received an honorary doctorate from the university in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Phifer established the Reese Phifer Jr. Memorial Trust,
a charitable arm of Phifer Wire, in honor of his son, who died in
an airplane accident.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his brother, Phifer is survived by his wife, Sue
Clarkson Phifer of Tuscaloosa; three daughters, Beverly Clarkson
Phifer, Karen Phifer Brooks and Susan Phifer Cork, all of
Tuscaloosa, and seven grandchildren.

VERNER PANTON, 72, DANISH DESIGNER AND ARCHITECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Verner Panton, the Danish industrial designer and architect
known for his radical molded-plastic chairs, op-art-inspired
textiles and lighting, died at his home in Copenhagen, Denmark, on
Sept. 5. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, according to his office in Basel,
Switzerland, where he also had a residence.
</P>
<P>
   Panton was in the forefront of postwar European and American
designers who were exploring new materials and their potential for
mass production.
</P>
<P>
   Like Charles and Ray Eames and Eero Saarinen before him, Panton
focused on the marriage between organic form and new technologies,
adding his own imaginative twist, which made his designs pop icons
of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Verner Panton was born on Feb. 13, 1926, in Gamtofte, Denmark.
He studied at the Odense Technical School and at the Royal Danish
Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   From 1950 to 1952, Panton worked for Arne Jacobsen, Denmark's
premier designer, and in 1955 he established his own architecture
and design office, first in Denmark and later in Binningen,
Switzerland, where he moved in 1963. In 1964, he married Marianne
Pherson, who continues to work in his design studio.
</P>
<P>
   Panton's most significant design contribution was his 1960s
curved and cantilevered plastic stacking side chair, also known as
the Panton chair. It is credited with being the first single-piece
molded plastic chair to succeed in production.
</P>
<P>
   Panton prepared for the design by visiting factories that made
crash helmets and plastic buckets. For at least seven years he
could not find a manufacturer able or willing to take it on.
Finally, in 1967, it went into production in Switzerland at the
Vitra factory, where it is still being made.
</P>
<P>
   The sinuous Panton chair was quickly lauded as a breakthrough
and was acquired by the most important design collections,
including the one at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the first to give form to the aspirations of a
whole generation that had some ideas about a new kind of living and
a new kind of society,'' said Terence Riley, chief curator of the
department of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art.
``Verner was there before anyone else and put his personal stamp on
that vision.''
</P>
<P>
   With designs like a 1963 inflatable plastic stool, a wire-frame
cone chair with pivot joint in place of legs, and op-art-patterned
rugs, Panton's work had more in common with that of leading Italian
designers than with the designs of Scandinavians who were working
in fine, hand-crafted wood.
</P>
<P>
   Not all his experiments were conducted on a small scale. In
1960, he designed two buildings, called the Cardboard House and the
Plastic House.
</P>
<P>
   With a philosophy that revolution was, or ought to be, a sensory
experience, Panton wielded color with boldness, from the glossy
stacking side chair that came in violet, turquoise, red, orange,
beige, black and white to the orange and red cafeteria he designed
for Der Spiegel magazine (1969).
</P>
<P>
   His exhibition installations were usually intended to startle.
For the 1968 Cologne Furniture Fair, he created a surreal interior
with the images of gigantic lips, feet, arms, hands, eyes and ears
printed on textile walls stretched like a tent, and colorful rubber
balls covered in toweling tossed onto the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``By experimenting with lighting, colors, textiles and
furniture, and utilizing the latest technologies, I try to show new
ways to encourage people to use their fantasy and make their
surroundings more exciting,'' he once told an interviewer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Panton's furniture, lighting and textile designs are in many
important design collections, including those of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris, the Denver
Museum of Art, and the Industrial Art Museum in Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, he was overseeing a retrospective of
his work at the Trapholt Museum in Kolding, Denmark. In addition to
his wife, Panton is survived by his daughter, Carin von Halem of
Basel, and his brother, Ole Panton of Charlottenlund, Denmark.

COMMENTARY: FOUNDER OF EARTH DAY HAS A NEW GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When John Glenn returns to space Thursday he will
behold a humbling view of Earth that few have savored. John
McConnell can appreciate the old astronaut's perspective, and he
doesn't even have to leave his apartment in Ridgewood, Queens. In a
corner of his kitchen is a flag emblazoned with the Big Blue
Marble. Next to it lies the instrument panel that guides him
through his favorite space: cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The computer lets McConnell circle the globe before the space
shuttle reaches orbit. His mission? To urge others to save the
planet by becoming Earth Trustees, individuals whose choices about
life and ethics will usher in an era of global peace and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a stretch for him, since McConnell, 83, was also the
brains behind Earth Day, the ecofest first celebrated in San
Francisco on March 21, 1970. Last year it was celebrated on the Mir
space station, among other places.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the popular misconception, Earth Day was not intended to
be some hippie-dippy hazy holiday. McConnell, the son of a
traveling preacher, is spiritual and serious about its
implications. He thinks society has the technology to bring people
together, even if only virtually at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep trying to move in the direction of those goals,'' said
McConnell, whose Web site is www.earthsite.org. ``Actions, good or
bad, begin in the mind. If we want to resolve conflict and
rejuvenate our planet, we need people to be enthralled and have a
sense of wonder of our amazing world.''
</P>
<P>
   All this started while he was gazing into space many years ago.
As a child, McConnell was awed by the stars that shimmered in the
night. His religious upbringing helped pique his curiosity about
essential questions of humanity. Those varied impulses converged in
1957 when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the context of the Cold War, that was terrifying,'' said
McConnell, who published a newspaper in North Carolina at the time.
``Everybody had the jitters with that Sputnik up there.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote an editorial proposing a peaceful satellite, a Star of
Hope that would be visible from Earth as it flashed at the rate of
a baby's heartbeat. The idea was published in other newspapers and
led to his meeting with President Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite was never launched, but he was now on a new
trajectory. He devised ``A Minute for Peace,'' public service
television announcements that urged people to set aside a moment
each day to ponder how they could improve the world. But why stop
there? By the late 1960s, he had moved to New York and embraced the
world itself when he came up with Earth Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``What brings people together is their local holidays,'' he
said. ``Every country has holidays. What we needed was a holiday
for the whole planet.''
</P>
<P>
   The goals he set for Earth Day live on in the Earth Magna Carta,
in which he outlines his current campaign for Earth Trustees. It
requires no change from your pocket, only a change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply stated, every individual and institution on our planet
should join in choosing what will eliminate pollution, poverty and
violence,'' he said. ``To do this, we have to address the issues in
ecology, economics and ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   While he and his wife, Anna, would prefer to be living among the
redwoods of California, they do what they can east of Eden, in
Queens. They keep in touch with like-minded people through their
computer and have amassed an impressive archive of documents,
videotapes and other records of their decades in environmental
work. While their apartment is tucked among a row of brick houses
that face an asphalt playground, they grow herbs and vegetables in
a small garden behind the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has to make compromises,'' he said. ``If you want
your efforts to count, though, you must make contact with other
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   That explains his other compromise: living in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last place I would live,'' he admitted. ``The only
reason I'm here is because of my greater opportunity to influence
the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   He often visits representatives of international organizations
to promote his ideas. Now if he could persuade someone with big
bucks to launch the Star of Hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have progress reports from around the world on the
progress they're making as Earth trustees,'' he said. ``It would be
a great way to usher in the new millennium: an outrider of planet
Earth.''

L.A. TEAMS MAKE PLAYS FOR NFL SLOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``s'' sports news file.) 
BY ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The door vibrated with the bass track as NFL
owners inside the hotel conference room took an aerial video tour,
via computer animation, of a mythical opening day at an equally
mythical football stadium in L.A.'s industrial suburb of Carson.
</P>
<P>
   And Michael Ovitz, according to observers, pitched his plan with
all the enthusiasm of one of those ``Saturday Night Live''
cheerleaders.
</P>
<P>
   When a group championing a renovated Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum had the stage, an enormous scale model commanded the room,
Charlton Heston narrated the video and developer Edward Roski Jr.
exhibited images of concrete going up for the Staples Center.
(Implied message: I'm not all talk; I can get it built.)
</P>
<P>
   After viewing these presentations _ and a third by a group from
Houston _ at their fall meeting Tuesday, several NFL owners said
they were impressed with everything they saw.
</P>
<P>
   About all that's left, they added, is fleshing out a few of the
details behind the L.A. gleam _ and deciding exactly when they will
choose their 32nd franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they answered a lot of questions,'' Pittsburgh
Steelers President Dan Rooney said at the conclusion of three
one-hour programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Houston showed they have everything going. As they
said, they have all their ducks in the water. I thought L.A. showed
great designs for both stadiums. They talked about the benefits of
the different locations; they all said they had it financed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the presentations were very focused and had a lot of
energy,'' added owner Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys. ``The
principals are very impressive. The dilemma in my mind is how to
get a franchise in both places.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't going to happen, at least from an expansion
standpoint. The NFL, which will be at an awkward 31 teams when the
Cleveland Browns start anew next fall, have only one prospective
expansion slot. And Commissioner Paul Tagliabue seemed hopeful that
the dazzle of the presentations will spur owners to make the choice
``within the first quarter of next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Ovitz and Houston groups insist they are operating
under a deadline, with Ovitz even pressing for a decision by the
end of this year. But an NFL insider dismissed that as
``gamesmanship'' and predicted that if the league shows it is
making progress toward a resolution, the former Hollywood agent
won't be issuing any ``drop-dead dates.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue adjourned the day's meeting moments after Ovitz's
show, the last on the agenda, thumped to a halt in the late
afternoon. The commissioner said the owners would be asked for
feedback when the fall meeting reconvenes this morning.
</P>
<P>
   What he is likely to get are more questions about specifics _
particularly on the L.A. projects _ which likely will prolong this
process well into next year.
</P>
<P>
   An NFL executive privately cited the gray areas still evident in
both L.A. proposals:
</P>
<P>
   _ Carson: ``The public money just came in last week (a pledge of
$180 million in bonds by Carson). How is that really delivered to
the project? Is that cash upfront or is that revenues just taken
off the stadium? And is there going to be any public challenge to
that?''
</P>
<P>
   _ Coliseum: ``You're assuming you can sell suites for this.
You're assuming you can do PSLs (personal seat licenses), club
seats. You're assuming that the total project costs this much ($357
million). But this design just came along in the last two months.
Have they really priced it out?''
</P>
<P>
   However, Tagliabue said, ``I would say both (L.A.) presentations
were quite specific in terms of financing and how the financing
would be nailed down.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston, meanwhile, drove its nails in deeply long ago. It
already has a special-purpose tax, on hotel occupancy and
short-term car rentals, that has been in place producing income for
a baseball stadium for a year.
</P>
<P>
   But there's that pesky issue of Los Angeles having the
second-largest TV market in the nation, while Houston lags behind
at 10th.

L.A. TEAMS MAKE PLAYS FOR NFL SLOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``a'' national news file.) 
BY ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The door vibrated with the bass track as NFL
owners inside the hotel conference room took an aerial video tour,
via computer animation, of a mythical opening day at an equally
mythical football stadium in L.A.'s industrial suburb of Carson.
</P>
<P>
   And Michael Ovitz, according to observers, pitched his plan with
all the enthusiasm of one of those ``Saturday Night Live''
cheerleaders.
</P>
<P>
   When a group championing a renovated Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum had the stage, an enormous scale model commanded the room,
Charlton Heston narrated the video and developer Edward Roski Jr.
exhibited images of concrete going up for the Staples Center.
(Implied message: I'm not all talk; I can get it built.)
</P>
<P>
   After viewing these presentations _ and a third by a group from
Houston _ at their fall meeting Tuesday, several NFL owners said
they were impressed with everything they saw.
</P>
<P>
   About all that's left, they added, is fleshing out a few of the
details behind the L.A. gleam _ and deciding exactly when they will
choose their 32nd franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they answered a lot of questions,'' Pittsburgh
Steelers President Dan Rooney said at the conclusion of three
one-hour programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Houston showed they have everything going. As they
said, they have all their ducks in the water. I thought L.A. showed
great designs for both stadiums. They talked about the benefits of
the different locations; they all said they had it financed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the presentations were very focused and had a lot of
energy,'' added owner Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys. ``The
principals are very impressive. The dilemma in my mind is how to
get a franchise in both places.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't going to happen, at least from an expansion
standpoint. The NFL, which will be at an awkward 31 teams when the
Cleveland Browns start anew next fall, have only one prospective
expansion slot. And Commissioner Paul Tagliabue seemed hopeful that
the dazzle of the presentations will spur owners to make the choice
``within the first quarter of next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Ovitz and Houston groups insist they are operating
under a deadline, with Ovitz even pressing for a decision by the
end of this year. But an NFL insider dismissed that as
``gamesmanship'' and predicted that if the league shows it is
making progress toward a resolution, the former Hollywood agent
won't be issuing any ``drop-dead dates.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue adjourned the day's meeting moments after Ovitz's
show, the last on the agenda, thumped to a halt in the late
afternoon. The commissioner said the owners would be asked for
feedback when the fall meeting reconvenes this morning.
</P>
<P>
   What he is likely to get are more questions about specifics _
particularly on the L.A. projects _ which likely will prolong this
process well into next year.
</P>
<P>
   An NFL executive privately cited the gray areas still evident in
both L.A. proposals:
</P>
<P>
   _ Carson: ``The public money just came in last week (a pledge of
$180 million in bonds by Carson). How is that really delivered to
the project? Is that cash upfront or is that revenues just taken
off the stadium? And is there going to be any public challenge to
that?''
</P>
<P>
   _ Coliseum: ``You're assuming you can sell suites for this.
You're assuming you can do PSLs (personal seat licenses), club
seats. You're assuming that the total project costs this much ($357
million). But this design just came along in the last two months.
Have they really priced it out?''
</P>
<P>
   However, Tagliabue said, ``I would say both (L.A.) presentations
were quite specific in terms of financing and how the financing
would be nailed down.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston, meanwhile, drove its nails in deeply long ago. It
already has a special-purpose tax, on hotel occupancy and
short-term car rentals, that has been in place producing income for
a baseball stadium for a year.
</P>
<P>
   But there's that pesky issue of Los Angeles having the
second-largest TV market in the nation, while Houston lags behind
at 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen insisted that would not
influence his decision when the time comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would be difficult at all'' to choose Houston
over Los Angeles, Bowlen said, ``because they're both great
markets. Houston is not exactly a small city, or a small area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at them both being equal at this point. ... It comes
down to two things: ownership and stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Which maintains the mandate for the Los Angeles groups to be
ever more convincing that they're solid in each respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to go; we're ready to start construction,'' said
Roski, who admitted that he was questioned after his presentation
about the interest of the market and his projected revenue streams.
</P>
<P>

STUMPEL'S INJURIES PROVE FRUSTRATING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ It will be difficult to accurately evaluate
the Los Angeles Kings offense until they get their best offensive
player back. But exactly when center Jozef Stumpel, the Kings' top
scorer last season, will be able to return remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel suffered a hip-flexor strain in the Kings' exhibition
finale at Bakersfield on Oct. 4. He then was scoreless in the first
four regular-season games before revealing his injury and heading
into rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, following the Kings' skate before their game
against the New York Islanders, trainer Pete Demers acknowledged
that in addition to the hip injury, Stumpel has experienced ``a
little abdominal pain which has eased up significantly.'' Stumpel
did not skate Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel was examined by a doctor when the Kings were in Tampa
last week, and is scheduled to be seen by Kings physician Dr.
Ronald Kvitne on Thursday, ``to see if there's something we're
missing,'' Demers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's slow right now,'' Demers said. ``He's just not coming
along the way we expect him to. We're continuing to treat him and
we're trying to keep his (conditioning) up and have him skate every
few days. It's frustrating for us. We want to get him back in the
lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   On the farm: General manager Dave Taylor toured Canada to scout
Kings prospects before joining the Kings in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor scouted left wing Matt Zultek at a junior game in Ottawa,
center Justin Papineau at a junior game in Belleville, Ontario, and
several Kings prospects during two AHL games involving the
Springfield Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   At the Springfield games, winger Greg Phillips had three goals
Friday, two assists Saturday, and center Olli Jokinen had a goal
and five assists in the games, earning AHL Player of the Week
honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked the way he played over the weekend,'' Taylor said.
``He has excellent vision on the ice, moves the puck well and does
a lot of smart things. Where he has to adjust is being more
forceful as far as getting the puck and being more physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Springfield prospect, center Donald MacLean, is expected
to be sidelined a month after spraining an ankle playing
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: Winger Josh Green returned after missing three
games with a shoulder strain, and winger Craig Johnson returned
after being a healthy scratch for one game. Defenseman Garry Galley
was a healthy scratch for the sixth time in eight games, but coach
Larry Robinson said he may play tonight at New Jersey.... Goalie
Stephane Fiset is expected to return to action tonight after
missing nine days with a groin strain. Fiset, however, was not the
backup Tuesday against the Islanders. That job went to Ryan Bach.
The Kings didn't want to risk the possibility of having to suddenly
stick Fiset into a game if starter Manny Legace got hurt or was
ineffective.... Taylor said that when the time comes for Bach to be
assigned to the minor leagues, there's a chance he will be sent not
to the team he was with, the Utah Grizzlies of the IHL, but to the
Long Beach Ice Dogs. Jamie Storr (groin strain) also may play some
games in Long Beach before rejoining the Kings.

ISLANDERS DEFEAT KINGS, 1-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ While their coach was in Vienna seeking to get
their leading scorer to rejoin the team, the New York Islanders
barely got enough scoring to beat the Los Angeles Kings, 1-0, at
Nassau Coliseum on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Sacco got the goal, early in the third period, and Tommy
Salo got his third shutout of the season as Lorne Henning ran the
team in Mike Milbury's absence.
</P>
<P>
   Milbury, the Islanders' coach and general manager, left Long
Island late Monday with a contract proposal for Zigmund Palffy, who
has been a holdout for seven weeks. The 26-year-old right wing is
the Islanders' best player and a restricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, Milbury will return on Thursday without
Palffy's signature on a contract. Palffy, who led the Islanders in
scoring the last three seasons, rejected the team's latest offer of
a two-year deal worth $7.8 million, plus incentives. He is seeking
$6.8 million a season.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed contract would have paid Palffy $3.45 million this
season and $4.35 million next season, the Islanders said.
Incentives for goals, assists, total points and awards would have
made the offer worth more than $10 million over two years. The
Islanders' latest proposal came less than a week after the team
withdrew its offer of a three-year, $12.75 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike went there in a serious way about getting Ziggy to play
hockey this season,'' the Islanders' president, David Seldin, said
on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Milbury had said, ``My goal in meeting with Zigmund Palffy face
to face is to bring this issue to a conclusion.'' He wanted a
resolution, whether it meant signing Palffy, trading him or letting
him sit out the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy and his agent took Tuesday's offer as an insult.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone offers you less than what they offered
previously, that tells me they are not interested in negotiating
seriously,'' said Paul Kraus, Palffy's agent, who did not attend
the meeting in Vienna, sending an associate, Petr Svoboda, in his
place. ``We are interested in making a deal; they obviously are
not.''
</P>
<P>
   According to an Islanders official, the team's offer was
identical to the contract signed by Edmonton's Doug Weight last
week. The Islanders have compared Palffy to Weight during the
negotiations, according to Kraus. Weight scored 256 points over the
past three seasons, which is comparable to Palffy's 264 points over
that time.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I were a general manager, would I trade Zigmund Palffy for
Doug Weight?'' Kraus said. ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   During the negotiations, Kraus has repeatedly compared Palffy to
Mats Sundin, the standout Toronto center who earns $6.8 million a
season.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he expected another offer from the Islanders, Kraus
said: ``Nothing is final. Nothing is absolute with them. Honestly,
I don't know what they are thinking.''

IMMIGRANTS BASK IN EL DUQUE'S GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNION CITY, N.J. _ It was a day for pride, more than for
politics, when Orlando (El Duque) Hernandez, the Yankees pitcher,
paraded down Bergenline Avenue here Tuesday, in the heart of Cuban
and Hispanic New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But for many of those lining the bustling commercial strip,
waving Yankee banners and Cuban flags, El Duque's story _ his
escape from Cuba on a raft and his success as a World Series
champion pitcher 10 months later _ represented a bigger-than-life
version of their own immigrant experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees play in the House That Ruth Built,'' said Union
City Mayor Rudy Garcia, who is also a Cuban immigrant. ``But today
he is coming to the Street That Immigrants Built, Bergenline
Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Union City and the surrounding towns just across the Hudson
River from New York City have the largest concentration of Cubans
outside of Miami, as the mayor likes to point out, and they have
become a magnet for immigrants from other Latin American countries
like Mexico, Ecuador, El Salvador and Nicaragua. An estimated 70
percent of the population of Union City and West New York is
Hispanic, and along Bergenline Avenue, businesses with names like
Gonzalez H.S. Fabrics and Mi Bandera Restaurant, owned by Hispanic
immigrants, have produced an economic boom in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said he was originally going to offer Hernandez the keys
to the city, but somehow that didn't seem enough in an area where
people felt he was one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we feel a great deal of pride in El Duque,'' Garcia
said. So he and West New York Mayor Albio Sires, also from Cuba,
decided to give Hernandez a parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He exemplifies two virtues important to the Cuban community,''
Garcia said. ``One is his love of freedom. He risked his life to
get out of Cuba on a raft. Two is his love of family. A lot of
Cubans are separated from their families and it is a result of
Fidel Castro's tyranny.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was referring to El Duque's two daughters, his mother and
his ex-wife, who were allowed to leave Cuba by Castro after the
intercession of New York's Cardinal John O'Connor and others. The
family has a 30-day visa, but officials are working to extend their
stay.
</P>
<P>
   Some who lined the 30-block route along Bergenline Avenue _ the
police estimated that the crowd, which was packed several deep at
some points, grew to 5,000 _ waited more than two hours in the gray
afternoon. When Hernandez finally came by, in a float decorated in
white with Yankee blue trim that practically flew down the street,
they barely caught a glimpse of him and his family. But no matter.
They beamed and cheered nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Hispanic who is trying to move the community forward,''
said Lorena Fuentes, who is from Guatemala. ``It's nice to have
someone represent us. He's a man everyone admires because he
brought his family here.'' As Hernandez's float passed, followed by
limousines full of dignitaries, cheering people crowded around and
ran after it.
</P>
<P>
   The parade drew teen-agers, grade-school children and older
people. Many knew that El Duque's half-brother, Livan Hernandez,
who also defected from Cuba and joined the Florida Marlins in time
to help them win the World Series last year.
</P>
<P>
   A sign atop a blue Chevrolet station wagon spoke for many in the
crowd. It said, in English and in Spanish, ``To El Duque: God Bless
You, Your Family, the Yankees, and God Bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a grand fanatic when it comes to the Yankees,'' said
Leonardo Gutierrez, 53, from Puerto Rico, a Hudson County employee
who made the sign. ``I am a fan of El Duque because he brought his
family over. That is a beautiful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Aymara Watson, who came to North Bergen from Cuba in 1995, said
she remembered seeing Hernandez pitch at Latin American Stadium in
Havana before she left the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a real loss to Cuba,'' she said. ``But for us it is
such a thing of pride, and in such a short time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, she said, everyone suffered economically, even champion
athletes like Hernandez. ``He probably earned enough to buy his
girls one pair of nice shoes each, but he probably still had to
stand in line for the bodegas like everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hernandez flew by on his float, Enio Martinez, 67, watched
quietly, a Yankee cap on his head and his hands in his pockets.
Martinez said that when he was a restaurant owner in Cuba in the
50s, he traveled to New York just to watch a Yankees game. After
Castro took over, Martinez became disillusioned ``with the new
regime,'' as he called it, and worked in the sugar cane fields for
two years to earn permission to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost everything in Cuba,'' he said. The government had taken
over his business and expropriated his home. He was allowed to
leave with his wife and two children. But he never saw his mother
again.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez reflected on Hernandez's quick success in the United
States, and he and his daughter, Mercedes Blanco, laughed when they
could not remember if the Yankee pitcher made $6 million or $9
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``By coming here, he won something even bigger,'' Martinez said.
``His liberty.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THIS is not a knee-jerk nostalgia thing. But when it comes to
picking the top college football teams, I believe I liked the old
system better. Do you remember how it used to be, as much as 48
hours ago, when you had two polls, one picked by the writers and
one by the coaches?
</P>
<P>
   Rating the teams was an industry in itself, with its own rote
and ritual. The system was invented in the 1920s by two legendary
sportswriters, Sam Rote and Joe Ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the process has just gotten a whole lot more complicated
because of something called the Bowl Championship Series, which
rates the teams according to their records, strength of schedule,
opponents' schedules and a compendium of ratings gleaned from the
writers, the coaches, the New York Times, the Seattle Times and a
math scholar named Sagarin.
</P>
<P>
   When they fed all the numbers into a computer named Albert, UCLA
was atop the list and Ohio State was second, a reversal of their
positions in the two most widely circulated polls. How the teams
are seeded has taken on a new, cosmic importance because at
season's end One and Two will meet in the Fiesta Bowl to play for
all the treasures.
</P>
<P>
   For now, we have Tennessee and Kansas State, also undefeated,
looking for ways to run up the score. In the final five weeks, the
Volunteers play three teams that are not ranked in the top 100,
which is akin to scrimmaging their coaching staff. Of course, the
Wildcats opened the season against three teams that rated no higher
than 131 (Northeast Louisiana). This is akin to playing opponents
whose jerseys and helmets don't match.
</P>
<P>
   Among the schedule-makers, this is known as ``pianissimo,'' or
soft touches, a convenient way to inflate the record.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so complicated in 1924, when the first national
championship was awarded. Unbeaten in 10 games, with no math police
checking out its schedule, Notre Dame was crowned by the Helms
Foundation and the Dickinson System. Historians say there was
little argument among the few who paid attention. People were
preoccupied with striking for a 50-hour work week and wondering
where Khartoum was.
</P>
<P>
   The 1924 Irish featured the backfield Grantland Rice
immortalized as the Four Horsemen. The team had one other
distinction. It was the first to win the championship
retroactively. The polls came into existence in 1926, but Knute
Rockne persuaded the people who developed them to predate their
choices by two years. Thus Rockne was able to honor his most famous
team. Notre Dame has always had a lot of ways to win.
</P>
<P>
   The latest formula is designed to squeeze out human error and
leave the serious matter of trophy-giving to science. All of which
gives us this oddity:
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska and Texas A&AMP;M boast identical records (7-1). The Aggies
are playing a meaner schedule, the country's eighth-toughest
compared to 15th for the Cornhuskers. And when they teed it up, the
Aggies won. So we check the BCS rankings and find Nebraska ranked
No. 6 and the Aggies eighth. What could the computer possibly be
thinking?
</P>
<P>
   It is at roughly this time every year that those in amateur
football discover what a vampire they have created in the national
polls. To the teams expected to compete for the national title, the
rankings have come to symbolize a great boiler, into which they
have been lowered to cook like Maine lobsters.
</P>
<P>
   You can go all the way back to 1966, and many people do, for an
example of the craziness this process has inspired. That year, Ara
Parseghian, then the coach of top-ranked Notre Dame, ran out the
clock and settled for a tie against No. 2 Michigan State, keeping
the Irish undefeated. And this is what transpired:
</P>
<P>
   Parseghian argued that if you're No. 1 and you don't lose, you
can't be dislodged. Duffy Daugherty, the Michigan State coach,
countered by saying that if you're second and you tie the team
ahead of you, then you become No. 1 and the other guy becomes 1A.
</P>
<P>
   And Bear Bryant, the coach at Alabama, the only undefeated and
untied team left among the major powers, said, waving the flag,
that he just hoped if any of his Alabama seniors got drafted and
had to go to Vietnam that they would not play for a tie.
</P>
<P>
   But later, Bryant made the truest observation of all: ``Ara had
the last laugh because he wound up with most of the awards. Playing
that old tie must have been smart.''
</P>
<P>
   There are clearly a few clinks in the computer still to be
ironed out. The bowl poll seemed like a good idea at the time. It
may yet turn out that way. But for now, it just gives another
reason to grumble.

ATLANTA _ For the first 60 years of its existence, East Lake Golf
Club claimed a tradition unlike any other _ it was home for Bobby
Jones, who epitomized golf during the sport's formative years in
the United States.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The place had staying power. Its tradition was as revered as
that of any course in the South, at least any of them outside
Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   But East Lake's reputation as a monument to golf peaked in 1963,
when it hosted the Ryder Cup. Since then, East Lake might as well
have been the Crater Lake of the golf scene. For most of the past
35 years, it went through a sad deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   But when the top 30 PGA Tour players step onto East Lake for the
season-ending Tour Championship starting Thursday, they might want
to give thanks for the concept of urban renewal. If not for Atlanta
developer Tom Cousins taking this run-down portion of town and
implementing a revitalization plan for the past few years, East
Lake might never have gotten this chance.
</P>
<P>
   It's a story not unlike that of Houston's Memorial Park. A
classic course designed decades ago had suffered from neglect for
years. Now, Memorial Park is a jewel in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for East Lake in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really nice to see what's transpired at this golf
course,'' Mark O'Meara said Tuesday. ``This is my first visit here,
but to hear about what has happened over time, it's quite an
achievement for all of Atlanta and for Tom Cousins and all the
businesses here to have put the support behind this development and
brought it back to an incredible stature. My hat's off to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The rejuvenated East Lake will provide an incredibly stiff
challenge this week to the best golfers on the tour. Even though
the course had to be tweaked to accommodate the pros (two par-5s
were changed to par-4s), it should hold up nicely under their
assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like a major, and I think scores will be similar to a
major,'' Phil Mickelson said. ``Definitely single digits under par,
and probably 4- or 6-under-par, will win. With a par-70, 6-under is
really like 14-under. I think it's set up better than most of the
majors we play as far as fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   What the PGA Tour has done is give the course, tucked in the
eastern neck of Atlanta's inner-city sprawl, a combination of
Augusta National finesse with U.S. Open muscle. The greens aren't
like putting on a tabletop, as they are at the Masters at times.
But they are faster than your average PGA Tour stop.
</P>
<P>
   And the rough looks as if it hasn't been cut since Jones
traipsed around the joint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rough is very, very deep,'' O'Meara said. ``With the
pressure and everything, it's set up like a U.S. Open. The rough is
that deep. If you're an inch off the fairway, you're going to take
out your wedge or 9-iron. That grass is very thick and very tough
to play out of.''
</P>
<P>
   Which would seem to favor the straight hitters this week. But
then you look at the course length (6,980 yards) and the speed of
the greens and realize this is a tract that favors nobody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it favors any one person,'' Jim Furyk said.
``It's not real long. It's not real short. The fairways are
probably the best we've played, and the greens are real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the greens. They will level the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they'd want to get the greens much faster,''
Jeff Sluman said. ``I would think they'd want to keep them right
where they are. The place is really something special. The course
is perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather is expected to be perfect, too. And that won't hurt
East Lake's chances for getting into the Tour Championship
rotation. There is talk of rotating the tournament among Champions,
East Lake, Pinehurst No. 2 and the Olympic Club.
</P>
<P>
   Because the event always will be in late October or early
November, it must be in an area where weather concerns will be
minimal. It's dicey enough coming to Houston at this time of year.
Atlanta, while chamber-of-commerce brilliant this week, can get
nasty in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it appears East Lake is destined to regain its
spot among the elite golf courses in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, Bobby Jones is smiling.

L.A. COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAMPAIGN CONTINUES DESPITE UNCERTAINTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As Sheriff Sherman Block slowly showed signs of
``alertness'' Tuesday after surgery for a brain clot, the politics
of his re-election campaign played out on a variety of stages.
</P>
<P>
   Some well-known political leaders _ Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Mayor
Richard Riordan and county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky _ reaffirmed
their support for Block, while prominent political analysts said
challenger Lee Baca was all but assured of victory because of the
seriousness of the sheriff's illness.
</P>
<P>
   Baca, who retired as a regional chief in the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department to run against Block, initially suspended his
campaign appearances and his advertising that had heavily
emphasized the sheriff's age and poor health.
</P>
<P>
   But the cease-fire did not last long, as the Block campaign
stepped up its attack on Baca's competence to run the massive law
enforcement agency, and the Baca campaign struck back with renewed
emphasis on Block's physical inability to serve another term.
</P>
<P>
   Block was listed in serious condition at USC University
Hospital, and Dr. Srinath Samudrala, who performed the four-hour
surgery, said it was too early to determine whether the sheriff
would fully regain consciousness or be able to talk and function
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is in serious condition. His level of alertness continues
to improve,'' Samudrala said. ``Obviously we'll need to allow
several days of recovery to see how the patient is going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He would not answer directly a series of questions about whether
Block was conscious and responsive or what the prognosis for
recovery is.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff ended up in the hospital Saturday night after
falling and hitting his head, requiring 10 stitches. His condition
worsened, and doctors now say he suffered a blood clot in the brain
before the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Block campaign spokesman Joseph Scott expressed frustration that
Block's health had overshadowed other issues and that Baca's
ability was escaping attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is Baca?'' Scott asked. ``There's a large undecided vote
out there, I think'' and several factors could help decide it, he
said, including Baca's lack of visibility during much of the
general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Block campaign manager John Shallman added: ``To give up or quit
is against the man's character. I do not need a reconfirmation from
this sheriff to continue this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``His opponent is someone who is too risky.''
</P>
<P>
   While Baca avoided jumping into the fray, his campaign
counterattacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been many issues in this campaign, one of them
being the sheriff's health and ability to lead the department,''
said Jorge Flores, a campaign consultant for Baca.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now more than ever, the voters of Los Angeles County
understand that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry that the Block campaign does not recognize the
genuine act of compassion that this (campaign suspension) is,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Block, who has overcome two bouts with cancer and must get
dialysis treatments for kidney failure three times a week, has
insisted he was healthy enough to lead the department for an
additional four years and campaigned vigorously after being forced
into a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Baca has said Block's health was 99 percent of the reason he
entered the race. He feared that if Block was elected again, he
might have to quit midterm because of health problems, meaning the
choice for replacing the sheriff would fall to the Board of
Supervisors rather than the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisors received a closed-session briefing from County
Counsel Bill Pellman on provisions of the law governing what
happens in the event the sheriff dies or is incapacitated.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the undersheriff runs the department when the sheriff is
not available. If the sheriff should die, the supervisors can
appoint a new sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's new term will start at noon Dec. 3, so any
appointment now to replace him because of death, resignation or
incapacity would be effective only until then.
</P>
<P>
   If Block wins the election but dies, resigns or is found unable
to stay in the position afterward, the appointed successor would
stay in office until the November 2000 election and would have to
run in that election to continue. The winner of that election would
serve a two-year term.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's incapacitation would have to be determined in
court. Under state law, the county would need to ask the attorney
general to bring a lawsuit in Superior Court to obtain such a
ruling or could have the attorney general delegate that
responsibility to the county.
</P>
<P>
   Two findings are necessary for a court to rule that an elected
official no longer is capable of holding office, Pellman said. The
official must be found physically or mentally incapacitated and
there must be reasonable cause to believe the incapacity will
remain in effect for the remainder of the official's term.
</P>
<P>
   In the political arena, many questioned whether the issue would
ever come to that because Baca is regarded as an all-but-certain
winner now.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, it's over,'' said consultant Joe Cerrell. ``For
people who didn't know Sherman Block from Gen. Sherman,'' he's now
being splashed across newspaper front pages and television news
because of his health.
</P>
<P>
   ``People without a clue about which one was ill'' _ Block or
Baca _ ``now know it. I don't see how Baca can lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Added consultant Rick Taylor: ``The campaign's over. Mr. Block
and his people have to understand it's not going to be him.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Block supporters gathered Tuesday evening at a private
home in Brentwood for a previously planned fund-raiser for the
sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   A broad cross-section of elected officials from both major
political parties at the fund-raiser helped his campaign raise an
estimated $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Block has backing from Democrats such as Feinstein, Yaroslavsky,
District Attorney Gil Garcetti, Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke
and from Republicans such as Riordan, Councilman Hal Bernson and
former District Attorney Robert Philibosian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sherman Block has been one of the best sheriffs in the United
States,'' Feinstein said. ``I know it's hard for people at this
time, but I believe that he will improve and come back better than
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan recalled Block's 42 years in the Sheriff's Department,
serving the past 16 as sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has always served with pride, energy and wisdom,'' the
mayor said. ``Sherman Block will come back and serve that way for
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaroslavsky added: ``If this had happened two years ago, he
would have had time to recover and it wouldn't be an issue. But,
the fact is, it happened seven days out from the election. If you
were going to vote for Sherm Block last Saturday, you should vote
for him next Tuesday.''

RANGERS TIE SABRES, 0-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The game ended in a double shutout, 0-0, between Mike
Richter's New York Rangers and Dominik Hasek's Buffalo Sabres on
Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden. The verdict extended the
Rangers' undefeated streak to five games, but the bad news involved
an injury to Aleksei Kovalev, who will miss about three weeks with
a separated left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to hurt our offense any,'' said Ranger Coach
John Muckler, with a grimace of a smile. ``We have to find a way to
score some goals.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth consecutive time that Hasek has shut out the
Rangers, who have tied their last two games and are undefeated in
five at 2-0-3.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's result could be submitted as a good argument for
a shootout, the penalty-shot contest that is used to decide Olympic
games and is occasionally discussed in the board rooms of the
National Hockey League. Although several rules have been changed to
increase scoring, neither goalie last night seemed interested in
extending the reforms to a post-buzzer series of one-on-one
confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be fun for the crowd and it would be fun to
participate in,'' said Richter, who had 24 saves and got his first
shutout since the 1996-97 season. ``But it kind of takes away from
the orientation of a team game.'' As it was, many of the fans
grumbled and groaned with a few boos at the final buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek prevailed in such a shootout for the Czech Republic in
last winter's Olympics, defeating Team Canada on the way to the
gold medal. But he said on Tuesday night he doesn't want to use it
in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say no,'' Hasek said. ``I'm not a big fan of
shootouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it would be a mistake to allow such a display with these
two teams on a night like this. Imagine if both kept sending
skaters in alone on each other's goalies without scoring. Imagine
if the Rangers could not even put a shot on goal under these
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   They managed only 16 in 65 minutes on Tuesday night, only eight
of them after the first period. During the third period, they
enjoyed four power plays. On three, they got no shots.
</P>
<P>
   All this is not to say that the game _ the Rangers' first 0-0
tie since Feb. 28, 1995 _ was boring or poorly played. It was not,
really, for fans who enjoy technical strategy laced with malice and
effort. But it is the kind of final score that might worry the NHL.
Last season saw the lowest scoring, on average, in four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Among many players paying a physical price was Wayne Gretzky. He
twice was hit hard by Jay McKee, the big defenseman, and Vaclav
Varada jousted with him.
</P>
<P>
   Usually the first Ranger to shower, dress and speak to
reporters, Gretzky remained in the team's private quarters for
almost 45 minutes after the game. In the last three outings,
Gretzky has been hit hard and knocked over several times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little sore tonight,'' he said. ``Been banged up a little bit
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovalev was injured in the first period. ``He's going to be in a
sling and rest it around three weeks,'' Dr. Barton Nisonson said,
adding that surgery was not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kovalev has no goals this season, he plays an important
role as right wing for Gretzky on the Rangers first line. He also
gets ice time on the power play. Mike Knuble, right wing on Todd
Harvey's line, was promoted to Gretzky's line with the start of the
second period. One change might be to move Harvey back to his
regular position of right wing and use the rookie Manny Malhotra at
center.
</P>
<P>
   Checking was so tight that it seemed at times as if the teams
were playing with 12 men a side instead of six. Both teams also
used variations of the neutral zone trap to stifle each other's
attacks. Within this framework, there was much hard hitting and
animosity. On the game's first shift, Buffalo wing Michal Grosek
clobbered Ranger defenseman Ulf Samuelsson into the corner in the
Ranger end. Several other Sabres also targeted Samuelsson, who is
playing with a full face shield to protect a fractured cheekbone.
</P>
<P>
   This seemed to energize Samuelsson, who is one of the league's
roughest players. With the Sabres on the power play near the end of
the first period, Samuelsson came across the ice laterally to
flatten Grosek with a hard, clean check in open ice. In the second
period, Samuelsson had several altercations with Matthew Barnaby,
the Buffalo terror. They collided, knee to knee, and went at it
moments later in front of the Rangers net. Whenever Samuelsson
skated by the Buffalo bench, the Sabres taunted him. With a
fraction of a second left in the second period, Barnaby, Curtis
Brown and Grosek all ganged up on Samuelsson in the corner, and
Barnaby was penalized for elbowing.  &QL;

LEITER IS NEXT ON MENU FOR METS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two days after signing Mike Piazza for $91 million to
be the cornerstone of their offense for the next seven years, the
New York Mets plan to announce Wednesday that they have agreed to a
four-year, $32 million deal with their pitching ace, Al Leiter.
</P>
<P>
   Mets general manager Steve Phillips and Leiter's
representatives, Alan and Randy Hendricks, completed the agreement
_ which has been in the works for over a month and a half _ late
last weekend, a person with knowledge of Leiter's negotiating
stance said.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter's deal, which includes a large signing bonus and no
deferred money, was expected to be announced at a 2 p.m. news
conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Mets had been reluctant to give a four-year deal
to Leiter, who won 17 games this past season. But as was the case
with Piazza, the Mets apparently were more reluctant to let Leiter
test the free-agent market, where he would have been the most
coveted pitcher after Randy Johnson and Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   In the span of three days, the Mets will have agreed to spend
$123 million to keep their best hitter and their best pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips' next move could be reacquiring Bobby Bonilla. The Mets
were believed to be willing to send Mel Rojas to the Los Angeles
Dodgers for Bonilla in a deal that could also include Butch Huskey
for Eric Young, a person with knowledge of Phillips' thinking said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That would give the Mets a potential lineup of Young leading off
and playing second base, followed by third baseman Edgardo Alfonzo,
first baseman John Olerud, Piazza behind the plate and Bonilla in
right field. Left field is an unsettled position, Brian McRae would
be in center field and Rey Ordonez at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   That question mark in left may be answered when the Mets trade
Todd Hundley, who has become an extra body now that they have
signed Piazza. The Cubs, Diamondbacks and Cardinals are understood
to definitely be interested. The Cardinals would presumably be
willing to part with left fielder Ron Gant. Or the Mets could
simply make a run at the free-agent outfielder Brian Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips reiterated Tuesday that his main priority now was
shoring the offense. After Luis Lopez agreed to a two-year deal
worth $1.35 million Tuesday ($575,000 in 1999 and $775,000 in
2000), the players the Mets have under contract for next season are
Piazza, Leiter, Rick Reed, Bobby Jones, John Franco, Willie Blair,
Rojas, Jorge Fabregas, Olerud, McRae and Hundley. The Mets also
have an option to pick up the final year of Greg McMichael's
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Met players who are eligible for arbitration are Alfonzo,
Huskey, Ordonez, Todd Pratt, Hideo Nomo, Turk Wendell and Jason
Isringhausen. Phillips seemed to indicate Tuesday that the Mets
would also like to re-sign two of their pitching free agents:
Armando Reynoso and Masato Yoshii.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have pitching depth and a catcher that we can trade from,''
Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips also has a lot more money in his budget. The Mets'
co-owners, Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday, have indicated their
willingness to spend more to make a run at the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' payroll at the end of last season was $57 million, the
sixth-highest figure in the league. With the 12 players they have
signed at the moment, their payroll currently stands at just under
$50 million. But that includes the $5.325 million Hundley will make
this season and he will almost certainly be traded, although
Phillips said he was not in a rush to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Wednesday whether he felt his payroll would approach
$70 million _ or near what the Yankees spent to win the World
Series this year _ Phillips said: ``I don't think we'll be exactly
at that number. But we will have a competitive payroll.'' And
Phillips added that he had no complaints about the budget his
owners had given him to work with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take some work,'' Phillips said. ``But I think
we're going to have a good team.''

BAILED-OUT HEDGE FUND CUTS 18 PERCENT OF STAFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital Management Inc., the hedge fund that a group
of banks and brokerage firms rescued last month, laid off 33
people, or about 18 percent of its 178 employees, on Tuesday,
according to people close to the firm.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs mostly involved people in the fund's offices in
Greenwich, Conn., and London and affected several senior
researchers and traders. They were concentrated in businesses that
the fund is seeking to wind down, like investments in developing
countries, and in the firm's equity trading, according to the
people close to the firm. These people spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   There are also a few layoffs in Long-Term's Tokyo office, they
said. No partners lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, a group of big banks and brokerage firms _
including Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.; Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.; Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter &AMP; Co. and J.P. Morgan _ invested $3.6 billion to shore
up the Greenwich hedge fund as it came close to running out of
money after falling under pressure from huge borrowings.
</P>
<P>
   That rescue, which resulted in the investing companies'
acquisition of 90 percent of Long-Term's capital, was organized by
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, although it involved no
public money. The Fed and the rescuing institutions were
particularly concerned that at a time of great fragility in many
financial markets, a failure of Long-Term Capital might have had
severe market consequences that might have even threatened the
integrity of the financial system itself.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital, which is now overseen by a committee made up
of its new shareholders, is believed to be trying to reduce its
risks and improve its returns. It is operating in a more favorable
climate since the financial markets have recently calmed.
</P>
<P>
   Those laid off by Long-Term Capital were paid through the end of
the year, and they will also receive additional severance payments,
according to an executive involved with the fund's business who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs are expected to result in a charge for the
management company estimated at $1 million or $2 million. They were
approved at a meeting of Long-Term Capital's oversight committee on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital was set up in 1993 by John Meriwether, a
former vice chairman of Salomon Brothers Inc., along with several
other senior Salomon executives.
</P>
<P>
   The hedge fund, a lightly regulated pool of capital, began
trading in 1994 and produced big returns in 1995 and 1996. This
year it stumbled badly, particularly after Russia defaulted on its
debt in mid-August, causing steep losses in markets around the
world.

FASTEST SUPERCOMPUTER: U.S. OUTDOING ITSELF AGAIN AT LIVERMORE
LAB 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department will take delivery Wednesday
of what the government says is the world's fastest computer,
capable of a peak performance of 3.88 trillion calculations, or
teraflops, a second.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said Tuesday that the
supercomputer, which is being assembled at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory in California, is about 15,000 times faster
than a 350-megahertz personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   The computer, built by the IBM, uses 5,800 processor chips, each
slightly more powerful than the widely sold Pentium II chip made by
Intel Corp., said people involved in its development. Livermore, a
nuclear weapons lab, will use it for simulations that determine,
without detonation, whether aging nuclear weapons are still
operable.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks prepared for delivery Wednesday, Vice President Al
Gore says that beyond weapons research, the technology of the
computer, known as massively parallel architecture, ``will lead to
advances and greater understanding of weather patterns, global
climate change, medicine, manufacturing and aviation safety.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Energy Department, the computer, called Pacific Blue, is
part of a program to advance supercomputer technology rapidly to
the stage where it can model nuclear warheads. Pacific Blue takes
the speed title from Sandia Red, a computer at Sandia National
Laboratory built by Intel that was finished in December 1996 and is
about half as fast. Mountain Blue, a computer being built by
Silicon Graphics Inc., is expected to deliver about four teraflops.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-2000, Energy Department officials hope to have a
10-teraflop computer, also built by IBM, running at Livermore,
followed in 2004 by a 100-teraflop computer. The 100-teraflop model
would allow high-fidelity simulation of an H-bomb detonation, as a
volleyball-size mass of nuclear fuel is compressed to the size of a
walnut, setting off the explosive chain reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they were trying to retire Moore's
Law, which holds that chip makers will be able to double the number
of transistors on a given sliver of silicon, and thus its speed,
every 18 months. The Energy Department wants to triple computing
speed in about the same time frame by combining the power of many
processors instead of increasing the speed of each.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Donofrio, senior vice president for technology and
manufacturing at IBM, said that in building Pacific Blue, ``we
pretty much used commercial-grade stuff'' from the IBM. commercial
product line.

8-MAN FOOTBALL GETS SACKED BY LONG TRAVELS, FEW PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is homecoming at Arizona Lutheran Academy. Family and friends
have come from as far away as Tucson and the White Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   And the football team at the southwest Phoenix school is
determined not to inflict the 42-point mercy rule on its guests,
the Clifton Trojans, before the king and queen are crowned at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   With his team ahead, 36-0, eight minutes into the game, Coach
Doug Meyer sends in sophomores and freshmen against a team with
only eight reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going for a two-point conversion after its seventh
touchdown, Arizona Lutheran kicks the extra point to make the score
49-8 with three minutes left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Homecoming festivities go on as planned, accompanied by the roar
of engines from Manzanita Speedway, a mile or so away.
</P>
<P>
   The game ends shortly after halftime with an Arizona Lutheran
touchdown, leaving Clifton with a five-hour trip home and lots of
time to ponder the declining state of eight-man football.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, the eight-man game was established in sparsely
settled areas to give boys a chance to play football. But lack of
numbers, high travel costs and the disparity between weak and
strong teams have left it on life support in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically dead,'' said Meyer, coach and athletic director
at Arizona Lutheran, which petitioned to move into Class 2A to play
11-man football against teams closer to home next fall. ``There is
no competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Four of Arizona Lutheran's seven victories this year ended
prematurely because of the point spread. Its only loss was a mercy
ruling to No. 1 St. David. Meyer said he can count on one hand the
number of competitive 1A football teams: St. David, Orme, Heber
Mogollon, Arizona Lutheran and Joseph City, all among the eight
teams starting the playoffs Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Lutheran opens at home against Joseph City.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be a great game,'' Meyer says. ``The rest will be
halftime, mercy-rule games.''
</P>
<P>
   And this, according to some, is one of the more competitive
eight-man seasons. &QL; 
Opting for 11-man
</P>
<P>
   The eight-man game is played on an 80- by 40-yard field. It is
wide-open, high-scoring and quite often one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' Mogollon Athletic Director Rocky Nelson said.
``You don't want to totally humiliate the other team, but you want
to give your starters time to get in a rhythm and feel good, then
put in your JV kids, your younger kids. You know they're going to
go all-out.''
</P>
<P>
   Some wonder whether eight-man ball will survive through the next
two-year realignment.
</P>
<P>
   Nine schools recently appealed out of 1A, which has an
enrollment cutoff of 200 students. Next fall, 21 schools will be in
1A, with maybe nine playing eight-man football.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Interscholastic Association executive board will
consider a proposal on Nov. 16 that could create an 11-man 2A-1A
football conference for schools falling into the 249-150 enrollment
range. The rest of 2A, those schools with enrollments between 250
and 449, would play in it own league. The schools with fewer than
150 students would continue to play eight-man ball, but there could
be so few that there may not be a state tournament.
</P>
<P>
   A season still could be played, but the title would be a
mythical one. According to bylaws, the AIA can't sanction playoffs
for classifications that have less than half of its team involved
in football.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the AIA isn't giving up on the eight-man game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to make sure every kid at every school has an
opportunity to play,'' said Glen Treadaway, assistant director of
the AIA. ``I'd hate to see it go.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 15 1A schools with football teams, barely enough for a
state tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Salome Frogs had to drop football midway through last season
because injured and ineligible players made it impossible to field
a team.
</P>
<P>
   Salome, about 90 miles west of Phoenix, takes pride in finishing
this season, but the team can look back at four mercy-rule defeats,
including a 92-50 loss last week to St. David.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard when you have eight seniors who never played a down
before,'' first-year Coach Rich Metcalf said. ``There is no tackle
football this side of the state for seventh- and eighth-graders.''
</P>
<P>
   Routs are common, but coaches and administrators agree that the
mercy rule is needed to keep scores from getting really ugly.
</P>
<P>
   It also gives visiting teams a head start on the long bus rides
home, so players can be in bed before sunrise. &QL; 
Bus trip nightmare
</P>
<P>
   Some of the tiniest towns in the most remote outposts in Arizona
attempt to field eight-man high school football teams.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie, a high school with 25 students in far southeastern
Arizona, for years combined with neighboring San Simon to field a
football team. But Bowie broke away two years ago, and this year it
had enough players for just a JV team.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Lutheran and Phoenix Day School for the Deaf are the
last of the Valley schools with eight-man programs. To reach their
competition, five-hour bus trips, one way, are typical. And
sometimes frightful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bus breaks down a lot, for some reason,'' Arizona Lutheran
junior quarterback Zack Stam said. ``We might have broken a state
record for flat tires.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last season, Meyer was driving the bus for Arizona Lutheran
en route to a game in Clifton. A tire blew just east of Apache
Junction. There was no spare, and Meyer had to call for another
bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally roll into town, five hours from home, and halfway
through the first quarter, our best player gets a freak accident
and breaks his ankle. The parents are taking him to a hospital in
Morenci.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get slaughtered, 50-12. We have to hop on the bus and drive
back and get home at 3:30 in the morning. Whatever could have gone
wrong, did.''
</P>
<P>
   Next season, Arizona Lutheran will will play in a league against
schools closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Community Christian and Scottsdale Christian recently
moved into 2A and into a league made up of Valley schools.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a smooth transition for Northwest, which won the 1A
title two years ago and now is 6-2 and ranked third in the state in
2A.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved eight-man football,'' Northwest Coach Charlie Bell
said. ``It was exciting. But it's my opinion that if all schools
played 11-man football, it would help tremendously. Scheduling
would be easier. You don't travel as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are some 1A football teams that could play
against 3A schools and not be disgraced.'' &QL; 
An appreciation
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody looks forward to seeing an end to eight-man
football.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Gilmore left San Jose, Calif., to start the football program
at Tesseract, an exclusive private school of about 90 students in
north Scottsdale that starts at ground zero next year with an
eight-man team.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore attended Arizona Lutheran's homecoming to see his first
eight-man game. He saw the numerous Clifton turnovers fueling the
rout by the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore enjoys the nature of the smaller game, but he can see
the horizon, the long bus rides ahead. He puts a positive spin on
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if they let it die, it will die,'' Gilmore says. ``You
have to appreciate what they're doing, what they're going
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer of Arizona Lutheran recalls those trips to Clifton and
Fredonia, he remembers the flat tires and he craves a new era. &QL;

THIS RUNNER OPENED A DOOR AND HELPS TO KEEP IT OPEN 
</HEADLINE>

 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As he crossed the finish line as the 1996 Olympic marathon
champion in Atlanta, Josia Thugwane of South Africa found his life
undergoing the same tumultuous change as his country's political
system.
</P>
<P>
   In that instant, everything was different. Nothing would ever be
the same.
</P>
<P>
   An athlete consigned by apartheid to living in a tin shack, a
man who did not read or write, was soon able to command an income
of half a million dollars a year. An unknown before the race, he
was now the first black in his country ever to win a gold medal. He
was greeted by President Nelson Mandela and was elevated into a
galvanizing symbol of a new, democratic South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a nation still grappling with unity and reconciliation,
Josia was not a hero for blacks, he was a hero for all South
Africans,'' said Banele Sindani, the executive director of the
South African track and field federation. ``He was someone we could
all rally around. After something like that, you don't go backward.
It has contributed to healing the wounds of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   But, upon his return home, there seemed to be as much concern as
celebration regarding Thugwane, (pronounced tug-WANNE) who has said
that he grew confused. Would this tidal wave of change capsize his
career? Would unsavory people try to exploit him? Could he hold
onto this money and his motivation? Would the vestiges of apartheid
suck at him insidiously, like an undertow?
</P>
<P>
   Not everything has gone as smoothly as the Olympic marathon.
After the Atlanta Games, Thugwane was beaten at home in a traffic
scuffle after he inadvertently cut off another driver; this
followed a scary incident before the Olympics when he was carjacked
and shot, a bullet grazing and scarring his chin.
</P>
<P>
   And in a country that has been slow to fulfill its promises of
houses and jobs, Thugwane has found that people wanted his money,
whether he wanted to give it to them or not. Some were beggars, he
said; others attempted to rob his wife when he left home to train
for races.
</P>
<P>
   His incipient efforts at reading and writing ended after two and
a half months when a South African company that promotes literacy
seemed more interested in using his name for promotion than real
education, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, by all accounts, his life has remained on a steady course.
</P>
<P>
   Thugwane, who is 27, has run his fastest races since Atlanta,
winning the Fukuoka Marathon in Japan last December and setting a
South African national record. With a personal best of 2 hours 7
minutes 28 seconds, he enters Sunday's New York City Marathon as
the fastest competitor in a deep field of Kenyan, Mexican, Moroccan
and Spanish challengers.
</P>
<P>
   He has quit his custodial job at a coal mine to become a
full-time athlete. A member of the Ndebele tribe, he has learned to
speak English. He has moved his family from a squalid township,
first to a house bought for him by the mine and then into a
comfortable suburb of Johannesburg, where an alarm system and
private security guards protect against intruders. He bought
another house for his parents. Where once he lived without
electricity and running water, he now has a cellular phone, a fax
and a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``More money can mean more problems, but there are a lot of poor
people with empty stomachs at home,'' said the 5-foot-2-inch,
99-pound Thugwane, who has been training for two months at altitude
in Albuquerque, N.M. ``People see me making money from running and
now they think they can make money, too.''
</P>
<P>
   After Atlanta, Thugwane settled on an American-based agent, Luis
Posso, of Tampa, Fla., who works with a South African associate,
Jaques Malan. Posso said that Thugwane, his wife, Zodwa, and their
four daughters are set financially for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, he was always worried, about money, about the safety
of his family,'' Posso said. ``Now I see him as a happy guy with no
worries.''
</P>
<P>
   Thugwane has signed a shoe contract with Nike, and has another
endorsement deal with Coca-Cola to conduct grass-roots clinics in a
country where apartheid left only one all-weather running track for
all of black South Africa. Once he could not afford his own running
shoes; now he hands them out free to children, Posso said.
</P>
<P>
   While some of his other clients go through expensive cars like
socks, Posso said, Thugwane wants nothing more exotic than a Toyota
Camry. It is this life of simple humility that has kept his running
from detouring into the potholes of sudden wealth and fame, Sindani
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Josia has not lost his humility,'' Sindani said. ``I believe
that will take him to an even higher level. I'll say it now, I
won't be surprised if he wins the Olympic marathon a second time in
Sydney'' in September of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Thugwane would like to be included more often in clinics given
by the South African track federation, which he said sometimes
ignores him. Posso said there would be a renewed effort to teach
him to read and write. For now, though, Thugwane is concentrating
on New York. He ran here in 1995, but dropped out after 18 miles
because of the bitter cold.
</P>
<P>
   Heat doesn't bother him, as he showed in the suffocating air of
Atlanta. And now he has apparently also conditioned himself against
the cold. On Oct. 4, he won the Great Northern half marathon in
1:02:32 on a chilly, rainy day in Newcastle, England. The forecast
for Sunday in New York is for temperatures climbing through the
50's with high clouds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know now I can run in the cold,'' Thugwane said.
</P>
<P>
   He injured a calf muscle days before the London Marathon last
spring and dropped out after 10 miles. ``Everything is fine, so I
don't talk too much,'' said Thugwane, who has paid for two training
partners in Albuquerque, where he said he has prepared for New York
by running for two hours six days a week.
</P>
<P>
   He longs to return home after the race, but at least he can feel
reasonably certain that his family will be protected in his
absence. When he lived near the Koornfontein coal mine east of
Johannesburg, he said, people would read in the newspaper or see on
television that he was out of town, training for a marathon, and
they tried to rob his wife. Others left animal parts and other
things on his lawn, as if to bring him bad luck, Posso said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided it was not safe,'' said Thugwane, who moved to
Johannesburg early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Posso has broached the idea of moving to Albuquerque
permanently, but Thugwane has so far declined. He wants to stay in
South Africa. And now that he has opened the door for others,
Thugwane is delighted to hold it open while his countrymen walk
through. He declined to run in the 1997 world marathon
championships, he said, giving his spot to another runner who had
not had the same exultant opportunity to compete against an
international field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gold medal opened many doors; I can go anywhere,''
Thugwane said. ``Other young men haven't had that chance. I want to
give them the chance.''

HAMED SPARS WITH THE BAG, THEN WITH THE PRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ Maybe he ate bad peanuts on the Concorde
from London on Tuesday morning. Whatever it was, Prince Naseem
Hamed blew into town, breezed through a 1-hour-10-minute workout,
and then blew his stack, blasting a couple of reporters during an
interview session before stalking out of a meeting room at Bally's
Park Place Casino late Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed (30-0), the World Boxing Organization featherweight
champion, arrived in town just four days before his fight with
Wayne McCullough (22-1) at Atlantic City Convention Center in a
12-round featherweight title bout Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   His delay was caused by his concern over his $2 million payment
_ HBO, which will televise the bout Saturday night, had guaranteed
that he would get it _ and that he did not get a visa until the
last minute. So here he was, four days late and in a bad mood. Call
him the prickly Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed always trains as if he has a taxi waiting with the meter
running. Tuesday's session was no different. The music blared as he
danced and pranced his way through workouts with pads, punching the
speed bag and jumping rope. And it was done to the total amusement
of his huge entourage.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old fighter looked soft around the middle, but his
conditioning coach, Dominic Ingle, said Hamed always looked like
that and that it was not an indication that he had been bouncing
his 4-month-old son, Sami, on his knee more than he had been
bouncing his gloves off some poor sparring partner's head.
</P>
<P>
   Ingle said Hamed had been training for eight weeks in Sheffield,
England, his hometown, and had been on a more nutritious diet that
included vitamin supplements and amino acid powders that were meant
to help him recover more quickly between workouts.
</P>
<P>
   When Tuesday afternoon's workout was over, Hamed sat down to
talk with reporters. He used the occasion to rip McCullough; to
announce that he was more mellow now that he was married and had a
baby son, and to verbally bully Colin Hart of The Sun in London,
whom he said had been unfairly critical of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne McCullough is going to get hurt,'' Hamed said. ``This
could be his last fight. I'm going to smash him to bits.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamed said he had been waiting for two years to fight
McCullough, and in that period his anger had been festering.
</P>
<P>
   It all started when McCullough showed up at Hamed's weigh-in
before his bout against Manuel Medina on Aug. 31, 1996. Hamed said
that McCullough had harangued him at the weigh-in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't do that the day before someone gets into the
ring, especially if you're not the one he's fighting,'' Hamed said.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, in Hamed's view, McCullough showed up at the fight, which
was held in Dublin, McCullough's hometown, and during the breaks
between the rounds, McCullough would stand up, hold his arms over
his head, and the crowd would cheer McCullough's name. It was
disconcerting and humiliating for Hamed, who is accustomed to being
the center of attention whenever he enters a room.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCullough has plenty of Irish supporters,'' said Brendan
Ingle, Hamed's trainer. ``And if he had been in the fight, then it
would have been on the level. He wasn't. He waited until Naz was at
a disadvantage to do what he did. Naz shouldn't have even been in
the fight. He had a chest infection. Frank Warren tried to get Naz
to pull out of the fight, but he wouldn't. So, Naz says it's
payback time for McCullough.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingle and Hamed, who have been working together for 17 years,
are trying to mend their relationship, because Ingle criticized
Hamed in a book written by Nick Pitt, a reporter with The Sun Times
in London, that was published in September. Hart reviewed the book
for The Sun, and Hamed believes that Hart chose the parts of the
book that made him look bad.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Hamed continually attacked Hart, and at one point the
exchange got so heated that Hamed's father, Sal, stood up and told
Hamed to sit down and be quiet. Hamed ignored his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were any good, and a decent man at all, you'd start
writing about somebody who is the best in their country and try to
build them up and try to give them more confidence,'' Hamed said.
</P>
<P>
   After the dust-up was over, Hamed said, ``Cheers'' and left.

D-BACKS SET PLAN FOR WILLIAMS TALK

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the same day that Bernie Wil liams' agent said in a published
report that the free-agent New York Yankees center fielder probably
will earn more than Mike Piazza's $91 million, Diamondbacks General
Manager Joe Garagiola said a visit with Williams has been lined up,
although not finalized.
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola also said the Diamond backs will contact pitcher Randy
Johnson, but won't have to bring him here. Johnson already lives in
the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to talk to them and find out what their thinking
is and go from there,'' Garagiola said.
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola said Williams and his agent, Scott Boras, will come
here in November, probably shortly after Williams returns from his
home in Puerto Rico ``sometime around the fifth or sixth.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite what appears to be an outlandish asking price for
Williams, who led the American League in batting last season,
Garagiola said it never hurts to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think whenever we can have somebody, particularly someone
from the American League who doesn't know our ballpark . . . it's a
tremendous plus when they can see the community and the
facilities,'' Garagiola said.
</P>
<P>
   It also helps that Williams has a relationship with Diamondbacks
Manager Buck Showalter, who man aged Williams and the Yankees from
1992 through 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks already have an established center fielder,
Devon White, who was the team's most valuable player last season.
White also has declared for free agency, but he has a home in the
Valley and would prefer to stay here. Williams conceivably could
play right field next to White.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' agent, Scott Boras, said that Williams is a better
player than Piazza and should expect to make more money because
several teams will be bidding. The New York Mets on Monday made
Piazza the highest-paid player in the game with a seven-year deal,
even though Piazza did not file for free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Piazza's contract represents what what team was willing
to pay Piazza,'' Boras told Bloomberg News. ``It doesn't represent
what free agency was willing to pay Piazza. We don't know what the
market is for a premium player who's competed for by multiple
teams. I think that's a very different market.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite missing 34 games because of a knee injury, Williams, 30,
hit .339 with 26 homers, 97 RBIs and 101 runs for the Yankees, who
won their second world championship in three years. He also won a
Gold Glove.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, traded from the Los Angeles Dodgers to Florida and then
to the Mets, hit .328 with 32 homers, 111 RBIs and 88 runs. But
defense is not his strong suit, which Boras was quick to point out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie Williams is a complete player. Mike Piazza is a
slugger,'' Boras, who represents Andy Benes and Jay Bell on the
Diamondbacks, told Bloomberg. ``In Bernie's case, you get the same
offense as Piazza, but you get premium, Gold Glove-type defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, since 1993, when both players became regulars, Piazza
has better hitting statistics in virtually all the major
categories.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean the Diamond backs wouldn't love to have Wil
liams. The question is whether he is too expensive, even though the
club is awash in revenue streams that puts it among major league
baseball's most profitable franchises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we get the opportunity, as I think we will, to sit
down and talk to him about Phoenix, about our team and how we're
putting it together and talk about the good things we hope to
accomplish, it's a good thing,'' Garagiola said.  &QL;

SWANN DECIDES SURGERY NEEDED ON RIGHT KNEE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eric Swann, who is scheduled to undergo another arthroscopic
surgery on his right knee this morning, has had cartilage problems
and arthritis in both knees his entire career.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were aware that Swann might miss work because of
the problems when they re-signed him in February to a five-year
deal worth $25 million, including what then was a team-record $7.5
million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   He is the anchor of a defensive line that was expected to carry
the team, a star among stars in a group that includes three former
first-round draft picks. Swann, a two-time Pro Bowler, can be one
of the league's most menacing defensive left tackles when healthy,
as his team-leading five tackles for loss and co-leading four sacks
bear evidence.
</P>
<P>
   So there was pressure on Swann, 25, to play and perform, even
after his knee flared up unseasonably early. The decision to opt
for surgery was Swann's, Coach Vince Tobin said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one who has to determine whether he can play or can't
play,'' Tobin said. ``What we hoped we could do is nurse him
through the season even if we had to sacrifice some practice time,
let him practice a little bit at the end of the week so he'd know
what to do and be able to play on Sunday. We did that the last
couple of weeks, and he played pretty well. It's disappointing that
he couldn't continue to go that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Swann could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A team source said arthroscopic surgery was considered three
weeks ago and then dropped when Swann's knee began to feel better.
He practiced very little during the weeks leading up to the past
two games.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the bye week. Swann practiced on Wednesday. On
Thursday, the knee flared up again. He is scheduled to have what
team medical personnel term ``arthroscopic flush and joint
inspection'' of the right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Warren King, a member of the Association of Professional Team
Physicians, comprised of team physicians from the NFL, NBA, NHL,
Major League Baseball and WNBA, said that in such cases, the
recovery time is dictated by the advancement of the arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be good in anywhere from one week to a very long
period of time,'' said King, who consults for the San Jose Sharks,
San Francisco Giants and Oakland Raiders in the Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   Arthritis is damage to surface cartilage that covers the bone at
a joint. It starts as a softening of firm cartilage, then becomes
rough and fissured, then thins, eventually disappearing so the
underlying bone is exposed. King said any roughening or damage to
the cartilage surfaces on a joint, such as the knee, can be
smoothed or removed and flushed out, resulting in ``significant
pain relief.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If a player is having trouble playing or performing, it is a
very reasonable thing to do,'' King said. ``If there is lost
meniscal pad, it could lead to quite an aggressive form of
arthritis at a relatively young age. It is not uncommon at all
among linemen who are carrying a lot of weight.''
</P>
<P>
   After Swann (6 feet 5, 315 pounds) had meniscus cartilage
removed from the right knee on Sept. 12, 1995, he missed four
weeks. After he had meniscus cartilage cleaned out of the same knee
on Nov. 10, 1993, he missed the final seven games.
</P>
<P>
   He has had two surgeries on his left knee, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin wouldn't second-guess the timing or the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I never look back,'' Tobin said. ``You make
determinations as you go, and you make decisions when you're forced
to make decisions. Last week, he practiced on Wednesday and felt
pretty good. On Thursday, it got sore and he didn't practice. This
week, it would not have been such that he could do what we'd
planned on doing, which was to practice at the end of the week and
play on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always satisfied that a player is going to do what he
thinks is best for him and the football team. Nobody can get into
anybody's mind and tell the level of pain he's going through, or
the level of his ability to play. . . . I'm satisfied that if Eric
thinks he needs surgery in order to continue to play, that that's
the course he should follow.'' &QL;

BCS POLL RAISES MORE QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ohio State University is unbeaten and ranked No. 1 in both
college football polls. But OSU isn't the nation's best team
according to the Bowl Confusion System rankings released this week.
UCLA is No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State is No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Buckeye A: ``We don't get any respect, man.'' Buckeye B: ``Yeah,
the computer's dissin' us.''
</P>
<P>
   After his team beat Northwestern last week, Ohio State coach
John Cooper spoke for most Americans when he said, ``I couldn't
tell you what the BCS poll is.''
</P>
<P>
   The BCS is a complex statistical formula devised by the Internal
Revenue Service and leaked by the White House to confuse the public
and direct our attention away from the pending presidential
impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Between now and December the BCS is guaranteed to produce many
heated arguments, and an occasional stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   I have spent hours studying the new ratings, which will identify
the teams that will play for the national championship Jan. 4 in
the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Best I can tell, the Byzantine formula is based in part on the
data from three computer rankings:
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sagarin; Hester &AMP; Anderson/``Seattle Times; The New York
Times''. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Who's who? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who is Jeff Sagarin?
</P>
<P>
   You can find him on the internet. Pictured on Sagarin's ``home
page`` is an intense-looking young man with dark eyebrows and a
shaggy head of dark hair. Jeff looks like Engelbert Humperdinck,
the singer.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a T-shirt and khakis, Sagarin is standing outdoors
alongside a young woman identified as Earth Goddess Nan. A white
dog is dozing at the couple's feet.
</P>
<P>
   Sagarin is a mathematics graduate from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology _ MIT for those in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Sagarin's national rankings (he ranks ASU No. 56, just ahead of
the Texas Christian Horned Frogs) will help determine which teams
will be coming to Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Ever met him?
</P>
<P>
   Spoken with him?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I haven't,'' said John Junker, executive director of the
Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   How about Chris Hester?
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Anderson?
</P>
<P>
   Junker laughed softly, the healthy sign of a busy man who hasn't
lost his sense of humor. ``I don't know them either,'' he said,
``but I enjoy their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Sagarin ranks UCLA ahead of Ohio State. So does Hester/Anderson.
But who ``are'' they? And why is a Seattle newspaper involved in
all of this? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Judging reliability &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Click your mouse and you'll find more than 70 college football
power ratings and rankings. Gary Hawley's Pigskin Index. Dr. Ono's
NCAA Football Rankings. Chad Hansen's Ultimate College Football
Ranking System. What makes one more reliable than the others?
</P>
<P>
   Junker defends the BCS rankings, calling the formula a
``credible and reasonable system.'' He favors computers determining
who is No. 1 and No. 2 over a person in a ``yellow jacket'' _ a
Fiesta Bowl official _ deciding which teams are worthy to play for
the championship, and by doing so risk having his house burned down
by those who most passionately disagree.
</P>
<P>
   And really, it's not that complicated. According to the system,
an average of the three rankings are utilized to calculate points
in one component of the formula. A maximum adjusted deviation of no
greater than 50 percent of the average of the two lowest computer
rankings will be utilized in the calculation.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if a team is ranked third and fifth in two of the
computer systems and 12th in the third computer system, the highest
ranking of 12 would be adjusted to six before calculating the
average points for the computer component (3+58 divided by
24x50%2+46).
</P>
<P>
   The average of those three rankings would be calculated for the
points of this component (3+5+614 divided by 34.67.)
</P>
<P>
   Have a nice day. &QL;

TEXAS WOMAN'S TEAM AIDS FLOOD VICTIM _ THEIR TEAMMATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the aftermath of last week's South Texas floods, members of
the Texas Woman's University basketball team opened up their hearts
to assist one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   With an off-day from the drudgery of practice, the players drove
from the school in Denton, Texas, to Seguin, Texas on Saturday to
help teammate Laura Kolenozsky, after her family's home was
destroyed during flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that speaks highly of these players as individuals,
and it tells you a lot about their character,'' Texas Woman's
basketball coach Beth Palmer said. ``We have some athletes who have
high integrity and character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura was real apprehensive about all of us wanting to help
her, because she didn't want anybody feeling sorry for her. But
after it was done, she was real appreciative.''
</P>
<P>
   The home where Kolenozsky grew up was located on the banks of
the Guadalupe River in Seguin. Now, Palmer said ``there's nothing
there but a slab.''
</P>
<P>
   The floods were ``similiar to a tornado,'' Palmer said. ``We
went down there to help Laura and her family try to find personal
belongings, and we were also there for moral support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would dig, dig and dig, and we'd find a fork. Then, we
would dig, dig and dig, and we'd find a pot. Laura's sister said
whatever we did find is more than what we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolenozsky would not comment, but her teammates were more than
happy to be there in her time of need.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it shows how close we are as friends and as
teammates,'' guard Angie Land said. ``We're not just going to get
together on the basketball court and play, but we're also going to
help each other out on all situations on and off the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it meant a lot to all of us, especially Laura. It shows
how much we all care for each other, and that when hardships come
we'll help each other out.''
</P>
<P>
   For the team, witnessing devastation happening to strangers on
TV is one thing. But seeing it happen to someone they know was a
sobering experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``To actually walk in and see where someone's house is totally
gone, that hurt me because Laura's a teammate of mine. But not only
that, she's a human being,'' junior guard Shamika Wilburn said.
``To be able to help out, it made me feel better. It was just a
great team effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Denton stores aided the cause. Kmart gave the team a
discount on cleaning supplies, and Wal-Mart donated the wading
boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we were down there, we also helped one of the neighbors
whose home also was affected by the floods,'' Palmer said. ``It was
emotional, and mentally and physically draining.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Laura is family in a way, because she's on our team. We
were shoveling and digging all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior forward, Kolenozsky led Texas Woman's in scoring last
season with 13.6 points per game. But her accomplishments on the
court pales in comparison to what her teammates and coach did for
her and her family off the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just proud of my team, and proud of the ladies who went
down there,'' Palmer said. ``We had them off last Saturday, and
they could have taken that day and done whatever they wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the players said, `We'll think about this day a lot
longer and remember what we did by helping out the flood victims.
But we won't remember what we did if we would have gone home and
sat in front of the TV.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The team did rally around Laura, and were able to rally around
something negative and make it work.''

OVITZ CAN'T WAIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Michael Ovitz is many things. He was the
former chairman of the most powerful talent agency in Hollywood. He
once was the right hand of Disney's Michael Eisner, before a sudden
amputation.
</P>
<P>
   He's the man who on Tuesday asked the NFL owners meeting here to
award him an expansion franchise and let him build a stadium on a
landfill in Carson.
</P>
<P>
   He also is not very patient.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ovitz has a vision, and he wants the NFL to share it,
sooner than later. In his eyes, he is not competing against the
heathen representing the New Coliseum or those fine folks from
Houston, who are including revenue from rodeos as part of their NFL
buy-in.
</P>
<P>
   The man whose reputation in Hollywood was built on the art of
the deal believes he has painted the league a picture that is
breathtaking and of great importance to all 31 owners. There should
be little reason for debate, because his proposal makes the most
sense, and also comes with an expiration date.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about something that is new, fresh, safe,
comfortable and centrally located,'' said Ovitz, the Stealth owner,
in a rare public appearance. ``There are 16 million people living
within a 30-minute Sunday drive of Carson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We answered all of their questions about the areas they were
concerned, location, stadium, financing, ownership and marketing.
We are redefining the terms of a `new' NFL franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't sit on the project for three years. We made an
exciting presentation, and this is the group to get it done.'' End
of story.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL, of course, there is no end. There are only more
cities to conquer. Just as it behooved league owners to talk up the
Ovitz proposal earlier this year as leverage in the stadium game,
it behooved them Tuesday to praise all three groups assembled and
not tip their hand.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the league considered a major expansion, four
cities were competing: Jacksonville, Carolina, St. Louis and
Baltimore. The first two got expansion teams. The two losers then
went out and stole teams. All four teams now play in new stadiums.
Coincidence? I think not.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of both Houston and the New Coliseum group, led
by Kings owner Ed Roski, acknowledged that their groups are willing
to explore an existing team moving into their proposed new
stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how that might play into this expansion decision, NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue said, ``I couldn't speak to that.'' No,
of course not.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz made it clear this is a one-time offer. If he doesn't have
a decision in hand by early 1999, he wouldn't be able to have a
stadium ready for kickoff in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   He eloquently hammered home other points that are important, if
not new, apparently designed to speed up the NFL's process.
</P>
<P>
   ``My 11-year-old son has never been to an NFL game,'' he said.
``If we wait too much longer, there will be a whole generation of
kids in Southern California who did not grow up with the NFL. We
tried to make the owners aware of that and included a detailed
marketing plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is an integral part of branding the NFL throughout
the world. It does not make sense to have 16 million people
involved with the NFL, to have the second-largest TV market without
a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz said he provided the league a detailed finance plan, but
he didn't itemize much of it for the media. He didn't say what
percentages his 10 equity partners had, and did not give specifics
on his deal with Herbert Glimcher, who owns the option to buy the
land.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the heavy financial hitters on his team, supermarket
czar Ron Burkle, was part of the ownership group present. And last
week, his contact at Bank of America, David Coulter, parted company
with the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Ovitz aides had referred to having up to a $750
million line of credit. Ed Brown of Bank of America was present
Tuesday as part of the Ovitz team, and now the line has been set at
$400 million.
</P>
<P>
   After you and I get past the first million, it all sounds like
funny money. But to the NFL, that can break a deal. It's what
killed author Tom Clancy's proposal to buy the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Carson's investment has changed some since last Thursday's
council meeting. Before, it reportedly was $18 million in cash, set
aside for the mall, and up to $180 million in bonds. Now it is $30
million cash and $150 million in bonds.
</P>
<P>
   City manager Jerry Groomes also noted that few of the city's
revenue streams would come directly from the stadium or Ovitz. It
would make its nut from the mall, ticket and parking surcharges, an
increase in property taxes related to the project and state
development money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we would make money is from anything else we add to the
project,'' said Groomes, referring to the building of nearby hotels
and retail shops. ``That would be gravy. Even if none of that
occurs, we'll still be able to pay the debt service (on the bonds)
and make a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   And the city won't move forward with anything until the NFL
gives Ovitz the go sign.
</P>
<P>
   That won't come until January at the earliest, leaving all three
groups more time to lobby their ideas and lob grenades at the
others.
</P>
<P>
   New Coliseum representatives believe Ovitz does not have the
money to make the deal happen. Ovitz aides say the New Coliseum is
old news and the league will expand to Fiji before it does to
Exposition Park. The New Coliseum says the league is starting to
doubt Ovitz. Ovitz/Carson says the Coliseum's goal of $100 million
in PSL revenue is Fantasyland.
</P>
<P>
   Into Tuesday night, reps from both sides were inviting reporters
to visit their suite and have dinner. The New Coliseum served ribs.
Team Ovitz served sushi. When in doubt, feed. Check back tomorrow
for the breakfast menu.

ISLANDERS EDGE KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Since the first day of training camp, Los
Angeles Kings coach Larry Robinson repeatedly has beseeched his
players to get the puck deep in the opponents' zone, to go to the
net, to rely on brute force rather than on the finesse that is
largely lacking on a team composed primarily of grinders.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, the message has not gotten through, and Tuesday
night, the Kings (3-3-2) paid in the form of a 1-0 loss to the New
York Islanders (4-4) before an announced crowd of 9,084 at the
Nassau Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mighty Duck Joe Sacco's 70-footer early in the third
period, the one bad goal Manny Legace has allowed in four
appearances, was the difference. But Legace, who made 33 saves, was
the last person deserving of blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commitment's not there,'' Robinson said. ``We've got some
prima donnas that just aren't putting out.... We're all waiting on
the outside with our sticks cocked, you know, `Hey, get me the
puck.' That puck doesn't have legs. You've got to work and you've
got to muck and you've got to grind and you've got to do what it
takes to get the goals. And that means getting bumped and getting
pushed and getting slashed and everything else in front of the
net.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers don't lie. The Kings have scored six goals in the
first four games of this five-game trip, and are 0 for 17 on the
power play the past four games. They took just 20 shots at Tommy
Salo, who recorded his third and easiest shutout this season, and
they had a four-shot first period for the second consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   The closest the Kings came to scoring was with 6:15 left, when
Rob Blake had a partial breakaway and fought off a hook to take a
shot at Salo, who made the save. Blake lost his balance and slid
into Salo, the rebound hitting his leg and entering the net.
Referees Kerry Fraser and Blaine Angus waved off the goal, ruling
that Blake's momentum had carried the puck into the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to argue with these guys anymore,'' Robinson
said. ``That was their explanation. I've got to live with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake, who suffered a multistitch gash below his left eye when
hit by a puck in the final minute, was more concerned with the
Kings' pop-gun attack and alluded to the absence of ailing center
Jozef Stumpel, who has a hip-flexor strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something new,'' Blake said. ``It's been like this
for a couple of years. Our No. 1 center is out and we don't have
any depth to pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The game's only goal came on an innocent play 2:01 into the
third period, when Sacco fired a 70-footer that dipped as it
reached Legace, who left just enough space between his legs to
allow the puck through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a while, you get a break like that,'' said Islanders
associate coach Lorne Henning, running the team in the absence of
coach and general manager Mike Milbury, who is in Austria
negotiating with restricted free agent Ziggy Palffy.
</P>
<P>
   Legace said, ``I saw it coming. I thought I was going to catch
it in the belly. All of a sudden, it wasn't there anymore. It was
the worst feeling in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Kings had mustered even a minimal attack, it would
have been an afterthought, with the postgame focus on Legace's
sprawling stop of a first-period shorthanded breakaway by Sergei
Nemchinov or his stop of Sacco's point-blank one-timer late in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   As time wound down, things only got worse for the Kings. Center
Ray Ferraro took a five-minute spearing major with 1:41 to play,
retaliating after being knocked to the ice by the Islanders' Bryan
Smolinski. Down a man, the Kings were never able to pull Legace for
an extra skater.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Ferraro had acted out of frustration, Robinson said,
``If you're playing for your team, isn't the team supposed to come
first, not your own frustration?''
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse for Ferraro, NHL executive Colin Campbell,
who administers justice in the league, attended the game, and
Ferraro could face disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro's play might have been the hardest hit of the night by a
King. Before tonight's finale of the five-game trip at New Jersey,
Robinson said he will show his players videotape to drum home to
them what they have not been doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're supposed to be a physical team and we got outhit by a
smaller, quicker team,'' Robinson said. ``That shouldn't be.
They're going to look at it. They think they have all the answers.
Now we're going to show them the answers.''

NBA LOCKOUT HAS ONLY DRIBBLE OF FAN RESENTMENT

   _Headline over Daily News letters to the editor after
cancellation of baseball games due to 1994 players' strike:
``America's pastime has jilted the fans''
</P>
<P>
   _Headline over Daily News letters to the editor after
cancellation of basketball games due to 1998 lockout: ``Fans
question Hackett''
</P>
<P>
   Stubborn greed cost Major League Baseball a big chunk of a
season, and fans were up in arms.
</P>
<P>
   Stubborn greed costs the NBA a big chunk of a season, and fans
are up in arms about the USC football coach.
</P>
<P>
   If you're an NBA executive these days, that is the most
worrisome thing about the owners' lockout that has caused the first
two weeks of the season to be called off.
</P>
<P>
   So few of us seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   Public anger is one thing. Public apathy is worse.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Major League Baseball was lucky, because the
fans' revolt at least indicated they'd lost something near and dear
to their hearts. They weren't going to stay angry for long, and as
the feel-good summer of '98 indicated, they haven't.
</P>
<P>
   Now the NBA is finding out where it stands, which is on shakier
ground than it might have realized during the two decades in which
it rose from an art-house secret to a billion-dollar blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it.
</P>
<P>
   When baseball went on strike, the reaction was, ``They've stolen
summer from us!'' When basketball is locked out, the reaction is,
``It's football season anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   When baseball went out, it was, ``We weep for fathers and sons
and lost days in the sun!'' With basketball, it's, ``This is really
going to cut into sneaker sales.''
</P>
<P>
   When baseball went out, it was, ``It's an insult to Babe Ruth
and Hank Aaron, to Lou Gehrig and Cal Ripken Jr., to history and
the integrity of the record book!'' With basketball, it's, ``Our
lawyers used to be so much sharper than this.''
</P>
<P>
   The contrast can be explained in a couple of ways. Here's the
one that should have the NBA feeling humbled, chastened and
concerned at the end of a decade in which it earned the designation
as the best-run U.S. sports league:
</P>
<P>
   Despite all its clever lawyering, merchandising and
cablecasting, the NBA has failed to weave itself into the very
fabric of American life as Major League Baseball and the NFL have.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation might be as simple as the fact that baseball is
the summer. The NBA shares its season with hockey and football; a
jilted pro basketball fan finds other fish in the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Or it might be that a league that was on the verge of collapse
before Magic Johnson and Larry Bird came along needs more than 20
years and a slick highlight reel to secure a permanent place in the
American sporting soul.
</P>
<P>
   An NBA diehard might argue that fans have reacted less
emotionally to this interruption in play not because of the NBA's
shortcomings but because we've gotten used to strikes and lockouts
and simply aren't as outraged by them.
</P>
<P>
   But we were used to strikes and lockouts by 1994, that being the
fourth baseball lockout or strike since 1972 (and the seventh if
you include umpires' strikes). Every baseball strike has inspired a
national hand-wringing.
</P>
<P>
   An NBA apologist could point out there's a difference between
canceling the end of the baseball regular season !ital!and!off! the
World Series and canceling the start of the pro basketball season.
Of course the loss of a World Series was a bigger deal.
</P>
<P>
   But that only serves to remind us how insignificant the NBA
regular season feels.
</P>
<P>
   A six-month season that lets 16 of 29 teams into the playoffs
isn't a competition, it's a commercial. Since the start of the
Johnson-Bird era in 1979, six NBA division races have been decided
by just one game. In the same stretch, 12 Major League Baseball
races have been decided by just one game.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations have bogged down and the NBA is expected to wipe
out the rest of the November schedule after a Board of Governors
meeting today. How much are you going to miss that Denver Nuggets
game on the 22nd?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not much. You'll still be talking about the USC-UCLA
game on the 21st.

TEXAS A&AMP;M'S LECHLER STARS IN PUNT, PASS, KICK DUTIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Strange-but-true fact: The most
accurate passer on the Texas A&AMP;M football roster actually earns his
keep with his feet.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not prevent punter Shane Lechler from branching
out into other areas of the Aggies' offense or special teams.
During the 1998 season, Lechler is the only player at A&AMP;M who has
kicked off, punted, attempted a field goal, held for a field goal
and thrown a touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   That final achievement became a topic of discussion during a
Monday afternoon hunting trip with quarterback Randy McCown.
</P>
<P>
   Lechler said he lost track of how many touchdown passes McCown
threw during the eighth-ranked Aggies' 17-10 victory against Texas
Tech and requested an update. McCown, of course, had none. A&AMP;M's
lone touchdown toss against Tech came from Lechler on a fake field
goal, making the quarterback-turned-punter 2-for-2 in the passing
department this season.
</P>
<P>
   In McCown's estimation, that also makes Lechler hard to live
with.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept saying, `It only took me two passes to throw for a
touchdown. How many did it take you?' '' said McCown, who has
thrown for three touchdowns in 69 attempts. ``He's constantly
giving me a hard time. Just once, I'd like to punt and have it roll
about 80 yards so I could have something to hold over him.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for that to happen any time soon, said coach R.C.
Slocum. He doesn't want anyone but Lechler, a junior from East
Bernard with All-America credentials, handling the punting duties
when the Aggies (7-1, 4-0) head to Stillwater, Okla., for
Saturday's 6 p.m. game against Oklahoma State (3-4, 2-3).
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Slocum likes to let Lechler handle as much of the
special-teams load as he is willing to shoulder. When he is not
holding for kicker Russell Bynum, Lechler is attempting the
long-distance field goals deemed out of Bynum's range. The past two
weeks, Lechler has completed a 29-yard pass on a fake punt and an
8-yard touchdown toss off a fake field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the versatility, Lechler's biggest asset is his ability
to win the field-position battle with rival punters. Lechler
averages 45.2 yards per punt, best in the Big 12 and sixth
nationally. He has killed 14 punts inside the opponents' 20-yard
line.
</P>
<P>
   Most telling, perhaps, is the fact A&AMP;M's average starting point
for drives this season is its 35-yard line. For opponents, it's
their own 27. Over the course of 103 possession exchanges, that's a
field-position gain of 824 yards, much of it attributable to
Lechler.
</P>
<P>
   That 824-yard figure exceeds the season totals produced by the
Aggies' leading rusher (Dante Hall, 750 yards), passer (McCown, 639
yards) or receiver (Chris Cole, 418 yards).
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I see it, to drive 80 yards against our defense is
next to impossible,'' Lechler said of a ``Wrecking Crew'' unit that
ranks eighth nationally in total defense (271.4 yards per game).
``The farther I can put them down there, the more I help out out
the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   He's helped to the point that Hall said, if forced to list the
team's three most valuable players, he would rank Lechler behind
linebackers Dat Nguyen and Warrick Holdman. Slocum takes it a step
further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shane Lechler has been the most valuable player on this
football team, by far, for a couple of years now,'' Slocum said.
``If you graded all his plays, he'd have very few minuses. He's a
great weapon for us that most teams don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, he accepted his role grudgingly. Lechler played
quarterback in high school, completing an eye-popping 87 of 101
passes (86.1 percent) during his senior season. But he played for a
Class 2A team that ran the option and never was asked to read
defenses until he arrived A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   That limitation proved too great to overcome, so Lechler stopped
attending quarterback meetings in 1997 and focused his attention on
punting. Last year, he set A&AMP;M season records for punting average
(47.0) and net punting (41.5). His career marks in those
departments, 44.6 and 41.5, also are school records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to hate punting. I didn't want to settle for that. I
wanted to be involved all the time, instead of six plays a game,''
Lechler said. ``Some times, it's still tough to watch Randy and
those guys out there having fun on every play. But I know if I'm
ever going to get to the NFL, this is what I've got to do. And I've
gotten to the point that I love kicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Lechler loves it even more when he gets to fake a kick and show
off his passing prowess, just to remind opponents _ as well as
McCown _ that he remains the most accurate passer on the A&AMP;M
roster.

RANGERS SECURE GONZALEZ FOR '99
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers exercised their option for 1999
on the contract of right fielder Juan Gonzalez and will consider
discussions regarding a extension, general manager Doug Melvin said
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin informed Jim Bronner, who represents Gonzalez, of that
decision before the Rangers exercised their option worth $8.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're focusing on putting the team together for next year and
then we would consider sitting down,'' Melvin said. ``I'm not
saying we would, but we would consider it at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   The escalation of major-league salaries this decade likely will
dictate Melvin do so despite the fact the Rangers also possess an
option for the 2000 season on Gonzalez's contract worth $7.5
million. Both option years represent a bargain considering Gonzalez
is possibly the game's best run producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that salaries are escalating,'' Melvin said.
``You just try to take each contract individually and do what you
can do from a team concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirby Puckett became the game's first player to average $3
million per year when the Minnesota Twins signed the center fielder
to a three-year contract worth $9 million before the 1990 season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, New York Mets catcher Mike Piazza _ who Monday signed a
seven-year contract worth $91 million _ ranks as the game's
highest-paid player at $13 million per year less than a decade
later. It also should be noted that Piazza never tested the market
by filing for free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``His market value might have been five years at $12 million,''
Melvin said. ``He didn't sign for market value. He signed a deal
that the Mets gave him. He didn't go out in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Bernie Williams likely will, and it remains to be
seen what the 30-year-old outfielder will receive. Williams filed
for free agency Monday, and Scott Boras, who represents the player,
seeks a seven-year contract with a no-trade clause.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin will watch with interest, but the general manager said
that cannot dictate the Rangers' approach with Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't worry about where the market is and all that,''
Melvin said. ``You try to work out a deal that fits your
ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision yesterday gives the Rangers 10 players signed for
1999 at $39.5 million, and many questions remain.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Royce Clayton, right-hander Todd Stottlemyre and
reserve catcher Bill Haselman have filed for free agency, and first
baseman Will Clark and right-hander Xavier Hernandez likely will.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Aaron Sele, center fielder Tom Goodwin, designated
hitter/first baseman Lee Stevens and designated hitter/outfielder
Mike Simms will be eligible for salary arbitration, and the Rangers
expect right-hander Rick Helling will be eligible, too.
</P>
<P>
   Those 10 players earned $22,644,000 this past season, and with
10 players already signed at almost $40 million illustrates
Melvin's task. The Rangers' Opening Day payroll this past season
was $54,142,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always uncomfortable when you get that high, but you
just work and try to put the best team together that you can,''
Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario could leave the Rangers vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make a mistake or players get injured,'' Melvin said,
``you've got a chance to have a disastrous year.''

SULLIVAN'S ACT DIDN'T PLAY AT TCU, BUT MIGHT AT AUBURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From his sweet home of Alabama comes the news that Pat Sullivan
has long been preparing to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   He's tanned. He's rested. He's ready to be the next head
football coach at Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   One full year after he submitted his resignation at TCU _
winless at the time and under fire _ Sullivan is being mentioned
prominently as a candidate to replace the abruptly departed Terry
Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a loyal Frogs fan, you probably find the news (A)
predictable, and (B) the silliest thing you've heard all month.
</P>
<P>
   To most observers here, TCU was never more than the Stuckey's on
Sullivan's highway back to the Southeastern Conference. He never
talked about it much, but his feelings for Auburn, his alma mater,
and for the down-home religion that is SEC football were always
there.
</P>
<P>
   One scene comes to memory, ironically from Sullivan's last night
of work at Amon Carter Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs were quasi-celebrating the conclusion of their ghastly
1-10 season, chortling at upsetting rival SMU. In the TCU locker
room, running backs coach Bud Casey, whose ties with Sullivan went
back more than 10 seasons, greeted a visitor with a frank synopsis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell ya,'' Casey said. ``We came here, not expecting to stay
all that long. We thought we were all going to LSU, but Pat screwed
that up. But now it's over and we're going back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Yep. That much pretty much sums up the Pat Sullivan Era at TCU.
</P>
<P>
   From out here on the prairie, it's seems unfathomable that
Auburn could have chased away a head coach who, in six years, was
30 games over .500. But then again, this is Texas and we know the
drill.
</P>
<P>
   In his private thoughts, back when Patrick was sharing them with
some media people, Sullivan would confess that he wasn't a fan of
Bowden. He put it much more colorfully, of course. And he was dead
right.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden was cocky and manipulative. He was stubby in stature but
left a wide footprint.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, his 20-0 start as a head coach was both the best
thing and the worst thing. It immediately stamped him, rightly or
wrongly, as a winner in the mold of his famous father.
</P>
<P>
   But the young Bowden never could assuage the Auburn expectations
left after those first two seasons _ who could? In 16 games against
top 25 foes over the past four seasons, Bowden was 4-12. His
overall record during that span was 18-15-1.
</P>
<P>
   More damning, though, was that the Auburn family never knew
whether to hug him or distrust him. With the school's worst start
in 46 years (1-5) staring him in the face, Bowden slipped into his
martyr's robe and walked out, leaving others to be blamed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people that Bowden has insinuated were responsible:
supporters of Pat Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   But know this _ no kid of Bobby Bowden is ever going to play the
fool. Terry gets $625,000 in severance pay and the chance to leave
before that 1-5 record got a lot worse. He could end up being the
next Oklahoma coach.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn, it appears, will let longtime assistant Bill Oliver
finish the season on an interim basis. And if he proves to be the
next Phillip Fulmer, who made Tennessee forget Johnny Majors,
Auburn might stop right there.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, however, those ``supporters of Sullivan''
will get their say. Patrick is certain to emerge as a serious
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm interested in the job,'' he told the
``Birmingham Post-Herald.'' ``I'm not going to sit here and lie to
you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auburn needs someone to rally the Auburn people, recruit and
coach. I feel like I'm good at those things.''
</P>
<P>
   In this part of the football world, alas, we never could
understand that about Pat Sullivan. But he was revered back in
Auburn after taking the Plainsmen to three bowl games and winning
the Heisman Trophy in 1971. He was Auburn's Earl Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the worst of TCU times, media friends from Alabama would
call us to check up on Sullivan. We would tell them one more time
about the LSU saga, when Sullivan talked his way out of the job in
1994 by demanding a Steve Spurrier-sized contract and someone to
pay his TCU escape clause.
</P>
<P>
   We would tell them how things changed abruptly after that '94
season, how Sullivan had decided he wanted to take control of the
offense and how the players had steadily lost faith in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to coach somewhere next year,'' Sullivan, who is 48,
told the Birmingham paper. ``Those were the plans back in January.
I just used this year to recharge my battery.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU fans will probably chuckle when they read that.
</P>
<P>
   At Auburn, Pat Sullivan is a golden oldie. A Heisman legend.
</P>
<P>
   Here, he was a dead battery.
</P>
<P>
   Godspeed, Auburn, from all the folks here at Stuckey's.

POOR GOAL PRODUCTION TROUBLES HULL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Brett Hull is second on the Stars in scoring,
and is still frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   The winger, the Stars' big free-agent pickup in the off-season
who signed a three-year deal for $17 million, has seven points in
seven games, second only to Darryl Sydor's 11 for the Stars.
However, Hull has just one goal among those seven points, despite
leading the Stars in shots with 28.
</P>
<P>
   So does the lack of goal production bother the man who has 555
career goals?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it does,'' Hull said. ``How many 2-1 games have we had?
If I score, maybe it's 3-1 or 4-1. My job is to go out there and
score. Mike \RModano\S and I talked about this. You're disappointed
when you don't do the things that help your team win easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hull is a plus-2 and his team is 5-1-1, so the level of
frustration is relative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other part of the game is that we're not getting scored on
either,'' Hull said. ``As long as I'm getting the chances, that's
fine. It'll go in sooner or later.''
Take the day off
The Stars are taking today off since they have five free days
between their game Saturday and their next game, on Friday, against
the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock put the Stars through two heavy
practices Monday and yesterday, along with intense off-ice
workouts. He said players will resume a regular workout beginning
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough thing for an older team, I think there's a
tendency to get stale,'' Hitchcock said. ``If we were playing
poorly, we'd welcome a break. But we were just coming off a game in
which we played our best five-on-five hockey of the season, so we
wanted to keep it going.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's practices focused on forechecking Monday and the
transition game yesterday. He said the team would dedicate a good
deal of practice tomorrow to work on the special teams. The Stars
rank first in the NHL in power-play success with 13 goals in 48
attempts for a 27.1 success rate. They are eighth in penalty
killing, stopping 30-of-34 chances.
Injury update
Center Guy Carbonneau missed his second day of practice nursing a
groin pull. He said he expects to skate tomorrow and would like to
play in back-to-back games Friday against the Ducks and Saturday
against the Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Shawn Chambers skated in practice with a charley
horse in his left leg. Chambers said he expects to play Friday.
Winger Brent Severyn is 100 percent recovered from the muscle
strain in his neck, Hitchcock said. Statistically speaking The NHL
is using expanded statistics for an entire season for the first
time. For half of last season, the league charted statistics such
as ice time, hits, faceoff wins, giveaways and takeaways.
</P>
<P>
   Through seven games, the Stars are second in the NHL in hits
with 205. The New York Rangers have 244. Stars defenseman Derian
Hatcher leads the NHL with 30 hits and defensive partner Richard
Matvichuk ranks second with 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have something to look at,'' Matvichuk said. ``We
certainly can't be judged on goals and assists.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher leads the Stars in ice time and ranks 21st in the NHL
with 25.2 minutes per game. The Rangers' Brian Leetch leads all NHL
players with 32 minutes per game.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars rank seventh in faceoff percentage, after leading the
NHL last season. The Stars have won 53.5 percent of their draws as
opposed to 54.8 percent last season. Joe Nieuwendyk, who finished
second in the NHL last season while winning 59.5 percent of his
draws, is 18-6 in two games since returning from injury. He is
expected to help the Stars contend for the faceoff championship
once again.

CSUN WANTS RAMOS, ARNOLD TO STAY BUSY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cal State Northridge's Anthony Ramos had three
offensive touches in Saturday's loss to Montana State. Aaron Arnold
had two catches.
</P>
<P>
   Considering how exciting and electrifying both wide receivers
can be, that's not nearly enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I saw was that we only completed 16 passes,''
CSUN offensive coordinator Rob Phencie said. ``I looked and they
didn't come close to touching the damn thing as much as they should
in a game.''
</P>
<P>
   When CSUN's coaching staff met Monday to discuss what worked and
what failed during the last week, the inability to get Ramos and
Arnold more involved in the offense came up quickly.
</P>
<P>
   That should change Saturday when CSUN travels to No. 23 Weber
State, which has the Big Sky's top-rated defense. The coaching
staff is under the belief that CSUN settled for four field goals
against Montana State because Ramos and Arnold weren't involved in
the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ramos goes (well), we go,'' CSUN coach Ron Ponciano said.
``When he's had good games we've won. He's an exciting player who
makes big plays in a lot of different facets of the game. We have
to get the ball in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the same thing with Arnold. If he gets shut down, our
offense gets shut down. That's what we have to solve. How to get
them the ball more.''
</P>
<P>
   There are ways.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold has been moved to kick returner, and when Ramos was being
his most destructive to defenses earlier this season, he did it in
a variety of ways. He's thrown a touchdown, is third in rushing for
CSUN and has 19 receptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the week we always have stuff prepared, but come game
time we have to run sight adjustments,'' Ramos said. ``Last week
our practice plan, we were doing a certain thing, and they gave us
a different look so we did something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamming Welch: CSUN has already faced Division I-AA's top rusher
(Sacramento State's Charles Roberts) and next week the Matadors
host the No. 7 runner, Charles Dunn of Portland State.
</P>
<P>
   However, this week's focus is Weber State's Morgan Welch, who
has run for 1,310 yards and eight touchdowns. He's fifth in the
country in rushing (163.8 ypg) and is 69 yards from a single-season
school record but has been held to fewer than 100 yards in each of
the Wildcats' past two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Welch) breaks some tackles, I think the offensive line is
very good and they have the one thing that kills us,'' Ponciano
said. ``They have the two tight ends and H-back.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are bad combinations for a defensive line that's been
mediocre lately. The Matadors are eighth in the conference in
rushing defense, allowing 202 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   All-you-can-eat buffet: Periodically, injured linebacker Cos
Abercrombie stops by practice, which he did Tuesday. His jaw is
wired shut after being broken at Northern Arizona on Sept. 19, but
he's scheduled to have the wiring taken off Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I ate real food was Sept. 19, when I had chicken
and spaghetti at Sizzler,'' said Abercrombie, who's lost 10 pounds
since being hurt. ``Just talking about it makes me hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Now this is ridiculous: The Matadors' injury situation has been
well-documented, but now it's getting out of hand. CSUN radio
analyst Ron Foster limped to practice with a hamstring problem
after injuring his leg during a commercial shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was high-steppin' it like Deion Sanders and felt
something,'' Foster said. ``(Play-by-play man) Gary Cruz is
healthy. Foster is probable.''

PUSH IS ON FOR NATIONAL FINALS RODEO BERTHS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association heads into the
final two weekends of the regular season, cowboys such as Mike
Johnson are entering every rodeo possible, trying to secure a
National Finals Rodeo berth.
</P>
<P>
   Using come-from-behind tactics during a small show last weekend
in Del Rio, Johnson placed first in calf roping, earning $2,241.
The Del Rio victory boosted Johnson from 18th to 15th place in
today's world calf roping standings, a slim $689 ahead of New
Mexico roper Shawn Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   Only the top 15 in each event qualify for the $4.2 million
National Finals Rodeo, scheduled Dec. 4-13 in Las Vegas. The
regular season ends Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 34, attempting to gain his 16th NFR berth, has high
hopes of staying among the elite 15 for the next 1 1/2 weeks. If he
can ride out the bubble and qualify for the NFR, he'll earn a spot
in the record books with the second-most calf roping qualifications
behind former world champion Roy Cooper, who has 18.
</P>
<P>
   If I were a gambler, I'd bet on Johnson. The Henryetta, Okla.,
cowboy has had continued success since turning pro in 1982. The
next year, at 19, he qualified for his first NFR and finished sixth
in that year's world calf roping standings.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 14 years, he was a permanent fixture at the NFR,
and although he has never won a world championship, Johnson
finished as runner-up in '89 to Rabe Rabon. In 1998, Johnson joined
an elite group of cowboys, reaching the million-dollar mark in
career earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Another on-the-bubble-bet might be Aaron Semas, who is
attempting to qualify in bull riding. Semas, 32, from Auburn,
Calif., has a good chance of qualifying for his seventh NFR thanks
to an impressive late-season push at last weekend's Casper (Wyo.)
Season Finale Rodeo. Semas vaulted to 13th in the Crown Royal world
bull riding standings with a $1,552 victory in Casper after scoring
80 points aboard Burns Rodeo Company's Pounder.
</P>
<P>
   Semas has devoted most of his time to competing on the
Professional Bull Riders circuit. But he has placed in enough PRCA
shows, mostly larger rodeos, to gain a top-15 spot.
</P>
<P>
   North Texans who are on the bubble, their rankings and events
include: Ty Murray, Stephenville, 15th, saddle bronc riding;
Gilbert Carrillo, Stephenville, 15th, bull riding; Brian Hawk, Fort
Worth, 15th, bareback riding and Vic Morrison, Bowie, 16th, team
roping heading.
</P>
<P>
   In the season's 11th hour, competitors hope to cash in at bigger
rodeos, such as the Grand National Rodeo at San Francisco's Cow
Palace, scheduled Friday through Sunday and Nov. 4-8, to earn a
berth in the 40th National Finals Rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco show traditionally ranks in the top 10 in
prize money among the PRCA's 750 annual shows. A sure bet: During
finals night on Nov. 8, rodeo competitors on the bubble will learn
their fate.
ON THE CIRCUIT
Courting college rodeo
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth might be in the preliminary stages of roping next
summer's College National Finals Rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   The June championships have been staged in Rapid City, S.D., the
past two years. But the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association
has elected to look for another home after attendance waned.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, NIRA officials met with some of Fort Worth's
prominent rodeo officials, including W.R. Watt Jr., Southwestern
Exposition and Livestock Show Rodeo president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Watt said a committee will approach Fort Worth government
officials next month and ask for financial backing in case the
finals are not profitable in its first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that we have to have somebody in place to
cover a shortfall,'' Watt said. ``However, I don't think we'll even
need to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Watt, who exuded confidence the CNFR can turn a profit in Fort
Worth, said the decision must come soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a lot of time,'' he said. ``Within the next
month, we'll know whether we have it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   If the college finals move to Fort Worth, officials will have
about seven months to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Will Rogers Equestrian Center has a date open in June _ I
understand it's not the exact week that the NIRA would prefer, but
they would be willing to hold it then,'' Watt said.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth's drawing cards are its state-of-the-art Will Rogers
Equestrian Center and its central location. Fort Worth officials
are courting the championships, knowing that finals were successful
in the remote city of Bozeman, Mont., its home for more than two
decades before it moved to Rapid City last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it can be successful in Bozeman, it sure can be successful
in Fort Worth,'' Watt said.
Fund-raiser scheduled
</P>
<P>
   Former Rangers pitcher Nolan Ryan, PRCA commissioner Steve
Hatchell and bootmaker John Justin are scheduled to appear tonight
at Billy Bob's nightclub for a fund-raiser. The gala will benefit
the Justin Cowboy Crisis Fund, which offers financial assistance to
rodeo competitors who have experienced hardship.
Headed to the Hall
</P>
<P>
   Helen Groves, billed as the Grand Dame of the National Cutting
Horse Association, is scheduled to be inducted into the National
Cowgirl Hall of Fame this weekend. Other inductees are Alice
Van-Springsteen, Coronado, Calif., trick rider; Cindy Walker,
Mexia, western song composer; and Mary Nan West, Batesville, stock
show organizer. Posthumous inductees areMaria Martinez, Native
American potter; and Cynthia Ann Parker, Old West pioneer.
THE BUZZ Women's rodeo
</P>
<P>
   Stephenville's J.J. Hampton is expected to enter this weekend's
Women's National Finals Rodeo in Fort Worth leading four
world-title races.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, a multiple title holder, will enter the championships
with an all-around race lead over Dolli Lautaret, $6,093 to $4,250.
Hampton also leads in team roping heading, calf roping and
break-away roping.
</P>
<P>
   The finals, scheduled Friday through Sunday at Cowtown Coliseum,
will help determine the 1998 world champions in the Professional
Women's Rodeo Association. Title races are determined by prize
money earned during the regular season and the finals.
</P>
<P>
   For information, call (817) 625-1025.
PRCA
</P>
<P>
   The Badlands Circuit Finals Rodeo ended Sunday in Rapid City,
earning its champions qualifications for the Dodge National Circuit
Finals Rodeo in March. The DNCFR, held in Pocatello, Idaho, is the
crowning event of the PRCA's circuit system, which comprises 12
geographic regions. Year-end circuit champions and circuit finals
average winners in each of PRCA's 12 circuits qualify to compete at
the DNCFR.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the average titlists at the Badlands Circuit Finals
Rodeo included Ken Lensegrav (Piedmont, S.D.), bareback riding, 218
points on three head, $1,731; Troy Pruitt (Minatare, Neb.), calf
roping, 29.5 seconds on three head, $2,309. In saddle bronc riding,
Red Lemmel of Mud Butte, S.D., and T.C. Holloway of Eagle Butte,
S.D., tied for the average win with 218 points on three horses.
Lemmel earned a rodeo total of $2,021 and Holloway garnered $1,691.
Bull riding
</P>
<P>
   Troy Dunn of Stephenville is among 10 competitors claiming a
North Texas residence who have qualified for the Nov. 6-8
Professional Bull Riders World Championships in Las Vegas. The
others include Ty Murray, Stephenville; J.W. Hart Gainesville; Cody
Hart, Gainesville; Gilbert Carrillo, Stephenville; David Fournier,
Stephenville; Adam Carrillo, Stephenville, Luziano Da Costa, Fort
Worth; Charles Litchfield, Bluffdale; and Tracer Hand, West. Tuff
Hedeman of Morgan Mill qualified, but has declined to compete
because of a neck injury sustained earlier this season.
Colleges update
</P>
<P>
   After competing in three National Intercollegiate Association
Rodeos in the Southern Region, Hill College leads both men's and
women's team title races. Last weekend, Hill's men's team finished
first and it's women finished third at the region's third of 10
rodeos at Uvalde.
Appaloosas
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 800 Appaloosas are expected to compete in the 37th
World Championship Appaloosa Horse Show, Friday through Nov. 7 at
Will Rogers Equestrian Center. Highlights include Sunday'scutting
futurity and the Nov. 6 freestyle reining class.
High schools
</P>
<P>
   After winning the break-away roping title at the Texas High
School Rodeo Association Region III show last weekend in Decatur,
Mindy Elrod leads the title race with 29 points. Kory Gant leads
the bareback riding title with 27.5
</P>
<P>
   after finishing second at Decatur, the third of 10
regular-season shows.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing first at last weekend's Richland High School
Rodeo in Saginaw, Northwest leads the North Texas High School Rodeo
Association team title race over Boswell, 2,447 to 2,250.
Northwest's Brandon Henderson leads the steer wrestling race after
finishing second last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley Harter's boys all-around victory at the Richland Rodeo
helped the Aledo cowboy take the lead in the race over Clint Akins,
975.5 to 965. Mary Margaret Richter has a commanding girls
all-around lead over Mansfield's Karly Newborn, 1,209 to 800.

QB SAYS QUICK EXIT AFTER HOOK NOT TRUE 
</HEADLINE>
  ST-NOTEBOOK-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chad Elliott said he didn't go away mad, he just went away.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott started at quarterback for Arizona State last week
against Stanford, then came out for the guy he replaced, Ryan
Kealy. That much is known. Not so certain is what happened after
the game. Allegedly, Elliott was so upset that he quickly left the
field instead of celebrating the Kealy-led, 44-38 overtime victory.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people got the wrong impression,'' he said
Tuesday. ``I was taken out of the game, and I think people tend to
look for negative things. They saw me running off the field,
thinking I was upset or mad or whatever. That's not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``What actually happened was, I walked over and talked to Randy
Fasani, their quarterback who lived close to me in Sacramento. I
told him he played a good game. He actually caught a pass against
us, playing tight end. I congratulated Ryan, gave him a hug, went
to the locker room and took my shower. People tend to make things
out of situations that aren't really there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Elliott did concede that he was steamed over being taken out
late in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I should have been pulled at that time,'' he
said. ``Obviously, I wasn't playing that good, but I don't think I
was playing bad enough to be taken out. But that's what the coaches
decided to do, so you have to live with that.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first collegiate start, Elliott, a redshirt freshman, was
8 for 17 for 92 yards and an interception. But Coach Bruce Snyder
said he was not disappointed in the way Elliott played. Kealy, who
will start Saturday at Washington State, was 8 for 15 for 153 yards
(two of the incompletions were spikes) and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, who changed high schools to give himself a better
chance at a scholarship, said he plans to remain a Sun Devil.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are rumors, just like the thing about me running off the
field,'' he said. ``But I'm going to stay around. I'm just happy
the team's back on track and focusing on Washington State.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott said he and Snyder met to discuss ``where each other
stood,'' and things are fine between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked each other some questions because we were a little
iffy on some areas,'' he said. ``But I think it worked out good.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Trying out the turf &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because Washington State's Martin Stadium has artificial turf,
this is the first week the Sun Devils are using their new,
Astroturf practice field. It came in handy earlier in the week,
when it rained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Sunday it was wet and windy with the storms that went
through, and it gave us perfect conditions to practice in for this
game,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the weather, we wouldn't have gotten as much
accomplished with the turf. We became much more comfortable with
the turf shoes and the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   But not without a footwear adjustment. The team came out in the
wrong kind of shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The plastic grass also served another purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also saved our grass fields, because in the wet and muddy
weather, we really would have torn them up,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I like Astroturf on a regular basis? That's another story.
But so far, it has really served its purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The 70-yard field, located southeast of the two grass fields at
the Bill Kajikawa practice facility, cost $400,000. It was a gift
from an anonymous donor. &QL; 
 &QL; 
J.R. hurting &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Tuesday was any indication, it doesn't look good for tailback
J.R. Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, nursing an ankle sprain, rode the bike and ran a
little, but did not participate in drills during what is usually
the most intense practice day of the week.
</P>
<P>
   He is second in the Pac-10 in rushing and third nationally in
all-purpose yardage.
</P>
<P>
   Another starter, safety Christon Rance, also was limited during
practice and is questionable for the game. &QL; 
 &QL; 
National leader &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt freshman Stephen Baker leads the nation in punting with
a 47.4-yard average. That ranks as the second-highest average in
conference history. ASU is eighth in the nation in net punting,
with a 40.5-yard average. &QL;

TYSON A NO-SHOW AT LOCAL GYM  
 BOXER'S TRAINING SCHEDULE INTERRUPTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Tyson has fights in court but none in the ring on his
schedule, which did not include an expected resumption of training
Tuesday at Phoenix's Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson left his equipment at the downtown gym 13 days ago amid
plans of returning for an extended stay in preparation for his
first fight since biting Evander Holyfield's ears on June 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment is still there. But there's been no word from
either the former heavyweight champ or his ever-changing entourage
about his plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard anything,'' said gym owner Richard Rodriquez,
who said he was told by Tyson that he would return not long after
the Nevada Athletic Commission agreed to re-instate his license.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ricardo, also of Madison Square Graden, said he been told
by Tyson that he would return Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Without a firm date for a fight, however, there's little reason
for Tyson to begin serious training. His absence Tuesday would seem
to eliminate any possibility of a bout Dec. 5, which had been
widely speculated throughout his five-day stay in the Valley and
during his re-licensing hearing 10 days ago at Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   He probably would need six weeks to two months to prepare for
his first bout in nearly a year and a half. If he had begun working
Tuesday for a Dec. 5 bout, he would have had five weeks and three
days to get ready.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tyson's legal problems continued to mount. On Monday,
he was sued in Las Vegas by a police officer, Thomas Moyer, who
charges Tyson hit him during a melee seconds after his
disqualification for biting Holyfield. Moyer, an off-duty member of
a security team at the time, alleges Tyson struck him in the chest.
The suit asks for unspecified damages for physical pain and mental
anguish.
</P>
<P>
   The Moyer suit is on top of a potentially more serious legal
problem for Tyson, who already owes the Internal Revenue Service
$13 million and at least $7 million to former trainer Kevin Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Maryland has decided to proceed with misdemeanor
assault charges against him in a trial Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is alleged to have assaulted two middle-aged men after an
auto accident Aug. 31. A Tyson attorney said an out-of-court
settlement with the two men was likely. But the state decided to
proceed with charges because of Tyson's criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   He is on probation through March on a rape conviction. If he is
found guilty Dec. 1, he could be sent back to prison. &QL;

   SAN JOSE _ When Cliff Ronning checked into the Hilton Hotel in
San Jose last March, his name was swirling amid trade rumors that
proved to be bogus.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say his comfort zone was much improved on Tuesday,
when the team checked into the hotel for tonight's 8:30 meeting
with the Sharks at San Jose Arena on the heels of a 5-1 win over
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   He finished last season third on the team in scoring with 55
points, including a team-leading 44 assists, despite bouncing
between the second and third lines, depending upon whether Jeremy
Roenick played center or wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy I'm getting an opportunity to help us win
games,'' said Ronning, 33. ``It's definitely more satisfying when
you feel that you're really a contributor on a winning team.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, with Roenick firmly entrenched as the first-line
center and Craig Janney shipped off to Tampa Bay, Ronning is
centering the No. 2 line with Greg Adams and Rick Tocchet as his
wings.
</P>
<P>
   The team can't complain about the production it is getting from
the top two lines. The Coyotes have five players tied for the team
scoring lead with six points. All are members of the top two lines,
including first-line mates Keith Tkachuk, Roenick and Dallas Drake,
plus Ronning and Tocchet, both of whom have two goals and four
assists.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of top-six production the Coyotes are going to
need if they hope to better last season's 35-35-12 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is we're just starting to develop
cohesiveness as a line,'' Ronning said. ``We're getting used to
each other's habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is that we come out and be steady in every
game. We can be a backbone for the first line if we can just remain
consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   The only missing element at the moment, at least in terms of
scoring production, has been that of left wing Adams, a consistent
20- to 30-goal scorer during his career who has just one assist in
the first six games.
</P>
<P>
   Ronning, however, said there is no reason to doubt Adams'
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing hard,'' Ronning said. ``In fact, Gus (Adams'
nickname) does a lot of the dirty work that nobody really sees.
It's Gus who is digging out the puck and getting it to me and Rick
and setting up our shots or passes. I've been in the league long
enough to know before long it will be me or Rick who is down there
digging and getting the puck to Greg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a matter of time. Greg's the kind of guy who will
start scoring goals in bunches when he gets going.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronning, like the Coyotes, returns to a city where he has
enjoyed great success. He has scored 44 points against the Sharks,
topped only by the 50 he has scored against Los Angeles and 45 he
has against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes have a 7-1 record against the Sharks in their past
eight games, outscoring them, 34-14, with Tkachuk (17 points) and
Ronning (11) leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix was 4-0 against San Jose last season, with Tkachuk
scoring eight points and Ronning five.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Jose hasn't won yet (0-4-2) and will be fighting for its
life,'' Ronning said. &QL;

TYSON A NO-SHOW AT LOCAL GYM  
 BOXER'S TRAINING SCHEDULE INTERRUPTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Tyson has fights in court but none in the ring on his
schedule, which did not include an expected resumption of training
Tuesday at Phoenix's Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson left his equipment at the downtown gym 13 days ago amid
plans of returning for an extended stay in preparation for his
first fight since biting Evander Holyfield's ears on June 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment is still there. But there's been no word from
either the former heavyweight champ or his ever-changing entourage
about his plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard anything,'' said gym owner Richard Rodriquez,
who said he was told by Tyson that he would return not long after
the Nevada Athletic Commission agreed to re-instate his license.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ricardo, also of Madison Square Graden, said he been told
by Tyson that he would return Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Without a firm date for a fight, however, there's little reason
for Tyson to begin serious training. His absence Tuesday would seem
to eliminate any possibility of a bout Dec. 5, which had been
widely speculated throughout his five-day stay in the Valley and
during his re-licensing hearing 10 days ago at Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   He probably would need six weeks to two months to prepare for
his first bout in nearly a year and a half. If he had begun working
Tuesday for a Dec. 5 bout, he would have had five weeks and three
days to get ready.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tyson's legal problems continued to mount. On Monday,
he was sued in Las Vegas by a police officer, Thomas Moyer, who
charges Tyson hit him during a melee seconds after his
disqualification for biting Holyfield. Moyer, an off-duty member of
a security team at the time, alleges Tyson struck him in the chest.
The suit asks for unspecified damages for physical pain and mental
anguish.
</P>
<P>
   The Moyer suit is on top of a potentially more serious legal
problem for Tyson, who already owes the Internal Revenue Service
$13 million and at least $7 million to former trainer Kevin Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Maryland has decided to proceed with misdemeanor
assault charges against him in a trial Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is alleged to have assaulted two middle-aged men after an
auto accident Aug. 31. A Tyson attorney said an out-of-court
settlement with the two men was likely. But the state decided to
proceed with charges because of Tyson's criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   He is on probation through March on a rape conviction. If he is
found guilty Dec. 1, he could be sent back to prison. &QL;

QB SAYS QUICK EXIT AFTER HOOK NOT TRUE 
</HEADLINE>
  ST-NOTEBOOK-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chad Elliott said he didn't go away mad, he just went away.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott started at quarterback for Arizona State last week
against Stanford, then came out for the guy he replaced, Ryan
Kealy. That much is known. Not so certain is what happened after
the game. Allegedly, Elliott was so upset that he quickly left the
field instead of celebrating the Kealy-led, 44-38 overtime victory.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people got the wrong impression,'' he said
Tuesday. ``I was taken out of the game, and I think people tend to
look for negative things. They saw me running off the field,
thinking I was upset or mad or whatever. That's not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``What actually happened was, I walked over and talked to Randy
Fasani, their quarterback who lived close to me in Sacramento. I
told him he played a good game. He actually caught a pass against
us, playing tight end. I congratulated Ryan, gave him a hug, went
to the locker room and took my shower. People tend to make things
out of situations that aren't really there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Elliott did concede that he was steamed over being taken out
late in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I should have been pulled at that time,'' he
said. ``Obviously, I wasn't playing that good, but I don't think I
was playing bad enough to be taken out. But that's what the coaches
decided to do, so you have to live with that.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first collegiate start, Elliott, a redshirt freshman, was
8 for 17 for 92 yards and an interception. But Coach Bruce Snyder
said he was not disappointed in the way Elliott played. Kealy, who
will start Saturday at Washington State, was 8 for 15 for 153 yards
(two of the incompletions were spikes) and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, who changed high schools to give himself a better
chance at a scholarship, said he plans to remain a Sun Devil.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are rumors, just like the thing about me running off the
field,'' he said. ``But I'm going to stay around. I'm just happy
the team's back on track and focusing on Washington State.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott said he and Snyder met to discuss ``where each other
stood,'' and things are fine between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked each other some questions because we were a little
iffy on some areas,'' he said. ``But I think it worked out good.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Trying out the turf &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because Washington State's Martin Stadium has artificial turf,
this is the first week the Sun Devils are using their new,
Astroturf practice field. It came in handy earlier in the week,
when it rained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Sunday it was wet and windy with the storms that went
through, and it gave us perfect conditions to practice in for this
game,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the weather, we wouldn't have gotten as much
accomplished with the turf. We became much more comfortable with
the turf shoes and the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   But not without a footwear adjustment. The team came out in the
wrong kind of shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The plastic grass also served another purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also saved our grass fields, because in the wet and muddy
weather, we really would have torn them up,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I like Astroturf on a regular basis? That's another story.
But so far, it has really served its purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The 70-yard field, located southeast of the two grass fields at
the Bill Kajikawa practice facility, cost $400,000. It was a gift
from an anonymous donor. &QL; 
 &QL; 
J.R. hurting &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Tuesday was any indication, it doesn't look good for tailback
J.R. Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, nursing an ankle sprain, rode the bike and ran a
little, but did not participate in drills during what is usually
the most intense practice day of the week.
</P>
<P>
   He is second in the Pac-10 in rushing and third nationally in
all-purpose yardage.
</P>
<P>
   Another starter, safety Christon Rance, also was limited during
practice and is questionable for the game. &QL; 
 &QL; 
National leader &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt freshman Stephen Baker leads the nation in punting with
a 47.4-yard average. That ranks as the second-highest average in
conference history. ASU is eighth in the nation in net punting,
with a 40.5-yard average. &QL;

NEWS CLIP FROM NG TRIAL SHOCKS SURVIVORS 
</HEADLINE>
 NG-TRIAL)   By HARRIET CHIANG  
 and JONATHAN CURIEL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard and Sharon O'Connor turned on the local news Monday
night to find out what had happened in the trial of Charles Ng,
charged with murdering their daughter and grandson in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   What they saw was a videotape of their daughter, Brenda, bound
to a chair, terrified and helpless, as her captors threatened to
rape and murder her. No one _ least of all the prosecutors in Ng's
trial _ had warned them it was coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God,'' Richard O'Connor cried as he and his wife
collapsed into tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were shocked,'' O'Connor said Tuesday from his home in
Coldwater, Mich. ``Not seeing your daughter all those years and
then seeing her in the chair. Here it comes on at 11 o'clock and
(Ng) is cutting the blouse off my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge at Ng's trial allowed the media in for opening
statements, so the videos of Brenda O'Connor and another victim,
Kathleen Allen, were fair game for TV stations to show. Whether
their decision to do so was ethical or moral was a subject of much
debate Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda O'Connor was 20 years old when she disappeared with her
husband and 2-year-old son in 1985. In the tape, shown in Orange
County Superior Court and on television stations across the
country, Ng's alleged partner, Leonard Lake, tells her, ``You will
work for us, you will cook for us, you will f _ for us . . . or
we'll take you outside, rape you and shoot you.''
</P>
<P>
   The O'Connors' shock at seeing their daughter quickly turned to
anger. They complained to the local station in Kalamazoo and were
no more happy with the Ng prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have shown a little decency in calling us up and
saying, `Mr. O'Connor, there's going to be something on the 11
o'clock news,' '' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Dan Lungren, whose office is part of the
prosecution team, did not respond to phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible intrusion on the surviving family
members,'' said Peter Arenella, a criminal law professor at the
University of California at Los Angeles, who has written about
television distorting the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Arenella said a responsible news station could have given a
brief description of the videotape without showing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me this is being done purely for the shock value and the
appeal to people's prurient interest,'' Arenella said. ``It's
unhealthy and adds to this trend that we now have in using criminal
trials as entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Television news directors said it was a hard call to make. Some
stations showed only portions of the tape or blurred victims'
faces.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Francisco Bay Area, KPIX-TV decided to broadcast
excerpts because they ``are germane to what the prosecution was
saying, which was whether or not Ng could be connected to the
killings,'' said the station's news director, Daniel Webster.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to that,'' Webster said, ``even though it's not
pleasant, it demonstrates the severity and horrific aspect to the
crime. . . . We're about putting out good, accurate, truthful
information. Sometimes, that isn't always terribly pleasant
information. It's the definition of news.''
</P>
<P>
   Webster said the station had received some calls voicing concern
about its decision.
</P>
<P>
   KRON-TV did not show Ng cutting away O'Connor's shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of discussion about it,'' said Dan Rosenheim,
KRON-TV's news director. ``Someone in our news department said that
it was almost like showing a snuff film on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we even showed less than what normal prudence would
dictate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   KGO-TV did not broadcast any of the tapes, calling them
``objectionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Even veteran journalists who staunchly defend freedom of the
press anguished over the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm torn that this video exists where people, through no fault
of their own, are seen in horrifying circumstances,'' said Joe
Saltzman, associate director of the University of Southern
California's School of Journalism. ``But as a journalist, I don't
like anyone telling me what I can and what I can't see.''
</P>
<P>
   Saltzman, who has produced award-winning documentaries for CBS
and covered the Vietnam War, said matters of taste become ``a
minefield of disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why blame the news media?'' he said. ``Blame this horrible
rapist killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Keane, the chief attorney in the San Francisco public
defender's office, who is defending Ng on a separate murder charge
here, said there is no reason to show such powerful scenes to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're seeing someone in that kind of distress with a total
sense of hopelessness, terror and anxiety,'' Keane said. ``And you
combine it with her anxiety for her baby _ it was gut-wrenching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To show that is to exploit the most poignant aspect of human
terror,'' he said. &QL;

DIARY IN NG TRIAL REVEALS DETAILS IN SLAYINGS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL WALLACE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SANTA ANA, Calif. _ Leonard Lake, who allegedly helped plot and
execute the 12 murders for which Charles Ng is standing trial, kept
a diary in which the mundane details of his life were recorded
alongside his plan to turn women into sexual slaves.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The journal was mentioned during opening statements when Ng's
trial began Monday. Ng's defense team has said it plans to use the
document to prove Ng was a bystander in the serial murders, while
Lake, who committed suicide shortly after his arrest in June 1985,
did the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have indicated they may introduce portions of the
journal to demonstrate Ng's involvement in at least one of the
slayings. Ng's trial was recessed Tuesday because a juror was sick.
</P>
<P>
   The diary _ more than a hundred pages of typed and hand-written
entries made in 1983 and 1984 _ provides a portrait of an obsessive
individual who did not consider himself subject to society's legal
or moral strictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a dangerous person,'' Lake wrote. ``Society would be
worried if they knew that I existed and what I was up to.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series of entries, he recalls how he and Ng stalked and
murdered Paul Cosner, a San Francisco auto broker who is one of the
12 people Ng is charged with killing.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the document, Lake demonstrates his obsession with
the sexual subjugation of women. Yet the journal is also remarkable
for its near-lack of emotional content.
</P>
<P>
   Lake's descriptions of how he selected and stalked potential
sexual slaves, built a bondage cell to imprison them and planned
and committed murder is just as flat as when he recounts doing his
laundry, shopping or watching television reruns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This book is really more of a log,'' he wrote in early 1983.
``With few exceptions, the reader will not find any great thoughts
or deep studies within (it). . . . The depth of my sins are not
recorded.''
</P>
<P>
   In some entries, Lake discusses his ``ops'' _ criminal
operations such as stealing marijuana from rural pot plantations,
selling the drug to raise money for his sexual slavery scheme and
targeting ``betas,'' Lake's code word for potential homicide
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Some sections concern Lake's ``Miranda Project,'' a sexual
slavery scheme inspired by John Fowles' thriller ``The Collector.''
The female protagonist of Fowles' book is a woman named Miranda who
is kidnapped and held as a bondage slave by a sexual psychopath.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 19, 1983, Lake wrote: `` `The Collector,' ah, `The
Collector.' Has it really been 20 years I have carried this
fantasy?''
</P>
<P>
   In an entry early in 1984, Lake describes his work in
constructing a bondage cell at his rural hideaway near Wilseyville
in Calaveras County.
</P>
<P>
   ``1983 was the year of Miranda,'' he wrote. ``Started (and
abandoned) in Humboldt County and restarted here. M is a serious
underground construction meant to: 1) Provide a physical setting
for my sexual fantasies. 2) Provide physical security for myself
and my possessions. 3) Provide limited protection from nuclear
fallout.''
</P>
<P>
   He concludes the passage by writing that how the chamber will
work as a bondage cell ``is unknown until the facility is
operational and something happens.''
</P>
<P>
   In some of the most chilling entries, Lake appears to
dispassionately describe how he and Ng picked Cosner as the target
of a Nov. 2, 1984, abduction and murder.
</P>
<P>
   Cosner's body has never been found, but investigators believe he
was abducted, possibly from his Marina District home, and shot to
death. Lake was driving Cosner's Honda at the time of his arrest in
South San Francisco, and some of the missing man's personal effects
_ including bank and credit cards _ were found in Wilseyville.
</P>
<P>
   ``25 Oct.,'' Lake wrote. ``Slow day. Went to SF . . .
Considering new operation. Loot, ID, vehicles, beta (murder
victim). Unfortunately, will need Charlie.''
</P>
<P>
   After checking on an ad Cosner had run offering a 1980 Honda
Prelude, Lake wrote: ``31 Oct. Nothing day. Spent day making calls
and checking out potential ops. New Beta. Honda Prelude with owner
that could pass for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``1 Nov. Nothing day. Called Beta and arranged to pay him $500
tomorrow night. To meet Charlie tomorrow noon and make plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``2 Nov. Met Charlie. Performed op. Met resistance for first
time, Unsuccessful in obtaining credit card or bank codes. Drove to
country for completion. Canceled Charlie's running debt to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Two entries after his description of the ``Beta op'' on the
owner of the Honda Prelude, Lake's diary reverts to his daily
activities, as if the incident had never occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``4 Nov.,'' he wrote. ``Spent whole day cleaning house and
putting my stuff away. Laundry, shopping, basic coming home stuff.
(It is) good to be home.'' &QL;

GAYS, RIGHT SNUB FONG'S UNITY TACTIC 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLA MARINUCCI  
 and JOHN WILDERMUTH  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    Attempts by GOP Senate candidate Matt Fong to ``unify'' gay
groups and the religious right backfired Tuesday as groups on each
side accused him of selling out to the other.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fong's unprecedented decision to sign a written pledge of
support for gay issues, reported in Tuesday's Chronicle, drew angry
responses from some conservative Christian groups over his
``apparent sellout of family values.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think that a person like Matt Fong would stand on
his principles and not have been forced to bend down and sign a
statement that goes against his beliefs,'' said Randy Thomasson,
political director at the conservative Capitol Resource Institute
in Sacramento. ``It seems pretty obvious that Matt Fong has either
changed his beliefs _ or is now showing us what he really
believes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike German, who heads the San Francisco Log Cabin Republicans,
was equally unforgiving of Fong's $50,000 donation to the
conservative Traditional Values Coalition, headed by the Rev. Lou
Sheldon, who has railed against the ``immoral homosexual agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps Matt Fong should find refuge in the Bible, if he's
going to use it as a source,'' said German. ``A man cannot serve
two masters.''
</P>
<P>
   With less than a week before the election, Fong's attempt to
appease both sides on one of the nation's hottest political issues
is a setback in his campaign to unseat Democratic Sen. Barbara
Boxer. The controversy battered his carefully crafted image as a
moderate and undercut his argument that _ unlike Boxer _ he is ``a
unifier, not a divider.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong, in San Francisco for a Chinatown fund-raiser, did not talk
about Sheldon Tuesday, but an aide dismissed the complaints from
conservative religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to a lot of conservative leaders today, and they're
all with Matt down the stretch,'' said Steve Schmidt, a spokesman
for Fong. ``They know that Matt Fong is a man of principle . . .
who wants to listen to both sides before he makes a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP strategists agreed that the Sheldon flap is unlikely to send
Republican conservatives fleeing to Boxer, whom they have been
anxious to send packing for six years, but they expressed concern
about the effect it will have on Fong's campaign plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that keeps you from getting your message out is a
problem, and this is a distraction,'' said one Republican
consultant. ``It's a real fluid race, and anything could change the
way it's going.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy began during the weekend, after Fong
acknowledged his $50,000 gift to Sheldon's anti-gay, anti-abortion
organization which, among other things, has advocated quarantine of
AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   The angry response from GOP gays and lesbians prompted Fong on
Monday to sign an unprecedented written pledge to support the
California Log Cabin Republicans on a wide range of gay issues,
including AIDS research, domestic partnership and
anti-discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   That pleased national and state Log Cabin Republicans, who said
Fong had proved himself to be a peacemaker and ``big tent''
Republican, but it failed to soothe the activist San Francisco
chapter, which has clashed often with Sheldon.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps far more damaging to Fong's election hopes, it was
received badly by conservative Republicans who support family
values legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly has stirred up Christians, as far as
disappointment is concerned,'' said David Spady, executive director
of the California Christian Coalition. ``These are people who
worked very hard to gather signatures for the Defense of Marriage
Act, and certainly our organization is opposed to special rights
for sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to contact Sheldon were unsuccessful, but Thomasson of
the Capitol Resource Institute said his nonpartisan family values
advocacy organization was ``deluged'' by angry conservatives who
were ``shocked, angry and disappointed at this apparent sellout of
family values.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of the candidates is supporting traditional family
values. Both support the homosexual agenda,'' he said. ``And that
goes against what people want for their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative voters, he said, ``are today almost as disappointed
with Matt Fong's pro-homosexual ideals as we are with Barbara
Boxer's loud and vivid pro-homosexual agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomasson said that if Fong's strategy was to court gays and
lesbians at the expense of conservative and evangelical voters _ a
block of several hundred thousand crucial state voters who are
unlikely to defect to Boxer, he has made a critical mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``No candidate can afford to take California families for
granted,'' Thomasson said. ``We do have principles that are
obviously higher than many of the candidates'.''

<P>
   1. ANNETTE BENING : DOING STARDOM HER WAY Actress Annette Bening
is also the wife of Warren Beatty and mother of his three children.
As she prepares for the opening of her new film ``The Siege,''
Bening talks about the film's controversial plot (involving Arab
terrorists and a hardline U.S. Army general,) how she manages to
juggle film stardom and motherhood, and why she thinks Hollywood's
obsession with age is unfair to women and to movies themselves. By
Ian Spelling. 1,400 words + photo. 2. PHIL COLLINS INTERVIEW : ``MY
LIFE AS A MOLE'' Pop singer Phil Collins discusses abuse from
critics, the worldwide success of his songs and the reasons why he
lives in Switzerland. By Wolfang Hoebel and Christoph Dallach. From
Der Spiegel. English translation available. Q&AMP;A format. 1,400
words. 3. OPERA'S DYNAMIC DUO Even for La Scala in Milan, home to
the world's most zealous opera fans, the booing suffered by soprano
Renee Fleming and tenor Marcello Giordani was remarkable. Here is
how two of opera's shinng stars survived the performance of
``Lucrezia Borgia'' and how they intend to scale the heights this
autumn. By Kevin West and Alessandra Ilari. From W magazine. 1,000
words + photo. 4. HECTOR ELIZONDO : KEEPING 'HOPE' ALIVE Hector
Elizondo has been nominated for four Emmys (winning one) for his
hit television show, ``Chicago Hope,'' and is as popular as ever in
movies, making him arguably America's most visible Hispanic actor.
Elizondo talks about the series, how fame has changed his life, why
he's about to begin his 11th film with director Garry Marshall and
what we should look for when he co-stars with Julia Roberts and
Richard Gere in ``Runaway Bride,'' (the not-quite-sequel to
``Pretty Woman.'') By Andrew Ryan. From Canadian TV Guide. 1,000
words + photo. 5. STAN TUCCI INTERVIEW ``As soon as somebody says,
``Don't do it the way you want to,'' I say, ``See you later,''
actor Stanley Tucci explains in his mellifluous voice that helped
make him so creepily convincing as suspected murderer Richard Cross
on television's ``Murder One.'' Tucci's roles have ranged from
Italian villain to the dogcatcher in ``Beethoven,'' Demi Moore's
husband in ``Deconstructing Harry,'' and an assassin in ``The
Pelican Brief.'' In this interview he talks about his two latest
starring roles. By Louise Farr. From W magazine. 1,600 words +
photo. 6. JOHN FRANKENHEIMER INTERVIEW According to John
Frankenheimer, the career of a Hollywood director goes through
three distinct phases : ``You go from the stage when people say,
'Who is John Frankenheimer?' to 'OK, we'll take a chance on
Frankenheimer' to 'Get Frankenheimer!'' Finally, however comes a
fourth : ``Get me a younger John Frankenheimer.'' The veteran
director (responsible for such major films as ``Birdman of
Alcatraz'' and ``The Manchurian Candidate,'') now returns with
``Ronin.'' Filmed in France, it is a suspense thriller that follows
a band of former Cold War operatives. ``The movie is about
betrayal, which in today's society is a very important subject,''
Frankenheimer says. By Natasha Fraser-Cavassoni. From W magazine.
1,000 words + photo.

ANDREAS VOLLENWEIDER'S HARPS OF MANY VOICES Swiss harpist Andreas
Vollenweider is on his first solo tour but takes with him enough
instruments to supply a large orchestra, including gothic harp,
Celtic harp, kora (African harp,) cheng (Chinese harp,) wind
chimes, gongs, piano, accordion, flute, saxophone. This New Age
pioneer even plays tuned salad bowls. By Steve Morse. From The
Boston Globe. 700 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 8.
TODD SOLONDZ'S PRESCRIPTION FOR 'HAPPINESS' ``Happiness'' may be
the most ironic movie title of the '90s. This controversial film is
a bleak, unsparing and yet relentlessly comic look at several
citizens of New Jersey whose lives are defined by sexuality.
Director Todd Solondz says he prefers the expression ``sad comedy''
to ``black comedy,'' but ``Happiness'' is about as dark as they
come .... By Joshua Mooney. BPI. 1,000 words + photo. 9. SHARON
STONE: UNGLAMOROUS IN 'THE MIGHTY' For her newest film, ``The
Mighty,'' Sharon Stone agreed to appear as an unglamorous
working-class mother, so enchanted was she by the story of two
handicapped boys who share a love for the King Arthur legend. Stone
discusses the film, (which she produced,) as well as her marriage
to San Francisco journalist Phil Bronstein. By Ivor Davis. 1,000
words + photos. (N/A Great Britain and Australia.) Please fax to

 &HT;    
 By AMY WALDMAN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The runners of the New York Marathon may be masochistic, but
they are not stupid: They run in the fall. After all, if you are
going to see the five boroughs as a blur while gasping for breath,
you might as well do it when the colors are crisp and the air
brisk.
 &HT;    Attitudes are brisk, too: When the heat leaves, the locals
return, their hunger to master the universe recharged.
 &HT;    The roaring '90s continue in New York, and in an appropriately
fin de siecle paradox, the city is both prospering and
deteriorating.
 &HT;    The proof is in the number of buildings going up _ witness the
construction boom around Times Square _ and the number falling
down, as suggested by a recent report calling for $90 billion in
infrastucture fixes in the city (and by the bricks peeling off old
buildings and onto the streets below).
 &HT;    The one adjective that does not apply to New York is static.
Neighborhoods molt and acquire new identities so fast that you can
blink and miss the metamorphoses.
 &HT;    The downtown commercial art scene is moving to Chelsea, while
young designers are forsaking SoHo for NoLIta, north of Little
Italy. Brooklyn and Queens, too, have taken on new cachet, as
places both to live and to visit.
 &HT;    After summer's lazy dress rehearsal, fall is when the show
begins, literally, with a new cultural season. There is a
head-spinning selection of art, theater, music and dance.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Two of the 20th century's greatest Abstract Expressionists are
the subjects of big retrospectives this fall.
 &HT;    Mark Rothko's early Surrealist works and color-saturated
canvases are on view in ``Mark Rothko: A Retrospective,'' at the
Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Ave., at 75th Street,
through Nov. 29.
 &HT;    This year the Whitney also opened 11 intimate galleries focusing
on art from 1900 to 1950. Open Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and
Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Thursday from 1 to 8 p.m.
Admission is $9; (212) 570-3676.
 &HT;    ``Jackson Pollock: A Retrospective,'' from Nov. 1 to Feb. 2 at
the Museum of Modern Art, at 11 West 53d St., is the first
retrospective of Pollock's work since 1967, and covers his entire
career. Open daily except Wednesday 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., and to
8:30 p.m. on Friday. Admission: $9.50; (212) 708-9400.
 &HT;    So far, this Broadway season offers no new spectacle like the
``Lion King'' or must-have ticket like ``Cabaret.''
 &HT;    At Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater, Harold Prince is
directing ``Parade,'' a new musical based on the true story of Leo
Frank, a Jewish factory worker accused of murdering a 13-year-old
girl in Georgia in 1913. Previews begin Nov. 12. Tickets: $50 to
$75; (212) 239-6200.
 &HT;    Dance assumes center stage in several productions.
``Footloose,'' the 1984 movie about the standoff between a
small-town preacher and a high-stepping outsider, is now a Broadway
musical, co-written and directed by Walter Bobbie, who won a Tony
for his direction of ``Chicago.'' It's at the Richard Rodgers, 226
West 46th St. Tickets: $20 to $75; (212) 307-4100.
 &HT;    And ``Swan Lake'' came to Broadway this month in a version by
Matthew Bourne, the British choreographer and director, at the Neil
Simon Theater at 250 West 52d Street. The production won raves in
London and Los Angeles. The twist: all the dancers are men _
wearing feathery pantaloons, not tutus. Tickets: $15 to $75; (212)
307-4100.
 &HT;    The most controversial ticket of the season promises to be
``Corpus Christi'' by Terrence McNally, starring an as yet unknown
actor, Anson Mount.
 &HT;    The play centers on a gay Jesus-like figure and was briefly
called off earlier this year after protests by the Catholic League
and anonymous bomb threats. A Manhattan Theater Club production, it
is at City Center, 131 West 55th St. Tickets are $50; (212)
581-1212.
 &HT;    In early December, the Brooklyn Philharmonic performs a
semistaged version of ``Powder Her Face,'' a new opera by the
English composer Thomas Ades about the life of Margaret, Duchess of
Argyll, whose sensational divorce rocked England in the 1960s. At
the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theater, Dec. 8, 10, and
12. Tickets: $20 to $45; (212) 307-4100.
 &HT;    On Nov. 12 and 14, at Alice Tully Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center
presents ``Blues Up and Down: A Battle in the Bucket,'' with jazz
elder statesmen like Teddy Edwards and Al Grey trying to outdo
younger talents like Cyrus Chestnut and Nicholas Payton. Tickets:
$37.50; (212) 721-6500.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The Lower East Side Tenement Museum offers one-hour historical
walking tours of a neighborhood that is gentrifying faster than a
New York apartment rents.
 &HT;    The tours leave from 90 Orchard St. and run weekends at 1:30 and
2: 30 p.m. through December; tickets $8. The museum also offers
frequent tours of its Tenement House, an 1863 building with
recreated apartments as they would have been during the 1870s,
1916, and the 1930s; (212) 431-0233.
 &HT;    There is no better time than fall to explore Fort Tryon Park,
which is also home to the rich medieval offerings of the Cloisters,
the upper Manhattan branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 &HT;    The only thing missing is the Unicorn tapestries, which have
been removed until January while the museum undergoes renovations.
Open Tuesday to Sunday, 9:30 a.m. until 5:15 p.m. through October,
to 4:45 p.m. after November. Admission: $8; (212) 923-3700.
 &HT;    The Wollman Rink in Central Park opened for ice skating on Oct.
15. With buildings rising like castle spires behind the trees,
there are few more magical settings for exercise _ north of the
entrance at Central Park South and Avenue of the Americas.
Admission: $4; (212) 396-9203.
 &HT;    In Chelsea, the West 20s between 10th Avenue and the Hudson
River have filled with dozens of galleries. You can start an
informal walking tour at the Dia Center for the Arts, at 548 West
22d St., now showing works by Robert Irwin and Joseph Beuys, and
then meander through the surrounding blocks.
 &HT;    The shops of NoLIta, the surreally quiet, oddly self-contained
blocks of Elizabeth, Mulberry and Mott between Spring and Houston,
seem made as much for looking as for buying. Stores include a glass
blower (Michael Anchin, at 250 Elizabeth St.), a milliner (Kelly
Christy, at 235 Elizabeth St.), and nearly two dozen eclectic
clothing stores.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Many hotels offer weekend specials or even discounted regular
rates, but occupancy rates in New York are so high _ 83 percent
this year _ that reservations are important. These hotels are
either new or recently renovated:
 &HT;    One look at the green carpet and the portrait of Mary McAlees,
the president of Ireland, on the wall, and you'll get the theme at
the Fitzpatrick Grand Central Hotel, which opened in August at 141
East 44th Street; (212) 351-6800, fax (212) 818-1747. The rooms are
not green, but tastefully decorated with canopied beds. Doubles
start at $325.
 &HT;    The Roger Williams, 131 Madison Ave., at 31st Street, was built
around 1928 but was thoroughly renovated last fall. Its sleek,
modern lobby includes a 20-foot atrium, and its 209 minimalist
rooms are done in white and beige with blond wood, and equipped
with CD players and VCRs. Doubles from $245; (212) 448-7000; fax:
(212) 448-7007.
 &HT;    The Algonquin, 59 West 44th St., (212) 840-6800; fax (212)
944-1419, finished a major renovation this year with an accent on
nostalgia. The lobby has been darkened to evoke an air of
antiquity, and the halls have been wallpapered with New Yorker
cartoons, a self-conscious reminder of the hotel's history as a
literary gathering place.
 &HT;    The Rose Room has been absorbed into the lobby, but the Round
Table remains. Guest rooms retain an old New York feel, with pewter
blue and cream decor, antiques, and headboards carved of dark wood.
Doubles: $329.
 &HT;    Budget: The Bentley Hotel, 500 East 62d St., (212) 644-6000, fax
(212) 207-4800, near the Roosevelt Island tram, has made the
transformation from office building to hotel with admirable grace.
It has a small reading library in the lobby, and its 229 rooms are
modern, spacious and simple. The higher floors have sweeping views
of the city. Doubles start at $195.
 &HT;    The New York Marriott Brooklyn, 333 Adams St., (718) 246-7000,
fax (718) 222-6535, is the borough's first new hotel in nearly 70
years, and a convenient base for exploring either Brooklyn or
Manhattan. It is a short walk from six subway lines and the
Brooklyn Bridge. The 374 rooms are comfortably furnished, with
unusually high ceilings, and there is a health club and pool.
Doubles start at $229.
 &HT;    Luxury: Even a grand dame needs an occasional make-over. The
Waldorf-Astoria and Waldorf Towers, 301 Park Ave. at 50th Street,
has just completed a renovation that, among other things, uncovered
original mosaics and murals in the Park Avenue lobby, transformed
Oscar's from a coffee shop into a softly lighted Art Deco bistro,
and created a new lounge in the Towers. Doubles start at $295 main,
$425 Towers; (212) 355-3000, fax (212)872-7272.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Park View at the Boathouse: the Loeb Boathouse in Central Park
has a new restaurant featuring Asian-influenced American cuisine to
complement its bucolic lakeside setting. It will stay open all
year, offering outdoor dining (with heaters) until Nov. 1, then
moving inside, where fireplaces have been installed. Dinner for two
with wine is about $150; (212) 517-2233.
 &HT;    Occupying the Coach House's former home, at 110 Waverly Place in
Greenwich Village, is Babbo, a modern Italian restaurant both
elegant and casual that combines unusual ingredients in unorthodox
ways; specialties include such pastas as mint love letters with
spicy lamb sausage, spicy ``Sicilian lifeguard'' two-minute
calamari, and saffron pannacotta with poached peaches and lemon
balm. Dinner for two, with wine, is about $130; (212) 777-0303.
 &HT;    If you want to sample the ``new'' Lower East Side, try Torch, a
supper club and lounge, at 137 Ludlow Street, which features South
American-influenced French cuisine, including a well-spiced
hamburger and popcorn-topped ceviche.
 &HT;    Along with the banquettes and sultry lighting, the attraction is
the array of torch singers who perform jazz standards nightly.
Dinner for two with wine costs about $90; (212) 228-5151.
 &HT;    After a hike over the Brooklyn Bridge (breathtaking even with
traffic rumbling below _ and, of course, free), warm up at
Grimaldi's, on 19 Old Fulton St. a cobblestone's throw from the
bridge. In the endless debate over the city's best pizza,
Grimaldi's is a front-runner; acolytes line up outside. Dinner for
two with wine is $30; (718) 858-4300.
 &HT;    At Gabriela's, 685 Amsterdam Ave., a casual, friendly Mexican
restaurant, you can get a savory roasted half-chicken _ with ample
side dishes like rice, beans and guacamole, for $6.50. It offers
traditional dishes like baby cactus salad and pozole, the filling
Mexican soup made with hominy. Dinner for two, with margaritas:
$25; (212) 961-0574.

West 46th St. Tickets: $20 to $75; (212) 307-4100.
 &HT;    And ``Swan Lake'' came to Broadway this month in a version by
Matthew Bourne, the British choreographer and director, at the Neil
Simon Theater at 250 West 52d Street. The production won raves in
London and Los Angeles. The twist: all the dancers are men _
wearing feathery pantaloons, not tutus. Tickets: $15 to $75; (212)
307-4100.
 &HT;    The most controversial ticket of the season promises to be
``Corpus Christi'' by Terrence McNally, starring an as yet unknown
actor, Anson Mount.
 &HT;    The play centers on a gay Jesus-like figure and was briefly
called off earlier this year after protests by the Catholic League
and anonymous bomb threats. A Manhattan Theater Club production, it
is at City Center, 131 West 55th St. Tickets are $50; (212)
581-1212.
 &HT;    In early December, the Brooklyn Philharmonic performs a
semistaged version of ``Powder Her Face,'' a new opera by the
English composer Thomas Ades about the life of Margaret, Duchess of
Argyll, whose sensational divorce rocked England in the 1960s. At
the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theater, Dec. 8, 10, and
12. Tickets: $20 to $45; (212) 307-4100.
 &HT;    On Nov. 12 and 14, at Alice Tully Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center
presents ``Blues Up and Down: A Battle in the Bucket,'' with jazz
elder statesmen like Teddy Edwards and Al Grey trying to outdo
younger talents like Cyrus Chestnut and Nicholas Payton. Tickets:
$37.50; (212) 721-6500.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The Lower East Side Tenement Museum offers one-hour historical
walking tours of a neighborhood that is gentrifying faster than a
New York apartment rents.
 &HT;    The tours leave from 90 Orchard St. and run weekends at 1:30 and
2: 30 p.m. through December; tickets $8. The museum also offers
frequent tours of its Tenement House, an 1863 building with
recreated apartments as they would have been during the 1870s,
1916, and the 1930s; (212) 431-0233.
 &HT;    There is no better time than fall to explore Fort Tryon Park,
which is also home to the rich medieval offerings of the Cloisters,
the upper Manhattan branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 &HT;    The only thing missing is the Unicorn tapestries, which have
been removed until January while the museum undergoes renovations.
Open Tuesday to Sunday, 9:30 a.m. until 5:15 p.m. through October,
to 4:45 p.m. after November. Admission: $8; (212) 923-3700.
 &HT;    The Wollman Rink in Central Park opened for ice skating on Oct.
15. With buildings rising like castle spires behind the trees,
there are few more magical settings for exercise _ north of the
entrance at Central Park South and Avenue of the Americas.
Admission: $4; (212) 396-9203.
 &HT;    In Chelsea, the West 20s between 10th Avenue and the Hudson
River have filled with dozens of galleries. You can start an
informal walking tour at the Dia Center for the Arts, at 548 West
22d St., now showing works by Robert Irwin and Joseph Beuys, and
then meander through the surrounding blocks.
 &HT;    The shops of NoLIta, the surreally quiet, oddly self-contained
blocks of Elizabeth, Mulberry and Mott between Spring and Houston,
seem made as much for looking as for buying. Stores include a glass
blower (Michael Anchin, at 250 Elizabeth St.), a milliner (Kelly
Christy, at 235 Elizabeth St.), and nearly two dozen eclectic
clothing stores.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Many hotels offer weekend specials or even discounted regular
rates, but occupancy rates in New York are so high _ 83 percent
this year _ that reservations are important. These hotels are
either new or recently renovated:
 &HT;    One look at the green carpet and the portrait of Mary McAlees,
the president of Ireland, on the wall, and you'll get the theme at
the Fitzpatrick Grand Central Hotel, which opened in August at 141
East 44th Street; (212) 351-6800, fax (212) 818-1747. The rooms are
not green, but tastefully decorated with canopied beds. Doubles
start at $325.
 &HT;    The Roger Williams, 131 Madison Ave., at 31st Street, was built
around 1928 but was thoroughly renovated last fall. Its sleek,
modern lobby includes a 20-foot atrium, and its 209 minimalist
rooms are done in white and beige with blond wood, and equipped
with CD players and VCRs. Doubles from $245; (212) 448-7000; fax:
(212) 448-7007.
 &HT;    The Algonquin, 59 West 44th St., (212) 840-6800; fax (212)
944-1419, finished a major renovation this year with an accent on
nostalgia. The lobby has been darkened to evoke an air of
antiquity, and the halls have been wallpapered with New Yorker
cartoons, a self-conscious reminder of the hotel's history as a
literary gathering place.
 &HT;    The Rose Room has been absorbed into the lobby, but the Round
Table remains. Guest rooms retain an old New York feel, with pewter
blue and cream decor, antiques, and headboards carved of dark wood.
Doubles: $329.
 &HT;    Budget: The Bentley Hotel, 500 East 62d St., (212) 644-6000, fax
(212) 207-4800, near the Roosevelt Island tram, has made the
transformation from office building to hotel with admirable grace.
It has a small reading library in the lobby, and its 229 rooms are
modern, spacious and simple. The higher floors have sweeping views
of the city. Doubles start at $195.
 &HT;    The New York Marriott Brooklyn, 333 Adams St., (718) 246-7000,
fax (718) 222-6535, is the borough's first new hotel in nearly 70
years, and a convenient base for exploring either Brooklyn or
Manhattan. It is a short walk from six subway lines and the
Brooklyn Bridge. The 374 rooms are comfortably furnished, with
unusually high ceilings, and there is a health club and pool.
Doubles start at $229.
 &HT;    Luxury: Even a grand dame needs an occasional make-over. The
Waldorf-Astoria and Waldorf Towers, 301 Park Ave. at 50th Street,
has just completed a renovation that, among other things, uncovered
original mosaics and murals in the Park Avenue lobby, transformed
Oscar's from a coffee shop into a softly lighted Art Deco bistro,
and created a new lounge in the Towers. Doubles start at $295 main,
$425 Towers; (212) 355-3000, fax (212)872-7272.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Park View at the Boathouse: the Loeb Boathouse in Central Park
has a new restaurant featuring Asian-influenced American cuisine to
complement its bucolic lakeside setting. It will stay open all
year, offering outdoor dining (with heaters) until Nov. 1, then
moving inside, where fireplaces have been installed. Dinner for two
with wine is about $150; (212) 517-2233.
 &HT;    Occupying the Coach House's former home, at 110 Waverly Place in
Greenwich Village, is Babbo, a modern Italian restaurant both
elegant and casual that combines unusual ingredients in unorthodox
ways; specialties include such pastas as mint love letters with
spicy lamb sausage, spicy ``Sicilian lifeguard'' two-minute
calamari, and saffron pannacotta with poached peaches and lemon
balm. Dinner for two, with wine, is about $130; (212) 777-0303.
 &HT;    If you want to sample the ``new'' Lower East Side, try Torch, a
supper club and lounge, at 137 Ludlow Street, which features South
American-influenced French cuisine, including a well-spiced
hamburger and popcorn-topped ceviche.
 &HT;    Along with the banquettes and sultry lighting, the attraction is
the array of torch singers who perform jazz standards nightly.
Dinner for two with wine costs about $90; (212) 228-5151.
 &HT;    After a hike over the Brooklyn Bridge (breathtaking even with
traffic rumbling below _ and, of course, free), warm up at
Grimaldi's, on 19 Old Fulton St. a cobblestone's throw from the
bridge. In the endless debate over the city's best pizza,
Grimaldi's is a front-runner; acolytes line up outside. Dinner for
two with wine is $30; (718) 858-4300.
 &HT;    At Gabriela's, 685 Amsterdam Ave., a casual, friendly Mexican
restaurant, you can get a savory roasted half-chicken _ with ample
side dishes like rice, beans and guacamole, for $6.50. It offers
traditional dishes like baby cactus salad and pozole, the filling
Mexican soup made with hominy. Dinner for two, with margaritas:
$25; (212) 961-0574.

</P>
<P>
   Mature travelers who aren't bargain-savvy may discover that
their vacation bills are rising as hotel occupancy rates climb and
the number of empty airplane seats decreases. This is quite a
change from a few years ago when hotels were overbuilt and planes
were flying half-full. It was then that generous senior discounts
were born as a way for travel companies to fill their seats and
their rooms at non-peak travel times.
</P>
<P>
   Today, these discounts are taking on a new look _ what they call
in the travel industry ``value-added'' benefits. These are not just
flat percentages off, but extras: a per-room rate rather than
per-person, food and beverage discounts and vouchers, packages with
touring included, event-oriented promotions like anniversary or
birthday rates or those tied to special cultural events like
concerts and art exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   There are even discounts that benefit travel companies: By
rewarding passengers with an early-booking discount, a cruise or
tour operator can get a better handle on planning for their
customers. Another helpful discount is one that is enriched to lure
the off-season traveler when the travel company needs more
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Many discounts are beginning to show up in the cruise industry.
With mega-liners being built, the cruise industry needs to fill a
growing number of berths, so cruise bargains may be the easiest to
find right now.
</P>
<P>
   Mature travelers should try to be flexible in their travel
plans, be very smart shoppers and read between the lines of
offerings. We can shop for bargains by season, location and other
factors. For example, if breakfasts are a regular part of your day,
a free breakfast can save $7 to $12 per day.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping smartly requires comparison shopping. ``Runzheimer's
Guide to Daily Travel Prices'' (check your library) can offer
benchmarks. These are the most- and least-costly U.S. cities for
travel accommodations:
</P>

<P>
   While these prices are for first-class lodging, look for ways to
beat the averages with senior discounts, choosing a business hotel
for a weekend or trying a resort hotel in midweek or off-season.

   Prices for goods and services can help you make comparisons,
too. Runzheimer, which analyzes travel and living costs, provides
these comparisons:

   While these prices are for first-class lodging, look for ways to
beat the averages with senior discounts, choosing a business hotel
for a weekend or trying a resort hotel in midweek or off-season.
</P>

   Prices for goods and services can help you make comparisons,
too. Runzheimer, which analyzes travel and living costs, provides
these comparisons:

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Travelers who've been almost everywhere can be hard to please
when Christmas rolls around. So here are a few suggestions to put
under the Christmas tree. Rates are per-person, based on double
occupancy. (Wrapping is optional.)
 &HT;    For James Bond fans, what could be better than a stay at
Goldeneye, the former home of author Ian Fleming in Oracabessa,
Jamaica.
 &HT;    This is the tropical getaway where the late Fleming wrote most
of the Bond novels, and some of his original furniture and
photographs remain.
 &HT;    The property was made available to the public in 1998 by its
current owner, Chris Blackwell, the man behind the Island Outpost
hotel group and Island Records.
 &HT;    The tab for renting the three-bedroom house that can sleep up to
six people? Just $5,000 per day, including all meals and drinks
(Island Outpost, 1330 Ocean Drive, Miami Beach, Fla. 33139;
800-OUTPOST).
 &HT;    For the hungry traveler, use a linen napkin to gift-wrap ``Great
Restaurants: Bordeaux to the Mediterranean,'' a moveable feast
through France from Sept. 12 to 18, 1999.
 &HT;    During this seven-day, six-night trip, participants manage to
eat at 11 Michelin-starred restaurants, including Les Pris
d'Euginie and Les Jardins de L'Opira.
 &HT;    Guests stay in country inns, enjoy sightseeing excursions in the
Pyrenees and taste regional wines.
 &HT;    The price for this gastronomic indulgence is $3,995 from France
in Your Glass (814 35th Ave., Seattle, Wash. 98122; 800-578-0903;
www.inyourglass.com).
 &HT;    How about a quick trip to London? Well, there's always the
Concorde. British Airways has a luxurious package for those who are
long on cash but short on time.
 &HT;    Passengers fly from New York to London on the supersonic
Concorde, stay three nights at the five-star Claridges hotel and
return in Club World business class. They get daily full English
breakfast, service charges, VAT and a chauffeur-driven private car
from Heathrow as well.
 &HT;    The tab is $5,829 and for $900, they can upgrade to the Concorde
for the return flight. (British Airways, Holiday Desk, 75-20
Astoria Blvd., Jackson Heights, N.Y. 11370; 800-876-2200).
 &HT;    For friends who always insist upon staying at the best places, a
more affordable gift might be a subscription to ``Andrew Harper's
Hideaway Report'' (Box 50, Sun Valley, Idaho 83353; fax only,
406-862-3486;).
 &HT;    The last word in five-star hotel and resort reviews, this is the
monthly bible for those who prefer to lay their heads only on the
best pillows. The cost of keeping up with world-wide luxury is $135
for 12 issues.
 &HT;    Few countries in the Middle East are as remote as Yemen, a
county best appreciated through its archaeological treasures. So
consider a 17-day archaeological tour of the country from Nov. 13
to 29, 1999, led by Dr. Trevor Marchand of the University of London
and offered by Archaeological Tours (271 Madison Ave., Suite 904,
New York, N.Y. 10016; 212-986-3054).
 &HT;    Including Sana'a and the ancient villages of Wadi Hadhramawt,
the cost is $5,075 _ including airfare from New York.
 &HT;    Far from the Middle East, polar bears roam the west coast of
Canada's Hudson Bay. The best and the safest way to view them is on
a tour with Natural Habitat Adventures (2945 Center Green Court,
Boulder, Colo. 80301; 800-543-8917).
 &HT;    These are six- to nine-day trips that go from Winnipeg, Manitoba
to Churchill, a grain port on Hudson Bay.
 &HT;    Over a thousand bears typically stop near Churchill on their
annual fall migration, earning the town the nickname of ``Polar
Bear Capital of the World.'' By using tundra vehicles, the animals
can be viewed safely at close range.
 &HT;    The ``Polar Bear Watch'' starts at $2,195, including
accommodation, most meals and round-trip charter flights from
Winnipeg with departures in October and November, 1999.
 &HT;    Dog-lovers on anyone's list might enjoy a dog-sledding
expedition to the Brooks Range in Alaska (American Wilderness
Experience, 2820-A Wilderness Place, Boulder, Colo. 80301;
800-444-0099).
 &HT;    These lodge-based trips north of the Arctic Circle promise a
proficiency in mushing by trip's end as well as front-row seats for
the Northern Lights. Prices for a four-day lodge trip start at
$1,700 plus $225 round-trip airfare from Fairbanks.
 &HT;    Speaking of ice, all but one of the six National Hockey League
arenas have closed down or been demolished. Only Maple Leaf Gardens
in Toronto remains, but this is its last season.
 &HT;    For diehard hockey fans who want to catch a last game there with
the Toronto Maple Leafs, there's Roadtrips (177 Lombard Ave., 7th
Floor, Winnipeg, MB, Canada R3B 0W5; 800-465-1765;
www.roadtrips.com).
 &HT;    They have ``Toronto Hall of Fame Getaways'' throughout the
1998-1999 hockey season, two-night packages that include
accommodations in a first-class hotel and seats for one game at
Maple Leaf Gardens. Prices start at $229 and include a pass to the
Hockey Hall of Fame.
 &HT;    Finally, an intriguing gift for the marrying kind comes from
Carnival Cruise Lines (3655 N.W. 87th Ave., Miami, Fla. 33178;
800-933-4968). The cruise line has new on-island wedding ceremonies
on Ocho Rios, Jamaica for $595, on Key West for $595 and on Nassau,
Bahamas for $995.
 &HT;    Those prices include a civil ceremony, photography, decorated
bridal aisle, pre-recorded wedding music, wedding cake, champagne,
flowers and on-island transportation. They do not include the price
of the cruise. Or the ring.

   CERABINO-COLUMN _ What would the real Moses say? He'd probably
be embarrassed. After all he'd done. To end up like this: a shill
for the National Rifle Association. Maybe you've heard the radio
ad. It begins with NRA front-man Charlton Heston's voice, saying
``As Moses, I led my people to the promised land . . .'' But it
doesn't hit the high harmonics of nonsense, until Heston wraps back
to: ``I can part the Red Sea, but I can't make criminals pay for
their crimes without your help.'' Somewhere, the real Moses must be
cringing, and begging his boss, ``Please, let me smite this actor!
Please! Just this once!'' Heston's gone far with his Moses movie
role. But tying Moses into gun control is, well . . . too far.

   MURRAY-COLUMN _ MONTE CARLO, Monaco _ I sit in the outdoor cafe

<P>
   BORDERS-COLUMN _ Editor and publisher of the Nacogdoches Daily
Sentinel. (Borders, Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel)
</P>
<P>
   KELSO-COLUMN _ Does Round Rock already have too darned many
things for vacationers to take in as it is? Or is there room for
growth in Round Rock's tourist industry? I say there's space to
squeeze in a baseball team among the other highlights. Look at the
top 10 tourist attractions in Round Rock, and make up your own
mind. (Kelso, Austin American-Statesman). MOVED
</P>
<P>
   SIBLEY-COLUMN _ The headline on the story about political
contributions the other day really struck me. It siad, ``Georgia
'fat cat' contributors only make a small meow.' Add my family to
that small meow list. We always put a political contribution in the
budget, along with a tithe for the church. But looking at today's
contributors I am woefully embarrassed. The Home Depot chairman and
his wife, $52,500, for goodness' sake! (Sibley, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED TUESDAY
</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ SESTRIERE, Italy _ In the march of time armies
commanded by Roman rulers, Celtic kings, European nobles, Christian
crusaders, Napoleon I, Nazis and others have come this valley. To
those bygone warriors, the surrounding mountains looked dangerous
and forbidding. To me, lounging in the morning sun in front of an
Alpine cafe amid the smells of cappuccino and fresh-baked Italian
bread, the same scenery looks postcard perfect, which you can buy
for about 1,000 Italian lira on postcards all around the village.
The Italians ought to do something about their money. I nearly get
a heart attack when my lunch bill says I owe 40,900. (Nethaway,
Waco Tribune-Herald). MOVED

ad. It begins with NRA front-man Charlton Heston's voice, saying
``As Moses, I led my people to the promised land . . .'' But it
doesn't hit the high harmonics of nonsense, until Heston wraps back
to: ``I can part the Red Sea, but I can't make criminals pay for
their crimes without your help.'' Somewhere, the real Moses must be
cringing, and begging his boss, ``Please, let me smite this actor!
Please! Just this once!'' Heston's gone far with his Moses movie
role. But tying Moses into gun control is, well . . . too far.

and forbidding. To me, lounging in the morning sun in front of an
Alpine cafe amid the smells of cappuccino and fresh-baked Italian
bread, the same scenery looks postcard perfect, which you can buy
for about 1,000 Italian lira on postcards all around the village.

   HEATHER _ ATLANTA _ She's already blown away the critics in

Headley talks about her trek to star in the Elton John-Tim Rice

Northwestern for ``Ragtime,'' then had Disney fighting Livent to
get her out of her contract for ``Lion King.'' Though dealing with
``Sybil,'' the glitchy ``Aida'' pyramid was tough, it was nothing
compared to two sprained ankles and stress fractures in both legs
for ``Lion King.'' But her biggest worry was this: After getting
used to standing ovations every night for ``Ragtime'' and ``Lion
King,'' she had to get ready for the first ``Elaborate Lives''

 &HT;    Pastor who performed `virginity check' on teen faces prison
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A pastor who performed a ``virginity
check'' on a teenage member of his Delray Beach church was found
guilty Tuesday of felony sexual activity with a child and faces 12
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Joseph Millien, 51, sat erect and motionless as the
verdict was read. He undid his tie and calmly passed it to his
attorney when the judge revoked his bond and ordered him jailed
until sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   The charge is a first degree felony because the jury found found
Millien was acting in the role of a pastor and custodian of the
girl when she was molested in church offices. The pastor was
acquitted of another count of disrobing and rubbing against the
17-year-old girl in a second encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Church members said virginity checks on girls is a cultural
practice in Haiti, where Millien lived before moving to Delray
Beach in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Haiti it's not against the law,'' said Marie Rodriguez, a
member of Millien's Full Gospel Assembly Church. ``All the parents
do that to their children.''
</P>
<P>
   In a confession he later retracted, Millien told Delray Beach
detectives in 1997 that he tested the girl's virginity even though
he had no medical expertise. He denied having any other sexual
contact with the girl.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors, who asked to re-hear the taped confession during their
two hours of deliberation, reached verdicts that matched Millien's
own words as to what he did and didn't do to the girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury obviously listened to the statement,'' Assistant
State Attorney Andy Slater said. ``I am pleased with the verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   The felony carries a maximum 30 years in prison but sentencing
guidelines call for six to 12 years for first-time offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Millien's attorney, Richard Lubin, said he was disappointed
Circuit Judge Howard Berman would not allow him to bring witnesses
before the jury to say that the charges against Millien were
motivated by a group seeking to take control of his 250-member
church.
</P>
<P>
   Lubin said the witnesses would have testified they were offered
money by Millien's enemies if they accused him of sexual
misconduct. Three females testified in court that the pastor
sexually abused them, but two of the incidents were in the late
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge denied our defense,'' Lubin said. ``We feel we have
an excellent (case for) appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman ordered Millien to jail until sentencing in about 30
days. Lubin said he will request a bond hearing.

Hamburg and Cologne; Munich, Berlin, Hanover and Nuremberg go for
$363.

   VRAGOBIL, Yugoslavia _ I watch the villages of central Kosovo
pass by from a Yugo driven by a guy I hired in Pristina, the
province capital.
</P>
<P>
   We're traveling a main road through hilly farmland. It's
familiar scenery, reminding me of the pretty rolling country around
the Ozark or Appalachian mountains back home. It's sunny and warm,
even hot in the car.
</P>
<P>
   It's an eerie place with no people, as if there has been some
terrible germ warfare that wiped out the humans but spared the
cattle, chickens and dogs.
</P>
<P>
   I've spent the morning trying to assess how things are going for
the thousands of people who have abandoned these villages for fear
of being caught in the wicked fighting between Yugoslavia's Serb
forces and the ragged soldiers of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).
</P>
<P>
   My assessment is pretty simple: These people need to get home
and make ready for winter while they still have good weather.
</P>
<P>
   On a day such as this, you could climb up on a roof and put some
plastic or canvas over the shell holes, and get something to cover
the windows. You could set aside some food from the relief
organizations, maybe even store some drinking water. You could get
the kids in some kind of decent shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that isn't happening. Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
refugees, frightened and exhausted by months of struggle, are
digging in where they are -- three and four families in dark
airless rooms in the few houses in the few villages overlooked in
the fighting. The rooms, though kept neat by constant maternal
labor, are breeding places for house flies and other bugs. There is
always the faint smell of feces and urine. Always.
</P>
<P>
   When you pull up to these houses, the first people you see are
children. They get as close as they can without touching you. They
seem fascinated by the look of the foreigner, with his clean jeans
and shiny boots, scrawling notes. They study his color photo mug on
a plastic card dangling by a chain from his neck.
</P>
<P>
   They wear dirty Chicago Bulls sweatshirts, My Little Pony
t-shirts and New York Yankees caps. I wonder if these things came
in donated packages, the former play outfits of some American kids
who tossed them in the bottom of their closets only to be delivered
by their mothers to some charity.
</P>
<P>
   I feel a pang from the flashback of the trash bags of clothes,
shoes and such that I hauled to my curb in Atlanta last summer
before moving to London. I'd give anything to see my boys' barely
worn things on these sweet-faced children.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hard thing when you are used to having children around.
It's normal to play with them, dress them, feed them and doctor
their wounds. These children need these things too, but where do
you start?
</P>
<P>
   You could go a lifetime in America without struggling with such
a question, clicking past the faces of starving children on the way
to HBO. You want to tune them out so that you can live your life
with only your own burden to carry.
</P>
<P>
   We have become a soft people, unhardened by war and want, so
just looking at these faces causes despair, a helpless feeling that
is abhorrent to someone so comfortable. It hurts too much.
</P>
<P>
   And places like this war-torn province in southern Yugoslavia
are thankfully easy to ignore. The politics are too messy to sort
out when you're already up to your neck in worrying about how
you'll pay for a good college or the many other pressing matters of
American life. And there's plenty of misery in America should the
spirit ever move you.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for me, there's comfort in the limitations of being
only a newspaper reporter. My job sets a limit on what is required
of me, which is no more than telling people like you about places
like this.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I've done that.

 &HT;    Bringing Moses into gun control fight a step too far
 &HT;    By Frank Cerabino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What would the real Moses say?
</P>
<P>
   He'd probably be embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   After all he'd done. To end up like this: a shill for the
National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you've heard the radio ad.
</P>
<P>
   If not, don't worry. There'll be plenty of other opportunities
before Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with NRA front-man Charlton Heston's voice, saying
``As Moses, I led my people to the promised land . . .''
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't hit the high harmonics of nonsense, until Heston
wraps back to: ``I can part the Red Sea, but I can't make criminals
pay for their crimes without your help.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, the real Moses must be cringing, and begging his
boss, ``Please, let me smite this actor! Please! Just this once!''
</P>
<P>
   Heston's gone far with his Moses movie role. But tying Moses
into gun control is, well . . . too far.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of the ad is a Florida constitutional amendment
aimed to keep crooks and lunatics from buying firearms at gun
shows, the ubiquitous weekend flea markets of unregulated mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   A loophole in the state law exempts gun shows from complying
with any county laws requiring background checks and
three-to-five-day waiting periods on gun sales.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional amendment would close the loophole.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of law that makes sense, unless you happen to
stake out the position that practically any form of gun control is
immoral and unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the NRA does.
</P>
<P>
   And so does the group's candidate for governor, Jeb ``Burning''
Bush, who's planted himself on the fake-Moses side of this issue.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA thinks defeating constitutional Revision 12 on Tuesday's
ballot is important enough to unleash Heston on us and spend at
least $150,000 in radio ads.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't know what Revision 12 was about, you'd never know
from listening to the Heston ad.
</P>
<P>
   He never mentions the words ``gun show'' or ``gun control.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he talks about how ``crimes that are now felonies under
state law could be reduced to mere misdemeanors, putting many
dangerous criminals right back on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   I think the real Moses returned from the mountain with a
commandment that addressed statements like that.
</P>
<P>
   As for gun control, it's hard to say exactly what the real
Moses' position would be. The Old Testament is silent on the
subject of the registration of firearms at Florida gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   But upon further inspection and study, I've come to the
conclusion that the real Moses would be opposed to the position
staked out by Heston and the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   In Moses' day, they didn't have guns. They had ``rods.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Old Testament is full of advice about how rods should be
used.
</P>
<P>
   In Numbers 17:2, the Lord tells Moses: ``Write thou every man's
name upon his rod.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like centralized registration of firearms to me.
</P>
<P>
   And consider this, from Exodus 4:2
</P>
<P>
   ``And the Lord said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he
said, A rod. And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on
the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rods turning into serpents.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't sound very pro-gun to me.
</P>
<P>
   And while we're in Exodus, there's that bit about ``three days
journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-day sacrifice?
</P>
<P>
   Three-day waiting period for guns.
</P>
<P>
   It's all starting to make sense.
</P>
<P>
   The real Moses wouldn't agree with Heston, at all.
</P>
<P>
   He'd be mortified.
</P>
<P>
   So I feel sorry for the real Moses.
</P>
<P>
   To be reduced to a pawn in the broken-promise land of politics
is a horrible way to end up.

 &HT;    There's space to squeeze in stadium at Round Rock
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does Round Rock, Texas, the Gateway to Hutto, need yet another
tourist attraction?
</P>
<P>
   The question is becoming important because on Tuesday, Round
Rock voters will go to the polls to decide whether to use $7.3
million of their hotel-motel bed tax money to help build a $13
million minor league baseball stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Does Round Rock already have too darned many things for
vacationers to take in as it is? Or is there room for growth in
Round Rock's tourist industry?
</P>
<P>
   I say there's space to squeeze in a baseball team among the
other highlights. Look at the top 10 tourist attractions in Round
Rock, and make up your own mind.
</P>
<P>
   Here are my picks for the top 10 things to see and do in the
Round Rock O Plex.
</P>
<P>
   Hairy Man Road: Get off northbound Interstate 35 at exit 253,
cross the highway, then head west on Sam Bass Road until you get to
Hairy Man Road. A beautiful drive with trees drooping over the
road, some say Hairy Man Road is named after a legendary hairy man
who came out of the bushes after dark to scare the bejeepers out of
people.
</P>
<P>
   It's kind of like Austin's Sixth Street thing, except Hairy Man
Road is out in the country. So, unlike in Austin's entertainment
district, the hairy guy along Hairy Man Road won't hit you up for
spare change.
</P>
<P>
   Garden Ridge Pottery, northwest corner of I-35 and FM 1325,
I-35's Exit 250:
</P>
<P>
   A 140,000-square foot crafts store filled with women looking for
such items as Beanie Baby Bunk Beds, Garden Ridge Pottery offers a
selection of lovely concrete yard statuary, including toadstools.
</P>
<P>
   Also available are decorative four-foot-high metal suits of
armor for $48.88 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are just tin; we just call them our tin men,'' said
Dalton Roberts, the general sales manager.
</P>
<P>
   You're probably wondering why anyone would buy one of these
hollow knight suits, since they're too small for most people to
squeeze into. They're for home decoration, Roberts explained. Just
the ticket, one supposes, if you're fixing to put a moat and
drawbridge around your house.
</P>
<P>
   The Tap, Exit 252B:
</P>
<P>
   Located downtown, just off the intersection of Main and Mays
streets, this tiny beer joint has a message on the front door that
reads, ``Men only. 11-10.''
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean women don't get to come in until after 10 at
night, or what?
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as they leave the seat up on the toilet, they're all
right. They can stay,'' joked Frankie Brown, one of the bar's
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Best sign in town, on a wall at The Tap:
</P>
<P>
   ``When I die, I want to go peacefully in my sleep like my
grandfather, not screaming in terror like the other people in his
car.''
</P>
<P>
   The water tower downtown:
</P>
<P>
   Looming in the sky across the street from The Tap, the old
unused water tower has very little water in it. It has been left
standing for aesthetic reasons, said Jim Nuse, director of public
works.
</P>
<P>
   Nuse added that a man named Boxey Elam who now lives in Lampasas
was the only person in town who would climb the water tower to
change the light bulb on top. Elam, Nuse says, is about 80 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that light goes out, I keep telling him he's got to get his
climbing shoes on,'' Nuse said.
</P>
<P>
   Impromptu car show, Renaissance Square strip mall, in front of
the Antique Mall of Texas, Exit 251:
</P>
<P>
   Every Saturday night, says Round Rock Mayor Charlie Culpepper,
you can find a bunch of auto enthusiasts gathered in the parking
lot here to look at each others' classic cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh man, you've got the Chevies and the Fords and the
Studebakers,'' Culpepper said. ``It's just everybody comes out
there and pops their hoods. It's been going on for years.''
</P>
<P>
   The markers on Main Street, Exit 252B:
</P>
<P>
   In 1878, outlaw Sam Bass died in a Main Street shootout here.
The eight numbered metal markers, set into the bricks of the
sidewalk, identify various critical spots in the event. They were
once part of a Chamber of Commerce walking tour.
</P>
<P>
   The actual rock for which the town is named, in Brushy Creek on
Chisholm Trail Road, Exit 252B:
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead and laugh, if you want, at a town being named for a
rock. But look at it this way. At least it's not one of those deals
where the town is named after something that doesn't exist, like
Lake City, Iowa. The town motto there is: ``Everything but the
lake.''
</P>
<P>
   To get to the table-shaped rock, take RM 620 west, then turn
right at the light at Chisholm Trail Road and go to Brushy Creek.
</P>
<P>
   You'll know it when you see it. It's the round, table-shaped
rock sticking out of the water.
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star Bakery, 106 W. Liberty St., downtown, Exit 252B:
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only bakery in the world that sells great orange
doughnuts from a drive-up window.
</P>
<P>
   The frame house where the horror classic ``The Texas Chainsaw
Massacre'' was filmed, on Quick Hill Road:
</P>
<P>
   Robert Burns, art director for the movie, says he's not sure if
the house is still standing. He says it was pretty dilapidated the
last time he saw it a couple years ago. But you couldn't get to it
anyway, since the part of old County Road 172 that led up to it is
now closed, Culpepper said.
</P>
<P>
   So let's play ball.

 &HT;    Funny money needs fixing in Italy
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SESTRIERE, Italy _ In the march of time armies commanded by
Roman rulers, Celtic kings, European nobles, Christian crusaders,
Napoleon I, Nazis and others have come this valley.
</P>
<P>
   To those bygone warriors, the surrounding mountains looked
dangerous and forbidding.
</P>
<P>
   To me, lounging in the morning sun in front of an Alpine cafe
amid the smells of cappuccino and fresh-baked Italian bread, the
same scenery looks postcard perfect, which you can buy for about
1,000 Italian lira on postcards all around the village.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians ought to do something about their money. I nearly
get a heart attack when my lunch bill says I owe 40,900.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is in lira, right?'' I ask the waiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   People everywhere can say ``OK,'' ``Coca-Cola'' and ``no
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be a very big problem if my American Express bill shows
that my lunch cost as much as a new luxury car. It was good, but
not that good.
</P>
<P>
   I can see my ``no-problem'' waiter and his girlfriend slicing
through the Alps on their new flame-red Ducatis, bought with my
lunch money.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of motorcycles, this is motorcycle heaven. Here, you
are guaranteed to wear out sides of your tires first.
</P>
<P>
   A young man I met at breakfast said Sestriere is included in a
three-valley loop that motorcycle riders out of Turin like to ride.
</P>
<P>
   They usually ride in groups. They wear full-faced helmets and
multi-colored race leathers. No Harley Davidsons here. These bikers
ride race-replica crotch rockets and tear through the mountains
like they are chased by demons.
</P>
<P>
   Like racers, they lean off their bikes into the turns, often
dragging a knee. They pass on hills and curves and split lanes
between traffic on narrow roads.
</P>
<P>
   The first day I encountered these Alpine road racers, I had been
concentrating on throwing my rented 5-speed Renault into the curves
when the first of a string of motorcycles screamed past only inches
from my left ear.
</P>
<P>
   I nearly wrecked trying to watch them and keep my car on the
road at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't a lot of motorcycle riders get killed around here?'' I
asked my young breakfast companion, who also rides a motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   He thought a moment as though he was trying to give me an
accurate estimate of the fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``Not in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   This, I felt, added weight to of my theory about America's
obsession with safety laws.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than allow Americans to assume responsibility for our own
safety, and thereby develop the skills needed to avoid injury, the
United States relies on safety nannies and spineless politicians
who heap safety laws on top of safety regulations to keep people
from hurting themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Americans are a danger to themselves and others
whenever they are forced to deal with life outside the tight,
little safety cocoon constructed for them by suffocating government
safety nannies.
</P>
<P>
   I saw an occasional speed limit sign in the Alps. Only farm
tractors and cows obeyed them.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding wrecks and fender-benders in Europe has more to do with
confidence in your fellow motorists and blending in with the
surrounding traffic rather than with posted signs, rules and
regulations that substitute for common sense and driving skill in
America.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude pumps money into government coffers as a result of
excessive fines and even more money into the pockets of personal
injury lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Europe has good scenery, good bread, good coffee and good
drivers. Next time, I'm bringing my motorcycle

 &HT;    Graham keeps the faith, if not the brimstone
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The fiery oratory that once scared us
into believing is gone. Now, a grandfather's soothing voice urges
the faithful to confess Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Graham has grown old.
</P>
<P>
   That was clear at his latest crusade last weekend in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   The sermon was the same, Graham's conviction was obvious, but
his sense of urgency was no longer palpable.
</P>
<P>
   He once paced a mile or more back and forth across the stage to
drive home his sermon calling sinners to repent. He preached a
simple _ his few critics say simplistic _ version of Christianity
for more than 60 years to hundreds of millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 79-year-old evangelist has Parkinson's disease. He
walks with a cane and sits on a high stool behind the podium to
preach. His voice is calm, almost pleading; his demeanor gentle and
self-effacing.
</P>
<P>
   In Tampa, he reminisced about earlier crusades. He told personal
stories and invited people to join him in a faith that has given
him peace. There was none of the hell fire and brimstone of the
younger Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you remember anything from these meetings,'' Graham urged
Friday night, ``remember that God loves you.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowds still come. More than 50,000 people gathered on each
of four nights at the Raymond James Stadium that is home to the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 80,000 overflowed the 65,000-seat stadium at the last
meeting on Sunday. Extra seating with remote television was set up
in a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham was preaching to the choir. Most of the audience
seemed already converted. They came to be part of history. They
came to be with an evangelical icon of enormous stature in a tribal
celebration of Protestant Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   A Billy Graham crusade is a form of evangelical fervor that he,
almost alone in the universe of preachers, made respectable.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 bay area churches worked together for nearly a
year to bring this one to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The well-oiled efficiency of the Graham organization will
continue to mount crusades long after his extraordinary run comes
to an end. But no one is likely to surpass his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Graham has preached to more people than any other person in
history. And that may be the least of the remarkable benchmarks
this profoundly humble man of God will leave as a legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina farm-boy-turned-preacher transformed the
oft-ridiculed country tent meeting into popular middle class urban
rallies. More than 200 million people came to hear him.
</P>
<P>
   He preached his old-time religion using every high-tech tool he
could muster including radio, television, satellite downlinks, and,
last weekend for the first time, the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Graham accomplished the nearly impossible. He reduced or
eliminated the distrust that various Christian groups have
historically had for one another. Multi-church cooperation is the
theme _ and the reality _ of every Graham crusade.
</P>
<P>
   He was raised a Presbyterian, ordained in the Southern Baptist
tradition and claims to feel a part of the Anglican and Christian
Missionary Alliance church.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, his sincerity converted countless Roman Catholic
churches from opposition to his crusades into eager participants.
</P>
<P>
   But arguably his greatest gift to both evangelical ministry and
to Christianity is his personal integrity. He brought honor to a
profession known as much for the sleaziness of Elmer Gantry as the
purity of the Gospel.
</P>
<P>
   In a era of questionable televangelists such as Pat Robertson
and Benny Hinn _ not to mention the disgraced Jimmy Swaggart _
there has never been a hint of scandal around Graham or his
organization.
</P>
<P>
   His few critics argue that despite his extraordinary statistics,
the world has not much changed since Graham began crusades after
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   They suggest his preaching has been great theater, classic
evangelism charged more with emotion than content and like much of
its ilk, ineffective in changing lives.
</P>
<P>
   Graham admits that cities look much the same after his crusades
as before. But he would say that saving the world was not his task.
</P>
<P>
   Simply preaching the Gospel and preaching the Gospel simply were
his marching orders.
</P>
<P>
   And he has been faithful to that task beyond anyone's
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   His well-deserved epitaph _ like that of St. Paul _ might be
found in the second New Testament letter to Timothy:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have fought the good fight. I have finished the race. I have
kept the faith.''

 &HT;    Some say he's a guru, he says `just a regular guy'
 &HT;    By Charlise Lyles
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the telephone, Deepak Chopra does not exactly sound like
the deep baritone, all-knowing mythical prophet.
</P>
<P>
   But a prophet he is, say devotees and detractors alike.
</P>
<P>
   Followers have declared him a guru, come to heal sick bodies and
souls with his teaching of mind/body harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors denounce Chopra as a ``profit prophet,'' whose advent
is just in time to cash in on the New Age-spiritual craze and baby
boomer angst and affluence.
</P>
<P>
   In the past eight years, both camps have purchased Chopra's
sutras, best sellers such as Ageless Body, Timeless Mind, The Seven
Spiritual Laws of Success, The Return of Merlin and The Path to
Love , contributing to his phenomenal success as a master of
personal transformation and alternative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1990s, Chopra, with a halo of jet black hair and
shiny let-me-empower-you eyes, has traveled the globe, preaching
his metaphysical message of inner renewal about 140 days each year.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview last week, over the telephone lines from St.
Louis, the man who has been called the harbinger of pre-millennial
enlightenment sounded nasal, placid, somber. ``. . . just a regular
guy writing books on topics that he's interested in,'' Chopra said.
``I have absolutely no guilt about being successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Endocrinologist Dr. Deepak Chopra, 52, is the former chief of
staff of the Boston Regional Medical Center. In the 1980s, as he
treated internal ailments and taught at Tufts and Boston
universities, Chopra began to call on the ancient wisdom of his
native India to inform his practice of Western medicine.
</P>
<P>
   His unorthodox teaching took hold, even in pretty orthodox
places like the American Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Tussing of Cincinnati tuned in to Chopra three years ago.
``I was in a marriage and job that were both very unhappy and
unfulfilling for me. I was so sad,'' said Tussing, who describes
her age as 24 ``with 18 years experience.''
</P>
<P>
   She read Chopra's Seven Spiritual Laws of Success . She attended
his lectures, meditated, changed her diet, studied. She became a
``certified mind/body educator'' and teaches the Chopra technique
at area hospitals and places such as the Yellow Springs Center for
Spiritual Journeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this knowledge, renewed confidence, a knowingness and
putting his principles into practice, I've had major
life-transforming events in my life and personal relationships,''
Tussing said.
</P>
<P>
   How does Chopra explain his melding of quantum physics, Hindu
text and other Eastern philosophies, the Bible and Western
medicine?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that we see around us, including our bodies, is an
expression of information and energy. Even our thoughts are
clusters of photons. Where does this all come from? And what is it
that organizes the information and energy into a very orderly
universe, including a very intelligent biological system? That
domain of awareness, which is the source of all creativity, is
spirit. To befriend this force is to find a sense of meaning and
purpose in life, which is the basis of true success.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, said Chopra, people come back to his $25 to $200
seminars, lectures or classes as many as 20 times ``before they get
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chopra does not dismiss traditional medicine. Still, approach
him with caution, say some physicians wary of his ``healing''
remedies for persons battling serious illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deepak is part preacher, part salesman, part philosopher. We
hear an awful lot of things from his lips and writing,'' said Dr.
John Renner, a family physician in Independence, Mo., who is
president of the National Council for Reliable Health Information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people need to be very, very skeptical before they buy
into that kind of thing. I'm not against all alternative medicine.
We have to be careful about what we call alternative and what we
call sales talk. When he talks warm, fuzzy stuff, that's one thing.
But when you talk about cancer. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Chopra-ism challenges traditional organized religion with the
notion that spirituality and consciousness, the true keys to
happiness and health, transcend religious doctrine and ritual.
</P>
<P>
   At the Healing Arts Center on the River in Mishawaka, Ind.,
director Sister Judian Breitenbach combines some of Chopra's ideas
with other mind/body spiritual integration therapies such as
reflexology, aromatherapy, healing touch and herbal body wraps.
Chopra serves as an adviser to the center, which opened three years
ago as part of Ancilla Health Systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we initiated this we did focus groups, and it was
well-received. There was some concern expressed on the part of the
diocesan leadership and fundamentalist-based groups,'' Breitenbach
said. ``It is a very delicate situation and it will be for other
dioceses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the public is pushing this,'' she said. ``They are
searching for a spiritual element in their healing process that has
not been present in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Chopra calls mainstream skepticism and rejection predictable.
``It is an expression of fear,'' he said. ``God is no longer a dead
white male in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a perceived threat. That has always been the history
of organized religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the universe within that Chopra urges us to tap into, his
enterprise is vast.
</P>
<P>
   He employs about 65 people, from public-relations specialists to
physicians and massage therapists. Some staff the Chopra Center for
Well Being in La Jolla, Calif., near San Diego, which opened about
four years ago. A massage appointment costs $55. The five-day
``creating health-ayurvedic-detoxification program'' is $2,550. But
it comes with a guarantee: a ``life transforming and healing
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Chopra says the retreat center has yet to turn a profit. It is
supported by the proceeds from his 21 books and 30 audio, video and
CD-ROM programs. He won't say how many millions of dollars this
means. And still, his enterprise grows with seminars, a line of
herbal products, movie scripts and possibly a spiritual television
channel.
</P>
<P>
   Chopra also has a reputation for filing lawsuits _ against the
Weekly Standard , a Rupert Murdoch paper, the Journal of the
American Medical Association and Britain's Daily Mail .
</P>
<P>
   Though he offers healing to the burned-out, the divorced, the
cancer-stricken, the grieving and the otherwise disheartened and
despairing, Chopra himself has suffered few life crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 6 years old, we got a telegram from my daddy in
England saying he had just been inducted into the Royal College of
Physicians. My grandfather, whom I loved very much, was absolutely
proud. He took us to the roof of the house in Bombay and took a
rifle and fired some rounds. Then he took me and my little brother
to the movies . . . He took us home and kissed us goodnight, and he
died. I couldn't figure out where he went. . . . It was like he
suddenly disappeared. Did I solve the crisis? No. I haven't
still.''
</P>
<P>
   As an adult, he says, ``There have been minor things. Nothing
major.'' His marriage to wife, Rita, is stable. His daughter is 25
years old and a graduate of Brown University. His 21-year-old son
sometimes works with Chopra.
</P>
<P>
   And no self-destructive traits have gotten the better of this
guru. ``Criticism, things like that make me angry for a little
while, then I let it go,'' Chopra said. ``And maybe I'm a little
self-righteous sometimes.'

 &HT;    Having a fit in the dressing room
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Lenda Jo Anderson wears a size 4. She
thinks.
</P>
<P>
   Sirvart Mellian has sizes 12 through 18 in her closet, and they
all fit her.
</P>
<P>
   How's that? ``The problem is, women's wear is based on numbers
that mean nothing,'' says Anderson, an associate professor of
consumer affairs at Auburn University(Ala.).
</P>
<P>
   Both women are working on national projects to make some sense
of it all.
</P>
<P>
   In today's stores, those 12s and 14s you hunt through vary from
designer to manufacturer. A Donna Karan size 4 is not necessarily a
Banana Republic size 4, or even a size 6.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the government stepped away from mandatory size
standards in 1942, after basing those numbers on a young and fit,
uniform-wearing World War II population. Since then, some designers
have become more generous with their sizing, squeezing more space
into smaller numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more interesting to say you are a size 2 to
friends,'' Anderson says.
</P>
<P>
   And smiles make sales.
</P>
<P>
   Groups such as the American Society for Testing and Materials,
which does quality control in the clothing industry, have suggested
new standards to reflect our expanding waistlines. And some simply
want to replace sizes on all tags with key measurements, such as
waist and hips.
</P>
<P>
   With help from the aerospace, auto and furniture industries _
which also need to know how big we are _ the group plans to take
body measurements of thousands of American women.
</P>
<P>
   Working with women 18-55, they plan to measure in 60 different
ways, from wrist to waist and beyond, says Mellian, a design
engineer for the U.S. Navy Clothing and Textile Research Facility
in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Combine those findings and interviews with each woman, and out
comes the first real database on sizing since the 1940s. They hope.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the ASTM survey, on women 55 and older,
already is complete. The group looked at more than 6,000 women from
38 states and found, as was expected, that body types change. If
you compare the average measurements for a mature size 6 with the
1942 standard, you now have 4 more inches of waist and 2 more of
hip room.
</P>
<P>
   This should mean a new sizing standard after the two-year study
is complete.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no way to enforce it, Mellian says.
</P>
<P>
   She has had some success, at least with her branch of the
military. She has talked the Navy into putting waist and hip
measurements on its women's uniforms, sort of a women's version of
menswear sizing.
</P>
<P>
   She asks why designers can't do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say women don't know their measurements,'' she says.
``But I refuse to believe that men are smarter than women, because
men know their measurements.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a lack of strict standards gives those who make
clothes some room to play. And that's important to the creative
types.
</P>
<P>
   Designers don't want to be told what to do, says Jack Morgan,
director of communications for the American Apparel Manufacturing
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the designer going to have to produce clothes along exact
numbers, like uniforms?'' he asks. ``Our feeling is, we would be
very concerned if undue restraints were put on designers.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you replace sizes with measurements, you constrain the
designer's creativity, he says. (His solution? ``We suggest people
try on the clothes.'')
</P>
<P>
   The AAMA is not entirely unsympathetic, though. For one thing,
Morgan says, they have developed a program called Suitable
Solutions, which may make the swimsuit buying process a bit easier.
</P>
<P>
   The program features color-coded tags that correspond with
different body types. Want a suit that de-emphasizes the tush? Look
for the right tag.
</P>
<P>
   The AAMA is now sending information to retailers, Morgan said.
But this system, too, is voluntary. And Morgan said there are no
plans to expand the tags to other kinds of clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Another program in the works involves the National Textile
Center, a group of colleges working with the U.S. Commerce
Department. The group wants to first sit down with focus groups,
probably in Atlanta and in North Carolina, to talk fit with women
ages 22-55, says Auburn's Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   They will go beyond measurements and discuss ease _ who likes
what to be loose where. Manufacturing representatives will sit in a
sound booth nearby, taking notes.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the group will mail questionnaires to a random sampling of
women across the country, asking similar questions about size and
fit.
</P>
<P>
   The goal: Come up with a program where women can say, ``Here are
my measurements and here is how I want this to fit.''
</P>
<P>
   So Anderson can order her fitted dresses and looser jackets,
just the way she wants them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what I like,'' she says. ``You can't fool me.''
</P>
<P>
   2-4-6-10? WHAT SIZE DO I FIT IN?
</P>
<P>
   HAVING A FIT IN THE DRESSING ROOM
</P>
<P>
   Just about everyone offers khaki pants.
</P>
<P>
   A Cox writer, with a 26-inch waist and 35-inch posterior area,
shopped around this week and snuck into fitting rooms with a tape
measure. Turns out she is a size 2, and a size 4, and a size 6, and
a size 8.
</P>
<P>
   The results:
</P>
<P>
   Lizsport, by Liz Claiborne _ Size 4 (26 waist, 38 fanny)
</P>
<P>
   Lauren, by Ralph Lauren _ Size 4 (26 waist, 36 fanny)

   Limited _ Size 2 (28 waist, 38 fanny)
</P>
<P>
   Lerner New York _ Size 6 (27 waist, 37 fanny)

 &HT;    Deluge of political issue ads flows from major parties
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Back in June before the fall campaign was in full
swing, lawyers for the two major political parties appeared in
federal court here to demand an end to restrictions preventing them
from spending unlimited amounts of unregulated ``soft money'' on
political issue advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Though they generally agree on little else, the two sides argued
together that without such an unfettered entitlement they would
become footnotes in the November elections, swamped in a flood of
political spending from third parties who face no restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Nov. 3 elections less than a week away, the
lawyers' predictions have proved flat wrong. Issue advocacy is
indeed flooding the airwaves in many states, but it is the major
parties themselves that are responsible for the deluge, not
third-party special interests.
</P>
<P>
   With several dozen House seats and perhaps eight Senate seats up
for grabs, the two parties are pouring millions into unregulated
issue advertising in California, Nevada, New Mexico, Illinois,
Kentucky, New York, North Carolina, Ohio and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans alone, under the leadership of Rep. John
Linder (R-Ga.), are spending $25 million on issue advertisements
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   State parties have been big players, too, using their own ``soft
money'' accounts to fund issue ads in gubernatorial campaigns and
congressional races. In Georgia, for example, the Democratic Party
spent $500,000 on issue advertising attacking Republican Sen. Paul
Coverdell on funding for veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of most issue advertising that voters are seeing around
the country, the Georgia ad does not tell voters to vote for
Michael Coles, Coverdell's Democratic opponent, or against
Coverdell, so the spending does not count against the federal
limits on what parties can spend on behalf of their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, the amount the parties are spending in issue
advertising far exceeds what they could spend in direct
contributions. In North Carolina, for example, the Democratic Party
is spending nearly $1.5 million on issue ads to attack the record
of Republican Sen. Lauch Faircloth, the GOP's most vulnerable
incumbent next to Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The amount is more than twice what the party can contribute in
so-called coordinated party expenditures under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Under Federal Election Commission rules that the parties are
challenging, the parties must mix unregulated soft money with
regulated ``hard money'' _ funds collected under contribution
limits _ to finance their issue advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has turned into a major river of soft money which is
flowing into federal campaigns,'' said Don Simon, director of
Common Cause. ``They spend this money on candidate-specific ads run
right before the election and claim that these ads are doing
nothing but discussing issues and have nothing to do with
campaigns. It's a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   The parties, spending an estimated $30 million to $40 million,
also are responsible for fueling the harshly negative tone of many
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got one of the worst attendance records in the Senate,''
intones one recent ad against Faircloth. ``And when Lauch Faircloth
has shown up for work? He voted to cut Medicare $270 billion, the
largest Medicare cut in history. Voted against Head Start for our
kids _ eight times. ... Call Lauch Faircloth. Tell him to put North
Carolina's working families first for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads have helped make the race competitive, said Michael
Tucker, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, which helped pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go in there and tell North Carolina voters that Lauch
Faircloth voted against Head Start eight times ... it makes a
difference when voters hear that,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky, a Republican Party ad tells voters that Democratic
Rep. Scotty Baesler, running for the Senate, ``voted to export
thousands of Kentucky jobs to Mexico.'' To the sound of the Mexican
mariachi, a Mexican actor says, ``Muchas gracias, Senor Baesler.''
</P>
<P>
   Issue advertising came under intense scrutiny in the 1996
elections after the two parties spent tens of millions of dollars
on ads that appeared to bolster the candidacies of President
Clinton and former Sen. Bob Dole. The Justice Department is
examining whether spending by the Democrats illegally exceeded the
spending limits imposed on presidential candidates who accept
federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   Third-party special interest groups also were active in 1996.
Organized as tax-exempt social welfare organizations in many cases,
these groups poured more than $135 million to $150 million in
unregulated donations into specific races.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Annenberg Public Policy Center in Washington
estimated that special interest groups have spent $260 million to
$330 million on issue advertising. But the 1998 figures are skewed
by the huge sums several of the largest groups poured into trying
to influence legislation, such as the $40 million spent by the
tobacco industry to fight an increase in cigarette taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Third-party groups that wanted to influence candidates and
elections appear to have spent most of their money during the
primaries, said Douglas Rivlin, Annenberg's director.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been the massive, coordinated effort we saw in
1996,'' Rivlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO, which spent $35 million in 1996 in the districts of
vulnerable House Republicans, scaled back its issue advertising
campaign this year to $5 million. This year, the labor union has
spent more money on organizing its grass-roots constituencies to
increase voter turnout, said AFL-CIO spokeswoman Denise Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to us that the party spending is the one place issue
advertising is increasing,'' Mitchell said. ``Other than that, I
think it's playing a diminished role.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, the AFL-CIO ran ads against 14 senators, including
Coverdell, criticizing them for opposing the patients' bill of
rights, which would subject health maintenance organizations to
liability lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, the ad prompted a response from the Washington-base
Business Roundtable, which just completed a $500,000, two-week ad
campaign across the state defending Coverdell's record on health
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to set the record straight,'' said Jennifer
Litchman, the Roundtable's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The Roundtable, a tax-exempt trade association comprised of
chief executive officers from the nation's largest corporations,
developed a relationship with Coverdell when the Georgia senator
coordinated efforts to defeat Clinton's proposed health care
reforms in 1993. Coverdell has remained a staunch opponent of HMO
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted people out there to know that Coverdell is
doing some good work out there on some of these issues,'' Litchman
said. ``We wanted to say thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   The parties, meanwhile, are continuing to press their claim in
federal court that FEC rules requiring them to match some regulated
hard money with soft money to produce issue ads is illegal. David
Leland, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party and a party to the
lawsuit, said the case is still important even though third-party
advertising has not developed as they argued in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we want to do is play by the same rules as everyone
else,'' said Leland. ``Whether these (third-party) groups choose to
engage or not is irrelevant.''

 &HT;    Jimmy Buffett to strum in support of MacKay campaign
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Parrotheads will get a chance to hear
Jimmy Buffett Thursday when he makes a surprise visit to Clematis
By Night to campaign for Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   While Buffett is strumming in South Florida for the Democrats,
the Oak Ridge Boys will be touring the Florida Panhandle Thursday
with Republican Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   If music is an important issue for voters picking a governor in
Tuesday's election, they'll have to decide: Is your heart on fire
for Elvira? Or would you rather be wasting away in Margaritaville?
</P>
<P>
   Buffett, who will be joined on stage by Gov. Lawton Chiles and
other Democratic leaders, will sing a few of his most popular
songs. Buffett, who has been active in politics for years, has long
supported Democratic candidates and will endorse MacKay during a
press conference in Titusville today.
</P>
<P>
   The Oak Ridge Boys, riding in their tour bus, will join Bush at
several stops in the Panhandle where their country and gospel music
is very popular.
</P>
<P>
   These star wars are not being limited to singers.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay will spend most of Thursday with President Clinton
attending a money-raising dinner in Palm Beach and watching U.S.
Sen. John Glenn return to space aboard the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   After the dinner, Clinton, if his schedule permits, may show up
on the stage in downtown West Palm Beach with Buffett, MacKay,
Chiles and other Democratic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Bush comes to West Palm Beach on Friday to
attend a rally at Rooney's Public House, a downtown Irish pub and
restaurant with New York's best-known Italian, Mayor Rudy Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay, who was campaigning in West Palm Beach Tuesday night,
was asked whether the Oak Ridge Boys or Jimmy Buffett was more
popular with Florida voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take Jimmy Buffett every time,'' he said with a laugh.
``I think he's a proven winner.''

 &HT;    Dell executives give $13 million for art museum
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney and Michael Barnes
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUND ROCK, Texas _ In the largest single cash gift to the arts
in Central Texas, five Dell Computer Corp. executives and their
wives have pledged $13 million to help build the Austin Museum of
Art on West Third Street in downtown Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The gift, which will be announced today, is a significant boost
to the museum's efforts to raise an estimated $35 million for
design and construction of the museum and at least $15 million to
endow it.
</P>
<P>
   It also signals that Dell, which has grown from its 1984 start
in a University of Texas dormitory to the region's largest private
employer, will be more active in shaping the region's cultural and
philanthropical landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Dell continues to grow, we are presented with a unique
responsibility to partner with greater Austin to shape the kind of
world-class community we need as we move into the 21st century,''
Chief Executive Michael Dell said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same basic quality-of-life issues that affect the future
of our company and our employees are directly relevant to Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Michael and Susan Dell, the donors are Mort Topfer, vice
chairman, and his wife, Angela; Kevin Rollins, vice chairman, and
his wife, Debbie; Tom Green, senior vice president for legal
affairs, and his wife, Deborah; and Tom Meredith, senior vice
president and chief financial officer, and his wife, Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Kirk Watson welcomed Dell Computer's multidimensional role
in Central Texas as the region evolves from a government-driven
economy to a technology center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a 13-million-star demonstration of generosity to the
community,'' Watson said. ``It assures that a part of this
transition of the city will occur in a high-class way.''
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials called the gift a huge boost to the entire arts
scene in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been much talk throughout the United States that the
high-tech community was not coming to the table in this way,'' said
Elizabeth Ferrer, director of the Austin Museum of Art. ``I think
that was a premature assessment. The high-tech community will play
an incredibly important role in the arts and other philanthropic
endeavors in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   While the gift has been in the works since spring, its
announcement depended in part on the filling of key positions at
the museum, said Tom Green, who has been working out details of the
gift for several months. The museum was without a chief executive
officer until June, when former IBM executive Bill O'Brien got the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Dell officials hope the timing of the announcement, one week
from the Nov. 3 election, boosts support for Proposition 4 among
Austin voters. The $46.4 million proposal includes spending for
libraries, museums and cultural centers.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell urged support for Proposition 4 and other measures,
noting that voters approved an $11.4 million bond issue for an art
museum in 1984 _ which coincidentally is the year he started his
company in his dorm room at UT.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next week's bond election gives us another, rare opportunity
to reinvest in important cultural assets that benefit us all,
including the Mexican-American Cultural Center, the Carver Museum
and the Palmer Performing Arts Center,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it to be a wonderful coincidence,'' said Watson.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot does not ask approval for bonds to renovate Palmer;
$50 million is expected to be raised privately. Propositions 11 and
12 release the City of Austin to rent Palmer to Arts Center Stage
and to raise money through taxes on car rentals in order to build a
parking garage, a landscaped park and a new community events center
to house current Palmer users.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Dell donation should hearten those Palmer backers who
question whether Arts Center Stage can raise $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gift proves there is money here in the community for the
arts,'' said museum board Chairman David Gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been saying that this kind of philanthropy is
possible in Austin,'' said Jessie Hite, director of UT's Blanton
Museum of Art. ``But this is the first time we have seen it. This
is very positive for everyone in the arts in Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   Running on parallel tracks, the new Blanton, planned for the
intersection of Speedway and Martin Luther King Boulevard, is
estimated to cost $50 million for design, construction and
endowments, about the same as the municipal museum. University
fund-raisers have secured $37 million so far. The Houston
Endowment, headed by Houston oilman and former UT Regent Jack S.
Blanton, gave $12 million, while Blanton and his wife, Laura Lee,
personally pledged $5 million. The late novelist James Michener and
his wife, Mari, left $10 million to the museum, as well as their
collection of American art, valued at $16 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Dell gift, however, is the largest single cash pledge to an
Austin arts group.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin Museum of Art, which will concentrate on 20th century
art in its new building, emerged from the reorganized Laguna Gloria
Art Museum in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The old museum had first sought a downtown presence in the early
1980s with a bond election to raise money for a building designed
by architectural superstar Robert Venturi. The project fell apart
in 1989, victim of a sour economy, political infighting and the
loss of the original land on Fourth Street.
</P>
<P>
   Die-hard backers revived the dream in the early 1990s by
creating a board of directors more broadly inclusive of Austin's
diversified communities. The City Council endorsed the new
management in 1996, and, a year later, retired doctor Ernest Butler
and his wife, Sarah, jump-started the renewed campaign for the
downtown museum with a gift of $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since $11.4 million in bond money remains for the project, the
addition of the Dell gift brings the project close to the halfway
mark in a fund-raising campaign expected to seek at least $50
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we've taken several giant steps forward,'' museum
chairman Gold said. ``We are within hailing distance of our (1998)
targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Gold said Dell representatives have worked closely with the
museum board on the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Dell Computer Corp., its executives and
employees and the 3-year-old Dell Foundation have given several
million dollars to cultural and charitable organizations.
Executives say the company's presence will be felt more in the
months and years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are all the things you need to do to become a
world-class company,'' said Topfer, a vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the gift is more significant for Austin's arts
institutions, which, for decades, rarely received any donations of
more than six figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am already beginning to schedule the first year or two of
exhibitions in the new building,'' Ferrer said. ``These are the
shows that are going to put Austin on the map, in terms of an art
center.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This represents a sea change in the cultural life of Austin,''
Gold said.

   Bush adviser: It's about 2000 now
</P>
<P>
   By Ken Herman
</P>
<P>
   c. Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush's top adviser on Tuesday
declared the gubernatorial race over and said the battle has turned
into the beginning of the 2000 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove blamed the Democrats _ not Bush _ for the White House
overtones. And, in nonspecific terms, he dismissed Democratic
challenger Garry Mauro as generally unworthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, you're right, the governor's race is over,'' Rove said
after fellow panelists expressed the sentiment at a meeting of the
Texas Taxpayers and Research Association. ``And it really is
astonishing commentary on the decline of the Democratic Party that
they've got this guy running as their candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mauro campaign was unimpressed with Rove's commentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dream on Karl Rove,'' said Billy Rogers, Mauro's campaign
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the campaign, Bush has declined to publicly make any
derogatory comments about Mauro, though he has aggressively
challenged the challenger's ideas and proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has said he has not decided on whether to enter the
2000 presidential race. In San Antonio on Monday, he said he does
not even want to talk about it until after Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
   But Rove said the Democrats are turning the gubernatorial race
into a preseason presidential contest. He pointed to Saturday's
possible trip to El Paso by Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose
appearance at a Mauro rally would mark the 14th event that she,
President Clinton or Vice President Al Gore have attended on
Mauro's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said the White House has not yet said whether the first
lady will attend the El Paso event.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said the Mauro campaign's ``closing endgame'' is an effort
to keep Bush from hitting his goal of running well in the Hispanic
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about trying to deny George W. Bush 40 percent of
the Hispanic vote, which has nothing to do with 1998 at all, and
all things to do with future fears on the part of the Clinton-Gore
White House,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, even before polls showed Mauro running a distant
second to Bush, political gossip said Mauro's mission was to see
what kind of issues worked against Bush, who could wind up in a
head-to-head battle for the White House with Gore in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Rogers said the Clintons' interest in the Mauro campaign
stems from their long-term friendship with him. Mauro met Clinton
in 1972, when they worked in Dallas for the George McGovern
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro and Bush worked West Texas on Tuesday, with the Democrat
continuing to criticize the incumbent for not saying if he is going
to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to choose at a time that is more convenient to him,''
Mauro said in Lubbock. ``My position is that we have full-time
problems and I plan to be a full-time governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, also in Lubbock, repeated his position:
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that I have not decided whether I will run for
president,'' he said. ``If that is a problem for some people, then
they should take that into account when they go to the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pre-election polls, Mauro insists he will be the
next governor. Like Rove, he said the outcome is not in doubt,
though he sees a different outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expect to win the election next Tuesday,'' Mauro said
Monday in Austin. ``Absolutely, 100 percent convinced of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove on Tuesday also served up a colorful view of the race
between Democrat John Sharp and Republican Rick Perry for
lieutenant governor. Rove, though involved with the GOP's
coordinated campaign, is not a consultant to the Perry campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the campaigns' television ads, Rove jokingly
dismissed Sharp as ``Mr. Green Eye Shades. Hire me to be your
accountant. Got tax problems? Call John Sharp, tax preparer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And here is Rick Perry talking about kids and looking good
and, 'If you agree with me, I want to be your lieutenant governor,'
exuding charisma,'' Rove said. ``One is Mr. Bland White Guy . . .
and the other is `Hey, I'm your next-door neighbor, and I may not
be as smart as the other guy, but you'd rather have me over
Saturday night for dinner wouldn't you?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' was the one-word response from Kelly Fero, spokesman for
Sharp.

and to raise money through taxes on car rentals in order to build a
parking garage, a landscaped park and a new community events center
to house current Palmer users.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Dell donation should hearten those Palmer backers who
question whether Arts Center Stage can raise $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gift proves there is money here in the community for the
arts,'' said museum board Chairman David Gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been saying that this kind of philanthropy is
possible in Austin,'' said Jessie Hite, director of UT's Blanton
Museum of Art. ``But this is the first time we have seen it. This
is very positive for everyone in the arts in Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   Running on parallel tracks, the new Blanton, planned for the
intersection of Speedway and Martin Luther King Boulevard, is
estimated to cost $50 million for design, construction and
endowments, about the same as the municipal museum. University
fund-raisers have secured $37 million so far. The Houston
Endowment, headed by Houston oilman and former UT Regent Jack S.
Blanton, gave $12 million, while Blanton and his wife, Laura Lee,
personally pledged $5 million. The late novelist James Michener and
his wife, Mari, left $10 million to the museum, as well as their
collection of American art, valued at $16 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Dell gift, however, is the largest single cash pledge to an
Austin arts group.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin Museum of Art, which will concentrate on 20th century
art in its new building, emerged from the reorganized Laguna Gloria
Art Museum in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The old museum had first sought a downtown presence in the early
1980s with a bond election to raise money for a building designed
by architectural superstar Robert Venturi. The project fell apart
in 1989, victim of a sour economy, political infighting and the
loss of the original land on Fourth Street.
</P>
<P>
   Die-hard backers revived the dream in the early 1990s by
creating a board of directors more broadly inclusive of Austin's
diversified communities. The City Council endorsed the new
management in 1996, and, a year later, retired doctor Ernest Butler
and his wife, Sarah, jump-started the renewed campaign for the
downtown museum with a gift of $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since $11.4 million in bond money remains for the project, the
addition of the Dell gift brings the project close to the halfway
mark in a fund-raising campaign expected to seek at least $50
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we've taken several giant steps forward,'' museum
chairman Gold said. ``We are within hailing distance of our (1998)
targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Gold said Dell representatives have worked closely with the
museum board on the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Dell Computer Corp., its executives and
employees and the 3-year-old Dell Foundation have given several
million dollars to cultural and charitable organizations.
Executives say the company's presence will be felt more in the
months and years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are all the things you need to do to become a
world-class company,'' said Topfer, a vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the gift is more significant for Austin's arts
institutions, which, for decades, rarely received any donations of
more than six figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am already beginning to schedule the first year or two of
exhibitions in the new building,'' Ferrer said. ``These are the
shows that are going to put Austin on the map, in terms of an art
center.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This represents a sea change in the cultural life of Austin,''
Gold said.

 &HT;    Small-business owners blast Southwestern Bell
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Several Austin small-business owners criticized
Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. on Tuesday for lack of local
competition and high in-state long-distance charges.
</P>
<P>
   Their press conference at the Capitol Marriott Hotel was
organized by a local public relations company, JRG Communications,
on behalf of the Partnership for a Competitive Texas, which was
started by AT&AMP;T and other long-distance companies.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman was the Rev. Frank Garrett, who lives in Austin
and is pastor of Bethel St. Paul Baptist Church in Giddings. He
focused his criticism on the 12-cent-a-minute ``access charge''
that long-distance companies must pay local phone companies to
complete long-distance calls made between points within the state.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett is also a radio talk show host and said he has expensive
long-distance bills trying to develop his Black Talk Broadcasting
Network of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   As have the long-distance companies, Garrett said that it
actually costs the local companies _ in Texas, primarily
Southwestern Bell _ about 1 cent a minute to complete the calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It amounts to little more than corporate welfare,'' Garrett
said of the 12-cent charge, ''welfare paid for by our families and
businesses and we want reform.''
</P>
<P>
   He was joined by Joseph Villarreal, a jeweler; Ying Li, a
consultant for people who do business in China; Russel Anders,
whose Data One company installs telecommunications equipment; and
Eugene Bailey, a landscaper.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Maddox, a spokesman for Southwestern Bell, said the access
charge _ frozen by state law until Sept. 1, 1999 _ was set that
high to keep the monthly charge for local service low.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're asking Texans to increase local rates when they (ask
for lower access charges),'' Maddox said. As for local competition,
he said competitors have almost 650,000 local lines. Southwestern
Bell has about 9.3 million lines in Texas.

 &HT;    Malloween: Treats the focus in safe settings
 &HT;    WITH BOO-BOX
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Traffic at the mall will be a nightmare this Saturday.
Thousands of frightening-looking kids will pack the doorways of
stores in search of sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Trick or treating at the mall has become a tradition for many
metro Atlanta children since the tainted-candy scares of the
mid-1980s, when malls got into the candy business to provide a safe
haven on Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a natural fit that we give kids a safe place
that's well lit,'' said Cindy Gilmer, marketing director at
Northlake Mall. ``You don't have to worry about being hit by a car
or the weather. Every year, we're mobbed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sybil Moore of Forest Park has always taken her two sons
Malloweening. They've trick or treated at the Mall West End,
Southlake Mall and Greenbriar. The family hasn't decided which mall
it will hit this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our generation grew up running wildly into the night, going
door to door. It was fun and safe then,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now you don't know whose door they're knocking on. People
move so frequently. And you get hit with eggs because of the
roughness of the teenagers. My kids like the mall because they can
be cute in their costumes and feel safe with mom's hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the free festivities are just for a day, mall managers
and store owners hope the business benefits last longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merchants love it,'' Northlake's Gilmer said. ``They don't
do a lot of business that night, but the parents are going to
remember the store that gave their child candy and, hopefully,
they're going to come back and shop there.''
</P>
<P>
   For serious trick or treaters who want to fill their goodie bags
to the brim, the malls can be a better deal than walking around the
neighborhood. Youngsters can get treats at more than 100 stores
before they call it a night.
</P>
<P>
   Greenbriar Mall expects to pass out more than 40,000 pieces of
candy.
</P>
<P>
   The Cobb Galleria Centre will have a semi-trailer loaded with
sweets to hand out during its annual Trick or Treat Street. More
than 11,000 children attended last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wild day. It's just insane,'' said Annie Miners, (cq)
event producer for Game Inc., the company that helps coordinate the
program at the Galleria.
</P>
<P>
   Not all malls participate. Some say unruly teenagers
overshadowed the under-12 set, for whom the events were targeted.
Cumberland Mall stopped passing out candy a couple of years ago. So
did Gwinnett Place.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do all parents embrace Malloween, with its sometimes long
lines and absence of neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to do trick or treating at the mall anymore.
It's just too much of a line,'' said Sandra Dawson, a Norcross
mother who used to take her 5-year-old daughter, Ashley, to a mall.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Finley's two girls wouldn't think of trick or treating
outside their Tucker neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what our kids enjoy,'' Finley said. ``We live near a
couple of cul-de-sacs, so we know almost all the neighbors.''

 &HT;    Ebner accuses Maxey of gay bashing in race for Texas House
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Because the Texas House race between Democratic
incumbent Glen Maxey and Republican challenger Fred Ebner is the
first in Texas history to feature two openly gay candidates, you'd
think the two men would find it difficult to feud over the issue of
sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   But the campaign for Austin's District 51 has taken a strange
turn in its final days: Ebner and other gay Republicans are
accusing Maxey _ the only openly gay member of the Texas House and
an outspoken gay rights advocate _ of gay-baiting. Maxey,
meanwhile, says Ebner is misleading voters about his sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   A recent campaign mailing by Maxey sparked the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The leaflet points out that Ebner is gay, highlights his
membership in the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay group, and notes his
support for expanding the state's anti-discrimination laws to
include sexual orientation. It also points out that Ebner is
pro-choice and supports the legalization of marijuana for medicinal
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Maxey ``supports these issues too,'' the leaflet says, but
unlike Ebner, Maxey ``will tell you where he stands.'' It doesn't
say that Maxey is gay.
</P>
<P>
   Ebner and the Log Cabin Republicans say the leaflet appears to
have been sent only to people who voted in the Republican primary,
and was intended to dampen GOP turnout by highlighting Ebner's
sexual orientation and some of his socially moderate stands. Maxey
declined to identify the target audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like very much for him to have distributed the same
thing in Clarksville and Travis Heights,'' said Ebner, referring to
two neighborhoods that are particularly liberal in a district that
is among the most Democratic in the state. ``I'd like them to know
that he's indulging in gay-bashing in order to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebner said he considers his sexuality to be ``a private and
personal matter which is irrelevant to holding public office,''
while Maxey has ``made a lifetime career of advocating a
left/liberal approach to gay issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxey said he sent the mailing because Ebner attacks him for
being a gay advocate when he speaks to broader audiences, but tells
gay groups that he can better represent their interests. He said
the leaflet didn't mention that he was gay because it is already
well-known.
</P>
<P>
   Maxey said he isn't gay-baiting because it was Ebner who
injected sexual orientation into the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard him twice now call me a professional gay
activist,'' Maxey said. ``He's put up by the Log Cabin Republicans,
a gay group, and then criticizes me for being a gay activist? Give
me a break.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxey said the Log Cabin Republicans recruited Ebner to ``spit
in the eye'' of the Republican party by showing that a gay,
socially moderate Republican could do better against Maxey than an
anti-gay conservative one. The platform of the Texas Republican
Party states that homosexuality ``is contrary to the fundamental,
unchanging truths that have been ordained by God'' and opposes gay
marriage and the repeal of sodomy laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Log Cabin Republicans deny they recruited Ebner, who ran for
Austin City Council in 1987. Steve Labinski, who is president of
the group's Texas chapter, dismissed the idea that Ebner's campaign
is designed to send a message to the Republican Party. He said
Ebner ``honestly believes that a mainstream Republican can better
represent the voters of District 51 than Glen Maxey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The mailout was identical to a mailout that would be sent by
the Christian Coalition or the Texas Family Association for the
same purpose: to inflame voter homophobia.'' Labinski said. ``This
is gay-baiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Hardy-Garcia of the Lesbian Gay Rights Lobby of Texas,
which doesn't endorse candidates, questioned why a gay Republican
would want to target an outspoken defender of gay rights. She said
the leaflet was ``hard-hitting, and a little bit harsh,'' but
declined to describe it as gay-baiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glen's borne the brunt of being a gay politician in this state
for a long time, so I imagine that he's frustrated about Ebner not
being open about it,'' she said. ``Maybe there will be a day when
sexual orientation won't make a difference and I look forward to
that day. But it hasn't happened yet, and no one knows that more
than Glen Maxey.''

 &HT;    `Aida' star Heather Headley sees her winning streak continue
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Heather Headley says she doesn't get recognized too
much on the streets of Atlanta. That's hard to believe, given the
catlike grace and sly almond eyes of the star of ``Elaborate Lives:
The Legend of Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, creating the role of Aida, the Nubian princess in
Disney's Elton John-Tim Rice musical at the Alliance Theatre,
Headley doesn't have a whole lot of time to stroll around the city
and attract notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show takes over your life,'' she says, tackling a salmon
steak during lunch at a Midtown restaurant, near the apartment
where she and other ``Lives'' members are living. ``You have to
plan your day backward.''
</P>
<P>
   She gets to the theater at 6:30 p.m. That means she watches
``Jerry Springer'' (a guilty addiction) at 4. At 3 she has to stop
talking to rest her vocal cords. At 2 she tries to hit the gym.
``All of a sudden you realize, `OK, I need to wake up at 5 to get
all this done,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Headley doesn't get up at 5 a.m. She can't: Aida keeps her up
too late, as the actress mentally runs through the night's show,
critiquing her own performance and the evolving production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I go to sleep with Miss Aida,'' she says with a
shake of her head. ``And I'm like, `Let me go! Go back to your
pyramid and stay there.'''
</P>
<P>
   A pop variation on the Verdi opera, ``Elaborate Lives''
elaborates on the love triangle that develops between the enslaved
Aida, her Egyptian captor Radames (Hank Stratton) and his
betrothed, the princess Amneris (Sherie Scott). Like her co-stars,
Headley has spent much of her time in Atlanta adjusting to rewrites
and new choreography and, of course, finessing John's songs.
</P>
<P>
   At a casual get-together with the songwriter and other cast
members, Headley remembers being amazed when John asked if she'd
like any changes in her ballads. ``I was just there to ask his
blessing,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the show that needs a blessing of its own is the
temperamental, hydraulically operated pyramid, which the cast has
dubbed ``Sybil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had maybe one or two nights where my heart would
break,''Headley says, recalling the early times when the set
element would crash. ``You're already trying to remember lines or
where you go next. But on top of that, I was stressed wondering,
`Is Sybil going to make it tonight?' By the fourth or fifth time, I
was getting really upset, because it wasn't fair for the
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when the director came in and reblocked the show, so it
could continue smoothly with or without the pyramid. Headley, whose
voice even offstage is a rich mix of caramel and honey, is quick to
praise the technicians, who have worked very hard trying to solve
the mechanical glitches.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Sybil's erratic behavior has generated spending
money for some of the actors, who bet on her nightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe Sherie (Scott, who plays Amneris) and Rich (Hebert, who
plays Zoser),'' Headley says of two of her co-stars. She'd been
betting the machine would crash, but Sybil performed flawlessly for
a week. ``I come offstage, and Sherie's there with her hand out,
waiting for her money.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the show has been physically demanding, Headley is used
to it. It's the second time she has created a role for Disney,
having originated the part of Nala in ``The Lion King'' on
Broadway. By comparison, ``Elaborate Lives'' is cake.
</P>
<P>
   ```Lion King' wore my body down,'' Headley says. She went from
the corseted Edwardian world of ``Ragtime'' in Toronto, in which
she understudied three-time Tony winner Audra McDonald, into Julie
Taymor's spine-bending, athletic stage vision for the Disney
adaptation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Arnold Schwarzenegger could go in there and die after
three weeks,'' Headley says. ``It's a rough show. I got two
sprained ankles and stress fractures in both legs.'' She pauses,
then laughs. ``Disney will be very happy that I'm saying this.''
But it's clearly said with affection; she hopes to return to the
show for a few weeks in December, while the next stage for
``Elaborate Lives'' is being decided.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Trinidad to a minister father and teacher mom, Headley
moved to the States as a teen when her father was assigned to a
church in Fort Wayne, Ind. ``That was a slap in the face,'' she
recalls with a smile. ``The weather, the culture, everything.''
</P>
<P>
   A churchgoer all her life, Headley has found it hard to make it
to Sunday services following two-performance Saturdays. But once,
Alliance artistic director Kenny Leon took her to his church,
Cascade United Methodist. And the pastor recognized her. ``He was
screaming `Aida' from the pulpit,'' she says with an embarrassed
giggle. ``It was so funny. I wanted to say, `No, I'm just here to
worship. There's no Aida here today _ I'll be putting her on in
about two hours.'''
</P>
<P>
   Most young actors struggle with rejection. Only 24, Headley's
big struggle has been with success. She was in her third year at
Northwestern University when her agent told her to audition for the
producers of ``Ragtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Headley mimics her agent's world-weary voice: ``She said, `Go.
They'll say you're too young, finish school. They'll call you next
year. You won't get it!'''
</P>
<P>
   She got it. She wasn't sure she wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not an easy decision, because my whole point in life
was never to leave school,'' she says. So she ran up $300 in phone
bills, calling her teachers, seeking advice. ``I was waiting for
the first `no,''' she says. ``The first `no' was going to keep me
in school. But they all said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Headley calls her six months in Toronto with ``Ragtime'' her
first true love, ``like your first boyfriend,'' she says. ``I still
warm up (vocally) to it every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Disney came calling, looking for a Nala.
</P>
<P>
   Headley's agent said, ``Go. Sing for them. They'll tell you
you're too young. You won't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   She got it. She wasn't sure she wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that she originally thought the idea of ``Lion
King'' onstage sounded silly and she'd never heard of Julie Taymor.
``I had a week or two of intense pressure,'' she remembers. ``No
sleep, I lost weight. Both sides were telling me, `Are you
crazy?''' Ultimately, Disney bought her out of the ``Ragtime''
contract, and she sees the decision as the best possible choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a quick three years, but it's my life, so I don't
see it as something phenomenal or great,'' she says. ``People are
like, `You've done two of the biggest musicals of the century in
one year.' But I don't see it like that. For me, it's just, `My
ankle hurts. This is killing me!''' She stops to laugh. ``But I do
consider it a blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, she's spoiled. She admits it.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers feeling nervous when she was getting ready to
perform ``Elaborate Lives'' in front of an audience for the first
time. ``I say this with all humility, but after `Ragtime' and `Lion
King' I did not know what it's like to see a -- itting house at the
end of a show. I had to remind myself, not everybody's show is sold
out, and not everybody gets a standing ovation every night.''
</P>
<P>
   But in her case, with standing-room-only performances of
``Elaborate Lives,'' Headley's record is now three for three.
</P>
<P>
   Most actors have rituals they perform each night. Headley's is
simple. ``I have to go center stage, to the center curtain, and
pray,'' she says. ``If I don't, I feel like Sybil will break down _
which she has. So I do it right before the curtain goes up. The
kids are always asking, `What are you doing?' But it only takes
half a second. I do it and go off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not calling all the gods,'' she says with a smile. ``Just
the one, the main guy.

 &HT;    Graham keeps the faith, if not the brimstone
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The fiery oratory that once scared us
into believing is gone. Now, a grandfather's soothing voice urges
the faithful to confess Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Graham has grown old.
</P>
<P>
   That was clear at his latest crusade last weekend in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   The sermon was the same, Graham's conviction was obvious, but
his sense of urgency was no longer palpable.
</P>
<P>
   He once paced a mile or more back and forth across the stage to
drive home his sermon calling sinners to repent. He preached a
simple _ his few critics say simplistic _ version of Christianity
for more than 60 years to hundreds of millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 79-year-old evangelist has Parkinson's disease. He
walks with a cane and sits on a high stool behind the podium to
preach. His voice is calm, almost pleading; his demeanor gentle and
self-effacing.
</P>
<P>
   In Tampa, he reminisced about earlier crusades. He told personal
stories and invited people to join him in a faith that has given
him peace. There was none of the hell fire and brimstone of the
younger Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you remember anything from these meetings,'' Graham urged
Friday night, ``remember that God loves you.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowds still come. More than 50,000 people gathered on each
of four nights at the Raymond James Stadium that is home to the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 80,000 overflowed the 65,000-seat stadium at the last
meeting on Sunday. Extra seating with remote television was set up
in a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham was preaching to the choir. Most of the audience
seemed already converted. They came to be part of history. They
came to be with an evangelical icon of enormous stature in a tribal
celebration of Protestant Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   A Billy Graham crusade is a form of evangelical fervor that he,
almost alone in the universe of preachers, made respectable.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 bay area churches worked together for nearly a
year to bring this one to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The well-oiled efficiency of the Graham organization will
continue to mount crusades long after his extraordinary run comes
to an end. But no one is likely to surpass his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Graham has preached to more people than any other person in
history. And that may be the least of the remarkable benchmarks
this profoundly humble man of God will leave as a legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina farm-boy-turned-preacher transformed the
oft-ridiculed country tent meeting into popular middle class urban
rallies. More than 200 million people came to hear him.
</P>
<P>
   He preached his old-time religion using every high-tech tool he
could muster including radio, television, satellite downlinks, and,
last weekend for the first time, the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Graham accomplished the nearly impossible. He reduced or
eliminated the distrust that various Christian groups have
historically had for one another. Multi-church cooperation is the
theme _ and the reality _ of every Graham crusade.
</P>
<P>
   He was raised a Presbyterian, ordained in the Southern Baptist
tradition and claims to feel a part of the Anglican and Christian
Missionary Alliance church.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, his sincerity converted countless Roman Catholic
churches from opposition to his crusades into eager participants.
</P>
<P>
   But arguably his greatest gift to both evangelical ministry and
to Christianity is his personal integrity. He brought honor to a
profession known as much for the sleaziness of Elmer Gantry as the
purity of the Gospel.
</P>
<P>
   In a era of questionable televangelists such as Pat Robertson
and Benny Hinn _ not to mention the disgraced Jimmy Swaggart _
there has never been a hint of scandal around Graham or his
organization.
</P>
<P>
   His few critics argue that despite his extraordinary statistics,
the world has not much changed since Graham began crusades after
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   They suggest his preaching has been great theater, classic
evangelism charged more with emotion than content and like much of
its ilk, ineffective in changing lives.
</P>
<P>
   Graham admits that cities look much the same after his crusades
as before. But he would say that saving the world was not his task.
</P>
<P>
   Simply preaching the Gospel and preaching the Gospel simply were
his marching orders.
</P>
<P>
   And he has been faithful to that task beyond anyone's
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   His well-deserved epitaph _ like that of St. Paul _ might be
found in the second New Testament letter to Timothy:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have fought the good fight. I have finished the race. I have
kept the faith.''

 &HT;    Small businesses face big threat from Y2K
 &HT;    By Kim Tyson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ While government agencies and major corporations
have been plowing millions into addressing Year 2000 computer
problems, many small-business owners are just beginning to look
into whether their companies will have disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 5 million small businesses are at risk of Year 2000 _ or
Y2K _ computer glitches, according to Wells Fargo &AMP; Co., which
commissioned a Gallup Poll survey of 500 small-business owners
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate how pressing some people think it is: Last week,
the U.S. Small Business Administration and the Internal Revenue
Service began sending letters to 6.5 million companies warning them
of possible Year 2000 problems as part of the SBA's Y2K Action
Week.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Technical Business Network hosted a conference with
100 people in attendance that explored the legal, insurance and
business issues of the problem. The business group announced plans
for the Austin Year 2000 Alliance, a forum to allow Texas
businesses to exchange information on solving Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   In case you've somehow managed to avoid any discussion about the
the Year 2000 problem, here's the crux: Some personal computers are
programmed to record only the last two digits of the year for any
date they encounter. If they're not fixed on or before Jan. 1,
2000, their automatic clocks will reset to Jan. 1, 1900. The fact
that 2000 is a leap year may complicate matters even more.
Obviously, this could cause devastating problems for any company
that uses computers _ now fixtures in 78 percent of small
companies. But it can also affect cash registers and telephone or
elevator systems that use time- or date-dependent microchips,
according to the SBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned about it,'' says Pedro Filipowsky, whose
company develops custom database software for small businesses.
``Once you start looking into all the different areas that can go
wrong it's just mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   He says a preliminary check of a small-business's computer
system takes about three to five hours, plus another couple of
hours per computer to identify what files or software applications
contain a date-related problem. If the database software needs to
be examined, a business owner may have to hire a professional at
$75 to $100 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all they have is a hardware problem, that can usually be
fixed in a few minutes. Beyond that it depends on how extensive
their date-related problems are,'' Filipowsky says. ``It can be
anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks of work.''
</P>
<P>
   He says if small-business owners delay exploring their computer
systems too long they may find it difficult to get help before the
date changes to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have to do is not bury your head in the sand;
approach it rationally, but do approach, do address the issue,''
Filipowsky says.
</P>
<P>
   GartnerGroup a high-tech consulting company, recently found that
23 percent of businesses and government agencies haven't started
any Year 2000 effort. But the proportion is far greater among what
GartnerGroup considers small companies _ 83 percent of those
waiting were businesses with fewer than 2,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The consulting group predicts at least half of all small
businesses will experience at least one serious system failure and
10 percent of these failures will last more than three days.
</P>
<P>
   Bernardine Bering, co-owner of Barton Springs Nursery, is one of
those who has looked at the consequences. She says her company
recently bought a computer-driven cash register that is
Y2K-compliant and Bering says she also has been assured by the
developers of its Counterpoint accounting software that the latest
version has taken care of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Some small businesses say they are being asked to give
assurances to their clients that they won't have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ginny's Printing and Copying, for instance, has had to assure
client Dell Computer Corp. that the problem won't disrupt Ginny's
new service center at Dell. Michael Martin, president of Ginny's,
says he has gotten promises from Xerox, which supplies his copy
machines, that it is addressing any Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   Dell is focusing on the impact of Y2K on Nov. 19 in a Webcast
from 10:30 to 11:15 a.m. at www.dell.com/breakfast. Experts from
Dell, the SBA and Microsoft Corp. will advise small businesses on
what they can do to prepare. The Webcast is expected to include
videos of small-business owners talking about how they are
addressing the Y2K problem and a question-and-answer session.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Ronay, who has a small financial consulting company in
Austin, says he found free software on the Internet to test his
system and discovered his 1994 computer's ``clock chip,'' or BIOS,
had a date problem. ``I didn't think I had a problem, but I did,''
Ronay says. ``My calculation is I need to replace either the
components of this computer or buy a new one before it gets too
close to the year 2000. If I had waited until August 1999, like
most people will probably do, there could be a run on computers or
parts.''
</P>
<P>
   One small business that has not yet tackled the chore of taking
on the Year 2000 issue is Garden-Ville of Austin Inc., a nursery
that specializes in native plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have thought about it. We now know what 2YK means . . . oh
yeah, it's Y2K,'' says Kathryn Stevens, assistant to the owner. ``I
have a file on it, but I'm not going to be able to do a lot of it
because I'm not computer-literate enough.''

 &HT;    Happy Birthday, My Sweet Baby
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Dan Neal
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ My daughter has leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have warned us that the worst might happen, but my wife,
Judie, and I try not to think about that.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we talk only about the best-case scenario: After three
years of gut-wrenching chemotherapy treatments, Nicki will be
cured.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it's hard. Despair dogs your every move when your child
has cancer, clawing just beneath the surface. Then it gnaws into
your consciousness when you least expect it. When you're driving to
work, making dinner, or just when you thought you were going to
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   But happiness peeps through as well. Like it did last week.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was Nicki's 7th birthday, and she celebrated it in the
children's cancer ward at St. Mary's Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   She wouldn't have had it any other way. All her friends were
there.
</P>
<P>
   Nurse Janet was there. She's the one who calls her
``girlfriend'' and ``Sweet Cheeks.'' The one who does her spinal
taps and other heavy-duty treatment procedures. The one she trusts
almost as much as Mom.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dave was there. He's the pharmacist who orders up those
drugs with the cold, cruel names _ Vincristine, Daunomycin,
Methotrexate. Drugs so vile the nurses have to wear rubber suits to
start the kids' intravenous lines. But to Nicki, Dr. Dave has only
one job that matters: He'll make faces, dance or tell her jokes _
anything to make her laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Nurse Pam was there. She's the one who never hurts her when she
taps into the IV port in her chest.
</P>
<P>
   Even Dr. Hector was there. He's the one who's funny because he
talks with that funny accent. He's the one her parents are trusting
with her life.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the other cancer kids were there _ her best buds
Daniella and Shardai and little Brooke, and Rachel, Anel, Alyssa,
Audrey. The ones Nicki plays Uno with, and works jigsaw puzzles
with and gets into trouble with whenever they are in the hospital
at the same time and aren't too sick to fool around.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't your typical kid bash. Most of the revelers were in
wheelchairs or trailing IV poles, so rowdy games were out. And most
of the chatter among moms centered on their children's absolute
neutrophyl count _ an immune system measurement that determines
when the kids can venture out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also the usual kid stuff: a stack of presents, a
big, messy cake, and lots of noise.
</P>
<P>
   Too much noise, in fact, for a boring old dad who had dashed
over in the middle of the work day. I stepped out into the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding Room 2512
</P>
<P>
   Been there a hundred times and the place still gives me the
creeps. At the far end of the hall I saw that little table where
the doctor gave us the leukemia speech back in June, when Nicki was
diagnosed. The different kinds. How it wrecks the blood. How the
chemo works. Any questions? Only one, but we dared not ask.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, the fish tank. Destination No. 1 for the child
just learning to walk while pushing an IV pole.
</P>
<P>
   And across the hall, Room 2512.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't looked in since June and couldn't look in now. It's the
room where Judie and I spent the two worst days of our lives _ a
brutally long Saturday and Sunday waiting on test results that
would show Nicki has cancer.
</P>
<P>
   That Monday, I would sit on the floor of that room and tell
Nicki that she had a bad germ called leukemia. As I talked, she
picked up the pieces to a stamp set she had been playing with and
put them in a plastic bag. ``All right,'' she said, sealing the bag
and handing it to me. She climbed into bed _ and into a dark,
furious funk that would last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And it was in 2512 that Monday night that Judie _ a rock of
strength and optimism all weekend _ collapsed in my arms as our
precious baby lay sleeping, the first bag of chemo dripping into
her veins. ``It hurts so much,'' she cried, her body heaving, her
sobs broken by vicious, stabbing gasps for breath. Her grief broke
my heart.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it's home
</P>
<P>
   But there was no grief Friday. Now my wife was laughing,
hollering for me to come back in the playroom. Nicki was opening
her presents.
</P>
<P>
   Bald as an egg, she flashed the same old snaggle-toothed grin
I'd seen at the 7th birthday parties of our three older children.
Four-year-old Brooke was her helper, toting packages from an
enormous pile of gifts to her friend, who sat enthroned on a
plastic chair. Rugrats dolls! An Ants-the-anteater Beanie Baby! A
Winnie-the-Pooh shirt!
</P>
<P>
   The scene of our horror now felt like home _ at least to Nicki.
</P>
<P>
   Happy birthday, my sweet baby

 &HT;    New York Times gives UT its 20th-century archives
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ To the college student who is more comfortable
staring at a computer screen than an old gray page, a recycling
center might seem to be the best place for four truckloads of
newspaper clippings.
</P>
<P>
   But the Center for American History at the University of Texas
is thrilled to be the new home to the New York Times morgue, the
old gray lady's enormous file of clippings that covers 80 years of
20th-century history. The donation will be officially announced at
a dinner tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here are the extremely well-indexed articles of
comprehensive coverage of all the major events of U.S. history as
they occurred during the major portion of the 20th century,'' said
Don Carleton, the center's director. ``It's quite a coup.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the newspaper's archives were transferred to electronic
databases, Times reporters and editors used the morgue as their
primary source of information on people, places and events. The
Times kept complete files of its articles sorted by subject from
1908 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But with all of those stories online now, the Times realized it
did not need the morgue and could not afford to maintain it. The
newspaper originally offered the voluminous archive to the New York
Public Library, which didn't have room for the 22 million clippings
and more than 2,500 linear feet of paper.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the center's reputation for storing huge media
archives, the Times asked UT to take it on. The clip files of the
New York Journal-American and the New York Herald-Tribune, two
Times rivals that are now defunct, are already housed there, as are
the papers of CBS News legends Walter Cronkite and Andy Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted UT,'' said Linda Amster, director of research at the
Times. ``The center is known for having morgues and knowing how to
store them. Our concern was for the preservation of the clips.''
</P>
<P>
   The clips include large files on many Texas topics, including 25
cubic feet of clippings on Lyndon Baines Johnson. ``This gives the
center really one of the great newspaper collections in the
country,'' Carleton said.

 &HT;    Pastor who performed `virginity check' on teen faces prison
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A pastor who performed a ``virginity
check'' on a teenage member of his Delray Beach church was found
guilty Tuesday of felony sexual activity with a child and faces 12
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Joseph Millien, 51, sat erect and motionless as the
verdict was read. He undid his tie and calmly passed it to his
attorney when the judge revoked his bond and ordered him jailed
until sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   The charge is a first degree felony because the jury found found
Millien was acting in the role of a pastor and custodian of the
girl when she was molested in church offices. The pastor was
acquitted of another count of disrobing and rubbing against the
17-year-old girl in a second encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Church members said virginity checks on girls is a cultural
practice in Haiti, where Millien lived before moving to Delray
Beach in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Haiti it's not against the law,'' said Marie Rodriguez, a
member of Millien's Full Gospel Assembly Church. ``All the parents
do that to their children.''
</P>
<P>
   In a confession he later retracted, Millien told Delray Beach
detectives in 1997 that he tested the girl's virginity even though
he had no medical expertise. He denied having any other sexual
contact with the girl.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors, who asked to re-hear the taped confession during their
two hours of deliberation, reached verdicts that matched Millien's
own words as to what he did and didn't do to the girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury obviously listened to the statement,'' Assistant
State Attorney Andy Slater said. ``I am pleased with the verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   The felony carries a maximum 30 years in prison but sentencing
guidelines call for six to 12 years for first-time offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Millien's attorney, Richard Lubin, said he was disappointed
Circuit Judge Howard Berman would not allow him to bring witnesses
before the jury to say that the charges against Millien were
motivated by a group seeking to take control of his 250-member
church.
</P>
<P>
   Lubin said the witnesses would have testified they were offered
money by Millien's enemies if they accused him of sexual
misconduct. Three females testified in court that the pastor
sexually abused them, but two of the incidents were in the late
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge denied our defense,'' Lubin said. ``We feel we have
an excellent (case for) appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman ordered Millien to jail until sentencing in about 30
days. Lubin said he will request a bond hearing.

 &HT;    Livestock industry rallies around roast to up beef sales
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ With the livestock business taking a pounding,
beef producers are hoping a new savior will come from an old
standby.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the roast?
</P>
<P>
   Steakhouses may be hotter than jalapenos, but the meat they use
accounts for only one-quarter of the cow. The rest, known as the
chuck (the front end) and the round (the back end), isn't nearly as
popular.
</P>
<P>
   The chuck and round is carved into thick roasts, the kind
millions of families once teamed with carrots and potatoes and
tossed into crock pots and Dutch ovens.
</P>
<P>
   But as more women took jobs outside the home, slow-cooking
dishes such as roasts gave way to quick and convenient foods.
What's more, beef's regal place in the American palate has eroded
over the years: Per capita beef consumption has dropped 12 percent
since 1980, while chicken and turkey have soared by 52 percent and
77 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   When roasts don't sell, processors usually turn the chuck and
round into ground beef. While that may be good for hamburger
lovers, it's bad for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole muscle pot roast will sell from $1.29 to $2 a pound,''
said Mary Adolph, a marketing executive for the National
Cattleman's Beef Association. ``When we grind it, the value goes
down substantially.''
</P>
<P>
   So now, with steer prices at a 12-year low, industry promoters
plan a new approach to return the roast to its former glory.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from the poultry business, which introduced such
easy-to-make foods as the chicken nugget and the turkey cutlet,
beef producers are coming out with new products.
</P>
<P>
   One item being tested is a precooked pot roast that takes seven
minutes to microwave. Another is a ``rotissaroast,'' beef's answer
to the rotisserie chicken craze.
</P>
<P>
   The Cattleman's Beef Association also plans to push the idea of
cooking a roast instead of a ham or turkey for holiday meals.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the group's efforts, prospects for a roast renaissance
appear limited. Doug Randolph, the meat buyer for Cub Foods, said
the cuts have always been seasonal items.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, when grills beckon and people don't want to use
their ovens, roast sales plummet while steaks leap. The trend
reverses itself in colder months.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph said beef has the added handicap of intimidating
customers. Many cuts can seem difficult to prepare, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear a lot of questions from customers in front of the beef
case as opposed to poultry and pork,'' he said. ``We need to do our
job helping them figure out what to prepare for dinner and figuring
out how to fix it.''

 &HT;    Comprehensive achievement test scores high with officials
 &HT;    WITH GRAPHICS
 &HT;    By Mary Ellen Flannery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Try this: Denise and Nona play soccer.
Denise scored four goals this year and Nona scored five, and
together they scored half of the goals scored by the team.
</P>
<P>
   How many goals did the team score?
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the more challenging questions posed to
fifth-graders on the new Florida Comprehensive Achievement Test.
It's likely that if it was asked of Palm Beach County students,
many would have answered incorrectly. Students here and across
Florida got more questions wrong on the FCAT than right when they
took it this year.
</P>
<P>
   But state and district officials like the FCAT, in a way that
only testing officials can truly appreciate a test, partially
because it is hard and their students aren't expected to do well at
first. One state official calls it ``an evolutionary step
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We get excited about new tests that have the impact of
improving student performance,'' said Marc Baron, director of the
school district's research and evaluation department.
</P>
<P>
   The FCAT is different and better than fill-in-the-bubble
standardized tests such as the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills
or the High School Competency Test _ both of which the FCAT
eventually will replace _ because it makes students think, said Tom
Fisher, director of the state Department of Education's testing
department.
</P>
<P>
   It was developed in response to Florida's Sunshine State
Standards that raised the expectations for students. For example,
the standards for math for all fifth-graders say they should be
able to identify number patterns and ``make predictions'' using
those patterns. A major function of the FCAT is to measure how a
student is doing in relation to the standards, rather than to other
students.
</P>
<P>
   Using the test results, the state DOE can also identify schools
that aren't performing well, and district officials can determine
which teachers are doing effective jobs, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   On the math section, which is given to fifth-, eighth- and
10th-graders, not all of the questions are multiple-choice.
Fifth-graders have to understand a concept and from that draw bar
graphs or finish patterns. On the reading section, given to
fourth-, eighth- and 10th-graders, students have to explain in
writing the lessons they learned from it. That is judged on
accuracy and detail.
</P>
<P>
   These are not questions that students typically see on a
standardized test, said Patricia Ordonez-Felicia, a math teacher at
John F. Kennedy Middle School who reviewed questions for the state.
But they are the type of questions that a regular eighth-grader
should be able to answer, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't try to make it fancy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the FCAT does not compare a student's achievement to other
students, parents will not get a percentile score.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the parents will get a number between 100 and 500, and
that score will be placed into one of five achievement levels.
Children who score in Level One haven't mastered basic reading and
math skills. A Level Five score would be best _ it means a child
could answer the more challenging questions correctly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be nice to have clear, statewide standards on what it
means to be proficient in reading and math,'' Baron said.
</P>
<P>
   The students took the test in January; the results were released
in May. Statewide and locally, students scored an average 300
points of a possible 500. At the time, the numbers didn't mean
much. But last week, each student's score was explained using the
newly defined achievement levels. Those achievement levels may be
adopted by the state in November.
</P>
<P>
   Most Palm Beach County students scored in the two lowest levels.
No more than 7 percent of Palm Beach County students scored in the
top level in reading or math. Black students scored worse than
white students, but many white students also brought home low
scores.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity among white, black and poor student scores isn't
unusual _ most tests show an achievement gap _ and it raises a
familiar question: Is the test biased against black or poor
students? Does it ask questions about bouillabaisse or lacrosse, or
any subjects that might be more familiar to white or more affluent
students?
</P>
<P>
   Fisher says no. The test is ``not a vehicle causing the
problem,'' but it is part of the solution, he said. It reveals the
disparity so that teachers and school officials can do something
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Are testing officials disappointed by the dismal showing? Not a
bit, Fisher said. They would have been disappointed if students had
scored very well. Great scores are the sign of a poor test, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (the scores) get high enough, it's time to throw the test
in the trash. The whole idea is to set standards and move forward,
set standards and move forward again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, state officials want all students in the top three
levels, but most in Level Three _ like half of a bell curve, Baron
said. And as hard as the FCAT is supposed to be, he said that's not
an impossible goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be amazed at what (students) can do,'' he said.

 &HT;    UT implements program to ease freshman fear
 &HT;    By Angela Shah
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A problem that has dogged the University of
Texas for years slapped freshman Cristina Maas in the face when she
walked into a philosophy class of 160 students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first week, I was, like, scared to death,'' Maas said. ``I
walked into class and there were all those faces that I didn't
recognize. It was a really intimidating situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Auditorium-size classes have long been the standard freshman
fare at UT _ the nation's largest university _ and are believed to
be one culprit keeping students from graduating. They also have
thwarted the school's efforts to attain a stellar ranking
nationally. On a campus with almost 50,000 students, UT's 6,744
freshmen often get lost in the shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   But UT administrators hope a new program started this fall and
designed to better assimilate freshmen into university life will
change that. Freshmen Interest Groups, or FIGs, aim to make UT feel
smaller by grouping students in similar majors in the same set of
classes. The program would be one of the university's largest
efforts to solve its freshmen retention problem on a grand scale.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the groups, Maas said, she quickly became as
comfortable on campus as in her hometown neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I walk in and I see at least 20 people I know,'' she said.
``I have a better sense of home.''
</P>
<P>
   That comfort level is key to keeping freshmen in school and,
more important, to helping them succeed. Only 30 percent of UT
freshmen graduate in four years. In five years, that number rises
to about 63 percent. Administrators say that's not high enough.
''The biggest complaint we get is that UT doesn't feel like a
home,'' said Nina Bhatia, a humanities and English senior who
volunteers as a peer mentor for a FIG on campus. ``This is a way to
show them that they belong to the university.''
</P>
<P>
   The university's focus on freshmen arrives as research
universities are being scrutinized for not paying enough attention
to undergraduate education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to help students adjust to life at the university by
giving them a small cohort of people with whom they share their
experiences,'' said Jim Vick, UT vice president for student
affairs. ``We have the potential to reach out to a lot of
students.''
</P>
<P>
   Maas, like so many other students, had attended UT's summer
orientation, where freshmen get nickel tours of UT, learn a
smattering of the school's traditions and register for fall
classes. During the orientation sessions, students in the Liberal
Arts, Engineering, Natural Sciences and Fine Arts colleges were
told of the FIGs and encouraged to apply. Maas took UT up on the
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was going to take these classes anyway,'' Maas said of the
humanities courses offered in her Traditions and Beliefs FIG.
``This way I get to meet people, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In the program, 30 groups of up to 25 students each take three
related courses that are linked to students' majors. Some of the
groups' offerings have catchy names such as The X-Files (psychology
and astronomy), The Bold &AMP; The Beautiful (classical mythology and
American photography) and Law &AMP; Order (sociology/juvenile
delinquence and English/crime and punishment).
</P>
<P>
   Each group has a volunteer peer adviser like Bhatia, an
upperclassmanwho is the students' liaison with administrators and
faculty. Once a week, these advisers meet for an hour to give tours
of the libraries or simply to socialize. As a result, many UT
freshmen say they have formed a community tethered by classes and
reinforced with e-mail and phone lists of classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was worried about being a number,'' said Casey Meyers, a
freshman government student, who is in the Changing Face of
Medicine group for pre-med students, ``but this took care of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Maas, the liberal arts freshman, joined a dozen or so
of her FIG classmates at the Texas Union. Sitting around a table
savoring scoops of Amy's ice cream, the multiracial student group
resembled an archetypal Bennetton ad sculpted by Madison Avenue.
The gregarious group members drew out the wallflowers, razzing each
other like old friends. Soon, they hope to get a weekly dinner
group going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think that the students have bonded faster than
usual,'' Bhatia said. ``To use the most cliche(accent)d word at the
university, they have established a greater sense of community than
I think freshmen normally do.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar interest groups have flourished at other state
institutions such as University of Oregon in Eugene, where they
were created in 1982 and involve one-third of incoming freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Though Oregon only has 13,000 undergraduates, just one-fourth of
UT's student population, Jack Bennett, director of Oregon's FIG
program, said both institutions ``have the same issues of
connecting students to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1,100 students at Oregon are enrolled in FIG programs that
include a College 101 class, tours of campus libraries and other
student resources and seminars on alcohol abuse and sexuality.
Students are even expected to write a four-year college career
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program creates an attitude of curiosity,'' Bennett said.
``It begins with a group of peers that take ideas seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof, Bennett added, is in graduation rates. About 45.3
percent of freshmen who participated in Oregon's program graduated
in four years, compared with 34.7 percent of non-FIG students.
</P>
<P>
   UTprofessors said they are optimistic about their FIGs. Billy
Wood, who teaches FIG students in mechanical engineering and is
also the undergraduate adviser for the College of Engineering, said
test scores this semester are the highest ever.
</P>
<P>
   Al Martinish, Maas' philosophy professor, regularly has lunch
and coffee with the FIG students in his class.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of banter going on,'' Martinish said. ``They're
very comfortable debating with each other even though they have
very different attitudes on the things we cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Some professors are already finding ways to improve the program.
Tommie Meyer, an assistant instructor of American Studies who
teaches in the Project Planet groupfor natural science
students,said he had to reconstruct his class plans because the
freshmen were ill-prepared to handle a seminar course. His students
were unable to openly debate discussion topics. He admits he's
frustrated that he was left to do most of the talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent all this time preparing for this class and then . . .
I threw out my entire syllabus,'' Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, FIGs not only help students learn and stay in
school, they provide invaluable college experiences that will serve
students well after they leave the university, Oregon's Bennett
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Oregon, FIG students have moved out and gotten apartments
together (after graduation),'' Bennett said. ``They remain pretty
good friends. Some have even gotten married.''

 &HT;    NetSolve plans stock offering
 &HT;    By Lori Hawkins
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ NetSolve Inc. of Austin is hoping to defy the
odds by selling stock to the public in the worse environment for
such sales in a decade. The company, which sets up and manages
large computer networks, plans to raise up to $51.75 million with
the stock sale, according to its registration statement filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   NetSolve's chief executive said the company realizes that it's a
tough market for public stock offerings. ``We're going to have to
see what the market conditions are,'' said Craig Tysdal. ``Clearly,
the market conditions haven't been supportive of pricing tech
IPOs.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Austin Internet company Vignette Corp. withdrew its
IPO filing citing the volatile stock market. PcOrder.com, an Austin
electronic commerce company, is still hoping to raise $35 million
through an offering.
</P>
<P>
   According to the investment firm Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
about 75 companies have pulled their IPOs since August, and 15 have
gone public in that period.
</P>
<P>
   NetSolve, founded in 1987, has about 125 employees in Austin.
The company lost $2.2 million on revenue of $14.5 million in fiscal
1998. For the first six months of fiscal 1999, the company lost
$96,000 on revenue of $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   NetSolve would use the proceeds for general business purposes,
according to the filing. It may use some money to acquire
technology or other businesses. Underwriters are BancBoston
Robertson Stephens and Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. Legal work is being
handled by Worsham, Forsythe &AMP; Wooldridge of Dallas and Foley, Hoag
&AMP; Eliot of Boston.

 &HT;    New Braunfels newspaper doing business in a strip mall
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ The sign seen from the road still says
``A Cut Above,'' as in a haircut, as in what used to be produced in
the strip mall that is the new home of the New Braunfels
Herald-Zeitung, flood victim.
</P>
<P>
   Above the door, there's a sign noting the shop's new tenant, but
people still ask if they're in the right spot when they come in to
buy a classified ad or pay for their subscription.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this the right place?'' one woman asks, clearly confused.
``Is this the Herald?''
</P>
<P>
   The strip mall is the third unlikely home for this
circulation-10,000 newspaper since six feet of water surged up from
the Dry Comal Creek and swamped its red brick office. Like most of
their neighbors, the newspaper's employees have been busy salvaging
valuables, cleaning up and getting on with their lives after one of
the worst floods in Central Texas history roared through town.
</P>
<P>
   They've also been back at work every day since, putting out the
city's only local newspaper without missing an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how proud I am of them. I just felt it was
too important for a community that had been devastated so bad not
to have their newspaper come out,'' says Doug Toney, the Herald's
editor and publisher, who along with five others waded through
several feet of water Oct. 17 to salvage the computers that are the
brains of the newspaper. Nearly everything else at the
award-winning 146-year-old paper was lost in the deluge.
</P>
<P>
   Reporter Bill O'Connell showed up for work early on the day that
18 inches of rain fell, ready to file a quick story on some
scattered road closings and get back home.
</P>
<P>
   He kept an ear to the police scanner, updating his story when
another road was closed, not thinking that his workplace was in
danger. By the afternoon, water outside the building rose high
enough to seep in around the doors.
</P>
<P>
   p
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you looked outside, you'd thinart of that,'' said
Margaret Edmonson, the Herald's managing editor. ``For us, there
was never really any question. That's what we were supposed to do,
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take at least a year to repair the old building, still
strewn with notebooks and negatives and soggy from the flood. Toney
estimates the newspaper suffered at least $2 million in damage,
only about half of which was covered by flood insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But, the plain-speaking publisher said, don't make too much of
that victim business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is this isn't our home,'' he says. ``The fact that
people lost their homes is a hell of a lot more significant. We're
just doing our jobs.''

 &HT;    Jeepers, creepers, unearthly peepers!
 &HT;    By Scott Benarde
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Earlier this month, WIRK's morning drive
man J.D. Pelletier walked into a Winn-Dixie, approached an
employee, tapped her on the shoulder and asked for something for
his aching eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The employee screamed.
</P>
<P>
   This happened on the air, of course. But J.D. was just having
fun with his WildEyes, contact lenses with attitude.
</P>
<P>
   With eight styles available _ including the living dead-looking
White-Outs which J.D. wore, Hypnotica (think Vertigo-like spirals),
Pool Shark (they look like eight-balls), Wildfire and Cat Eyes _
customers are buying the lenses to enhance Halloween costumes and
amuse family, friends and co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wanted a pair of contacts like this for a while,'' says
20-year-old Alex Gentry of Delray Beach. Gentry was influenced by
the villain in the film The Last Action Hero. ``It was cool,''
Gentry says, how the guy's eyes kept changing color and design.
</P>
<P>
   He opted for White-Outs, the most popular design until the Cat
Eyes lenses (think Michael Jackson in his classic Thriller video)
hit stores in early September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were the best ones,'' says Gentry. ``They made
me look more sinister than the other ones. Also, Halloween's coming
and I want to be a zombie.''
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to wear them to work _ he's an assistant engineer
_ and to the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale, where he takes
computer animation classes.
</P>
<P>
   WildEyes hit stores in February after a year of development by
Wesley Jessen, a company that has been making contacts since 1948.
In the late '80s, the company began making special effects lenses
for films such as Wolf, Interview With The Vampire, Death Becomes
Her as well as the Star Trek movies.
</P>
<P>
   Patients noticed the oddball eyeballs in films and well-heeled
customers began paying specialists $800 to $2,000 to have
special-effects lenses custom made.
</P>
<P>
   Contact lens maker Wesley Jessen figured a way to mass produce
them and lower costs. Its Halloween ad campaign features WildEyes
for $99 a pair.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   As he crossed the finish line as the 1996 Olympic marathon
champion in Atlanta, Josia Thugwane of South Africa found his life
undergoing the same tumultuous change as his country's political
system.
</P>
<P>
   In that instant, everything was different. Nothing would ever be
the same.
</P>
<P>
   An athlete consigned by apartheid to living in a tin shack, a
man who did not read or write, was soon able to command an income
of half a million dollars a year. An unknown before the race, he
was now the first black in his country ever to win a gold medal. He
was greeted by President Nelson Mandela and was elevated into a
galvanizing symbol of a new, democratic South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a nation still grappling with unity and reconciliation,
Josia was not a hero for blacks, he was a hero for all South
Africans,'' said Banele Sindani, the executive director of the
South African track and field federation. ``He was someone we could
all rally around. After something like that, you don't go backward.
It has contributed to healing the wounds of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   But, upon his return home, there seemed to be as much concern as
celebration regarding Thugwane, (pronounced tug-WANNE) who has said
that he grew confused. Would this tidal wave of change capsize his
career? Would unsavory people try to exploit him? Could he hold
onto this money and his motivation? Would the vestiges of apartheid
suck at him insidiously, like an undertow?
</P>
<P>
   Not everything has gone as smoothly as the Olympic marathon.
After the Atlanta Games, Thugwane was beaten at home in a traffic
scuffle after he inadvertently cut off another driver; this
followed a scary incident before the Olympics when he was carjacked
and shot, a bullet grazing and scarring his chin.
</P>
<P>
   And in a country that has been slow to fulfill its promises of
houses and jobs, Thugwane has found that people wanted his money,
whether he wanted to give it to them or not. Some were beggars, he
said; others attempted to rob his wife when he left home to train
for races.
</P>
<P>
   His incipient efforts at reading and writing ended after two and
a half months when a South African company that promotes literacy
seemed more interested in using his name for promotion than real
education, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, by all accounts, his life has remained on a steady course.
</P>
<P>
   Thugwane, who is 27, has run his fastest races since Atlanta,
winning the Fukuoka Marathon in Japan last December and setting a
South African national record. With a personal best of 2 hours 7
minutes 28 seconds, he enters Sunday's New York City Marathon as
the fastest competitor in a deep field of Kenyan, Mexican, Moroccan
and Spanish challengers.
</P>
<P>
   He has quit his custodial job at a coal mine to become a
full-time athlete. A member of the Ndebele tribe, he has learned to
speak English. He has moved his family from a squalid township,
first to a house bought for him by the mine and then into a
comfortable suburb of Johannesburg, where an alarm system and
private security guards protect against intruders. He bought
another house for his parents. Where once he lived without
electricity and running water, he now has a cellular phone, a fax
and a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``More money can mean more problems, but there are a lot of poor
people with empty stomachs at home,'' said the 5-foot-2-inch,
99-pound Thugwane, who has been training for two months at altitude
in Albuquerque, N.M. ``People see me making money from running and
now they think they can make money, too.''
</P>
<P>
   After Atlanta, Thugwane settled on an American-based agent, Luis
Posso, of Tampa, Fla., who works with a South African associate,
Jaques Malan. Posso said that Thugwane, his wife, Zodwa, and their
four daughters are set financially for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, he was always worried, about money, about the safety
of his family,'' Posso said. ``Now I see him as a happy guy with no
worries.''
</P>
<P>
   Thugwane has signed a shoe contract with Nike, and has another
endorsement deal with Coca-Cola to conduct grass-roots clinics in a
country where apartheid left only one all-weather running track for
all of black South Africa. Once he could not afford his own running
shoes; now he hands them out free to children, Posso said.
</P>
<P>
   While some of his other clients go through expensive cars like
socks, Posso said, Thugwane wants nothing more exotic than a Toyota
Camry. It is this life of simple humility that has kept his running
from detouring into the potholes of sudden wealth and fame, Sindani
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Josia has not lost his humility,'' Sindani said. ``I believe
that will take him to an even higher level. I'll say it now, I
won't be surprised if he wins the Olympic marathon a second time in
Sydney'' in September of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Thugwane would like to be included more often in clinics given
by the South African track federation, which he said sometimes
ignores him. Posso said there would be a renewed effort to teach
him to read and write. For now, though, Thugwane is concentrating
on New York. He ran here in 1995, but dropped out after 18 miles
because of the bitter cold.
</P>
<P>
   Heat doesn't bother him, as he showed in the suffocating air of
Atlanta. And now he has apparently also conditioned himself against
the cold. On Oct. 4, he won the Great Northern half marathon in
1:02:32 on a chilly, rainy day in Newcastle, England. The forecast
for Sunday in New York is for temperatures climbing through the
50's with high clouds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know now I can run in the cold,'' Thugwane said.
</P>
<P>
   He injured a calf muscle days before the London Marathon last
spring and dropped out after 10 miles. ``Everything is fine, so I
don't talk too much,'' said Thugwane, who has paid for two training
partners in Albuquerque, where he said he has prepared for New York
by running for two hours six days a week.
</P>
<P>
   He longs to return home after the race, but at least he can feel
reasonably certain that his family will be protected in his
absence. When he lived near the Koornfontein coal mine east of
Johannesburg, he said, people would read in the newspaper or see on
television that he was out of town, training for a marathon, and
they tried to rob his wife. Others left animal parts and other
things on his lawn, as if to bring him bad luck, Posso said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided it was not safe,'' said Thugwane, who moved to
Johannesburg early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Posso has broached the idea of moving to Albuquerque
permanently, but Thugwane has so far declined. He wants to stay in
South Africa. And now that he has opened the door for others,
Thugwane is delighted to hold it open while his countrymen walk
through. He declined to run in the 1997 world marathon
championships, he said, giving his spot to another runner who had
not had the same exultant opportunity to compete against an
international field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gold medal opened many doors; I can go anywhere,''
Thugwane said. ``Other young men haven't had that chance. I want to
give them the chance.''

SUN MICROSYSTEMS INTRODUCING A NEW VERSION OF UNIX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sun Microsystems plans to unveil a new version
of its Solaris operating system Tuesday in an effort to capitalize
on Microsoft's delays on its newest version of its NT operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   The new Solaris program, which is Sun's version of the Unix
operating system for its Sparc-based systems and Intel-based
servers, has gained increasing market share in the Unix world in
the last year largely based on the growth of the Internet server
and enterprise computing market.
</P>
<P>
   A number of companies are competing for the rapidly growing
high-end corporate computing market, including I.B.M., Hewlett
Packard and Compaq Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is also trying to enter the high-end market with a new
version of its Windows NT operating system. But Microsoft has been
delayed by more than a year and there are industry reports that the
system continues to have problems.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several analysts said an announcement by I.B.M. on
Monday that it planned to join forces with Sequent Computer and the
Santa Cruz Operation, a Unix software company, indicateed that the
market was moving back toward Unix because of Microsoft's delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the Microsoft marketing machine has made NT a
contender,'' said Andrew Allison, an industry analyst, ``but nobody
in their right mind would use NT for critical applications at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun executives said they planned to name the newest version of
Solaris, which features 64-bit addressing and as a result can
handle vast data sets, Solaris 7.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that this is a significant jump in the company's
numbering scheme _ the last version was 2.6 _ Sun's officials
disputed the obvious marketing connotation of the number 7 with
respect to the next version of Microsoft's Windows NT, which is
scheduled to be 5.0.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Zander, president of Sun Microsystems, said, ``We believe we
have a three year lead on Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Most industry analysts contend that such a figure is optimistic.
Yet there is evidence that Sun is continuing to pick up market
share against all three of its closest Unix competitors for large
enterprise computer operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, Sun grew faster, at 37 percent, than all
other server vendors except Dell Computer. Sun passed
Hewlett-Packard in the second quarter to lead the industry in Unix
revenues for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Zander also said he believed that Microsoft would have
significant difficulties meeting stability goals necessary for
corporate use. The current version of NT is reported to have more
than 35 million lines of code, increasing the chances of software
errors that will plague developers.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the version of Solaris scheduled to begin shipping
on Tuesday will have between 12 million and 13 million lines of
code.
</P>
<P>
   Separately I.B.M., Sequent and the Santa Cruz Operation agreed
to develop a single software operating system that will control
computers running both Intel computer chips and I.B.M.'s own
non-Intel based microprocessors. In addition, the partners said a
variety of other computer makers will use the new Unix system in
their own machines, including Unisys, Groupe Bull, Thomson-CSF,
Acer and Fujitsu's ICL unit.

 Microsoft Hopes New Name Will Jazz Up Software  
 By Benny Evangelista   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an effort to extend the Windows brand even further, Microsoft
Corp. yesterday said it is changing the name of its operating
system for businesses from Windows NT to Windows 2000 and
introduced an operating system for smart cards.
</P>
<P>
   The name change, announced by Microsoft officials in San
Francisco, is aimed at creating the same consumer awareness for the
more powerful NT operating systems that Microsoft now has with its
Windows 95 /98 PC operating software.
</P>
<P>
   And at a Paris trade show, Microsoft launched its first
operating system for smart cards _ which contain microchips that
store personal or financial information.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will compete in the chip card market with systems
based on Sun Microsystem's Java software. The worldwide market for
chip cards will jump from $1.4 billion in 1997 to $6.8 billion in
2002, according to Dataquest Inc. of San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Elgan, editor of Windows magazine, said the two
announcements get rid of a ``bad name'' (NT was short for new
technology) and signal a further move by Microsoft to create one
standard in the minds of all consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming increasingly clear that Microsoft really does
want to put a Microsoft operating system on anything that is even
remotely computerlike,'' Elgan said. ``They want to be the center
of the universe. They want to be the ocean that everyone swims
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which is on trial in Washington on federal antitrust
charges that it misused its monopoly position with Windows 95 and
98, announced it is changing all of its business operating software
to Windows 2000, with specific products taking on the name of the
markets they serve.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Windows NT Server becomes Windows 2000 Server,
while Windows NT Workstation becomes Windows 2000 Professional. The
company also announced a new product called Windows 2000 Datacenter
Server, aimed at bigger corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Beilinson, Microsoft's Windows 2000 product manager, said
company research showed business customers didn't fully understand
Windows NT and confused it with alternative operating systems like
Unix.
</P>
<P>
   The new Windows 2000 name brings the old NT more in line with
Windows 95/98 in the minds of consumers and businesses, he said.
Beilinson added that future versions of Windows 98 might be called,
for example, ``Windows 2030 Consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Elgan said the name change may also mean a future ``Windows 2003
Home, or Windows 2003 Family or Windows 2003 Kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The name change is purely perception manipulation,'' Elgan
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum, Microsoft unveiled a Smart
Card for Windows, an operating system with a memory capacity of 4.5
kilobytes. The smart card system is smaller than Windows CE, which
runs on 300 kilobytes of memory.
</P>
<P>
   During an announcement at the Cartes '98 smart card trade show
in Paris, Microsoft also said 20 hardware companies now make smart
card products that will use the system, including two of the
biggest, France's Gemplus and Schlumberger Industries.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said it will cost $2 to $5 to produce a card using
Smart Card for Windows, compared to $15 for Java-based cards.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the smart card market is in now Europe, where they are
used as prepaid phone cards and bank cards. But analysts have said
Microsoft's entry may hasten development of the smart card market
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another facet of Microsoft's long-running campaign to
make Windows omnipresent,'' said analyst Christopher Galvan of
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.

 Health Industry Urged to Embrace Internet  
 By Dan Fost   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A pair of powerful voices from the worlds of computing and
medicine _ Intel Corp. Chairman Andrew Grove and former Surgeon
General C. Everett Koop _ said yesterday the health care industry
needs to follow its customers onto the technology bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tens of millions of consumers are online,'' Grove told a press
conference at Internet Health Day, an event that drew 700 people
and 20 health-related technology companies to the Hyatt Embarcadero
Hotel in San Francisco. ``Members of the health care community can
either participate in this revolution or become bystanders to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to a third of all Internet users seek out health and medical
information online, and their numbers are growing by 70 percent
annually, according to research by ING Baring Furman Selz LLC.
</P>
<P>
   Koop, who is now a scholar at Dartmouth University and an
entrepreneur who's founded a health-related Web site at
www.drkoop.com, hailed the Internet as a way for patients to go
beyond what their doctors tell them.
</P>
<P>
   Koop said he's always told patients, ``Take charge of your
health.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day of managed care, I can add, `If you don't, nobody
else will,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the health care industry has been reluctant to embrace
computing, a new crop of startups is springing up to offer
health-related information to online consumers.
</P>
<P>
   BabyCenter, a San Francisco startup for new and expectant
parents, showed yesterday that it's moving from merely providing
information to adding electronic commerce to its Web site. ``We
just closed a $10 million round'' of venture financing, said Matt
Glickman, 32, the chief executive and founder of the 55-employee
company. ``People see huge potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's esteemed Mayo Clinic was on hand to tout its newest
offering, Web sites that employers can link to to give workers
information about wellness and how to prevent health problems. The
clinic, a nonprofit venture, also has a public site with
information for the general public.
</P>
<P>
   For the workplace site, companies like Intel, Dow Corning,
Lucent Technologies and Dell Computer have already signed up,
according to Michael Casey of Mayo HealthQuest. ``As more and more
people have PCs and Internet access, it's just a natural
progression,'' Casey said.
</P>
<P>
   That certainly is Intel's hope. Grove acknowledged that for the
world's largest maker of computer chips, which sponsored
yesterday's event, ``it's in our enlightened self-interest that
this process should go on. It's another reason for people to own
and use computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Grove also acknowledged that, on the issue of health, his
interest is as much personal as it is economic.
</P>
<P>
   He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1994 and has spoken
publicly about how he's followed a course of treatment that is
sometimes at odds with his doctors' recommendations, such as
foregoing surgery in favor of hormone therapy, high-dose radiation
and a new diet. He said yesterday that his health was fine.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 article he wrote for Fortune magazine, Grove told how
he used the CompuServe online service to gather information and get
support while he struggled with his diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I experienced the powers of it,'' he said yesterday. ``I was
overwhelmed by the amount of information that was available.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers going online for health information must exercise
caution, experts said. ``The right information and the wrong
information glows on the computer screen with the same intensity,''
Koop said.
</P>
<P>
   He urged people to take information to their doctor for
validation, although he also cautioned patients not to be ``health
nuts who bring in reams of information.''
</P>
<P>
   David Ansley, medical editor of OnHealth Network Co., a Web site
based in Seattle, said consumers should not just seek advice from
doctors on the Web, but also look to journalists and to fellow
patients. ``For breast cancer patients, women who have been through
it will tell them things the hospital and the doctor aren't going
to tell them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grove uses a simple test before relying on a Web site for
information. ``When I get on a Web site, I ask it questions to
which I know the answer,'' he said. ``If the Web site coughs up the
wrong answer, I'm out of there.''

 NetRatings Joins Nielsen to Track Web Audiences  
 By Carol Emert   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NetRatings Inc., the underdog in the Web-ratings business, is
teaming up with Nielsen Media Research, the well-known television
ratings company, to track Web audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The companies' announcement of a strategic alliance yesterday
came just two weeks after Media Metrix, the top Web
audience-measurement company, announced a merger with No. 2 ranked
Relevant Knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   All of the companies use panels of computer users to project
which Web sites receive the most visitors. They also identify key
demographic information about surfers such as their age, gender and
household incomes.
</P>
<P>
   NetRatings of Milpitas has been criticized for its research
methodology, particularly its small panel size, which includes
3,500 people, compared with 40,000 for Media Metrix. Nielsen of New
York, meanwhile, has been trying to launch a Web measurement
service for about two years but has not gotten it off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The new alliance will combine Nielsen's methodology and
NetRatings' tracking technology into a service called Nielsen
NetRatings.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen will take a ``significant equity position'' in
NetRatings, and two Nielsen executives will join NetRatings' board.
However, the companies will remain separate entities. Financial
details were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Monahan, of the San Francisco interactive ad agency Left
Field, said there appears to be enough Web business to support both
Media Metrix, which is headquartered in New York, and Nielsen
NetRatings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We subscribe to Relevant Knowledge and to NetRatings'' because
they offer slightly different services, said Monahan, a media
supervisor. ``It's almost going to be a question of personal
preference.''

Texas politicians venture out onto the Web 
By Gregory Kallenberg  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Mindy Tucker listens for the sound of the
political future, she hears millions of screeches _ the screeches
of modems all over Texas logging onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely see a time, not so far away, where Web sites are
a permanent part of any and all campaigns,'' said Tucker, deputy
communications director of Gov. George W. Bush's re-election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 7 million people connected to the Internet in
Texas, the Web is quickly becoming the newest pulpit for candidates
preaching the word. More candidates than ever are using
communication tools such as e-mail and Web pages to further their
political platform.
</P>
<P>
   While many experts predict the 2000 election will be the first
election deeply affected by the Internet, impatient, trailblazing
candidates are testing the Web with the hope that being in
cyberspace will translate into votes.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent national survey done by Campaigns and Elections, a
trade publication for the political industry, 63.3 percent of
candidates polled said they already had a Web site, with another
20.7 percent saying they expected to have one.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Faucheux, editor-in-chief of Campaigns and Elections, added
that more Republicans than Democrats have sites and that
Republicans were spending more on the design of their sites.
Candidates on the East Coast were more likely to have a campaign
site than those elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a site doesn't so much say whether a candidate is
technologically hip as it answers to the general population whether
or not a campaign is connected to the real world,'' said Jonathan
Coopersmith, an associate professor of history at Texas A&AMP;M
University. Coopersmith's academic focus is on how technology
affects politics.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Shafer, deputy editor of Slate, an online political
magazine, agreed with Coopersmith but said he's not seeing
sophisticated use of the medium yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still waiting for a political entrepreneur to combine a
potent message with the right Internet technology and connect with
voters,'' Shafer said.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Bush and his Democratic opponent, Gar-- y Mauro, have
Web sites that approach the potential seen by experts. Bush's Web
designer based his technologically advanced site on one maintained
by brother Jeb Bush, Republican nominee for governor of Florida.
Jeb Bush's site is considered one of the best on the Web and cost
his campaign $26,000, one of the most expensive political sites in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's site includes up-to-date poll information and
multimedia clips, including a five-minute biographical video and
the campaign's television commercials, all on a nifty, easy-to-use,
light-up menu. The site also provides direct access to the campaign
by posting direct -- -mail links to Bush and campaign
administrators, and a secure link to make contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said the governor's site was put together for $4,000,
``roughly the price of one television commercial.'' The money was
spent on the site's slick design, and campaign workers now update
it for no cost. To date, the site has been visited by more than
60,000 users, which is a trickle compared with news sites such as
CNN.com, which attracts more than 200,000 users a day.
</P>
<P>
   But Faucheux said a true tally of users and the site's
effectiveness in reaching voters won't be possible until after the
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to interpolate how many people are using these
sites'' because use is building steadily and likely won't peak
until Nov. 3, Faucheux said. ``After the election, we'll have a
better idea of who and how many were using the sites.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush site has raised more than $3,000 in online donations,
which Tucker said is below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Most campaigns want to raise enough money online to pay for
their sites, Fa-- cheux said. If they succeed, online campaigning
is basically free.
</P>
<P>
   The Mauro campaign site, designed by a few Web-savvy campaign
workers, cost the campaign nothing and is updated in-house. The
site includes interactive links to pages telling how to volunteer,
where to donate to the campaign and how to get in touch with Mauro.
John Hannah, Mauro's press secretary, said the site has been used a
lot, though he won't give specific numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The site has been used mostly for information purposes and not
specifically for raising money, though it does provide phone
numbers on how to donate to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities inherent in such a cheap, powerful tool will
be especially attractive to candidates of the future. A Web-savvy
intern using a basic Internet connection can create and maintain a
political site on the Web for about $25-$50 a month. With campaign
finance reform around the corner, Shafer predicted, candidates will
be driven to use the Web as a campaign tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this big hue and cry that there's too much money in
elections,'' said Shafer from his Washington office. ``But one of
the reasons there is so much demand for cash is because television
time is so expensive. The Web is this incredibly low-priced
alternative. Next to television, it's almost costless.''
</P>
<P>
   The question remains whether voters are ready for a cyberspace
campaign. Faucheux thinks they are, but to a limited degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this medium will never supercede television or radio, if
done in the right way it can effectively disseminate information
and mobilize voters,'' Fa-- cheux said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Price, a business development manager for Austin Title who
surfs the Net seven days a week and votes in every election, said
he has never looked at a political site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for more straight news than political advocacy,''
Price said. ``Besides, when you combine the skepticism everyone has
towards politics and the distrust we have towards the Internet,
it's a double whammy. You've got to question the source and be very
careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Slate editor Shafer sees another problem with campaigning on the
Web. The Internet is vast, and it's easy for a campaign site to get
lost in the universe of World Wide Web addresses alongside the
millions of personal, sports and pornographic Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   According to Shafer, time won't solve this problem, but money
will. Shafer's solution lies in online advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there are certain sites, like a lot of the popular news
Web pages, where you can buy banner ads which can pinpoint users in
certain ZIP codes,'' Shafer said. ``Campaigns will need to purchase
these focused ads and deliver them in such a compelling way that
people will click through the banners to get to the actual site,''
thus delivering tightly targeted audiences to campaigns and
improving the effectiveness of spending.
</P>
<P>
   Even with political skepticism and distrust of the Internet
slowing advancement, both Shafer and Coopersmith think online
campaigns will play an essential part in the 2000 elections. That
year, Shafer predicted, the Internet will yield at least 10 percent
of grass-root donations, and getting the word out about candidates
will be done primarily through -- -mail. He went on to predict that
we are only four years away from voting by computer.
</P>
<P>
   Coopersmith was a little more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``2000 is when you'll see the true birth of Internet campaign,''
Coopersmith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a presidential year, so the money will be there to
really advertise the sites. More importantly, the candidates will
have the benefit of two years to learn more about the Internet and
build on their experience, resources and the public's interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviews of Texas political web sites
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With the Internet's popularity growing by the
day, politicians are beginning to post Web sites and take advantage
of the medium to campaign. Here are a couple of exemplary sites and
the addresses of the Democratic and Republican parties' sites:
</P>
<P>
   _ www.Bush98.com _ The best campaign Web site in Texas. The
site, which was put together for $4,000, has all of Gov. George W.
Bush's speeches and television commercials. It also includes --
-mail links to him and a how-to on donating money to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   _ www.Mauro.org _ An amazing effort for a site that cost
nothing. This site posts Garry Mauro's positions, photos from the
campaign and a Q&AMP;A that is periodically updated with readers'
inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   _ www.TexasGOP.org _ This site is the official home of the Texas
Republicans. Here, you can access all Republican Web sites. You can
also check up on races and make contributions to the party.
</P>
<P>
   _ www.TxDemocrats.org _ The official home of the Texas
Democratic party is not as impressive as the Republican Web site,
but it is just as informative and gives all available direct links
to Texas Democratic candidates.

FASTEST SUPERCOMPUTER: U.S. OUTDOING ITSELF AGAIN AT LIVERMORE
LAB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department will take delivery Wednesday
of what the government says is the world's fastest computer,
capable of a peak performance of 3.88 trillion calculations, or
teraflops, a second.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said Tuesday that the
supercomputer, which is being assembled at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory in California, is about 15,000 times faster
than a 350-megahertz personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   The computer, built by the IBM, uses 5,800 processor chips, each
slightly more powerful than the widely sold Pentium II chip made by
Intel Corp., said people involved in its development. Livermore, a
nuclear weapons lab, will use it for simulations that determine,
without detonation, whether aging nuclear weapons are still
operable.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks prepared for delivery Wednesday, Vice President Al
Gore says that beyond weapons research, the technology of the
computer, known as massively parallel architecture, ``will lead to
advances and greater understanding of weather patterns, global
climate change, medicine, manufacturing and aviation safety.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Energy Department, the computer, called Pacific Blue, is
part of a program to advance supercomputer technology rapidly to
the stage where it can model nuclear warheads. Pacific Blue takes
the speed title from Sandia Red, a computer at Sandia National
Laboratory built by Intel that was finished in December 1996 and is
about half as fast. Mountain Blue, a computer being built by
Silicon Graphics Inc., is expected to deliver about four teraflops.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-2000, Energy Department officials hope to have a
10-teraflop computer, also built by IBM, running at Livermore,
followed in 2004 by a 100-teraflop computer. The 100-teraflop model
would allow high-fidelity simulation of an H-bomb detonation, as a
volleyball-size mass of nuclear fuel is compressed to the size of a
walnut, setting off the explosive chain reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they were trying to retire Moore's
Law, which holds that chip makers will be able to double the number
of transistors on a given sliver of silicon, and thus its speed,
every 18 months. The Energy Department wants to triple computing
speed in about the same time frame by combining the power of many
processors instead of increasing the speed of each.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Donofrio, senior vice president for technology and
manufacturing at IBM, said that in building Pacific Blue, ``we
pretty much used commercial-grade stuff'' from the IBM. commercial
product line.

CHEAPER THINKPADS STILL CLASSY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   This is the first installment of a new column by Peter H. Lewis. 
Each week he will write about new products and developments in the
electronics industry of interest to consumers. 
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After spending nearly two years interviewing consumers about
their computing desires and habits, IBM has created a very
impressive new line of notebooks designed for people who spend
their own money on computers.
</P>
<P>
   Best known for selling hardware to the expense-account crowd,
International Business Machines has learned that individual
consumers have different desires than corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, IBM discovered, wanted a high-quality notebook not so
much as a traveling companion but as a substitute for a desktop
computer at home. And by the way, it had to cost less than $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's response is a trio of Thinkpad notebooks _ called the i
Series _ that will have base prices of $1,499, $1,999 and $2,499
when they arrive in stores next month.
</P>
<P>
   I've been testing the momma-bear version, the $1,999 Thinkpad
1450. It is about twice the size of the older Thinkpad 560X, the
slim four-pound model that I carry on business trips, but it is
also half the cost, and it outperforms the smaller machine. For a
desktop substitute, the added heft is actually an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   (But when I carry the external disk drive, CD-ROM drive, AC
power adapters, port replicator and other attachments, the 560X
actually weighs eight pounds, slightly more than the Thinkpad
1450.)
</P>
<P>
   The new Thinkpad has a big, bright display that outshines
anything offered by competitors in the price range, respectable
performance from its 266-megahertz Pentium MMX processor and lots
of features that make it more friendly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The new Thinkpads arrive in what has already been a delightful
season for portable PCs. Earlier this year, a resurgent Apple
Computer Corp. introduced the impressive line of powerful G3
Powerbooks. Dell Computer offered a high-end Inspiron notebook
featuring a Texas-sized 15-inch active-matrix display.
</P>
<P>
   Sony broke new ground with a powerful yet super-skinny
subnotebook computer, its magnesium-hulled Vaio 505. And we are
just beginning to see a new crop of ultraportable computers that
weigh a couple of pounds and cost less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Either because of price or features, however, none of these
computers seemed ideal for consumers who wanted an all-in-one
portable PC that could serve as a replacement for a desktop
computer at a reasonable price. (An all-in-one portable includes a
floppy drive and a CD-ROM drive in the main body along with the
hard disk, instead of forcing them onto the desktop as tethered
external devices, octopus style.)
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, prices for Pentium-class notebooks with
active-matrix thin-film transistor color displays _ the best in
terms of brightness and sharpness _ were above $5,000.
Expense-account customers quickly made Thinkpads the most desired
Windows notebooks in the airlines' first-class sections.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to buying a computer for personal use, even
corporate executives had to think twice about Thinkpads. With
prices for desktop computers dropping every week, in some cases
below $1,000, it did not take a chief financial officer to figure
out that one could buy two, three or more desktop computers for the
price of one high-end Thinkpad.
</P>
<P>
   The i-Series Thinkpads narrow the price gap between desktop and
portable computers.
</P>
<P>
   The one I've been using has the characteristic solid feel and
finish of a Thinkpad. In performance, it is still at least two
generations behind comparably priced Windows-based desktop
machines, but it holds its own with other laptop competitors in its
class. It wins hands down for cachet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get on a plane, it's still a status symbol to pull out
a big black IBM computer,'' said Andrew M. Seybold, editor-in-chief
of Andrew Seybold's Outlook, a newsletter about mobile and wireless
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   He forecasts success for the lower-cost i-Series Thinkpads.
``It's like when BMW or Mercedes came out with lower-priced
models,'' he said. ``People are waiting to buy them when you drop
the price.''
</P>
<P>
   There are three new i-Series Thinkpads. The least expensive is
the model 1410, which comes with an Intel Pentium MMX processor
humming at 266 megahertz, 32 megabytes of system memory, a
3.2-gigabyte hard disk, a 20-speed CD-ROM drive, and a 12.1-inch
thin-film transistor screen. The cost is $1,499.
</P>
<P>
   The model 1450, which I tested, will have an estimated street
price of $1,999. It also had a 266-MHz Intel Pentium MMX processor,
but it came with 64 megabytes of RAM, a 4.3-gigabyte hard disk and
a 13.3-inch screen that was exceptionally good.
</P>
<P>
   The poppa bear is the 1710 model, which steps up to a more
powerful Intel Pentium II processor, a 24X CD-ROM drive and an
extra bay that allows the use of a second battery or some sort of
removable data storage. Based on specifications alone, the 1710
model appears to make the most sense as a desktop replacement,
worth the extra money.
</P>
<P>
   The new consumer notebooks share several new features, including
at least 2 megabytes of video memory and a 56K modem. Most
impressive is that they all sport thin-film transistor displays,
which yield brighter and sharper images than the lower-cost passive
displays found most often on low-cost portables.
</P>
<P>
   IBM said it had decided to use the costlier but superior
displays as a result of ``exit poll'' interviews with recent
notebook purchasers. The most common regret among people who had
already bought notebook computers, IBM found, was that they did not
get a bigger or better display, despite the higher cost.
</P>
<P>
   In the category of little things that make life better, IBM made
the new notebooks much better suited to playing audio compact
disks. Working with the audio company Altec Lansing, it created a
speaker system that fits in the left and right margins of the
computer's display, creating a wider than normal notebook with a
bit of an overbite on the lid.
</P>
<P>
   Other laptops, like the Compaq Presarios, sometimes place the
speakers where they can be muffled by the palms of the user.
</P>
<P>
   The i-Series Thinkpads have the CD controls _ including a
liquid-crystal display, a volume control dial, forward and reverse
track selection, and eject buttons _ on the outside of the
computer, so a person can play music disks without having to boot
up the computer.
</P>
<P>
   For those who resist headphones and think that their mission in
life is to share their musical taste with the folks in adjoining
seats, the speakers in the lid are cleverly positioned to pump out
decibels to either side when the case is closed.
</P>
<P>
   There are cheaper alternatives if a consumer simply wants a
portable audio CD player, of course.
</P>
<P>
   IBM also clearly listened to people who wanted to become
productive with their laptops without having to get a degree in
computer science.
</P>
<P>
   The company's research revealed a list of questions that new
users often have, including such common stumpers as these: How do I
send a fax from my computer? How do I send and receive electronic
mail? How do I download files from the Internet? What the heck is
power management, and how do I do it? How do I write a letter or
make a business presentation?
</P>
<P>
   So IBM has answered the questions by creating shortcut
instructions for each task (available on the 1410 and 1450 models).
IBM also added four color-coded function keys to the keyboard that
can be set up to perform common tasks, like connecting to the
Internet (the computer comes with an offer of 100 free hours of

<P>
   What don't I like? It seems a shame not to show off such
beautiful screens with a DVD drive, which would let travelers watch
movies as well as play audio CDs. An external DVD add-on is the
only option. The new Thinkpads are too big to use on airline
seat-back trays.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentium MMX processor poses a dilemma for students: It keeps
the cost down and is fine for e-mail, Web browsing and term papers,
but it is a lousy chip for serious game players.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line is that the i-Series Thinkpads are a good
value, and the only question is whether IBM can produce them fast
enough.

PC World searches for problem-free PC 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Is there such a thing as a problem-free PC? The
November issue of PC World examines that question. What it found is
there are a handful of PC makers that sell dependable systems and
provide useful service. Its findings are based on a survey of more
than 6,800 PC World readers. These readers rated no PC as
outstanding. They did name several as good. Only Dell computers
earned that moniker across PC World's three categories of work,
home and notebook computers. And Acer's home PC model was the only
one to receive an unacceptable rating from readers.
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue of PC World you'll find a review of the first
electronic books, scheduled to hit stores sometime this fall. The
magazine found the idea intriguing but concluded ``reality has yet
to catch up with the potential.'' The two PC World looked at are
the SoftBook and Rocket E-Book. The biggest difference between the
two was screen quality, says PC World. It found SoftBook had a
slight off-color cast and a problem with ghosting, especially
outside. In contrast, the magazine found the Rocket E-Book's screen
was easy to read.

<P>
   Dr. Brain is a series of game titles from Knowledge Adventure
designed to make kids think. It has released a new title called
``IQ Adventure.'' Designed for kids ages 9 and up, the game opens
with players marooned in an alternative universe. They're pursued
by robots hungry to harness human brainpower. Kids save themselves
by completing 15 missions that are complex puzzles. ``IQ
Adventure'' is the first in the Dr. Brain series to let kids play
against each other online. But doing so costs an extra fee and
Internet access is required. Available only for Windows computers,
``IQ Adventure'' retails for $30.
</P>
<P>
   Another newly released educational title is Edmark's ``Let's Go
Read! 2.'' This game features IBM's speech recognition technology
that lets kids talk to the game and then have it respond. Designed
for kids ages 5-7, ``Let's Go Read'' teaches reading skills through
thinking and exploration. It focuses on phonic skills, spelling,
vocabulary and comprehension. It's available for Windows and Mac
computers and retails for $39.95.

   One of the more anticipated films of next year is the prequel to
``Star Wars.'' Now you can get a satirical sneak peek on the

Internet provides guide for ghouls 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is difficult to write about Halloween sites on the
World Wide Web without using any puns. But don't be spooked.
There's not a ghost of a chance you'll be left with haunting
memories of bad jokes here.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start our tour of the frightful sites with one called
Halloween at http://www.4halloween.com/ that can furnish all the
necessities for a traditional Halloween. You will, of course, want
to copy the recipe here for fake blood and follow some of the links
to the traditional scary stories that should be told on this
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also get hints here for making (or buying) a trick or
treat costume. And don't leave this site without reading up on the
various methods of carving a jack-o'-lantern pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've mastered that art _ and assuming you still have the
usual number of fingers left so you can operate the computer
keyboard _ let's move to Jody's Haunted Halloween Page at
http://www.netwide.net/users/lightner/halloween.html. Even if you
are unmoved by the most lifeless zombie and do not have a burning
desire to dress as a witch, you may enjoy this page.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there are recipes with a Halloween theme. You can,
for instance, prepare Tuna Spooks, or Bloody Devil Dogs, or
Gingerbread Ghosts with a little help from the recipes you find.
Or, if you lean more toward conventional fare, you'll find a good
recipe that will let you use the remains of your jack-o'-lantern to
cook up some pumpkin bread.
</P>
<P>
   But there's still more. You will find links to many other pages
with a Halloween theme as well as recommendations and designs for
trick-or-treat costumes. You'll also get some safety tips that help
make your own ghosts and goblins stand out in the dark to avoid
traffic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Halloween wouldn't feel right without a trip to a haunted house.
You'll probably find several near where you live, tours of the
awful with the admission price going to a charity.
</P>
<P>
   But if you'd like to take a tour of a virtual haunted house,
complete with sound effects and music, wander over to The Haunted
House at
http://members.aol.com/harley101/private/hween/hween1.html. You'll
also find a selection of Halloween sound files you can download.
</P>
<P>
   Next we'll stop in at a place that will give you ideas for
Halloween costumes. It's a page called Halloween and is sponsored
by McCall's Patterns. It's way too late to order the patterns from
this page at http://www.mccall.com/funstuff.html but the full color
photographs will spark some good ideas if you're planning to make
your costume this year.
</P>
<P>
   We've saved the sweetest of the sites for last. It's Hershey's
Halloween 1998 at http://www.hersheys.com/(tilde)hershey
</P>
<P>
   /halloween/. Since the site is sponsored by the famous chocolate
maker, as you would expect, there is some commercial content here.
However, as you might not expect, most of the page is used for
nifty Halloween screensavers you can download, a Halloween Handbook
that offers everything from safety tips to costume ideas, and a
really nifty feature called a Pumpkin Carving Planner.
</P>
<P>
   To use the planner, simply move the jigsaw puzzle like pieces
around. The notion is to try out various designs for a carved
pumpkin before you make the first cut. Even if you never carve a
jack-o'-lantern yourself, it's a lot of fun to use the designer.

Action Files carries on tradition 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the early days of Apple Computer, Now Utilities was
among the most successful and innovative enhancers of the software
that gave the Mac its distinct look and feel.
</P>
<P>
   Now Utilities was so successful Apple Computer added many of its
innovations to the Mac operating system. Things such as
point-and-click navigation through folders, hierarchical pop-up
menus and lists of recently used files and folders began with Now
Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere in the mid-1990s Now Utilities lost its way. It
failed to come up with new innovations and has not released a
version compatible with OS 8.
</P>
<P>
   The company was sold a couple of times and finally ended up in
the hands of a hot new upstart, Power On Software. Power On is
updating Now Utilities and incorporating it into its own popular
Action Files Software.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Action Files is the modern day successor to Now in
both function and spirit. It's a simple but powerful enhancement to
the Mac's open and save dialogue box.
</P>
<P>
   That's the window that pops up anytime you highlight and release
the open command in any menu. It lists files by name and lets you
navigate through a file or folder to a particular item.
</P>
<P>
   Action Files, like Now's SuperBoomerang utility, greatly
enhances this window. For starters, it adds a menu bar with lots of
new headings along the top. Those headings include not only a
file's name but also the size, kind, label and modification date.
</P>
<P>
   You can also sort files in this window, turn off column headings
and resize an Action File's window, something you can't do in the
Mac OS.
</P>
<P>
   But the best part of Action Files is its navigational tools. It
lets you save in a list your favorite files and folders. Just
highlight the item you want to add to your favorites list and hit
the space bar.
</P>
<P>
   The item now appears every time under either the document or
folder heading in the menu bar. To jump to any particular item,
just highlight it in the menu. This is a great timesaver.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find Action Files all over the Internet, from which a
trial copy can be downloaded. Among the sites are http://www
</P>
<P>
   .actionutilities.com and http://www5.zdnet.com/mac, the Mac
homepage of ZDNet.
</P>
<P>
   The price of Action Files is $39.95 for a downloaded version and
$49.95 for a CD version.

Searching best search engines 
By Mark Clothier  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's already impressive, but what will make the
Internet a truly amazing tool is a simple way to access its
resources.
</P>
<P>
   We aren't there yet. The main access route, search engines,
speak a different language than you do and, when put to work, turn
up thousands of useless pages to search.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, we have to learn to better use what we have.
Yahoo! Internet Life, in its November issue, helps by breaking
search topics into different categories and listing what they think
is the best engine for each.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Light, http://www.northernlight.com, is listed as the
most useful search engine. The site uses search folders that
organize your search results into categories.
</P>
<P>
   It listed its own engine, Yahoo!, http://www.yahoo.com, as the
best search directory. The site was praised for categorization, a
user-friendly interface and customizable news content.
</P>
<P>
   Deja News, http://www.dejanews.com, is considered the best way
to search for newsgroup postings.
</P>
<P>
   FindMail, http://www.findmail.com, got the nod for best mailing
list search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves for Kids, http://www.ajkids.com, was the most
kid-friendly search engine. It has a feature that lets you filter
what your kids search for. Shareware Search Engine,
http://www.hotfiles.com, is a Ziff-Davis shareware directory with
downloads and reviews. For those who just want to hone their
searching capabilities, Search Engine Resource,
http://www.searchenginewatch.com, might be the place. This site
includes a tutorial that helps you refine your searches. The site
also keeps a list of search-engine links.
</P>
<P>
   Thin is good and now it's cheaper
</P>
<P>
   Sharp is releasing a new generation of Windows CE-based portable
PCs that are thinner, lighter and below $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharp Mobilon Pro has a large, full-VGA 8.2-inch color
touch-screen and keyboard. The unit weighs 2.7 pounds and is 1-inch
thin.
</P>
<P>
   The Mobilon Pro retails for a suggested $899.
</P>
<P>
   The unit was designed with mobile professionals and college
students in mind. It has an ``instant on'' Windows CE feature that
cuts boot-up time. The system allows the option of keyboard data
entry or touch-screen.
</P>
<P>
   The TV for the couch potato
</P>
<P>
   In plenty of time for the holidays, Pioneer Electronics is
coming out with some high-end in-home entertainment options.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer offers the PRO-100 projection television. It has a
51-inch screen with 1,000 lines of horizontal image resolution.
That's $4.30 a line, as estimated retail is $4,300.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you fortunate enough to be trying to choose between
a nice, newly used BMW and television monitor, Pioneer's
High-Definition Television Ready 50-inch Plasma Display might be up
your alley.
</P>
<P>
   The 3.86-inch-deep screen weighs 92 pounds and has a maximum
resolution of 1280x768 XGA and more than 980,000 pixels. Suggested
retail: $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the shopping list, closer to the average person's
limit, is the PDR-555RW Compact Disc Recorder. The $699 machine
uses standard CDR audio discs that you can record on and the new
CD-RW format, which lets you record up to 74 minutes worth. The
discs are erasable. A feature called Digital Synchro takes the
shaky-hand factor out of the process. With Digital Synchro, the
start and finish of the playback track is recognized and
automatically synchronized with the recorder.
</P>
<P>
   The Pioneer Mini Disc Recorder, the MJ-D707, also uses Digital
Synchro. The system features 20-bit A/D and D/A converters and an
automatic threshold control circuit that restores incoming digital
signals to their original form. The mini-disc recorder retails for
an estimated $399.
</P>
<P>
   First, they came up with the 10-disc changer and that seemed a
bit excessive. Then came the 25-disc and the 100-disc.
</P>
<P>
   Behold the 301-disc changer.
</P>
<P>
   The PD-F1007 Giga CD Changer is designed to load and play CDs in
the center of a roulette rack, so it is not any bigger than any
other stereo components.
</P>
<P>
   The unit retails for $349 and comes with 10 custom filing modes,
a 50-track best selection memory, an optical digital output, CD
text, CD title input. And, in case 301 CDs won't cut it, it has the
ability to attach a second unit, which lets the system hold more
than 600 CDs.

Pathfinder splits off its magazine content 
By Frances Katz  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pathfinder, (http://www.pathfinder.com), Time Warner's catch-all
content site that includes all its major magazine and media
properties was one of the first corporate sites to hit the Web.
Users logging on in 1995 were fascinated to find Time magazine
available on their computers. Pathfinder, along with HotWired, were
two of the Web's coolest destinations in the early days.
</P>
<P>
   But that was yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years the clunky, cluttered Pathfinder home base has
been attacked for its long download time _ users complained they
could read all of Time, half of Sports Illustrated and
Entertainment Weekly's movie reviews offline in the time it took
for Pathfinder to load. As Pathfinder lurched from one redesign to
another adding more and more content, analysts questioned the
wisdom of stacking the world's most famous magazine brands and
cable companies behind the Pathfinder Web address. Internally,
staffers struggled to develop sites that reflected each magazine's
unique style and still give Pathfinder some sense of uniformity.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, it was an uphill battle. Time Warner got tired of
fighting. In the early days, when the Web was a largely untried and
untested medium and access to it was largely by 2400 bps modems,
one-stop destinations like Pathfinder and Wired made a lot of
sense. They were fun, graphic and were perfect for the first wave
of Web surfers, fascinated more by the medium than the message.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Web evolved from an underground hobby into big
business targeting mass audiences, companies with an eye on the
bottom line began to see that promoting established brands rather
than unique hangouts was the key to online success.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, Time Warner began to break up the Pathfinder family
with the announcement that the online edition of ``People''
magazine will move off the Web and be available exclusively on
America Online. The company also said that its other popular online
brands including Entertainment Weekly, ParentTime, Money.com and
Time.com will also be available via AOL.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling here is what's the point in hiding our crown
jewels under a bushel,'' says Time Warner spokesman Graham Cannon.
``Our job in a very dynamic online environment is delivering the
kind of information people want where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   People.com's 18-month deal with AOL is an effort to find a place
where People's offline readers congregate. AOL's strong female and
family demographics make it an ideal location for the breathless
celebrity news and gossip People is famous for. Cannon says that
more than one-third of AOL's 20 million members are already People
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of content aggregators like Pathfinder are over,'' he
says. ``Pathfinder as a consumer brand is not the way I see our
users using our sites.'' Time Warner research reveals that less
than 2 percent of Time Warner's Web site traffic comes through the
Pathfinder Web address. In an age of increasing Web
commercialization, users are much more likely to type in
``time.com'' or ``EntertainmentWeekly.com.''
</P>
<P>
   The decentralization of Pathfinder, like the sale of Wired,
another early Web hangout, is a sign the Web is growing up. While
surfing the Web is still fun, the new generation of online users
want their Web sites served up quickly and their news updated
regularly from name brand products they can access by just typing
in its name. It may not be hip, but it is the future.
</P>
<P>
   Wallpapers.Com: Is there a more infernal exercise than shopping
for wallpaper (other than putting up the hated material, of course
...)? This site helps you wallpaper the background of your
computer's operating system, offering free desktop themes and
e-mail postcards for both PC and Mac, plus holiday screensavers.

Reboot your life _ give away your old computer 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Computers can figure your taxes, connect you to the
Web so you find a good place to board your dog for the weekend, let
you pass a slow Saturday killing space aliens, and make your
spelling resemble English more when you write your Aunt Vera Mae.
</P>
<P>
   But the best thing a person can do with a computer is give it
away.
</P>
<P>
   Now that prices are so low and new computers are so powerful
compared to last year's model, many people will be buying a new
machine. Today, I'm suggesting a fine use for the old machine. Put
it in the hands of someone who needs a computer but can't afford
one.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way to write a column like this without being corny
and sentimental. But some of the world's greatest moments are corny
ones. If you've gone a week or so without blushing, then maybe I
can help you find a way to reboot your life.
</P>
<P>
   When most people think about giving a computer away, the
practical side takes over. Before you know it, you are considering
IRS rules and tax-deductible ways to use that donation to shave a
tax bill. If that approach appeals to you, then there are plenty of
excellent organizations that could use that old clunker of yours. I
can even recommend a place here in Atlanta called Freebytes that
will even take in defective computers (it's also delighted to have
working models).
</P>
<P>
   It qualifies as a tax-deductible charity and has a Web site at
http://www.freebytes.org that will give you all the details. Even
if you live far away from Atlanta, the Web site can be valuable
since it has links to similar organizations in other areas. There's
nothing wrong with saving on your taxes and helping someone else at
the same time. That's real multitasking.
</P>
<P>
   But some of you may believe charity begins at home. And plenty
of my old machines have found places within my own family _
extended and otherwise. There's even an old 8088 machine _ if it
was a car it would qualify for antique plates _ that's happily
writing letters in Jonesboro, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of opportunities in most families. Maybe your
parents aren't properly wired. Think of the money you'll save on
phone bills if Mom and Dad can use e-mail to keep in touch and _
with a computer _ you'll be able to send them e-mails with
electronic images of the latest family happenings. Or perhaps there
is a niece or nephew that could use a computer.
</P>
<P>
   All these are fine uses for an old computer. But none of them
have the true blush value of giving a computer away to a total
stranger. If you really want to stammer and blush, think about
using your computer to change the life of a school kid.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, being able to log on to the Internet to get homework
help; or to simply fire up a computer to write a school report, is
almost as important for a kid as having access to books. But a lot
of families have enough trouble buying groceries. While computer
prices are lower than ever, even one of those $600 PCs that seem so
inexpensive to you represent a financial mountain for others.
</P>
<P>
   Most schools and churches can help you find a kid who needs a
computer. Or your own children may have a nomination to make. And,
if you have time, set up the computer and even give an hour or so
of instruction.
</P>
<P>
   If you take this route, you won't get a penny's worth of
deduction on your taxes. But my guess is it'll make you richer than
you ever dreamed possible. And your computer will have performed
one last fine task for you _ it may make you blush.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Scott Kurnit, the founder and chief executive of
the Mining Co., ever finds himself feeling insignificant or
questioning his new business endeavor, he can bolster his
self-esteem by catching the F train from his offices in midtown
Manhattan to SoHo and there gaze upon his company's latest
marketing effort: a giant mural on a building on Houston Street
near Broadway touting ``miningco.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Cater-cornered to the famous DKNY ad, the mural is just one
piece of evidence that New York companies like his that deal with
Internet-related media are beginning to understand the need to
promote their online brands in the off-line world.
</P>
<P>
   The Mining Co., an Internet search engine that offers personal
guides to Web sites, joins such other companies as iVillage, N2K,
theglobe.com and Connecticut-based priceline.com that have recently
undertaken national advertising blitzes _ broadcast, cable TV,
outdoor and print _ intended to make their brands household names,
the likes of ESPN or (dare they wish) Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Not one of these companies existed five years ago. Nor did their
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Now, iVillage advertises its Women's Network on several cable TV
channels.
</P>
<P>
   N2K, which agreed last week to merge with its biggest
competitor, CDNow, has its own huge billboards in Times Square and
on Sunset Strip in Hollywood for its Web-based retail business,
Music Boulevard. It also introduced a broadcast, cable and radio
campaign during the Grammy Awards show this year.
</P>
<P>
   Theglobe.com invested $8 million to plaster its logo on
everything from bus stops to cable to the T-shirt of a waiter in
SoHo at the trendy Jerry's restaurant, a popular lunch spot for
Silicon Alley denizens.
</P>
<P>
   All these companies have established a presence on the World
Wide Web through banner advertising and strategic relationships
with other sites. But to build the critical mass they have promised
their investors _ and in the case of N2K, its shareholders _ they
must have a presence in the nonvirtual world, too. Survival demands
that they drive traffic to their Web sites to increase ``viewer
impressions,'' the count of how many times the pages on a site are
seen.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Mining Co., iVillage and theglobe.com are focusing
most of their advertising dollars on markets with a ``wired''
population, primarily New York, San Francisco, Boston and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com, an airline ticket broker in Stamford, Conn., has
taken a more ambitious and focused approach. Eschewing TV and
online advertising, the 6-month-old company has spent $20 million
to buy national radio spots featuring William Shatner and full-page
ads in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to know about us before they get on line,''
said Jay Walker, priceline.com's founder and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   To Walker, radio and newspapers are the most efficient media for
his particular brand because ``you don't need a lot of pictures or
motion to convey'' his company's simple message, that ``as long as
you're flexible, you can name your price on an airline ticket, a
car or, shortly, a hotel room.''
</P>
<P>
   James Dettore, chief executive of Brand Institute, a New York
consulting firm, says the cost of creating an online brand for
Internet companies is inherently cheaper than creating a brand for,
say, cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, companies will spend 8 to 10 percent of their
budget on marketing,'' Dettore said. But he contends that Internet
companies have two advantages over others: The medium is global,
and it is fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, it takes 15 to 20 years to establish a
megabrand,'' Dettore said. ``The software industry _ Microsoft,
Dell and Gateway _ accelerated this to three to five years. And
Internet brands are growing even faster.'' Even so, he says,
building a national brand is expensive, costing ``anywhere from $50
million to $100 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is finding an efficient way to allocate limited
resources. iVillage has raised some $67 million in capital _ an
impressive amount but not nearly enough to cover the cost of
building the brand, developing the product and meeting payroll.
</P>
<P>
   The Mining Co. has raised about $20 million, as has
theglobe.com, which filed for a public offering in July.
Priceline.com has raised $52 million, and N2K has raised more than
$160 million through two public offerings and private financing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Internet companies often find it hard to accept the vague,
imprecise measurements of a campaign's effectiveness in traditional
media.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Newman, N2K's vice president for marketing, advertising
and sales, describes the frustration of assigning a value to a
brand's image _ and of conveying that value to her bosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has become a response-based, customer acquisition
buy,'' she said. ``It's become pretty scientific. We can count how
many customers we acquired for every banner we place.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, she said, ``The off-line advertising is more
intangible, but it builds confidence and trust in our virtual
brand.''
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, Ms. Newman has larger, equally intangible,
problems to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   With the N2K-CDNow merger, the brand she has worked so hard to
create may become obsolete if the management of the newly formed
company deems CDNow, or an entirely new name, more valuable than
N2K or its Music Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Diamond, co-founder of N2K and chairman of the new company,
said Friday: ``We have agreed to a process to work with senior
management and consultants to assess our brand equities and a third
brand. We'll continue to market our respective services through the
holiday season.''
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, the merger will be complete in January
and the new name _ and new branding campaign _ will be announced
soon thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Back down in SoHo, Kurnit of the Mining Co. has issues of his
own. Just days after the paint dried on his mural, the gasoline
station in front of the building where it resides sold its air
rights to a billboard company. Now, a cigarette ad blocks a part of
the Mining Co.'s mural _ and perhaps its chance to make a fleeting
impression amid the noise.

HIGHER-SPEED INTERNET STANDARD IS APPROVED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as Microsoft battles the U.S. government, it can celebrate
an incremental victory in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months ago, Microsoft, Compaq Computer and Intel joined
with the large local phone companies in an effort to enable
consumers to receive Internet data over regular telephone lines at
speeds much faster than now possible.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the consortium achieved its initial goal: winning
preliminary approval of its technical standard from the
International Telecommunications Union, a U.N. group. The
technology is known as digital subscriber line, or DSL. The version
of DSL that won approval promises to deliver 1.5 million bits of
data to homes every second.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that it took the computing and communications
industries about two years to settle on a universal standard for
modems that deliver 56,000 bits a second, the industry consensus on
DSL was quite a quick step.
</P>
<P>
   But the phone companies must continue to step lively if they are
to beat back the threat to their future posed by cable modems.
There may be half a million people using cable modems for access to
the Internet over cable television systems, while only a fraction
of that number use DSL technology.
</P>
<P>
   The new standard will allow consumers to install the advanced
modems without help from a technician. Many cable modems require
expert help for installation. The consortium hopes to have the
modems in stores by the middle of next year, priced about $150.

NEWS ANALYSIS: MICROSOFT'S REFRAIN: WHERE'S THE HARM? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp.'s defense in the antitrust trial that began last
week boils down to one question: Where's the harm?
</P>
<P>
   John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer, never quite uttered those
words. But he nonetheless posed the question in hundreds of ways in
his raspy baritone drawl during three days of cross-examining the
government's lead witness, James Barksdale, executive of Netscape
Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 20 states accuse Microsoft of being a
new-age monopolist, bullying other companies so that it could
stifle competition in the Internet software market. Netscape, the
early leader in the market for software used to browse the World
Wide Web, was the main target of Microsoft's illegal campaign, the
government contends.
</P>
<P>
   Warden used his combative cross-examination of Barksdale as a
forum for trying to make Microsoft's case. With his pointed
questions, Warden sought to establish that while Microsoft was
assuredly aggressive and powerful, there was scant evidence that
its behavior resulted in the effects that classic antitrust
doctrine deems illegal _ namely, raising prices or restricting
output so that consumers suffer.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that Microsoft bundled its Internet
Explorer browser with its industry-standard Windows operating
system and gave the browser away free to crush Netscape. Microsoft
replies that it folded its browser into its operating system as a
convenience to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Warden tried to drive home the point with a sarcastic question:
``Mr. Barksdale, do you think consumers would be better off if
Microsoft had not given the browser away free, in your hypothetical
world?''
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale replied that in the long run he thought consumers
would benefit if Microsoft had not made the browser free because
the move had eliminated the incentives for other companies to enter
the browser market with innovative products.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Warden made his point: To side with the government, a
court must favor a would-have-been world of hypothetically greater
innovation instead of the present, which has not yet created
widespread consumer dissatisfaction. Where's the harm?
</P>
<P>
   From every imaginable angle of interrogation, Warden hit the
same theme.
</P>
<P>
   The government has contended that through exclusionary deals
with computer makers and gateway services to the Internet like
America Online, Microsoft made it more difficult and expensive for
Netscape to distribute its browser. Microsoft's power to engage in
this exclusionary behavior, the government adds, derives from the
``chokehold'' monopoly the company enjoys because 90 percent of all
personal computers run the Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't it true, Warden asked pointedly, that 26 million
copies of Netscape's browser were downloaded over the Internet
during the first eight months of this year? ``I wouldn't dispute
the number,'' Barksdale replied.
</P>
<P>
   Warden then introduced internal Netscape documents showing that
the company plans to distribute 159 million copies of its browser
over the next 12 months. He asked Barksdale for an estimate of the
number of Web sites from which computer users can download Netscape
software, and Barksdale replied that there were said to be more
than 20,000 such Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it true,'' Warden asked, ``that any home user who has a
PC and an Internet connection may freely choose at no cost
Netscape's Web-browsing software?''
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale replied testily, and reasonably, that most people
don't take the time and trouble to download software. That, he
said, gives Microsoft a big advantage because of its deals making
Internet Explorer the main browser offered by leading personal
computer companies and America Online, which are the key
distribution channels to home users.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Warden's point was made. Microsoft's monopoly appears to
be a pretty leaky chokehold, at least when it comes to software
distribution in the Internet era. Where's the harm?
</P>
<P>
   And Warden got personal with Barksdale. Microsoft's strategy
against Netscape may have been to ``cut off their air supply,'' in
the memorable phrase of one senior Microsoft executive. And
competing with Microsoft has been difficult, but the result could
scarcely be characterized as financial ruin for Netscape and its
leaders. Warden asked Barksdale to calculate the value of his
Netscape shares. More than $100 million, he replied. Where's the
harm?
</P>
<P>
   With this line of defense, antitrust experts say, Microsoft is
playing a strong hand. As William Kovacic, a visiting professor at
the George Washington University Law School observes: Since the
mid-1970s, when the United States began facing more global economic
competition, federal courts have tended to view big companies as
engines of innovation and economic efficiency that should be left
alone, unless their behavior can be proved to harm consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The judgment of the courts, Kovacic notes, has been that the
antitrust laws should not be used to put ``saddlebags on
thoroughbreds.''
</P>
<P>
   But in its case, the government is asking the court to weigh
considerations beyond the current welfare of consumers and health
of the industry that Microsoft dominates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department is saying that we want the race of
modern capitalism to be a fast one, but we also want to make sure
that the winner succeeds because he is the fastest runner not
because he tripped the guy next to him,'' said Carl Shapiro, a
professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a former
senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   The government has contended that in specific meetings with
Netscape, Intel and Apple Computer, for example, Microsoft sought
to intimidate rivals and bully its partners to help it curb
competition. Look closely at what Microsoft did, the prosecutors
say, and the picture that emerges is of a monopolist at work,
illegally using its market power to squelch competition.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's strategy for refuting these contentions is twofold:
fiercely dispute the Justice Department's evidence by mustering any
available e-mail or snippet of deposition testimony that can be
used to undermine the government's interpretation of events, and
constantly return to the theme that even if Microsoft behaved
badly, there is little evidence to show that the economy or
consumers were hurt as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The linchpin of the Microsoft defense is that, yes, the company
may be big, powerful and even nasty at times _ ``the antitrust laws
are not a code of civility in business,'' Warden reminded the court
_ but the company presides over a sector of the economy for which
it is hard to argue that the ``dead hand of monopoly'' is at work.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Microsoft is asking: Where's the harm?

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Interactive toys sense how they're played with 
By James Cummings  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Imagine what would have happened if an
interactive Barney doll had turned up in a household in the Middle
Ages.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, his owners would have been burned at the
stake for witchcraft.
</P>
<P>
   There's something downright spooky about modern interactive
toys. Though they are obviously not alive, many of the things they
do look suspiciously lifelike.
</P>
<P>
   They seem to see, hear and feel what's going on around them, and
they seem to react to their environments in appropriate,
reasonable, intelligent ways.
</P>
<P>
   In the place of eyes, ears and other sensory organs, interactive
toys use light, touch, motion, magnetic, infrared, radio and other
sensors. Instead of mouths and muscles they have digital
recordings, motors and plastic and metal skeletons. In place of
brains they have chips.
</P>
<P>
   And in place of intelligence, they have clever programming,
which is the key to creating the illusion of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the toy isn't fun, if it isn't magical, then all the
high-powered chips in the world won't make any difference,'' said
Karn King, who works for a sound digitizing company. ``You don't
just stuff in the technology; you use the technology to make the
toy pleasing to the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolls with eyes that close are a primitive example of
interactive toys. The eyes are attached to weights and when the
doll is placed in a sleeping position, the weights pull the eyes
into the appropriate sleeping status.
</P>
<P>
   The sense organs of modern interactive toys tend to be much more
sophisticated than simple weights, but the principle is the same.
The child introduces a stimulus; something senses the stimulus and
reacts in an appropriate way.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing Amy from Playmates is like a sleeping doll with a degree
from technical school. She not only talks, she seems to know what
she's talking about.
</P>
<P>
   When the child first plays with the toy in the morning, Amazing
Amy may ask for breakfast. If the child tries to give her a piece
of plastic pizza that comes with the toy, Amazing Amy may say, ``I
like pizza but not for breakfast. How about cereal?''
</P>
<P>
   The doll also can tell the difference between her play clothes
and pajamas and will ask for the right outfit at the right time.
Amazing Amy even knows when she's sick or needs a diaper change.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Slate of Playmates' marketing staff said Amazing Amy has
play pieces such as food items and clothing that have built-in
resistors.
</P>
<P>
   Place the play piece against contact pads on the doll's body,
and the doll's internal computer runs a signal through the play
piece and recognizes the piece by the amount the signal is reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing Amy also uses touch sensors to tell when her nose is
being blown or when she's being hugged.
</P>
<P>
   Touch sensors are among the most common components in
interactive toys. Touch sensors usually have some sort of springy
material that holds two halves of a circuit apart. Squeeze on the
springy material, the circuit is completed, and the ``brain'' of
the toy responds.
</P>
<P>
   Actimates, a division of Microsoft, uses touch sensors in its
popular interactive Barney and in the Arthur and D.W. dolls it
introduced this year, according to Christine Winkel, an Actimates
product manager.
</P>
<P>
   Squeeze the hands or feet of the dolls and they talk or play
games. They have vocabularies of thousands of situation-appropriate
phrases.
</P>
<P>
   The Arthur and D.W. figures, based on the Arthur characters'
public television series, also have touch-sensitive watches.
Children can touch the watches and the figures help them learn to
tell time.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to recorded speech, Barney, Arthur and D.W. all move
their heads and arms in gestures that match what they're saying,
Winkel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a chassis of 740 different parts,'' Winkel said.
</P>
<P>
   The Barney toy even has a light sensor, according to Winkel.
Cover the toy's eyes and the absence of light triggers it to play
peek-a-boo.
</P>
<P>
   Motion and attitude sensors, which detect vertical or horizontal
orientation, as well as touch sensors are important in toys like
Tickle Me Elmo, according to King.
</P>
<P>
   She said she knew people who designed the Elmo toy, and it took
them a while to get the sensors right.
</P>
<P>
   ``With one of the first prototypes you really had to bang it
hard to get it to activate,'' King said. ``It was more like Thrash
Me About Elmo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite disturbing, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   MIMICKING SPEECH
</P>
<P>
   King is marketing manager for Voxware Inc., a sound recording
compression technology company in Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Though Voxware is not directly involved in toy manufacture, King
said the technology of compressing lots of recorded sound for
storage in a small space is critical to making a toy that can speak
thousands of phrases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old Speak and Spell toys had a crude plastic record
inside,'' King said. ``The technology in a modern speaking toy is
more like the technology in a digital answering machine.''
</P>
<P>
   In an analog recording such as an audiotape, the sound
vibrations that hit a microphone are converted into electrical
impulses. Those impulses are impressed onto a physical medium such
as vinyl or magnetic material on the surface of a tape.
</P>
<P>
   King said digital recordings are made by sampling every few
milliseconds the sound vibrations that hit the microphone. The
recorder, in effect, describes the sound energy hitting the
microphone at any given instant as a series of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Sound compression, she said, is a process of isolating
repetitive patterns so they don't have to be described more than
once.
</P>
<P>
   The compresses recordings typically are store in modern toys on
microchips as ROM (read only memory), according to King.
</P>
<P>
   A microchip may look like solid, but actually it is honeycombed
with cells. When information is recorded on a microchip, each cell
becomes either charged and represents the number one or it remains
uncharged and represents the number zero.
</P>
<P>
   The patterns of ones and zero are the basis for all computer
codes and can be used to expression any number.
</P>
<P>
   King said the phrases talking toys can say are usually not
recorded in their entirety. Instead individual words or short
phrases are stored on the chip and linked by an operating program
to build sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Getting dolls to talk is much easier than getting them to
understand spoken speech, King said.
</P>
<P>
   Software exists that can recognize words, but King said it may
not be ready for mass-market toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The software only responds correctly within tight limits,''
she said. ``If a little kid has to learn a strict set of rules
before playing with a toy, the magic goes out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   MIMICKING INTELLIGENCE
</P>
<P>
   Owners of Actimates dolls can buy separate activity packs that
will make their toys interact with specially encoded television and
computer programs. Arthur and D.W., designed for slightly older
children than Barney, also interact with an Arthur Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But the dolls naturally can't see, hear or understand what's
going on on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   What is actually happening is the dolls are responding to radio
signals generated in the activity packs that are plugged into the
television or computer, Winkel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nine different patents for Actimates technology,'' she
said. ``We're definitely looking into using radio technology in
other characters and toy applications.''

<P>
   Toys have no intelligence; they have triggers that call up
responses. A programmer decides which trigger _ a touch sensor, an
attitude sensor, a radio signal _ elicits which response. The
instructions for matching triggers and responses are typically
stored in some kind of memory device like a ROM microchip.
</P>
<P>
   In Barney's case, the toy uses a 4-megabit chip with 512k of ROM
to store its voice and responses, Winkel said. That gives the toy
about as much computing power as an advanced pocket organizer, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing Amy has one chip for producing the 10,000 phrases the
doll can say and another chip for other functions like recognizing
clothing, Slate said. Like Barney, she has about 500k of memory.
</P>
<P>
   And all the doll's functions are keyed to an internal timer. In
that way, Amazing Amy is related to the virtual pets that Playmates
also makes. Slate said one of the most important advances that
makes dolls such as Amazing Amy and the Actimates line possible is
miniaturization. The small, lightweight brains can be hidden deep
inside the toy so the dolls can be soft, light and cuddly.
</P>
<P>
   Randomization completes the illusion of intelligence. People
don't say exactly the same thing every time they get thirsty, for
example, so a doll that uses the same words every time a particular
situation arises will seem mechanical.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing Amy and the Actimates toys also have a range of possible
responses for every set of stimuli.
</P>
<P>
   Children playing with the dolls don't have to understand how
they work. In fact it's better if children never have to think
about how their doll knows what to say and when, Slate said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a programming standpoint, our doll is very complex,''
Slate said. ``But the programming is complex so the play will be
simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know exactly how Amazing Amy works, but it's easy
for a little girl to learn to play with her.

WITCHES PRACTICE THEIR CRAFT WITHOUT TOIL AND TROUBLE

 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ As a young girl, Sarah Unsworth MacMillan spent
many a Halloween in the black garb of a witch. But it wasn't until
her 30th birthday that she realized the costume was an extension of
her true self.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came into witchcraft through my studies,'' said MacMillan, a
Yale University graduate, former high school English teacher and
self-initiated witch who lives in San Antonio. ``I was even
encouraged by a Catholic nun at Yale to study more about the
feminine aspect of my god.''
</P>
<P>
   MacMillan and other modern witches prescribe to Wicca _ commonly
called ``witchcraft'' _ which celebrates seasonal and life cycles
with rituals from pre-Christian Europe. Unlike most patriarchal
religions, Wiccan worship recognizes a higher being as the
``Goddess,'' a pre-Christian god that is as much feminine as
masculine.
</P>
<P>
   Halloween, or Samhain (pronounced ``sow-en'') on the Wiccan
calendar, is like New Year's Day to a witch _ welcoming what
Wiccans contend is life's rebirth through the divine Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   And whether you attribute it to millennialism or author Anne
Rice, a new undercurrent of witchcraft is subtly bewitching the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's showing up like crazy in pop culture,'' said Phyllis
Curott, a Wiccan high priestess in New York City and author of
``Book of Shadows,'' which recounts her journey from Civil Rights
attorney to witch. ``Goddess spirituality is the fastest growing
spirituality in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment industry has certainly hopped on the
broomstick, so to speak. Perhaps inspired by ABC's ``Sabrina the
Teenage Witch,'' the WB network recently added ``Charmed,'' a
television series starring Shannen Doherty and Alyssa Milano as
sisters in the craft. And Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman play
another pair of spell-casting sibs in the motion picture
``Practical Magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers are dabbling in witchcraft, too. Cover Girl makeup
has models Tyra Banks and Niki Taylor casting lavender magic
makeovers in an enchanted forest, while Camel cigarettes recently
ran print ads with three fetching smokers encircling about a table
of arcane items and rings of smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is the image of the old crone with hooked nose hunched over
a bubbling cauldron as she cackles incantations. The modern witch
looks shockingly contemporary. Save for occasional intricate
jewelry and floral headdresses, witches typically prefer a power
suit or jeans to black cloaks and pointy hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to dress extremely corporate,'' said Dorothy Morrison,
a Wiccan High Priestess of the Georgian Tradition who lives in the
Midwest but did not want her hometown to appear in this story. ``I
think it's better for the image. Flowing robes have their place but
I think we would have more credibility if we looked like normal
people because we are normal people.''
</P>
<P>
   And while men may be warlocks, most new Wiccans are young women
searching for an identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hugely popular with young teens and women in their 20s,''
noted Curott, who became a witch when she was 25. ``Women need an
image of the divine that reflects themselves. They haven't had it
for 2,000 years. Goddess spirituality and witchcraft affords the
image of the divine feminine.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said she ``stopped praying to Jesus when I was 5
because I realized Mary was the all powerful one, and no one would
dare disobey their mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Curott said the Goddess in Wiccan lore is the sacred life force
_ Mother Nature within the body _ an ever-present energy that
connects all things.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for a belief system that dates back hundreds of years (it's
commonly called ``the Old Religion''), witchcraft's fresh, New
Age-like philosophy still has clouded origins.
</P>
<P>
   The word witch actually stems from the old Anglo-Saxon word
``wicce,'' meaning ``wise one,'' such as a seer, priestess or
shaman who is able to work with unseen, divine forces.
</P>
<P>
   Wiccans contend their craft was founded by the people of Old
Europe who attuned their psyches and daily lives to the cycles of
nature. It was practiced for centuries in southern Italy and in
small villages of Britain. Later, witchcraft made its way to
colonial Virginia and New England.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian crusade to suppress the Old Religion resulted in
many deaths (mostly women) during the Inquisition of the 13th and
14th centuries, as well as the infamous witch trials in
17th-century Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Modern Wiccans still use much of the old terminology (many still
prefer to be called ``witches''), but they want to dispel the
historical misconceptions associated with their craft.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, witches stress they do not worship the devil or
cast spells to harm people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Witches do not acknowledge the existence of a Christian devil
or hell,'' MacMillan said. ``Some pentagram users call themselves
Satanists. They may call themselves witches but the pagan community
in general wants nothing to do with Satanism or any kind of
relationship between Satanism and witchcraft. I wouldn't want my
kids to be involved in that or anywhere near it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Wiccan pentagram is often confused with the
baphomet used in Satanism, which is the pentagram turned upside
down to resemble a horned goat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Wicca's acknowledgment of God (albeit a duel god) and
determined stance against Satanism still haven't won the affections
of some Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church has not changed its position that witchcraft is not
acceptable,'' said the Rev. John A. Leies, chairman of the theology
department at St. Mary's University of San Antonio. ``It is a
violation of the virtue by which we honor God.''
</P>
<P>
   Leies said the Roman Catholic Church was aware of the difference
between witches and Satanists but added that Wicca's
``superstitious elements'' are not accepted by the church. Nor will
it condone Wicca's defying of nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't hear anybody in the church instituting a crusade
against witches,'' Leies said. ``In one sense, there's a greater
tolerance of Wicca, or white witchcraft, but the church is more
worried about the alliance with Satanism. The church says to accept
the reality of the devil.''
</P>
<P>
   But witches don't believe they will be condemned to hell for
doing or saying things ``deemed negative by someone else,'' said
Lori Christensen, a San Antonio witch who also teaches psychic
development. ``Wicca has no right or wrong. It's you and your
higher self that you face.''

CANDY CORN REMAINS THE KING OF SWEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANIEL J. VARGAS  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Time to fess up. Candy corn is one of your guilty
pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   You love it. Say it. Again, this time with some semblance of
sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   You're not alone. The concoction of honey, sugar and corn syrup
is a Halloween staple. Americans will buy 20 million pounds of the
tri-colored, triangular treat this year. So say the number
crunchers at the National Confectioners Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candy corn sales are kind of a fall thing,'' said the NCA's
Sheila Heath (not to be confused with the candy bar, she added).
``There is some red and green candy corn around Christmas time, but
it's primarily Halloween.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Halloween without it. While you are at it, imagine an
Easter basket missing marshmallow chicks, Christmas without candy
canes, Valentine's without those chalky little hearts bearing mushy
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Candy corn's significance is undisputed, but how did this
corn-craving craze come to be?
</P>
<P>
   Candy historians say the fall treat evolved in the 1920s, but
they aren't sure who produced the first sweet kernels. Even
professors who are experts in food culture couldn't answer the
question.
</P>
<P>
   Call it little orphan candy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit on the public relations board of the National
Confectioners Association, and I've brought it to their attention
but no one knows,'' said Gwen Stansu, spokeswoman for Favorite
Brands International in Chicago. Favorite Branks owns Farley's and
Sathers, both of which churn out several billion kernels per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll continue our search for an answer. Someday someone will
own up to it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its mysterious origin, candy corn's place in the candy
universe was clear from the beginning. Its hues of yellow, orange
and white destined it to become Halloween's soul mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``With its fall colors, it was a perfect fit,'' Stansu said.
``You can put the candy corn in a bowl on the table and it just
says `Halloween.' The whole experience just caught on.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 70-plus years later, it remains a thriving relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Candy corn spooks all other nonchocolate treats in sales this
time of year, helping make Halloween the biggest candy holiday. It
rakes in about $1.8 billion, leaving Valentine's Day, Easter and
Christmas in a cloud of, um, corn.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the recipe for candy corn, but don't try this at home:
</P>
<P>
   Fifty thousand pounds of corn syrup, honey and sugar are mixed
in a giant beater and then heated in bathtub-sized kettles until a
creamy syrup, called ``slurry,'' forms.
</P>
<P>
   The slurry is poured into silver vats, into which the yellow and
orange colors are added.
</P>
<P>
   The white portion (tip) of the candy corn is mixed in a special
vat. It receives special ingredients to make it firmer, hence, the
different taste you may have noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Next step is to add the slurry to triangular-shaped molds made
of cornstarch. First, the yellow band is poured, then orange and
white. Once done by hand, this process now uses machines.
</P>
<P>
   The kernels dry for 24 to 36 hours. Then they are removed from
the molds, dropped into a sifter to shake off any excess cornstarch
and get a shiny glaze.
</P>
<P>
   Candy corn is touted as a fat-free snack with 4.4 calories per
kernel. (Be warned, if you eat enough, your body will store any
excess calories as fat.)

BEING DISGRUNTLED IS ALL IN A DAY'S WORK

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Even when Daniel S. Levine is happy with his
work, he's disgruntled.
</P>
<P>
   He has to be. Since he began publishing the on-line magazine
disgruntled.com in 1995, Levine has heard workplace horror stories,
passed along tales of creative corporate sabotage and offered
advice to workers about taking control of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has produced a paperback book, ``Disgruntled: The Darker
Side of the World of Work,'' offering some fresh material and many
of the favorite tales from his on-line world.
</P>
<P>
   Such as this one a reader had sent him involving an office that
had installed cameras on top of each computer terminal to allow
employees to send video e-mail messages: ``A woman who was having
an affair with a married co-worker decided to send him a spicy
message. She performed a striptease and as she shook and shimmied
before the camera, she told him of the night of pleasure that
awaited him when they met for their illicit rendezvous later at
their favorite hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was that when she sent the message, she clicked on
the wrong distribution list. Instead of sending it to her lover as
she had intended, she sent it to 480 people throughout the firm.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine loves the funny anecdotes, but what prompted him to start
disgruntled.com was his frustration that the publications he worked
for paid little attention to the increasing anxieties of typical
workers, aiming their stories instead at executives and investors.
And he said there are workers who are still ambivalent about the
job market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this growing number of people who can't understand the
disconnect between the job market that people are reading about and
what they are experiencing,'' Levine said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   People who have been laid off after years with a company can be
particularly devastated, he said. ``It's unbelievable in some cases
how betrayed they feel. In some cases, they find out that their job
hasn't gone away _ they've just hired someone as a contract
employee.''
</P>
<P>
   His book tells about a controller in Wisconsin who was asked to
prepare a two-year cash projection, a revised budget and a
suggested plan for laying off people and eliminating departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was told to have it in by Friday at 4 p.m.,'' Levine
writes. ``Forty-five minutes after meeting his deadline he was
handed a pink slip and told his services were no longer needed.
Among his final duties was to type his own severance agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The book isn't made up of just cute or depressing anecdotes.
Levine offers many statistics from a variety of sources, such as
this one from the AFL-CIO's Executive Pay Watch project: From 1980
through 1995, factory wages rose 70 percent, corporate profits rose
145 percent and compensation for chief executives soared nearly 500
percent.
</P>
<P>
   He has tales of corporate sabotage, like the computer programmer
who designed a company's databases in the 1970s. The programmer had
his own form of unemployment insurance: If his name was deleted
from the company's personnel database, the software would
automatically delete the customer database.
</P>
<P>
   It was _ and it did.
</P>
<P>
   Levine also offers ways that frustrated workers can help
themselves, including an extensive list of agencies and groups. He
offers common-sense advice about making the most out of a bad
situation, and how people often find they are better off if they
reduce spending so they can take a lower-paying job that is more
fulfilling.
</P>
<P>
   Readers from the Web site (www.disgruntled.com) also offer tales
about why they quit their jobs, sometimes out of anger or
frustration, but other times simply because it was the right thing
to do. Levine included a letter from an engineer who described an
incident that triggered his own career decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I was riding down the elevator with an older engineer
whom I'll call Joe,'' the engineer wrote. ``Joe was retiring after
30 years with the company. This was his last day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Joe what the highlight of his career was. He stared at
me for a solid minute over the box of personal belongings he
carried. He looked away. His face got cloudy. As he walked out the
door for the very last time, he shook his head and mumbled, `What a
waste, what a waste!'
</P>
<P>
   ``I quit the next day.''

DONATION BRINGS OUT THE REAL MATT FONG 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If Matt Fong were the ``unifier'' he claims to
be, these are just a few causes the Republican candidate for Senate
could have given $50,000 to:
</P>
<P>
   _ How about a Matthew Shepard scholarship fund at the University
of Wyoming in honor of the young gay man beaten to death by thugs
two weeks ago?
</P>
<P>
   _ How about a child care center in San Francisco's Chinatown or
East Los Angeles?
</P>
<P>
   _ How about an agency that makes adoption easier for working
families?
</P>
<P>
   No, Fong didn't give the leftover campaign funds from his state
treasurer's race to any unifying charitable cause like those, a
cause he'd be proud to mention in campaign speeches and ads in his
race for senator against the incumbent, Barbara Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   While advertising himself as a moderate, Fong gave the $50,000
to right-wing extremists, the Rev. Lou Sheldon and his Traditional
Values Coalition, a group that's against women's right to abortion
and has fought to keep gays out of teaching, marriages and
ambassadorships.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition even fought to put people with AIDS in urban
concentration camps, euphemistically called ``cities of refuge.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican National Convention in 1996, Sheldon told me
he was sure there must be good moderate Republicans, ``just as I'm
sure there are heterosexuals in San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the most dangerous kind of right-winger, smart, savvy
and often witty, unlike the witless Fong who handed the man his
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, in answer to your question, he could have given it
to a day care center in Chinatown or some other charitable
organization,'' said Joseph Remcho, a Democratic lawyer who has
dealt with leftover campaign funds before. ``It's pretty clearly a
massive statement about where his heart is.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong's heart is with the heartless. I don't know where his head
is, or if there is anything in his head.
</P>
<P>
   After the San Francisco Examiner revealed Fong's June donation
to the Traditional Values Coalition, Fong was left sputtering about
how the donation was intended to change the group's more extreme
positions.
</P>
<P>
   You bet, Matt, and the NAACP should give money to the Klan to
change its more extreme positions.
</P>
<P>
   If by any slim chance Fong is elected senator, maybe he'll vote
to send millions to Serbian and Iraqi leaders so they'll change
their more extreme positions.
</P>
<P>
   If only Fong had said something credible, like he gave the money
to Sheldon in order to get an endorsement in the primary, he'd be a
lot better off.
</P>
<P>
   The people Fong hired as spin doctors have been reduced to
barely rotating quacks. Fong's campaign spokesman, Steve Schmidt,
who referred to Sheldon as ``Rev. Lou,'' said the money was meant
to help the Traditional Values Coalition with its ``voter education
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   I've seen some of the Traditional Values Coalition's educational
materials, and they were pretty sleazy. They were effective,
though, and aimed at the U.S. Senate, the 100 most important voters
in the land.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon helped demolish the Senate confirmation of James Hormel
_ the gay philanthropist from San Francisco _ as ambassador to
Luxembourg by spending two days in the gay and lesbian room of the
San Francisco public library. Sheldon and his daughter Xeroxed
about 10 pounds of mostly raunchy and erotic material for each
member of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   As Kenneth Starr knows, they love receiving thick volumes of the
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon's idea was to convince senators that if Hormel helped
fund the library, he must approve of every book in it _ you know,
like Andrew Carnegie and all his libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Fong now says his donation was only earmarked for
survey research to oppose gay marriage, but maybe it's paying off
Sheldon's Xerox bill.
</P>
<P>
   In endorsing Fong, the San Francisco Chronicle said he is a man
who ``talks with passion about making the Republican Party more
inclusive to minorities and gays.'' The Los Angeles Times described
Fong as ``a low-key Republican moderate.''
</P>
<P>
   They look almost as foolish as Matt Fong does.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't retract their endorsements, the only thing they
can say is that they endorsed Fong to make him more moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, that works. And making Fong senator will make him smarter.

AMAZING SURVIVAL INSTINCTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Whenever I think of mazes, my mind immediately dredges
up ``The Shining.'' Not the book, the movie _ Jack Nicholson
murderously chasing Shelley Duvall and the little kid who played
Danny through the snowy maze in the mountains of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   I could have used Danny the other day, when I visited the Maize
(it's in a cornfield, get it?) at Alma School and Queen Creek
roads. Although his particular psychic gifts may have given him a
propensity to talk to invisible friends and scream ``Redrum!
Redrum!'' at the top of his lungs, Danny was invaluable in the
maze, nearly a human compass.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, I wasn't in that big a hurry. The temperature was
near 90, so freezing to death wasn't a problem. And, as far as I
know, I didn't have a crazed ax-wielding writer chasing after me.
Although some editors might have liked to have had a crack at it. .
. .
</P>
<P>
   I tackled the maze in the early afternoon, and pretty much had
the 6-acre place to myself.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as you walk down the dirt path, you're bordered on
either side by cornstalks held back by plastic chicken-wire
fencing. The stalks are 6 or 7 feet tall, so once you make your
first turn, you are immersed in corn, causing you to immediately
lose your bearings. Causing me to, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Which is the point, after all. Mazes are funny things. When
you're solving one with a pencil on a children's menu at a pizza
parlor, you see everything from above. When you're down in it,
well, you're down in it.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain freedom, so they say, to willingly getting
yourself lost. They are wrong. They just have a poor sense of
direction. Unfortunately, so do I. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Fight of the navigator
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I hugged the perimeter for a while, and not on purpose. I have
such a poor sense of direction and spatial relations that I don't
learn anything. I'll go over a path again and again before I
realize it's the same one _ the wrong one. Three times I tried
different paths, and three times I wound up back in the same place.
There are gates you can use as shortcuts, but at first I thought
that would be cheating, and soldiered on.
</P>
<P>
   Soon I decided that, yes, I would use the shortcuts. But by then
I was so lost I couldn't find one.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I ended up atop a bridge, where a man in a yellow
shirt (that's how you know it's him) offered help. Just tell me
generally where the center is, I asked him, pointing in the
direction I suspected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right over there,'' he said, and pointed directly behind me.
</P>
<P>
   Aha. So I glanced at the aerial map he had, and, in a few
minutes, wound my way to the center. Magellan, I ain't.
</P>
<P>
   The way out was a little simpler, although I didn't just retrace
my steps. The only way I know that is because on my exit I saw a
blue Pepsi cup someone had jammed onto a cornstalk. I don't know if
this was Hansel-and-Gretel-style cheating or just plain littering,
but, either way, it was wrong. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Professional concession
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It took me about 45 minutes to get in and out, which wasn't a
bad time. Most people take about that long, Dale Herbst told me
from his post in the trailer that serves as a concession stand. His
son, Brett, designed and built the Maize.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there was the person who wandered around for 3{
hours. I'm sorry, but that's when I'd whip out my Swiss Army knife
like it was a miniature machete and hack my way to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had to help people out,'' Dale said. ``A lot of people
get a little bothered.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale himself gets a little mixed up sometimes, when he's tilling
the paths.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get in there on that Roto-tiller you pay attention to
what you're doing and not where you're going, so much,'' he said.
``I'm going around and around. It's hard for me to find my way
through, I will admit.''
</P>
<P>
   No shame in that. The Maize can throw you off, and the feeling
lasts. When I was done, I headed south on Alma School toward home.
It took me almost five minutes to figure out the problem.
</P>
<P>
   I live north. &QL;

BOXER VS. FONG: A DILEMMA FOR AN ASIAN-AMERICAN LIBERAL 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM WONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ More than other political contests, the
Boxer-Fong U.S. Senate race has caused a battle between my head and
my heart. It is a tussle between the rational and irrational.
</P>
<P>
   For most California voters, a decision on the fascinating
face-off between incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer and Republican
Matt Fong will be relatively simple. They will vote for the person
they like better _ who most closely stands for what they stand for.
For me and for other Chinese-American liberals, the choice is more
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   When Boxer first ran for the Senate in 1992, the choice was
simple for me. Her opponent was a right-wing Los Angeles television
personality named Bruce Herschensohn. Boxer was a feisty Marin
County liberal who espoused feminist and environmental positions.
It was easy pickings: Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, this year's race is no different because Boxer
still represents liberal causes, ones that I generally subscribe
to. It should again be an easy choice for me. But it isn't, and the
reason is Fong's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   At one level, my waffling is itself irrational. Fong's stances
on issues such as abortion rights, gun control and the environment
are ones I generally disagree with. A responsible voter, you might
say, would support a candidate who shares his views on significant
public issues.
</P>
<P>
   No argument there, except that Fong represents something
intangible that may not be apparent to most Californians. He is the
rare Chinese-American politician who has risen to the level of
potential national visibility.
</P>
<P>
   In a state with a long and sometimes troubled history regarding
its ethnic Chinese population, Fong standing on the precipice of
national political power is a potent symbol. It is ethnic pride
that causes my civil war of conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese-Americans are energized by Fong's candidacy, and
not all of them are conservative Republicans. Just take my own
relatives. One sister, not particularly active politically, is a
friend of one of Fong's aunts _ so she is helping Fong raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Another sister, more liberal and more politically active, says
she's voting for Boxer even though she doesn't care much for Boxer
personally. She can't see voting for Fong and what he stands for.
Her husband, however, has both centrist and iconoclastic political
views. He's going to vote for Fong because the Republican, as a
Chinese-American man, embodies what my brother-in-law believes has
been a missing or invisible element in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese-American Democrats clearly are divided on the Boxer-Fong
race. Some liberals have expressed support for Boxer with complete
certitude. Some centrist Democrats say they are crossing the line
to work for Fong.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons vary. Some express disappointment with the
Democratic Party for not embracing Asian-Americans more. They
didn't like how the party abandoned a handful of Asian-American
party fund-raisers during the campaign-finance scandal. They view
Boxer as insensitive to Chinese-Americans and issues of particular
importance to them.
</P>
<P>
   One pro-Boxer Asian-American told me that she does not have our
community in her heart. The feeling among a lot of California
Chinese-Americans, and perhaps other Asian-Americans, is that Fong
does have their interests in his heart, despite his moderate to
conservative stances.
</P>
<P>
   For me, Fong's $50,000 contribution to the Traditional Values
Coalition, a right-wing Christian group, is troubling, if not
defining. But as the election grows close, I just might wait until
I am inside the polling booth before I make my final decision.

FIGHTING CALIFORNIA PROPOSITION 9 WITH YOUR MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARVEY ROSENFIELD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Proposition 9 is one of those rare ballot
measures that exposes the pervasive reach of cash-register politics
in California.
</P>
<P>
   The odd alliances organized against the ballot initiative
include three environmental groups lined up with utility companies
in support of nuclear power. Big labor standing side-by-side with
big business. Republicans and Democrats hand-in-hand.
Self-described ``low-income'' groups opposing rate reductions. What
unites so many groups? The answer, of course, is money _ your
money.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 9 is a referendum on a 1996 legislative deal that
requires ratepayers to pay off $28 billion in bad debts incurred by
Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego
Gas &AMP; Electric. The arrogance of these giant monopolies pushed the
cost of electricity to 50 percent above the national average.
Deregulation was supposed to give ratepayers the right to choose
among competing electricity suppliers. But competition threatened
the three companies.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Legislature. Its bailout of the utilities appears on
utility bills as ``CTC.'' This charge has destroyed competition.
Every power supplier that competes with PG&AMP;E must collect the
bailout charge from its customers and send the money to PG&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
   To hide their thievery, the utilities agreed to give small
ratepayers a 10 percent rate reduction for four years. But
residential and small businesses are required to repay the rate
reduction bonds with interest for 10 years. (Look for the ``Trust
Transfer'' charge.)
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 9 prohibits utilities from taxing us to pay for
billions of dollars in obsolete and inefficient power plants. It
will lower our electricity rates by 24 percent to 37 percent,
according to the California Energy Commission. That's at least $250
per year per family.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is supported by the League of Women Voters,
Consumers Union, Consumer Reports magazine, the Sierra Club, Ralph
Nader and the Public Media Center.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities already have spent $30 million trying to defeat
Proposition 9. But you won't ever see their faces. In a remarkable
display of cash-register politics, the utility companies have
recruited a vast number of surrogates.
</P>
<P>
   The Planning and Conservation League, an ostensible
environmental group, got $70,000 in donations from the three
utilities (some of the most notorious polluters in the state) to
send out anti-Proposition 9 mailings.
</P>
<P>
   David Horowitz, the former television reporter now campaigning
against Proposition 9, got $106,000. The author of a supposedly
independent study critical of Proposition 9 got $100,000. The San
Francisco Greenlining Institute claims Proposition 9's rate cuts
aren't important for the poor. (It got $300,000 from the
utilities).
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the utility food chain: the state Republican and
Democratic parties, which each got $500,000. In ads and mailings,
these pigs at the utility trough threaten us with higher taxes,
litigation and ``chaos'' if we dare pass Proposition 9.
</P>
<P>
   Independent experts, such as the state legislative analyst, have
dismissed their claims. Indeed, the courts have already thrown out
the utilities' legal challenge to Proposition 9. A question for
after the election: How much of the tab for the utilities'
campaigning will ratepayers be forced to pay?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the citizen-backed Proposition 9 has no money for
slick advertising. The people Proposition 9 will help the most
can't afford commercials. Instead, citizen volunteers _ members of
the new California Oaks Project _ are spreading the word. So the
campaign for Proposition 9 will determine not only whether
Californians will pay less for electricity, but also whether the
initiative process belongs to the people, or to the arrogant and
corrupt establishment that dominates our state.
</P>
<P>

Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, is co-author of Proposition 9.)

D'AMATO FACES QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS WORK HABITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Filed in the national news, ``a,'' category and political
news, ``p,'' category)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES M. ODATO  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENVILLE, N.Y. _ Amid a spirited, blue-collar work force
cheering his speech, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato on Tuesday declared
himself a working man who shows up day in and day out to do his
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those men and women, they go to work every day, just like the
rest of Americans,'' D'Amato, speaking from a flatbed truck, told
many of the 370 men and women employed by locomotive manufacturer
Super Steel. ``And if you send me to Washington and I was too busy
to show up for work, then you should replace me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki earlier credited his fellow Republican,
D'Amato, for being on the job when the state needed him.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, D'Amato, who has relentlessly attacked his
Democratic rival, Rep. Charles E. Schumer, for missing dozens of
votes in Congress this year, was called on to explain why he, as a
Nassau County supervisor running for the Senate in 1980, missed 966
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Records released by the Schumer camp Tuesday showed D'Amato
routinely missed votes in 1980, when he was supervisor of
Hempstead, Long Island, and running against Jacob Javits in the
Republican primary and Democrat Elizabeth Holtzman in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   The D'Amato data, which first appeared Tuesday on the Internet
version of today's edition of The Village Voice, shows:
</P>
<P>
   When he ran for the Senate the first time, in 1980, D'Amato
missed 10 of his final 11 county board meetings _ a 91 percent
absentee rate.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato missed 966 votes on ordinances and resolutions that
election year, including measures similar to those he has
criticized Schumer for missing. D'Amato did not show up for votes
on the county budget, tax rates and on funding for education and
senior citizen services. D'Amato skipped five of the six bimonthly
board meetings before the November 1980 election, starting in
August of that year, and all of the sessions after the election,
even though he remained on the public payroll.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has criticized Schumer the past six weeks for putting
politics before public service, even though both candidates have an
18-year congressional attendance average of more than 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Schumer campaign turned the tables on D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today Al D'Amato's glass house shattered,'' said Howard
Wolfson, Schumer's spokesman. ``Al D'Amato's whole campaign has
been a fraud. This shocking revelation is definitive proof that New
Yorkers can't trust Al D'Amato.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, through a spokesman, said Schumer is desperately
seeking to divert attention from his own record.
</P>
<P>
   The senator has said Schumer missed 90 percent of the House
Judiciary Committee's votes this year and 99 percent of the Banking
Committee's. Schumer's staff has not disputed the numbers, but said
that most of the measures were procedural or that most of the bills
passed by overwhelming margins rendering his vote meaningless to
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has had a difficult several days on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, D'Amato was caught in an apparent lie when he first
denied referring to Schumer as a ``putzhead'' and then admitted
using the Yiddish slur. ``Putz'' literally means penis, but is
often used as a synonym for ``fool,'' and it was in that context
that D'Amato eventually said he used the term.
</P>
<P>
   As the contentious and close race _ some polls have D'Amato and
Schumer in a statistical dead heat, while others give the Democrat
a slight lead _ moves into its final days, the revelations about
D'Amato's prior record are damaging to the incumbent senator,
according to pollster John Zogby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He raised the issue, and he keeps hammering and yammering on
the issue of attendance,'' Zogby said. ``And now it's going to come
back and haunt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Marist College pollster Lee Miringoff said D'Amato has a problem
explaining why it was OK for him to miss votes when he was
campaigning, but not OK for Schumer. Marist is an independent
college polling organization in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, (D'Amato) cannot overlook one and not the other. I
would suspect this would require some backpedaling on D'Amato's
part ... I would suspect because of the close connection between
Pataki and D'Amato, it may require some explaining as to why `A' is
OK and `B' is not. Most voters would think there is a similarity.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, a check of state Legislature voting records
Tuesday found that Pataki, a former state senator and D'Amato's
handpicked choice for governor in 1994, also missed Senate votes
during his gubernatorial campaign. Pataki, who has attacked
Schumer's voting record, missed 123 votes in Albany while
campaigning to unseat Democrat Mario Cuomo, according to records
released by Senate Democrats.

Super Steel. ``And if you send me to Washington and I was too busy
to show up for work, then you should replace me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki earlier credited his fellow Republican,
D'Amato, for being on the job when the state needed him.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, D'Amato, who has relentlessly attacked his
Democratic rival, Rep. Charles E. Schumer, for missing dozens of
votes in Congress this year, was called on to explain why he, as a
Nassau County supervisor running for the Senate in 1980, missed 966
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Records released by the Schumer camp Tuesday showed D'Amato
routinely missed votes in 1980, when he was supervisor of
Hempstead, Long Island, and running against Jacob Javits in the
Republican primary and Democrat Elizabeth Holtzman in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   The D'Amato data, which first appeared Tuesday on the Internet
version of today's edition of The Village Voice, shows:
</P>
<P>
   When he ran for the Senate the first time, in 1980, D'Amato
missed 10 of his final 11 county board meetings _ a 91 percent
absentee rate.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato missed 966 votes on ordinances and resolutions that
election year, including measures similar to those he has
criticized Schumer for missing. D'Amato did not show up for votes
on the county budget, tax rates and on funding for education and
senior citizen services. D'Amato skipped five of the six bimonthly
board meetings before the November 1980 election, starting in
August of that year, and all of the sessions after the election,
even though he remained on the public payroll.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has criticized Schumer the past six weeks for putting
politics before public service, even though both candidates have an
18-year congressional attendance average of more than 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Schumer campaign turned the tables on D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today Al D'Amato's glass house shattered,'' said Howard
Wolfson, Schumer's spokesman. ``Al D'Amato's whole campaign has
been a fraud. This shocking revelation is definitive proof that New
Yorkers can't trust Al D'Amato.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, through a spokesman, said Schumer is desperately
seeking to divert attention from his own record.
</P>
<P>
   The senator has said Schumer missed 90 percent of the House
Judiciary Committee's votes this year and 99 percent of the Banking
Committee's. Schumer's staff has not disputed the numbers, but said
that most of the measures were procedural or that most of the bills
passed by overwhelming margins rendering his vote meaningless to
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has had a difficult several days on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, D'Amato was caught in an apparent lie when he first
denied referring to Schumer as a ``putzhead'' and then admitted
using the Yiddish slur. ``Putz'' literally means penis, but is
often used as a synonym for ``fool,'' and it was in that context
that D'Amato eventually said he used the term.
</P>
<P>
   As the contentious and close race _ some polls have D'Amato and
Schumer in a statistical dead heat, while others give the Democrat
a slight lead _ moves into its final days, the revelations about
D'Amato's prior record are damaging to the incumbent senator,
according to pollster John Zogby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He raised the issue, and he keeps hammering and yammering on
the issue of attendance,'' Zogby said. ``And now it's going to come
back and haunt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Marist College pollster Lee Miringoff said D'Amato has a problem
explaining why it was OK for him to miss votes when he was
campaigning, but not OK for Schumer. Marist is an independent
college polling organization in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, (D'Amato) cannot overlook one and not the other. I
would suspect this would require some backpedaling on D'Amato's
part ... I would suspect because of the close connection between
Pataki and D'Amato, it may require some explaining as to why `A' is
OK and `B' is not. Most voters would think there is a similarity.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, a check of state Legislature voting records
Tuesday found that Pataki, a former state senator and D'Amato's
handpicked choice for governor in 1994, also missed Senate votes
during his gubernatorial campaign. Pataki, who has attacked
Schumer's voting record, missed 123 votes in Albany while
campaigning to unseat Democrat Mario Cuomo, according to records
released by Senate Democrats.

A `SCIENCE FICTION' JOURNEY FOR YOUNG ASTRONAUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KENNETH C. CROWE II  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ When Friendship 7 astronaut John Glenn
orbited the Earth three times on Feb. 20, 1962, Josephine
Parazynski followed the flight from her market in this upstate New
York town.
</P>
<P>
   She never considered that her only grandson, Scott, then just 7
months old, would be an astronaut. Even farther from speculation
was he would be traveling on the space shuttle Discovery when Glenn
returned to space 36 years later.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday afternoon, Parazynski, 87, will be sitting with
family and friends in her living room watching her grandson, Glenn
and their fellow crew members lift off from Cape Canaveral aboard a
space craft far more roomy and sophisticated than Friendship 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very nice to Scotty. They're very friendly. Scotty had
him over for dinner,'' Parazynski said about the relationship
between her grandson and Glenn, who is now 77 and the senior
senator from Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scotty's very protective of him. He's always guiding him,''
she said, pointing to her arm to show how her grandson, who is a
physician and will be monitoring Glenn in space, touches the
senator.
</P>
<P>
   Scott E. Parazynski, 37, spent summers and vacations visiting
his grandparents and relatives in Saratoga Springs, where his
father, John E. ``Eddie'' Parazynski, had grown up. Much of his
time was behind the register at Pepper's Market, the family
business next door to his grandparents' home.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Parazynski attended high school in Iran and Greece while
his father was working overseas for the Boeing Co. He graduated
from Stanford University and Stanford University Medical School and
now lives in Houston. He joined NASA in 1992, has flown on two
previous shuttle missions and has walked in space.
</P>
<P>
   On Josephine Parazynski's living-room wall hangs a picture of
6-year-old Scotty standing in front of a large building bearing a
NASA insignia. He's clutching a plastic toy rocket popular among
boys his age during the height of the space program. It's about
that time when he decided to be an astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview posted on the NASA Shuttle Web site, Scott
Parazynski spoke about flying with Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, my initial response was this is too good to be true,
this is science fiction,'' Parazynski said.
</P>
<P>
   ``John certainly was one of my role models, and one of the
inspirations for me being here today. Of course I don't remember
his pioneering orbital flight because I was only 7 months old at
the time, but my father worked on the Apollo program,'' Parazynski
said.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Parazynski doesn't expect to speak to her grandson
until he returns from space.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult moment of the 10-day mission for her will
come when Discovery is launched, scheduled Thursday at 2 p.m.
Eastern. She saw her grandson's two other launches in person. But
she worries and prays as the shuttle lifts off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll be able to cope better at home,'' she said. ``I'm
not going to miss it.''

CALIFORNIA GROUP SAYS IT MAY BUY THE OAKLAND A'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Just days after officials here hired a Boston
financial firm to find local buyers for the Oakland Athletics, a
group of sports and business figures has emerged with a plan to buy
the baseball team and a promise to keep it in the Oakland Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball Hall of Famer Joe Morgan; Andy Dolich, a former A's
vice president; and George Zimmer, whose bearded, beaming face
appears in ads for his Men's Wearhouse clothing chain, say they are
assembling a team of investors to buy the A's once the team's worth
has been determined.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth partner would be Advantix, parent company of BASS
Tickets, for which Dolich is vice president for sports marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not made an offer,'' Dolich said Tuesday. ``We are
still out actively talking to additional investors. The group as
it's presently constructed will not be the final group.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland Vice Mayor Ignacio del la Fuente said it was ``too early
to tell'' whether Dolich and his team would make a viable offer for
the A's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they have any juice behind them. We'll see,''
he said, adding that other potential buyers were ``waiting in the
wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Current owners Steve Schott and Ken Hofmann have put the A's on
the block for $135 million plus $20.3 million in deferred player
compensation, a price officials consider to be inflated.
</P>
<P>
   John Russo, an Oakland City Council member, has accused the
owners of trying to price themselves out of the local market and
sell to investors who will move the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are successful in breaking the community's heart, they
will sell the team to the highest bidder,'' Russo said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland-Alameda County Joint Powers Authority, which
oversees the Oakland Coliseum, has demanded arbitration to
determine the value of the A's.
</P>
<P>
   Dolich said his group, if successful in buying the A's, would
restore the team's fan-pleasing performance and keep it in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be the intent of our group to move the A's to the
level that they had in their glory years of 1987 through 1992,''
Dolich said. ``You have to give the fans a team that they believe
has a chance to compete for the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   The team has had three losing seasons since the current owners
took over, and attendance has dropped from 2.5 million a year to
about half that number.
</P>
<P>
   Dolich said he and his partners wanted to keep the team where it
was, even if that meant remaining in the multipurpose Oakland
Coliseum rather than getting a baseball-only park of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it is folly to believe that this community would
look at building a new stadium,'' Dolich said. ``In the future, if
the economics makes sense to do that, sure, we'll consider it. But
right now the focus is in Oakland at the Oakland Coliseum.''
</P>
<P>
   Russo said the potential new investors were ``a very impressive
group. They've got baseball background both on the field and in the
front office, and they've got at least one prominent businessman
who has got a high profile.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a reference to Zimmer, the Men's Wearhouse founder,
chief executive and company icon, who appears in all of his own
advertisements to tell viewers, ``I guarantee it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolich served as the A's vice president of operations from 1980
to 1991, and as executive vice president from 1991 to 1994. He then
spent one year as president and chief executive of the Golden State
Warriors National Basketball Association franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, who owns a beer distributorship in Alamo, played for
Houston, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Oakland but was best known
for his stellar years with Cincinnati's Big Red Machine. He is a
member of baseball's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   As for Zimmer's ``I guarantee it'' slogan, Russo said: ``I'd
like to hear him say he's going to guarantee a World Series.''

The two studies were designed to test an idea on which many
scientists and patients had pinned their hopes: that therapy
combining three powerful antiviral drugs, the ``cocktail,'' might
diminish HIV infection to such a low level that the virus could
then be kept in check by fewer drugs and the body's own immune
system. That way, instead of having to take the triple combination
for life, as some experts had predicted would be necessary,

market investments. The plan would raise the tax paid on those
transactions to 0.38 percent from 0.2 percent now. A tax on
corporate earnings will rise to 3 percent from 2 percent. The most
sensitive measure would raise the social security tax paid by
government employees and _ for the first time _ collect the tax

increase unemployment. By Diana Jean Schemo.

ALASKA SCHOOL MURDERS: A WINDOW ON TEEN RAGE

   BETHEL, Alaska _ One pitch-dark morning last year, 16-year-old
Evan Ramsey boarded the yellow school bus on Napakiak Drive with a
three-foot shotgun stuffed into his baggy black jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Classmates noticed he was walking with a limp but never said
anything. Two minutes before the 8:50 bell Evan walked into the
lobby of Bethel Regional High, removed his hat and coat, pulled the
gun to his hip, and shot sophomore basketball player Josh Palacios
in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys better run,'' he yelled as students ran for cover. A
school secretary described Evan's expression that morning as
``gleefully evil.'' For several minutes, he roamed the hallways,
firing randomly into the ceiling and the metal lockers before he
was confronted by the principal, Ron Edwards, a 50-year-old former
Marine.
</P>
<P>
   Evan pointed the black gun at Edwards. As the principal turned,
Evan shot him behind his left shoulder from about 10 feet away. He
then pulled another shell from his pants pocket. ``This one's for
me,'' he announced.
</P>
<P>
   He raised the gun to his chin but couldn't bring himself to
fire. Police shot at Evan twice before he finally yelled ``I don't
want to die'' and threw down the shotgun on a staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Josh and Edwards lay dying, the student holding his gold
crucifix, the principal cradled in the arms of his wife, a
substitute teacher, on the floor of his own office. The spray of
birdshot that killed Josh also wounded two other students, the
second shooting incident in a 16-month wave of multiple murders
committed by children at schools in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The frightening odyssey that led Evan to kill _ pieced together
from dozens of interviews, court transcripts, and Alaska
child-welfare records _ illustrates how the hidden culture of
severely troubled children can produce the kind of explosive
violence that has flashed in seven school shootings the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Just off the radar screen of most adults, growing numbers of
teenagers move in a world where violence is an option in resolving
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The glorification of violence has spread from inner cities to
places like Bethel, a lonely rural town on the Alaskan tundra where
residents still leave their keys in the car. And the presence of
weapons, combined with common teenage problems _ untreated
depression, substance abuse, suicide ideation, even teasing _ has
made the melodrama of adolescence more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think growing up basically is hard,'' said Brock Rapoza, 16,
who was standing near Palacios when his friend was shot. ``I think
it would be real easy _ with a combination of hormones, the
problems you have growing up, and around here there's so much
alcohol abuse _ for a kid to just snap.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of bringing a gun to school ``popped into my head one
day,'' Evan said recently during three days of interviews inside
the Cook Inlet Pre-Trial Facility in Anchorage, where he is
awaiting sentencing Dec. 1 for what is expected to be a life term
in state prison. His face soft, his wrists and legs shackled, Evan,
who turned 18 in July, said he ``didn't really feel anything'' as
he killed his classmate and principal.
</P>
<P>
   Evan (pronounced E-van) lived with the superintendent of the
Lower Kuskokwim School District, who first took him in as a foster
child when he was 7. Slight, goofy, with brown curly hair and acne,
he wore winter hats in summer, was tough to beat at chess, and was
known at school as ``Screech'' _ a geeky character he was said to
resemble on the television show ``Saved by the Bell.'' He counted
the school's brightest students among his closest friends, but he
was frequently picked on by stronger, more popular boys. He was
polite to adults and carried his neighbors' groceries. In a region
where guns are as prevalent as screwdrivers, he had little
experience with weapons, including the 12-gauge shotgun that hung
unlocked near his front door.
</P>
<P>
   To most adults who interacted with him, Evan seemed like a boy
who was maturing after struggling for years to control his
explosive temper. But in reality, he was slipping badly. Two years
earlier, depressed about his home life and harassment at school, he
took down the shotgun and threatened to ``blow my brains out''
before his best friend, Wilson Naneng, talked him out of it. At
night, unable to sleep, he wandered his neighborhood for hours, he
said, amusing himself by tossing rocks at dogs.
</P>
<P>
   One night, 10 days before the murders, Evan received an
unexpected call from his father, Don Ramsey, 53, who told him he
had just been released from prison. An infamous figure in Alaska,
the elder Ramsey had served 10 years for storming the state's
largest newspaper, The Anchorage Times, with an AR-180 assault
rifle, a .44 magnum revolver, three smoke grenades, and a string of
firecrackers, and for briefly taking the publisher hostage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Son, I'm out,'' Ramsey told Evan, who had seen his father just
three times since that incident. ``And I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan began to hang out with two new friends, both 14-year-old
boys. The three spent hours after school walking the boardwalks
that range across the area. They smoked unfiltered Camels and
marijuana together, and played violent video games on a Sony
PlayStation that one of the boys, James Randall, had in his room.
For hours, after school and during frequent sleep-overs, Evan and
James sat in the dark, immersing themselves in simulated killing.
</P>
<P>
   One day after being picked on, Evan recalled, he told James he
wanted to ``go out with a bang.'' He said he'd like to bring the
shotgun to school ``to scare the hell out of everybody and kill
myself.'' At first James didn't believe him, Evan said, but slowly
became convinced that his friend was serious. Evan said that James
and his other friend, Matthew Charles, began to egg him on. The two
boys even suggested several teachers and students he could kill,
including Ron Edwards, the principal, Evan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``James said, `Don't kill yourself,''' recalled Evan. ``He told
me: `You got to live the fame and the fortune.'''
</P>
<P>
   James, currently on trial for two juvenile counts of first-and
second-degree murder as an accomplice, acknowledged in an interview
that he showed Evan how to load the shotgun the day before the
murders. But he said he hadn't been sure Evan was serious about
taking the gun to school.
</P>
<P>
   The third boy, Matthew, told investigators he had offered to
``back up'' Evan with a .22-caliber revolver he kept at home. But
he couldn't, he said, ``because I'm only 14.'' Instead, he brought
a camera to take pictures of the shootings, which, according to
Evan, Matthew had hoped to hang on his wall. Matthew, who was
initially charged with first-degree murder as a juvenile, later
pleaded guilty to a juvenile charge of criminally negligent
homicide, and is in the custody of his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Evan told other friends that ``something big is gonna happen,''
that he was plotting ``an evil day.'' He told them to gather in the
library that morning, Feb. 19, 1997, on a mezzanine above the
lobby, out of harm's way. At least 10 students were there _ some
completely in the dark, others with a vague foreboding of what
might occur, and at least one apparently aware that Evan intended
to show up with a gun. But none alerted an adult.
</P>
<P>
   When the first shot was fired, Wilson Naneng and his girlfriend,
Cynthia, came racing down from the mezzanine in a panic. Both had
received calls from Evan the night before. Cynthia hadn't been
home. But Wilson talked to his friend for an hour and got the
impression Evan was planning to fight a student who had been
teasing him. But as they waited in the library, it occurred to
Wilson and Cynthia that Evan, as he had two years before, might be
planning to take his own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to make sense,'' Cynthia recalled later. ``He was
hurting so bad, you know, why not show everybody how much he was
hurting. But we thought that he would kill himself, not other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the thought occurred to them, however, it was too
late. ``Evan was our friend, and to do something like that, it
totally destroyed all the trust I had,'' said Cynthia, a
16-year-old junior who asked that her last name not be used. ``You
just think, `Couldn't one of my other friends have done this,
too?'''

of statewide hearings to the Capitol tonight from 7-9 p.m. What
such studies are finding is that school violence, dramatized by a
series of sensational shootings, is relatively rare, but more
everyday problems of disruptive students made for a serious area of
disagreement. Teachers say younger, elementary-age students are
more of a problem than older students, but some parents say they
feel cut off by schools when their child is accused of being
disruptive, especially if race is involved. This experience of many
parents has been heard repeatedly by the panel meeting tonight,
according to convener Sen. Vincent Fort (D-Atlanta) and Suzanne
Dion, a Georgia PTA lobbyist who was also at the local downlink of
the White House summit. (Cumming, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 BETHEL, Alaska: ... ``have done this, too?'''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Inside Bethel Regional High, a rectangular mass of dark brown
wood, heads of moose, muskox, brown bear, and caribou are mounted
on the wall, testimony to the region's hunting culture. That year,
454 students _ mostly Caucasians, Eskimos, and mixtures of both _
were enrolled. Bethel (pop. 5,277), a hub for dozens of fishing
villages in the Yukon-Kuskokwim River Delta, is inaccessible by
car, so the high school basketball team, the Warriors, flies to
away games in a 10-seat plane.
</P>
<P>
   Before Alaska became the 49th state in 1959, the delta existed
in isolation. Many villages lacked telephones until the 1970s.
Television arrived shortly after. Today, most everyone has cable,
and the school district, which covers 10,000-square miles and
includes 25 schools, uses the most advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here 19 years. The kids used to be incredibly
naive,'' said Gary Baldwin, director of personnel for the school
district. ``They had no experience with the media, or with exposure
to violence, or with video games... But things are changing here
really fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The region has one of the highest rates of alcoholism and child
abuse in Alaska. In 1992, the Bethel office of the Division of
Family and Youth Services (DFYS) received 428 reports of harm to
children; by 1997 that number rose to 1,361. The high school has
become more unruly, teachers and students say. The year of the
shootings, Bethel Regional registered 2,496 disciplinary
infractions, an average of 5.5 per student, and issued 108
suspensions. The major infractions included abusive language,
defiance, and disruptions (45 percent); smoking, alcohol, and drug
use (25 percent); fighting and rough horseplay (19 percent);
harassment (9 percent); and carrying of weapons (4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   A student showed up at a junior varsity basketball game that
year with a 9mm Glock pistol, which he threatened to use against a
visiting student who had pulled a knife on him. Girls informed
their parents, who in turn informed administrators, that drugs were
being sold in the school bathroom. Boys were caught on campus
filling soda cans with beer. Midway through the year, the school
board met to consider using a drug-sniffing dog to search lockers.
</P>
<P>
   In a safety survey that year, 55 percent of all Bethel Regional
students reported seeing drug and alcohol use on campus; 70 percent
said they knew students who came to school high on drugs or
alcohol. ``Kids will come to school stoned; they'll go out during
lunch time, during classes, and smoke pot,'' said Cynthia.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting beside her, Cynthia's parents, Marty and Jean, said
little. Both are nurses who moved to Bethel from Anchorage,
Alaska's largest city, to raise their children away from the urban
maw. Scholastically, Cynthia is thriving: Her grade-point average
is 4.05, better than perfect because of an A she received in honors
biology. She reads Hemingway and Nabokov.
</P>
<P>
   But socially she sometimes has struggled. In seventh grade, she
briefly dated Evan Ramsey. The two broke up but remained friends.
They hung out in a clique of students who, she said, ``were not
really wanted by anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia said many of her friends have struggled with the kind of
depression that seemed to gnaw at Evan. ``A lot of them have tried
to commit suicide or mutilate themselves in various ways,'' she
said. ``One of my friends was taking bottles of aspirin and had to
be taken into Anchorage for a day or two. My friends carve
themselves up with razors, burn themselves, pierce themselves. One
of my friends has slit her wrists several times, unsuccessfully.
There's probably something with every single one of my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiral of troubles began after father's rampage &QL;

   Five feet 4 1/2 inches tall and built like a small kiosk, Don
Ramsey sometimes refers to himself as ``Yoda.'' He lives in
Anchorage in a sparsely furnished two-bedroom apartment with his
youngest son, William, 14. He lives with the shades drawn,
surrounded by computer equipment and thousands of documents
detailing his criminal history and his sons' experiences in the
Alaska foster-care system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, a fire destroyed Ramsey's apartment. A cab driver at
the time, Ramsey blamed the incident on local politicians. He sent
his wife Carol and their sons, John, Evan, and William, to live
with relatives in Fairbanks, then declared ``war'' against ``The
System,'' as he described it in an open letter to an Alaska senator
for which he bought advertising space in The Anchorage Times.
</P>
<P>
   Upset when the Times pulled the ad, saying it was in poor taste,
Ramsey walked into the newspaper's offices, chained the door, set
off smoke grenades and firecrackers, and made his way upstairs to
meet the publisher, Robert Atwood. After spraying the ceiling with
the assault rifle, he held Atwood hostage for several minutes
before the 79-year-old man and his 46-year-old daughter subdued
him. Ramsey claims he gave up when he heard Atwood's daughter cry,
``Daddy!''
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time they pulled me out of there it looked like the
last scene in `The Blues Brothers,''' joked Ramsey, who was called
``Rambo'' in prison.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 10 years, Carol Ramsey said, her husband had been
``the kind of person I was looking for: loving and caring. On
weekends we'd go for rides down the highway, celebrate the kids'
birthdays at home or at Chuck E. Cheese.'' When her husband was
convicted of attempted kidnapping, three counts of felony assault,
and two counts of reckless endangerment for the attack on The
Anchorage Times, she unraveled. ``That's when I started drinking,''
she said recently. ``I didn't know what else to do. From 1986 until
about two years ago, everything I did depended on alcohol. Every
morning I would have beer for breakfast and drink all day.''
</P>
<P>
   DFYS took away her children on Dec. 14, 1987. Tipped off by her
sister Ida, authorities found Carol too drunk to speak, her boys
huddled inside an unheated home with temperatures of 22 below zero
outside. Evan was 7. For the next four years, he and his brothers
moved between foster homes and their mother's, always returning to
state custody when Carol resumed drinking.
</P>
<P>
   One February evening, one of Carol's boyfriends punched John
Ramsey in the chest. John, who was 9, waited until his mother and
her boyfriend had passed out, put coats on his two brothers, and
set out in subzero weather. The boys made their way to their
principal's house, where Janna Hulse, his wife, found them huddled
in an enclosed porch at 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a noise and thought it was a dog, but I went to take a
look and it was the three boys,'' she recalled. ``They had their
jackets, but no hats or gloves. So we gave them breakfast and in
the morning washed them and called DFYS.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol, a tiny, soft-spoken woman, lost her two front teeth a few
years back when a lover punched her in the face. She lives in a
small Anchorage apartment decorated with scenic jig-saw puzzles and
photos of her children. She is part Eskimo, part Athapascan Indian,
and when she speaks, it is difficult to imagine the horror that
seems to surround her when she drinks. ``When she's sober she's the
type of person you wouldn't mind hanging around with,'' said Evan.
</P>
<P>
   Even while he and his brothers were in foster care, Evan visited
his mother every summer. ``He always wanted to come stay with me _
a momma's boy, I guess you'd call it,'' said Carol.
</P>
<P>
   Evan's psychologist: `It hurts when he cries'
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, three months after DFYS first took custody of the
Ramsey boys, a state psychologist warned that Evan was ``beginning
to develop a real depression. He has no nice dreams. The only
beautiful thing he can think of is his cat, which died; and it
hurts when he cries.'' Evan was almost 8. The psychologist
recommended therapy and placement in a ``long-term, safe, and
affectionate home.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan lived in 10 homes over the next three years. In 1990, DFYS
received reports of abuse and discovered an older boy in his foster
home had caused bruises to Evan's face and neck. Evan later said
the boy urinated in his mouth. In a letter to the foster parents, a
case worker wrote, ``I'm sure that you readily agree children
cannot live in an environment where there is fear of being `thumped
on' by another child stronger than they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan never received counseling. But later that year, DFYS found
a stable home for him and William with school superintendent Sue
Hare. (John had been sent to a relative in Anchorage.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the most prominent figures in the region, Hare oversaw a
school district roughly the size of Ohio. She held a master's
degree in public school administration. Fired after the shootings,
her 13-year tenure was the longest of any school superintendent in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Hare grew up in Georgia and came to Alaska after seeing pictures
in a travel brochure. She never left. She married a local Yup'ik
Eskimo and settled down to a career in public education. One day
her husband David took a group of boys fishing on the Kuskokwim
River. His nephew fell in and when David went to rescue him, both
drowned. ``You always think the thing that's bad is the worst thing
that'll ever happen,'' said Hare, laughing mordantly. ``And then
you live a little longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hare was alone and already had two adopted children, a boy and a
girl, when DFYS asked her to take in Evan and William Ramsey. She
was traveling to schools throughout the district and often was busy
with work into the night. The state paid her $1,424 a month for the
care of both boys, but she said money was not a consideration. ``I
just felt so sorry for them,'' she said. ``You have two kids
turning up on somebody's porch and it's below freezing outside? And
DFYS says, `Will you take them; there's no other place?'''
</P>
<P>
   Elena Franks, the DFYS social worker who handled the case, said
Hare was chosen because ``she was licensed and she had the space.''
Hare had cared for 21 previous foster children, including a child
with leukemia who had died in her arms.

   TAKE-BOS  
 BETHEL, Alaska: ... died in her arms.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But many people in Bethel now second-guess the decision to place
the boys with Hare. In July 1992, according to Bethel court
records, Hare's adopted son, 27-year-old Sam, pleaded no contest to
sexual abuse of a minor, a felony. State law prohibits sex
offenders from residing in homes where foster care is provided. The
agency was aware of the allegations against Sam during a review of
Hare's guardianship that year, agency officials acknowledged. No
action was taken because Sam never molested Evan and was not living
at home at the time, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sue Hare and Evan said that Sam lived with the boys for
several years before and after his conviction. Worse, both Sue and
Sam Hare acknowledged in interviews that the shotgun used in the
shootings belonged to Sam, an apparent violation of his probation
and of federal law. Sue said she bought the gun long ago and had
given it to Sam to hunt ducks, geese, and ptarmigan. The gun sat
for years on a rack nailed next to the front door. ``William liked
to play with the gun,'' said Sam. ``William was just 13; he liked
looking at things. I'd tell him that as long as it's in the home,
it's OK. But Evan never picked it up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, you don't even think about it as an issue until
something like this happens,'' said Sue Hare. ``And then you go,
`Well, I would never have a gun in the house again.' But it's so
normal here to have access to guns. It wasn't anything that was at
any kind of level of my consciousness. It was a bird gun. I don't
think I even connected the fact that you can kill a person with a
gun that you use to shoot birds.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks, of the DFYS, said the gun never was an issue because
hunting is a way of life in Bethel and to question its presence
``would be unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   The first years of life at Hare's, Evan recalled, were ``like
the `Brady Bunch.' We went on our little outings. We went to the
playground, did things at home. We'd go out to the park, go to
restaurants to eat, go rent movies.'' But as he grew older he
struggled. He often fought with Hare's adopted children. In 1996,
police were called to Hare's home after Evan allegedly threatened
her daughter Pam and kicked a hole in the wall, but no charges were
filed. With Hare constantly traveling, she often sent the children
to stay with friends.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson Naneng's mother, Agnes, said Evan came running down the
street one day, crying. ``He asked if he could live with us,'' said
Agnes, who has 10 children, six still at home. ``I said, `Evan, we
don't have room, but anytime you need a place to go you're welcome
here.' He was the kind of kid who needed hugs, you know, people who
showed him they cared. I tried to do that for him when I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Agnes said she called DFYS and asked what it would take to place
Evan and his brother in a home where there was more adult
supervision. ``They said nothing could be done because Hare was his
legal guardian,'' she said. DFYS said it has no record of the call.
</P>
<P>
   Growing sense of tension, malaise in student body
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1996, a boy at Bethel Regional Junior High,
located on the same campus as the high school, told a 13-year-old
seventh grader that if he came to school the next day he would beat
him up. The youth went home, pulled a rifle from the hall closet,
and shot himself to death.
</P>
<P>
   Later, during one awful week, two other Bethel students lingered
on life-support systems before dying. One was a gifted student
athlete whose own house crushed him as he was lowering it with his
father, a physical education teacher. The other was a troubled
16-year-old who had gotten drunk and shot himself in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Between those crises and mounting discipline problems,
uneasiness began to grow among the faculty over what seemed to be a
growing sense of tension and malaise in the student body. None of
that concern, however, focused on Evan. Around school, teachers and
classmates were vaguely aware of his troubled life, but few knew
the details. He was known mainly as Sue Hare's foster son, a quiet
underachiever who often ran to Hare's office when his temper got
him in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Morris, who as dean of students was the school
disciplinarian, said Evan had trouble during junior high because
classmates ``knew how to push his buttons.'' He often would
explode, throwing trash cans, books, and other debris before
storming out of school. As a freshman, he tossed a chair in the
library, brushed aside a teacher who tried to restrain him, and ran
crying across the street to Hare's office. He received a two-day
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, he got into a fight with Josh Palacios, the boy he
later killed, at a sandpit outside school. There are several
versions of what happened. Brock Rapoza said Josh, who was half
black, half Mexican-American, actually fought a friend of Evan's
who used a racial epithet against him. Claudia Palacios said she
was told by her son it was Evan who used the racial slur and that
``Joshua kicked his ass.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan said he had first hit one of Josh's friends ``and (Josh)
didn't like that so he beat my ass.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of letting it end there, Evan left for a few moments and
came back with a metal pipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna kill you,'' he yelled, waving the pipe as Josh
scattered with his friends. ``He was freaking out,'' said Brock,
who witnessed the outburst. ``It was like he snapped or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan said Josh was one of several students who ``seemed to feel
that (messing) with me was one of the jobs that was meant for
them.'' Josh sometimes called him ``a punk'' and other names, he
said. When he passed Josh's locker on his way to class, students,
including Josh, sometimes pelted him with wads of toilet paper.
</P>
<P>
   His nickname, Screech, was given to him good-naturedly by Wilson
Naneng's sister, and most of his friends used it interchangeably
with his real name. ``I didn't like it,'' said Evan. ``From what I
understand, that kid is thought to be the dork of the show.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of continuing to lash out, Evan turned to teachers
and administrators for help. This was taken as one of several signs
he was maturing. After a conversation with Morris one day, Sue Hare
recalled thinking, ```You know, he's had a hard time and he's
really using good judgment.' This was just a month or so before
(the shootings) and I thought, `It's going to be all right, it's
going to come together for him. He's going to be OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   Evan's grades, though still poor, were improving. And after 12
disciplinary infractions the year before, including two suspensions
for smoking, he had received just five minor detentions. ``I would
put my arm around Evan and tell him how much better he was doing,''
said Morris. ``I guess that's why I'm alive today.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Evan felt no one was listening. ``The response I
always got from all these people was to ignore it, it will go
away,'' he said. ``I got tired of people telling me it will get
better. I think that if Sue would have put me in counseling, maybe
it would have helped, just to talk to somebody. But it seemed that
nobody really did anything about it. Nobody did anything until it
got out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   One cold February evening, the school board gathered for a
special meeting to discuss discipline at Bethel Regional. Students
had been showing up in class wearing colors, pretending to be gang
members. A Bethel police officer told the board about drug busts in
the parking lot and said he frequently smelled pot in the
bathrooms. Pat Martin, a social studies specialist with the
district, recalled: ``It was lots of little things that when you
added them all up it made you say, `We have a problem here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Edwards, the principal, had just returned from the state
basketball tournament in Anchorage. He told the board he had heard
harrowing stories about violence and a growing need for metal
detectors to reduce gunplay on school grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Exasperated, Edwards pounded his fist on the table. ``I do not
want my school to be like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours later he was dead.

EARLY DETECTION SOUGHT FOR DEPRESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE FAINARU  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rates of clinical depression among teenagers are as high as they
have ever been, and the recent spate of multiple murders in
American schools has led to nationwide efforts to detect children
at risk for violence and suicide, which also has risen dramatically
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute of Mental Health in Washington estimates
that 1.5 million children under 18 suffer from serious depression,
a treatable mood disorder. Other studies put the numbers much
higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's one of the saddest things in our society, that
we're not doing anything about this,'' said Kevin Dwyer,
president-elect for the National Association of School
Psychologists. ``If we don't address the needs of these children,
it's a short-term gain for a long-term loss. I sound like a
politician, but I'm tired of talking to reporters about death.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, there has been no systematic analysis of the eight boys
who killed 21 people and wounded 48 in seven nationally publicized
school shootings since 1996. But mental health experts familiar
with the cases said most of the attackers suffered from some form
of clinical depression or other psychological disorder. Alone, even
severe depression is unlikely to lead to violence, the experts
added. But depression can become dangerous when it serves as the
psychological foundation for other risky behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Ramsey, a 16-year-old who killed the principal and a
sophomore basketball player and wounded two other students in 1997
at Bethel Regional High School in Alaska, suffered from dysthymia,
a form of depression, ``so ingrained in the personality it becomes
a part of you,'' said John R. Smith, a pyschiatrist who examined
Evan on behalf of the Alaska Public Defender Agency.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, when Evan was almost 8, a psychologist determined that
he was beginning to develop ``a real depression'' and recommended
treatment. But Elena Franks, a social worker with the state
Division of Family and Youth Services, said the local health
corporation in Bethel did not have a child therapist available at
the time. Evan, it now appears, showed signs of severe depression
throughout adolescence. But both he and his legal guardian, Sue
Hare, said he never received treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This boy had a treatable illness,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   A guide to early warning signs for school violence, released in
August by the US Department of Education in response to the seven
school shootings, lists many of the same characteristics found in
children with symptoms of depression. Those characteristics
include: social withdrawal, excessive feelings of isolation and
rejection, and patterns of impulsive and aggressive behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   Richard W. Riley, the secretary of education, said in an
interview that some children ``don't feel like they've ever been
connected.'' The situation can become explosive, he said, when
combined with other factors, such as guns and exposure to excessive
media violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that a child turns on the television and sees several
horrendous murders, then has a loaded pistol in the drawer and then
goes to school and is mixed up, disturbed, or troubled, anyone who
thinks those things aren't connected I don't think has thought it
out,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   The high depression rates overlap with a number of risky
behavior patterns that have made adolescence more dangerous and, at
times, lethal.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 1,558 middle and high school students sponsored by
Harvard University and the Metropolitan Life Foundation, published
last week, indicated that large numbers of teenagers live in a
climate of uncontrolled anger and violence. In polling that crossed
geographic, racial, and socio-economic lines, one-third of students
agreed with the statement: ``When I am really angry, there is no
way I can control myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In the highly combustible atmosphere described in the survey, 43
percent of all boys said they had been in a physical fight in the
previous year, and 18 percent of all boys said they had been
threatened with a weapon. ``This means that these high-profile
shootings that we read about are just the tip of the iceberg'' in
terms of school violence, said Jay Winsten, a co-author of the
study.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1996-97 academic year, 6,093 students were expelled for
bringing a gun to school, according to the Department of Education.
That figure is believed to represent a small fraction of the
weapons that actually make their way into American schools.
</P>
<P>
   In an August report by the Centers for Disease Control, nearly
one-fifth of high school students reported carrying a weapon in the
previous 30 days, 8.5 percent onto school property. The figures
were just slightly lower than the CDC's last Youth Risk Behavior
survey, released in 1995. In addition, nearly one-third of all high
school students said they had been offered, sold, or given an
illegal drug on school property in the past year. One-in-four
students said they had smoked marijuana at least once in the past
month. Nearly half of all students said they had drunk alcohol at
least once in the past month. Those figures also were largely
unchanged since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Margot A. Welch, who heads the Collaborative for Integrated
School Services, a Harvard University support network for school
counselors, said the recent school shootings ``are evidence that
the pot is boiling faster than ever and that things are getting
worse. And when I talk to educators, people are almost afraid to
talk about them, because they can happen anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, depression was considered primarily an adult
disorder, and child mental-health experts say it still often goes
untreated or misdiagnosed. However, the most-convincing evidence
that it is rising among teenagers is suicide rates, which have
tripled since 1960 and are rising even faster at younger ages.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC survey offers a glimpse at how teenagers view suicide.
Nationwide, 20.5 percent of high school students said they had
seriously considered suicide in the previous year and 7.7 percent
had actually made an attempt. In 1995, according to the CDC, 2,227
children ages 10 to 19 killed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Although juvenile crime in schools, like crime nationwide, has
decreased, violent school crime is rising. In public schools, the
number of students who were victims of violent crime, including
physical attacks with weapons, robberies, and threats, rose from
3.4 percent to 4.2 percent between 1989-95, according to a joint
study published in April by the Justice Department and the
Department of Education. Last year, one in five public middle and
high schools reported at least one serious violent crime, including
murder, rape, and armed assault.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer, of the National Association of School Psychologists,
said, ``It's only a matter of time when you find out that no
community in the country is immune from this epidemic. And I call
it an epidemic: It is an epidemic of violence in the country
generally that is now manifesting itself in our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Poland, who chairs an emergency-assistance team that has
provided counseling services to most of the communities where the
school shootings occurred, said the crimes have demonstrated the
need for ``broadening the missions of the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make our schools more like an airport,'' he said.
``Does anybody b.s. about guns, violence, and weapons in an
airport?''

<P>
   BETHEL, Alaska _ Rumors, not books, drew Evan Ramsey's friends
to the Bethel Regional High library that morning last year.
</P>
<P>
   The students were gathered on a landing, uncertain exactly why
they were standing there amid the computers, books, and maps. One
girl had heard vaguely of an impending disaster that would make
people want to leave town. Others had heard that ``something really
big'' was about to happen. The rumors focused on Evan, who had
warned one boy he was plotting ``an evil day,'' and who had told
his younger brother that he was planning to shut down school for
the entire year.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Evan wanted his friends out of the line of
fire. He came to school that morning with a loaded 12-gauge shotgun
concealed in his jeans. He shot and killed a 15-year-old sophomore
and the principal, wounded two other students, then surrendered to
police on a flight of stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Evan, 16, plotted the rampage in his bedroom, with the
assistance of two 14-year-old friends. To retrace their steps
before the murders, which occurred on a cold Wednesday, Feb. 19,
1997, is to explore the chasm that often divides teenagers and
adults, obscuring impending trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signs were there,'' said Bob Herron, the school board
president. ``But for whatever reason, we didn't hear them. We were
in a comfort zone where we thought, `That can't happen here.'''
</P>
<P>
   To many adults, the seven multiple murders in American schools
since 1996 seem like screams from a distant culture. Yet in their
words and actions, the young killers sent out unsubtle signals of
their deadly intentions. Their warnings slipped through the cracks
of adolescence, where teens are afraid to ``narc'' on their
friends, teachers often lack full information about their students,
and parents are sometimes too busy to notice.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Bethel Regional High _ even inside his own home _ adults
perceived Evan differently than he perceived himself. To most
adults, he was a polite and likable boy, rapidly maturing after
years of acting up. But to himself, he was an outcast, under
constant harassment from other, more popular classmates, his pleas
for help ignored by adults who had the power to end the abuse.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Evan and his friends plotted the murders as if they
were playing a board game, while his legal guardian _ the school
superintendent _ slept across the hall. At school, in hurried phone
calls, they dropped tantalizing hints and whispered dark secrets to
their friends. Evan told one girl he planned to bring a shotgun to
school, then lied when she made him promise not to. One afternoon,
he abruptly walked out of class, causing his anxious teacher to
notify other faculty. But none of the teenagers warned an adult,
and none of the adults picked up signals that a tragedy was
brewing.
</P>
<P>
   Evan had been jolted by a series of events _ some exceedingly
small, but significant given his state of mind and the peer
pressure he was experiencing. The teenagers around him either were
egging him on, didn't believe him, or had just enough information
to gather in the school library to see what might happen next.
``It's the audience: He sent out invitations to the shooting.
That's what it amounts to,'' said Renee Erb, who later prosecuted
the case.
</P>
<P>
   The total effect, said Wilson Naneng, Evan's close friend, was
``like shaking a soda and finally opening it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Wilson, a college-bound junior, disclosed that Evan
had picked up the same shotgun once before. Two years earlier, Evan
had called him and said, ``You've got five minutes to get over here
or I'm going to shoot myself.'' Wilson took away the gun and
comforted his friend. But he never told Evan's legal guardian, Sue
Hare, who first heard about the incident when a reporter recounted
it to her recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really tell anybody about that because of how friends
are,'' said Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   (AT)5Gun ownership common in hunting culture
</P>
<P>
   (AT)7 James Randall killed his first moose when he was 13, his
first bear a year later. Like many children in this region, he was
responsible for helping his family gather food. He hunted and
fished with his father, James Sr., a former public-safety officer,
and he owned several of his own guns. ``I have maybe three .22s, a
.410 shotgun, a .30-30 (rifle), an SKS (semiautomatic rifle) and a
.306 (rifle),'' James said. ``I think that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   James and Evan are distant cousins. They had known each other
for years, but they started to hang out the summer before James
entered ninth grade and Evan entered 11th. The two boys walked the
slim wooden boardwalks that connect Bethel's subdivisions. They
went to the sandpit, rode bikes, smoked cigarettes and dope, and
hung out in James's bedroom, where a dozen speakers culled from
garage sales were hooked up to his stereo, a VCR, and a video-game
unit.
</P>
<P>
   The two boys played video games for hours, taking breaks only
when James's mother would arrive with snacks, or when his father
would burst into the room. ``He'd go, `Enough!''' said Evan. ``He'd
tell us to get off our asses and help him clean up the yard.''
</P>
<P>
   James said Evan sometimes called him up and told him he was
depressed about his home life and that he was being picked on at
school. Evan would come over and play and ``then he would go back
to normal,'' said James.
</P>
<P>
   To most adults, Evan appeared to be coming into his own that
year. ``I commented to him a few times,'' said Dit Hoffman, a
school secretary. ``I would compliment him on his good behavior and
the fact that he'd grown up a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But Evan saw his situation differently, and in many ways it was
changing dramatically. Without notice, his father, Don Ramsey, had
come back into his life after spending 10 years in prison. In 1986,
armed with several weapons, Ramsey had stormed into the offices of
the state's largest newspaper, The Anchorage Times, and had briefly
taken the publisher hostage following a dispute over how the paper
had handled a political screed for which he had bought space.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey called up his son 10 days before the shootings and told
him he had been released. ``It was just, `You know I love you,
don't you, son?''' said Ramsey. ``And he told me, `I love you, too,
dad.' He gave me no indications that anything was wrong up there in
Bethel.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan also was having problems with his love life. For months, he
had dated a girl who, like him, had spent years in foster care and
``could relate to some of the things that were happening in my
life,'' he said. ``Then, all of a sudden, she said no more,
(expletive) you, and left town. It was a pretty depressing
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, the week before the murders, Bob Morris, the dean of
students, confiscated a portable compact disc player from him in
the hallway at school. Evan said he had taken the Discman from Hare
and had been scared she would find out. ``I just thought it was a
retarded reason to take it away,'' said Evan. ``I wasn't listening
to it and I never got it back. I was supposed to get it back
sometime in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just was one of the things that was on my mind at the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   `I figured I'd scare everybody'
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday night before the murders, James and another
14-year-old, Matthew Charles, slept over at Evan's. They invited
Matthew's sister, Theresa, who James was dating at the time, and
the four climbed beneath the house to smoke marijuana from a pipe
they had fashioned from aluminum foil.
</P>
<P>
   Evan said he does not recall the exact moment he got the idea to
bring a gun to school. ``It just popped into my head,'' he said.
``It came out of the blue.''
</P>
<P>
   The original idea, he said, was to commit suicide in the school
lobby. ``I figured I'd go into the high school and scare everybody,
scare the holy crap out of them, and kill myself,'' he said. ``But
James had some strong disagreements on that. He said that my face
and name would go across the world. He said I'll become famous. He
said lots of people will know about me. He said I should live the
fame.''
</P>
<P>
   The three boys fantasized about whom they would kill, Evan said.
``They made some suggestions, `Why don't you shoot this person,
kill that person, kill that person.''' Someone brought up the name
of Ron Edwards, the principal. ``Matthew was telling me, `Shoot
him, shoot him, shoot him,''' said Evan. ``He's an
(expletive)...he's this, he's that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Evan went downstairs, pulled the shotgun off the rack and
brought it up to the bedroom. Matthew borrowed a camera belonging
to William Ramsey, Evan's younger brother, and took pictures of
Evan holding the gun.

 BETHEL, Alaska... holding the gun.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The three compiled a rough hit list that included Edwards, a
sophomore basketball player named Josh Palacios, and other students
and members of the faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a list up here,'' Evan said, pointing to his head.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe it was the confiscated Discman that
ultimately triggered the murders. Evan said the Discman incident
``was one of the things. And this girlfriend (who) said
`(expletive) you' and disappeared. And everybody constantly coming
at me and messing with me and messing with me. And I don't know who
my parents are; that was another thing that hurts. It seemed like
all my friends knew their fathers. And James and Matthew were
getting me all riled up: `Yeah, it would be (expletive) awesome.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``James told me, `You can't go back, everybody would think
you're nothing. Everybody would just have one more reason to mess
with you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Later, William said, ``I knew something was going on because
James kept saying `Wednesday is going to be the happiest day of my
life. Wednesday is going to be a cool day.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for James and Matthew said neither boy believed Evan
would actually go through with the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Hints of shooting intimated to close friend
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Evan called Carol Rodgers. She was two years older, but
they had become friends. Occasionally, the two rode snowmobiles
together on the tundra and walked the town, but mostly they hung
out, smoking cigarettes and talking. Evan frequently told her how
unhappy he was.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, she said, Evan seemed agitated and serious. ``At
first he goes, `Carol, I got to tell you something really
important, but I don't know if I should.' It took me 10 minutes on
the phone to get it out of him. I'm like, `Evan, you better tell me
now.' He goes, `Why?' And I said, `Because I'm getting scared of
what you're going to tell me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Carol, do me a favor. Don't come to school
(Wednesday) morning.' I'm like, `Why?' And he goes, `Because.' And
I said, `Why?' He kept saying, `Because.' And finally he told me.
He said, `I'm thinking about bringing a gun to school on
Wednesday.' And I'm like, `Don't do it. You're going to suffer the
consequences if you do it and I don't want to see that happen.' And
then he goes, `I don't care about consequences.'''
</P>
<P>
   Carol said she made Evan promise not to bring the gun to school.
``And before we hung up, he goes, `Carol, I promise.'
</P>
<P>
   ``See, I expected him to keep that promise. That's the only
reason why I didn't say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Evan walked out of seventh-period yearbook class. The
instructor, Reyne Athanas, had asked him what he intended to do
about his assignment, a series of photos on special needs students.
``I don't know,'' he said. When Athanas turned to help another
student, Evan grabbed his backpack and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Athanas, 47, was more informal than most teachers: She looked
younger than her age, wore jeans to class, and allowed students to
call her by her first name, pronounced ``Renee.'' On Halloween she
painted faces, including Evan's. When he walked out of class she
became concerned. ``He wouldn't respond to me that way,'' she said.
``It was just a total indifference to what I was saying. He didn't
care. In a normal everyday classroom situation we would have talked
about it. He had never left my class like that.''
</P>
<P>
   She waited a few minutes to see if he returned, then went to
find a guidance counselor. The counselor, busy with another
student, sent her to Bob Morris, the dean of students. Morris
checked the bathrooms but couldn't find Evan, so Athanas went to
the school social worker, Jacqueline Volkmann, and later told
Evan's guardian, Hare, the district superintendent, when she bumped
into her at the public library.
</P>
<P>
   Volkmann cornered Evan in the hallway before school the next
day. ``Oh, that's no big deal,'' Evan told her. Lying, he said he
had gone to the computer room to work, and that he would assure
Athanas everything was fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was I wasn't even sure who he was; I had to have
someone point him out to me,'' said Volkmann, who had arrived at
Bethel Regional that year. She said she believes the faculty
assumed she must have known him ``but the sad part is I really
didn't. The teacher had some insight but the problem was I didn't
have enough information to pick up on it.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she has been afraid to admit that she didn't know Evan.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something I haven't talked about,'' she said. ``Number
one, I didn't want to take the fall for that. Number two, I didn't
want the school to take the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan learned to fire shotgun from a friend
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the day before the murders, Evan, James, and Matthew
skipped school. They wandered around Bethel, ducking into a hideout
beneath an apartment complex to smoke cigarettes. They visited with
friends and, after school let out, returned to Evan's house, where
James showed Evan how to use the shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Evan, who unlike James had almost no experience with weapons,
pulled the gun off the rack, carried it up to his room and handed
it to James. ``He showed me how to load and unload it,'' Evan said.
``Then he gave it to me to load and unload. He showed me everything
about the shotgun except how to fire it. He told me I'd have to be
a (expletive) moron if I didn't know how to fire a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   James told him that ``after I fired the first time I wouldn't
want to stop,'' Evan said. ``He said it'll become a normal thing.''
</P>
<P>
   James said Evan, while holding the gun, began to talk about Ron
Edwards, the principal. ``I don't know if he was saying he was
going to kill him but I know he was calling him names and saying
stuff,'' he said. ``I kind of thought (Evan) was serious. I think I
shouldn't have started this whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   James went home but Matthew stayed for dinner. Hare arrived from
work, tired and ill. She already had heard from Morris that Evan
had skipped school. ``You know, I expect you to go to school,'' she
scolded him. On other occasions, Evan had lost his $10-a-week
allowance when he skipped, but this time Hare chose not to punish
him. Shortly after dinner she went to bed.
</P>
<P>
   According to James, Evan called him later that night, crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was going to kill himself,'' said James. ``Then he
told me, `It's either them or me.' I remember that like it was
right now. I was like, `Why? Why are you so mad?' I was just trying
to talk him out of it. I just told him, `Don't do nothin'.'''
</P>
<P>
   James said he never told an adult because he didn't believe Evan
would actually go through with it.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew, apparently unaware he was incriminating himself,
volunteered in a witness statement that he had offered to ``back
up'' Evan with a .22-caliber revolver he kept at home. He couldn't,
he said, because ``I'm only 14.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he borrowed a camera from Evan's younger brother
William. ``He wanted to get pictures to hang on his wall and
remember everything,'' said Evan. ``He just thought it was really
cool that I was going to kill these people. I really don't think he
was all there.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, Evan and Matthew sat in Evan's room. They played
music and drew cartoons. They drew pictures of the rabbit from Trix
breakfast cereal commercials. ``You know, `Silly rabbit, Trix are
for kids,''' Evan said. ``We changed `Trix' to `trips' and made the
rabbit look like he was on some kind of drugs, and we drew some
marijuana leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan called his friends. Several weren't home that night. Wilson
said he spoke with Evan for about an hour but never learned
specifically what his friend was planning to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Go up to the library, something really bad is gonna
happen tomorrow,''' Wilson recalled. ``I asked him, `What do you
mean something bad's going to happen?' He said he would let people
know on the bus and let them know out loud in the lobby. I said,
`Is it going to be like a fight and he said, `Yes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said Evan told him that ``somebody was going to get hurt.
He said, `I'd like to tell you more, but I just can't.' Then Sue
told him he had to go to bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, Evan sat down with a notebook and wrote two
notes.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from one, found crumpled and discarded, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have thought to myself, what kind of damage can a 12 gauge
slug do to a human's internal organs or their head? Well today I
found out, and so did everyone else that is in school .... No, I am
not on drugs...ciggerettes, that's all. I am not really depressed
just that the fact that I want people, the world, or maybe just
Bethel, to know how (expletive) and cruel the world is or can be.
This school has got to get its (expletive) together 'cause there
are too many deaths this past 2-3 years. Well I can tell you that
the Superintenant Sue Hare has been the nicest person I've ever met
cause she took both William and I in and didn't get any money for
it, and she like was a mother for William and me. But anyway I'm
dead you guys are living, you should be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The second note, folded and placed on his desk, read in part:
``Hey Every body!! I feel rejected, rejected, not so much alone,
but rejected. I feel this way because the day-to-day treatment I
get usually it's positive but the negative is like a cut, it
doesn't go away really fast. I figure by the time you guys are
reading this I'll probably have done what I told EVERYONE I was
going to do. Just hope 12 gauges don't kick too hard but I do hope
the shells hit more than 1 person because I am angry at more than 1
person. One of the Big (expletive) is Mr. Ron Edwards, he should be
there, I was told this will be his Last year, but I know it WILL BE
HIS LAST YEAR. The main reason that I did this is because I'm sick
and tired of being treated this way everyday .... By the way every
one allways told me ``Don't Judge A Book By It's Cover.'' This
saying is true because I was told that my teachers say that ``He's
Such A Good Kid.'' But they Say that About everyone. I don't think
I'm a good-Hearted person. LIFE SUCKS in its own way, so I killed a
little and killed myself. Jail isn't and wasn't for me, ever.''
</P>
<P>
   He requested that Sue read the note to friends and family. ``I
was not crazy (I think),'' he wrote.

 BETHEL, Alaska... he wrote.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By February, Bethel is covered in snow and darkness. The
temperature hovers around zero. The sun rises at 10:30 and sets
around 4. Many students arrive at school and leave in total
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, as Evan prepared for school, he found himself alone.
Hare was ill and had stayed in bed. William had taken a cab to
school early to see what might happen.
</P>
<P>
   Evan had traded his lunch money, $5, for William's baggy black
pants. He already had loaded the shotgun with shells from a box
that he said sat on a shelf below the unlocked gunrack. He spilled
some extra shells into his pocket. He took down the shotgun and
stuffed it into his pants and covered himself in a black parka that
went down to his knees. ``The reason I chose that color of clothes
was that the shotgun was black,'' he said. ``I figured I needed
that in order for me to get on the school bus without anybody
wondering what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   He walked stiff-legged out the door. Instead of waiting at the
bus stop in front of his house, he walked down the street to
``where most of my friends were at. Just to b.s. with everybody.''
The bus stop was in front of Carol Rodgers's house on Napakiak, so
he stopped to chat with her. ``I didn't notice anything,'' she
said. ``I mean, it was chilly out that day and I noticed he had a
trench coat. But I didn't notice the way he was walking.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just like, `What's up?''' Rodgers recalled. ``Then he
bummed a smoke off me, like he does every morning. It was just our
normal morning conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   With the gun in William's jeans, Evan rode the bus to school and
limped across the boardwalk. A few students later said they noticed
he was walking strangely, but no one said anything, according to
Evan.
</P>
<P>
   At school, several students had arrived early. Wilson waited
near the front door for his girlfriend, Cynthia. While he was
waiting, he said, James and Matthew came up behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``James specifically stated to me, word for word, `Don't try to
stop him, don't be a hero,''' said Wilson. ``That's when I started
thinking, `There's something wrong here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia arrived and Wilson met her. ``He (Wilson) said go to
your locker, we have to go to the library,'' she recalled. ``So he
walked me to my locker and I put my stuff away. I went up to the
library and I was like, `What's going on?''' By then, at least 10
students had gathered, most of them friends of Evan. Cynthia asked
Matthew's sister Theresa what was happening. ``She said, `Evan told
me to tell everyone to go up to the library because he's got
something really important to tell us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson thought about Evan's threat to commit suicide two years
earlier and began to panic. ``I kept asking Theresa, `What did Evan
say to you? What did he say to you?' I said, `Is Evan going to kill
himself? Is he going to kill himself?' She said, `I don't know. I
don't know. I don't know.'''
</P>
<P>
   Joking bet about death became all too real
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs, Josh Palacios was sitting where he sat every
morning: in the center of the lobby. He and his friends had come
from playing basketball in open gym. Sweaty and disheveled, they
were gathered on couches and lunch tables, the most popular boys in
school joking and talking and preening in the middle of the noisy,
crowded room.
</P>
<P>
   One of Josh's friends, a heavy-set boy named Brock Rapoza, came
running up out of breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, you're gonna die of heat stroke,'' said Josh, ribbing his
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever, punk, you're gonna die first, I'll bet you money,'''
said Brock. ``African-American males, you know what the statistics
are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, let's make a bet,'' said Josh.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, $100.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear to God,'' Brock said later. ``Everybody was laughing.
It was like everyday conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   The group looked up and saw Evan standing in front of the
secretary's station with the shotgun in his hands. ``He was kind of
crouched a little bit and he had this really odd look on his face,
like he was gleefully evil,'' said Dit Hoffman, the school
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Evan held the gun low to his hip, almost to his thigh, and
pointed it at Josh. Few students panicked at first, believing he
was carrying an ROTC rifle, which does not fire. Josh was one of
the first to realize the gun was real. ``Hey, what do you have that
gun for?''he asked Evan, who had moved about 10 feet away from him.
Evan didn't answer. Josh started to walk away slowly, then returned
to his seat, then got up again.
</P>
<P>
   As he rose, Evan shot him in the stomach. ``My head was thinking
weird things,'' said Brock. ``In sixth grade we had this mock
emergency, you know, and my mind was thinking that this was a big
emergency and we were just practicing how to exit the building.''
Evan then fired into the ceiling and yelled: ``You guys better run.
Run, (expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   Two students who had been near Josh, Shane McIntyre and Russell
Lamont, both were struck in the arm by pellets from the first shot.
Raul Sanchez, one of Josh's closest friends, crawled beneath the
lunch table. ``Paco, don't look,'' said Josh, using his nickname
for his friend as Raul glanced at the wound beneath Josh's T-shirt.
Josh asked Evan: ``Why did you shoot me?'' He asked Raul to hand
him his gold crucifix. Raul, who later received the Alaska Student
Hero of the Year award, held Josh's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Reyne Athanas emerged from the teachers' lounge and saw Evan
standing in the middle of the room, waving the shotgun. She slowly
approached him and asked him to put down the gun. ``I kept
thinking, `I've got to get him to give up the gun,' but he just
couldn't stop,'' she said. ``I don't know how to describe it. He
looked like he wasn't even there.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan said he remembers little of what happened inside the
school. ``I don't know what happened that day,'' he said. ``I don't
know what was asking me to go this way or go that way. It was like
this feeling, `Walk here, walk there.' In the high school I didn't
know who I shot or where they went to....It was like it got really
confusing. I didn't really know what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Athanas asked Evan for the gun. ``He said:
`Do...you...want...this...gun,''' she recalled. ``And I told him,
`Yeah, if you'll give it to me, I'll take it if you'll give me the
gun.' And I stepped toward him to take it and he swung it at me
like he was going to shoot and I said, `You don't want to do this
Evan.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What went through my mind was, `Would I fly backwards when it
hit me?' I don't know where that came from. Isn't that weird? And
then I thought, `What would my boys do?'''
</P>
<P>
   Gale Power, a physical education teacher, set off the fire
alarm. Kids screamed and ran everywhere; some were still arriving
at school and teachers tried to head them off. Up in the library, a
boy named Mark Patzke laughed, and seemed to be counting off the
shots: ``That's one, that's two....'' (His family moved away
shortly after the shootings.) Evan ran off down the hall.
Investigators said they believe he was looking for other students
on the mental list that he, James, and Matthew had prepared. He
fired into a metal locker and the ceiling. He walked down another
hall, went outside, crossed the boardwalk, then walked through the
front door, completing a circle that brought him back to the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   He was met by Edwards, who had emerged from his office, hoping
to somehow get the gun away from him. Evan pointed the gun at the
principal. Edwards turned and tried to make it back to his office,
but Evan shot him in the doorway from behind. The mass of pellets
struck behind Edwards's left shoulder, perforating his lung, heart,
and aorta. ``I really didn't know I hit the principal,'' said Evan.
``I could have sworn I hit that wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Athanas tried again to persuade him to give up the gun. Evan
reached in his pocket and held up another shell.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to take me alive,'' he told Athanas. ``This
one's for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept thinking, `grab the gun, grab the gun, grab the gun.'''
Athanas said. ``Then he put it up to his chin. I was like, `Don't
do that. Please don't do that. You don't have to do that Evan. Put
it down.' I knew he had absolutely no control at that point. He was
definitely not there then. He couldn't stop. It's like you get
going in something and you don't know how to get out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan said one of the main reasons he went to school that day was
to kill himself.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he didn't, he said: ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officers began to creep in through the front door. Evan
saw them and ran up a flight of stairs toward the library. He
reached the top of the stairs, but the gate had been locked by
Bruce Wegner, the school librarian. Chris Walker, a Bethel police
officer, shouted at Evan to drop the gun. Walker later said Evan
pointed the gun at him. He fired at Evan twice with his own
shotgun. The first shot, a slug, lodged in the wall behind him. The
second shot glanced off the railing of the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Expletive) this,'' Evan said. ``I don't want to die.''
</P>
<P>
   He threw down the shotgun on the stairs. It broke into two
pieces and tumbled to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Accomplice couldn't believe Evan had actually done it
</P>
<P>
   In the school cafeteria, Sue Unin, a teacher at the elementary
school, sat with one of her children. She had rushed over when she
heard what had happened, and, now that it was all over, police and
state troopers were fanning through the building, organizing
students and teachers to take statements.
</P>
<P>
   A 14-year-old boy sat down beside her. ``He was talking and
talking and talking,'' she said. ``He was talking about how he
couldn't believe it had happened, that Evan had actually done it.
He reminded me of a motor that wouldn't stop. And then he told me
that he was supposed to take pictures. I can still see him bringing
that camera out of his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just about died,'' she said. ``I couldn't believe it. After
I got myself together, I went and told someone. It was like, `Um,
this kid over here said he was going to take pictures.'''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Charles was questioned several times. He told state
troopers he had gotten so excited he forgot he had the camera, and
by the time he had charged the flash it was too late. An
investigator asked him if he had thought about warning anyone.
``No, I didn't want to warn anybody,'' Matthew said. ``I wanted to
see if he was bluffing.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It was kind of cool when he shot Mr. Edwards.''

VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES COLOR OUTLOOK FOR KIDS AT RISK, EXPERTS SAY

<P>
   ANCHORAGE _ ``This is where I think he got his strategy,'' said
Don Ramsey as he guided his mouse across the pad. The mouse
controlled a hand. The hand held a gun as it negotiated a maze of
animated carnage: blood-drenched corpses, mutants obliterated and
the ultimate killing machine, the B.F.G. 9000, which stands for Big
Fragging Gun.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey believes his son, Evan, was emulating the popular
computer game ``Doom'' when he raced through the corridors of
Bethel Regional High with a shotgun last year. Evan ducked behind
corners and blew holes in the ceiling. He killed a 15-year-old
sophomore, then killed the principal by firing into his shoulder
from a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, most children who use fantasy guns never kill in real
life. The $5.1 billion video-game business, which has grown larger
than the film industry, sold 115 million units last year _ more
than one for each US household. Most titles are nonviolent and many
are educational.
</P>
<P>
   But like Don Ramsey, many researchers fear that the most violent
games are giving some children a dangerously skewed perspective.
Most troubling, they said, are ``first-person'' or
``point-and-shoot'' games, estimated to represent 5 percent of the
market, where the primary aim is to kill _ randomly, constantly,
often for hours on machines not unlike simulators used by the
military and law-enforcement agencies to train their people to
shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about a hundred rounds a year, which is what
you need to get soldier- or police-qualified,'' says Lieutenant
Colonel David Grossman, a former West Point professor of behavioral
sciences and author of a 1995 book on how people learn to kill.
``We're talking about tens of thousands of rounds, every single
time, and there are never any repercussions. It's nothing but kill,
kill, kill, kill, kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman retired recently as a professor of military science at
Arkansas State University in Jonesboro where, coincidentally, two
11- and 13-year-old video enthusiasts killed four classmates and a
teacher last year. The perpetrators of other recent school
shootings in West Paducah, Ky., and Springfield, Ore., also
reportedly played the ultraviolent games.
</P>
<P>
   In Alaska, Evan Ramsey and an alleged 14-year-old accomplice,
James Randall, spent evenings playing games like ``Doom,'' the
``Die Hard'' trilogy, and ``Resident Evil'' in James's room,
according to both boys and their parents. The two turned off the
lights and played for hours on a Sony PlayStation hooked up to ``12
or 13 speakers,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like action and shooting,'' he said. ``You start out with
something cheap, like a handgun. You'll keep shooting and the
higher you get you find weapons on the way and then you use them. I
had my `surroundsound' hooked up and it'd be dark and it'd just be
the screen and we'd have fun. We had everything: We had chips, Dr
Pepper, and we'd just sit there. We'd start around 11 and we'd play
until 3 or 4. If we really got into it, we'd play until maybe 6 or
7 in the morning, until he had to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan, who had almost no experience with real guns, now says the
games mistakenly taught him ``you can get shot a whole bunch of
times before you die.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like with `Doom,' you have a `health factor,''' said Evan.
``You start at a hundred health. When you get shot it drops to
something like 15. You get shot with different types of weapons and
your energy gets taken off. Now I know it's not like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said Evan, ``I think I played video games too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software
Association, said blaming video games for mass murder amounts to
``very simplistic scapegoating.'' Jeanne B. Funk, an associate
professor of psychology at the University of Toledo, who has
studied the effects of video games on children, acknowledged that,
despite her own uneasiness about their possible impact, research so
far is inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want parents to think that because kids take up
violent video games they end up shooting their classmates,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Lowenstein, ``that's not to say I would be willing to
bring all these games into my home. I wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The real danger, most experts believe, is the potential
influence on children like Evan who are more predisposed to
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this stuff is a huge, huge problem, except when
you get to the extremes of the culture,'' said Eugene F. Provenzo
Jr., an education professor at the University of Miami who has
written a book about children and Nintendo. ``This is really bad
stuff to give to our most-troubled kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In the niche world of ultraviolent gaming, gore is a marketing
tool. The game ``Re-Loaded,'' for example, is advertised as ``the
most deranged, psychologically brutal, senselessly violent,
over-the-top, insane bloodbath ever created.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said the ``point-and-shoot'' games produce the same
effect as strategies long used by the military to break down a
soldier's aversion to killing. After World War II, the military
found that just 15 to 20 percent of all soldiers fired their
weapons in battle. Using repetition training with man-shaped
targets, the military was able ``to make killing a reflex action,''
Grossman said.
</P>
<P>
   More alarming, said Grossman, there is evidence the games have
made some children better marksmen. He said he witnessed this
phenomenon while commanding an ROTC battalion of 500 cadets at
Arkansas State. ``What we're seeing is more and more kids who have
never handled a gun in their lives, whose parents hate guns and
never allowed a gun in the house, the kid comes in and puts a gun
in his hand and starts to fire expert,'' he said. ``Why? They all
know: `It was all the video games that I played.'''
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Johnston Beach, professor of psychology at West Point,
said he is unaware of studies showing that video games have led to
better marksmanship. ``It would be kind of scary if it's true,'' he
said. But he agreed with Grossman that violent video games provide
the same kind of repetition training without the discipline
enforced by the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think kids have adapted themselves to a much higher level of
stimulation,'' he said. ``They have to do more to get excited,
which just makes it more likely that people will go out and do
stupid things.''
</P>
<P>
   James, Evan's alleged accomplice, disagreed that the games give
children an unrealistic view of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so, but that's from my view,'' he said. ``I
mean, I'm a kid.''

<P>
   BETHEL, Alaska _ Overcome with guilt, Wilson Naneng for months
he should have prevented his friend Evan Ramsey from bringing the
shotgun to school.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of at least 10 students who had gathered in the
Bethel Regional High library that morning, following Evan's
suggestion that ``something really big'' was about to occur. He
then stood by in horror as Evan killed 15-year-old Josh Palacios
and principal Ron Edwards, wounded two other students, then
surrendered under fire from police in the school lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Wilson, a promising junior, began to find ways to
injure himself. He bit his hands raw, drew knives across his arms.
Finally, during the state academic decathlon meet in Anchorage, he
strung up his belt in a hotel room and attempted to commit suicide
before friends and supervisors intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt betrayed by Evan and I felt some guilt that I should
have stopped it,'' said Wilson, now an 18-year-old freshman at the
University of Alaska at Fairbanks. ``I felt as if I had been shot
myself. When I talked about Evan, it was like he was dead. I felt
like I had lost a brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson hardly recognized Evan that morning _ Feb. 19, 1997 _
``all raged, full of his hate that he had.'' His soul-searching was
shared by others in Bethel, and, in many ways, throughout the
state, as people sought to understand how such a crime could have
been committed in the sanctuary of a public school, by a boy whose
life was so embedded in his community.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that two 14-year-old friends had helped Evan plot the
murders, and that other students had failed to act on the dark
hints that emerged beforehand, made the crimes all the more tragic
and perplexing. The case provoked fundamental changes in the way
the school district addressed its most-troubled students, changed
the way Alaska looked at juvenile crime, and foreshadowed a
national debate about school violence as the shootings,
grotesquely, seemed to repeat themselves across the country in six
other nationally publicized episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we no longer have that innocence where school is the
safest place in the community,'' Alaska Governor Tony Knowles, who
spoke at Ron Edwards's memorial service, said in an interview. ``We
have lost that.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan, who was 16 when he committed the murders, is now 18. Tried
as an adult, convicted in February of two counts of first-degree
murder, and awaiting sentencing Dec. 1, he alternated between
convincing remorse and callous indifference during a series of
interviews inside the Cook Inlet Pre-Trial Facility in Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at one point if he wished he had committed suicide in the
school, as he said he'd intended, Evan said: ``I do, but I don't. I
do because I wouldn't have to deal with this: with the chains, with
having to worry about getting (stabbed) or having somebody sodomize
me. But then, this also gives me an opportunity to get a message
out: that what I did ain't right. All these teenagers in the Lower
48, for whatever reasons they pulled their killings, I don't think
that it is really right.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his early child abuse and the harassment he endured
at school, he said: ``What I did was (expletive) up. I mean, I
killed two people. But then, there's also some (expletive) up
things that happened to me. I tried to go get help and nobody would
help, so I felt I had to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was less apologetic when asked about the effect of the
crimes on friends and relatives of the victims: ``I think I've
(expletive) these people's lives up _ temporarily. And if they're
not (expletive) morons they'll get on with their life. What
happened was really screwed up, but that don't mean that they
should just stop living and stop doing what they were doing
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he &UR;  &LR; was angry at Edwards, Evan, sitting in shackles
and his red prison jumpsuit, said: ``I don't remember. I think it
was one of those little things. I thought he was a (expletive) but
not the kind of (expletive) that you'd really want to hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the losses of Edwards and Palacios are still felt
deeply in Bethel. A veteran educator, Edwards, 50, was so
passionate about Bethel Regional High and its students that, had he
lived, ``I think this would have devastated him,'' said Les
Daenzer, a district administrator who became interim principal
after the shootings. ``I think he would have quit.'' Friends find
it hard to believe that Edwards, a former marine and National
Guardsman who had served in Vietnam, was killed in his own school.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to describe Ron in one word it would be `solid,'''
said Daenzer. A champion bodybuilder from Kalispell, Mont., Edwards
had risen through the ranks of the Lower Kuskokwim School District.
Before Bethel, he was principal in Kongiganak, a Yup'ik Eskimo
village of about 200 people. Conditions were so basic that Edwards
and his staff took showers at school. But within a few years he had
created one of the best-run programs in the district.
</P>
<P>
   At Bethel Regional, Edwards seemed to be everywhere at once:
running the lunch line, sitting in on classes, pushing papers,
picking up spare change, attending every sporting event and fawning
over his wife, Cindy, who was studying for her teaching certificate
and often substituted at the school. One of his unfulfilled dreams
was to see Ron Jr., the youngest son among his four children, play
baseball. His daughter, Meagan, was valedictorian the year after
his death.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards loved to hunt moose and pan for gold. He intermittently
worried about his weight: When friends cleared out his desk, they
found rice cakes and tuna in one compartment, mounds of candy in
another. At home, he would curl up in his favorite chair, announce
``the captain is in the command module,'' and watch Monday Night
Football. He was perhaps the biggest booster of the Bethel High
sports program, of which basketball, as in most schools in
hoops-crazed Alaska, is king.
</P>
<P>
   To many, Josh Palacios was the future of that program. A
sophomore, he already had made the eight-man varsity traveling
squad. He was 5 feet 4 inches tall and growing, dribbled well with
both hands, and was solidly built: He loved to flip up his T-shirt
to reveal his ``six-pack'' stomach to anyone willing to look or
touch. Half black, half Mexican-American, he was an exotic presence
in Bethel and girls found him attractive. His mother Claudia, a
women's health-care provider, put condoms in his Easter baskets. A
gifted artist, Josh once replicated a Van Gogh painting, which, he
wrote, ``symbolized a man sittin' and chillin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Claudia had moved her two sons, Josh and Corey, from Dallas to
Bethel after her marriage broke up in 1988. She wanted to be closer
to her mother, Linda, a nurse who had moved to escape inner-city
violence. Linda reached her breaking point one day when she pulled
a gun on a man who was tailing her on a Dallas freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the climate change, Josh's love of sports only deepened
in Bethel. He set up Nerf hoops all over the house to amuse himself
when it was too cold to play outside. ``In Bethel we had a rule
that the boys couldn't play outside if the wind-chill was minus-10
or below,'' said Linda. ``They'd be at home by themselves and
they'd call me up at work: `Grandma, it's only minus-9!' Josh would
get snow in his boots and his socks would freeze to the soles of
his feet. We had to put him in the bathtub with warm water to get
his feet out of his boots. And he had this short, nappy hair and
the snow would melt on his head and then it would freeze. It made
an ice cap on his head and he'd come in and you'd have to crack it
off his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated at an Anchorage restaurant, a few blocks from Josh's
grave, Linda and her daughter Claudia laughed, then cried. Josh had
so many friends that they all pitched in one year to send him to
basketball camp when it looked like he might not be able to afford
it. ``I can't tell you how many kids he brought over to our
house,'' said Claudia. ``It was never stray dogs, it was always
stray people.'' Josh, whose favorite NBA player was David Robinson
of the San Antonio Spurs, was buried in his Bethel Warriors
uniform. Claudia only wishes he had brought home Evan Ramsey one
day.
</P>
<P>
   Climate of harassment given intense scrutiny
</P>
<P>
   After the shootings, there was an outpouring of grief for both
Josh and Edwards. But those seeking change at Bethel Regional also
focused on the climate of harassment in which the murders took
place. Once the grief settled, the school board held a series of
emergency meetings. Task forces were assembled on everything from
cultural awareness to alcoholism to family values.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, meetings of the ``School Issues'' committee
were the most heavily attended. The committee looked at harassment,
violence, security, dropout rates, substance abuse, truancy, and
other issues. It made several recommendations, some of which were
implemented immediately. Bethel Regional added an unarmed security
guard who patrols the halls with a radio. The school repainted the
walls a brighter color, and stationed teachers in the hallways as
extra eyes and ears during class changes.

 BETHEL, Alaska... during class changes.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new principal, Ron Magee, a former member of an elite Marine
unit and a black-belt in karate, championed a ``zero tolerance''
discipline policy. The school set up discipline guidelines for
offenses ranging from cutting classes and truancy to weapons and
drug possession, robbery and extortion. Students caught bringing a
gun or knife to school would be expelled immediately. Possession of
drugs or alcohol would result in a 5-day-suspension and counseling
for the first offense, a 15-day suspension for the second offense,
a 45-day suspension for the third offense. Students caught selling
drugs or alcohol would receive a 45-day suspension for the first
offense, then face expulsion for a second infraction.
</P>
<P>
   The school district set aside $125,000 for an alternative
boarding school to ``provide a new start for students who have left
school, or are not experiencing success.'' The school was designed
for ``at-risk'' students, many of whom had problems with substance
abuse and violence.
</P>
<P>
   The school, which accepted about 30 students this year, provides
both classroom instruction and three hours daily vocational
training at a paying job in Bethel. Before enrolling, students
submit to rigorous interviews in which they are asked about past
drug and alcohol use. The school also forces students to take drug
tests and makes them sign a waiver stipulating that the school
maintains a zero-tolerance policy on drugs, alcohol, and violence,
and that ``if I violate this policy I will be sent home.''
</P>
<P>
   The district has yet to implement a violence-prevention
curriculum that was promised after the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most serious concern of many teachers and parents is
that the issues that led to the shootings extend far beyond the
walls of Bethel high, that the problems are so big as to be
insurmountable. ``It's a mess, but it's all a mess,'' said
Jacqueline Volkmann, who served as the school's social worker the
year of the shootings and now works as a social services
coordinator for the local health corporation. ``To say otherwise
would be to remain in denial.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyne Athanas, a former art teacher who tried desperately to
persuade Evan to put down his weapon, said the incident has left
her emotionally torn. ``How can you care for someone, who you think
you know, and then they do a horrendous thing like this, and you're
appalled by the act but you don't know how to feel?'' she said,
crying quietly at the school one afternoon. ``Do you hate him? Do
you despise him? Do you feel sorry for him, what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got tons of different battling emotions,'' she said.
``I mean, I really liked Evan. I really liked Josh. And I'm angry
at Evan for doing this to me and everybody else that has had to go
through it. I mean, how could he do this? It's too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Palacios said she was torn sitting in court listening to
testimony about Evan's troubled life before he shot her son. ``I'm
sitting there, listening to all this, and as a mother I felt so bad
for him,'' she said. ``Part of me wanted to get up and hold him in
my arms and just tell him it'll be all right. And he killed my
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   But others see strict punishment as the key. ``As a friend of
the family, I wish we had the death penalty,'' said Nancy Brown, an
education specialist with the district who worked with Edwards in
Kongiganak and led the search for a violence-prevention curriculum
after the murders. ``I guess this is the anthropologist in me
talking but, you know, cull the herd.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere are the issues more confused than in the
criminal-justice system as it tries to mete out fair punishments to
adolescents who may or may not understand their crimes. Evan, who
had turned 16 less than four months before the murders, fell under
a recent Alaska law that says any juvenile 16 or over can be tried
automatically as an adult for certain felonies, including murder.
His attorney, the assistant public defender, launched a ``suicide
by cop'' defense. He argued that Evan had hoped to draw police to
the school to shoot him, but he never intended to kill anyone. That
defense was weakened by the judge's decision to limit testimony
related to Evan's horrific upbringing and by the fact that he had
shot two people at nearly point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   But the fates of his two alleged 14-year-old accomplices is less
clear. Both were initially charged with first-degree murder _ but
as juveniles. Matthew Charles, who brought a camera to school to
take pictures of the shootings, pleaded guilty to a lesser charge
of criminally negligent homicide. His attorney, Sidney Billingslea,
said he remains in ``24-hour custody of a network of parents,
treatment providers, and education people who monitor the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the systems are old and they don't work anymore,''
said Claudia Palacios. ``(Matthew) sits down with his family at the
dinner table every night, and in my family there's an empty chair.
He'll celebrate holidays and birthdays with his family, and in my
family there will always be something missing. It just doesn't make
any sense to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew, in tears, apologized to Claudia Palacios last week
during the trial for James Randall, who admitted to showing Evan
how to use the gun the day before the murders. After testifying
against James for more than 40 hours, Matthew, who was receiving
treatment for ``pervasive depression,'' according to Billingslea,
ingested large quantities of cold medicine and Tylenol in an
unsuccessful effort to kill himself. He remains hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   James was first tried _ also as a juvenile _ on charges of
conspiracy to commit murder and accomplice liability. He was
acquitted of conspiracy, but after the jury became hung on the
second charge the state, armed with new evidence, chose to try him
again for first- and second-degree murder. A verdict is expected
any day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Central to James's defense is his adolescence: that he neither
believed Evan nor understood the seriousness of what they were
doing. Evan himself said of James: ``I think if he was thinking he
wouldn't have shown me'' how to use the gun. ``I think if he was
thinking straight he would have realized, `Hey, people are going to
die and get really hurt. He don't know how to load it or unload it,
so if I don't show him how to use it properly nothing will
happen.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchel Schapira, James's lawyer, said Bethel's hunting culture
should be taken into consideration. ``My kid showed Evan how to
fire a gun,'' he said. ``Up there, that's like when you're 14 years
old and somebody shows you how to start a car.'' He said it is
inconceivable James truly believed Evan would use the gun to kill.
He said the legal standard to which James is held is that of ``a
reasonable person in the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But what is the situation? I say his situation is
adolescence,'' said Schapira. ``His situation is being a
14-year-old, and hearing how 14-year-olds talk, this plethora of
issues that adolescents go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Randall's father, James Sr., a former Village Public Safety
Officer, said: ``I think J.R. might have been involved in the way
that 14-year-olds think: just blowing smoke. Like me, when I was
young, I might talk about a teacher and I might say I'd like to
kick their ass, and maybe even shoot them, but to the point of
believing it and actually doing it, no. I don't even think Evan
believed it until he walked in with that shotgun.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he's found guilty of murder, James, who turns 16 on
Sunday, cannot be held past his 19th birthday. Evan is facing over
300 years in state prison. If he spends 70 years of his life
incarcerated, Alaska will spend an estimated $2.1 millon for his
care. ``Evan's as good as dead,'' said Sue Hare, his legal guardian
at the time of the murders. ``I've told other people: Evan killed
two people and he killed himself at the same time. That's what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Renee Erb, who prosecuted Evan, said: ``I'll tell you the
scariest (stuff): Evan is not that different than a lot of kids;
he's not much worse than a lot of kids. Maybe that is the scary
thing: that they're not different. They're not different enough so
that anyone could pick them out. Not different enough for teachers
who spend seven hours a day with kids to pick them out. They're not
necessarily detectable. And that is what should scare the pants off
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Healing interrupted by similar shootings
</P>
<P>
   In Bethel, the difficult days of recovery after the murders have
been interrupted by terrifying images from other rural American
towns that experienced similar school shootings. ``It was like this
nightmare going on and on,' said Cynthia, a 16-year-old junior who
asked that her last name not be used. ``It just seemed so odd that
what happened in Bethel, Alaska, was going on all over the country.
And it got me mad when people would say it's just a southern
problem. Because I know it wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   On the one-year anniversary of the shootings, the school held a
``Celebration of Life'' in the gym. Brock Rapoza, one of Josh
Palacios's best friends, sang ``I'll Be Missing You,'' the tribute
that Sean ``Puffy'' Combs dedicated to his best friend, Christopher
``The Notorious B.I.G. /Biggie Smalls'' Wallace, after the rapper
was shot dead in Los Angeles last year. The school compiled a book
of student poems and writings about the shootings. In one poem,
titled ``Unexpected,'' a student wrote:
</P>
<P>
   The shock is that the one that murdered these
</P>
<P>
   Is the one we trusted, laughed with just as well as the ones
that died.
</P>
<P>
   Just an ordinary person like us,
</P>
<P>
   He talked, laughed, cried, just as we did.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Yummy, not Evan,'' said John Ramsey when asked for his
reaction to the shootings. Evan's 20-year-old older brother is
serving 3 1/2 years at the Central Arizona Detention Center for
holding up an Anchorage porn shop five days before Evan committed
murder. John Ramsey was referring to his younger brother William,
who bears the family nickname ``Yummy'' because as a toddler Evan
would call out, ``William, William, Yum, Yum, Yum.''
</P>
<P>
   William, 14, the only one of the Ramsey boys not in prison,
currently lives in Anchorage, in a two-bedroom apartment with his
father. Don Ramsey, 53, served 10 years in prison for bursting into
The Anchorage Times with an arsenal of weapons in 1986, briefly
taking the publisher hostage. He took custody of William last year
from Sue Hare, who had been William's as well as Evan's guardian in
Bethel.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Don Ramsey spent seven years in a wheelchair. He
underwent open-heart surgery in July. He plans to have William
schooled at home, but so far the program has not begun.
</P>
<P>
   William spends much of his time in his room, using the
PlayStation he purchased recently. ``I like playing Golden Eye,''
he said, referring to a computer game. ``It shows it like real
life. They got real pistols, and you can aim at the head and go
pop.... They got shotguns and you could shoot 'em and blood will
come out.''
</P>
<P>
   To William, what happened to his brother is ``like a violent
movie, a killing movie. That's how I see. I can't see it as real.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson Naneng, who once considered killing himself over his
friend Evan Ramsey, is feeling better now. He said a talk with his
uncle made him realize that everyone's life is difficult at times.
``You must try to understand each aspect of the accident,'' he
wrote in a poem called ``Life's a Rugged Road.'' By the end of the
summer he was ready to move on to college.
</P>
<P>
   At Bethel Regional High, the days go on. Still, many teachers
wonder whether they'll ever look at their students the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Elliott, a special education teacher, had been near the
principal's office the day of the shootings and saw Ron Edwards as
he was shot. She stayed with him, trying to reassure him on the
floor of his office as he whispered to her, ``Nancy, I'm going to
die.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, on the first day of school, Elliott was forced to
admonish one of her students over his refusal to complete an
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The student responded with a warning, which earned him a
three-day suspension: ``I'm gonna to do to you what Evan did to Mr.
Edwards.''

QUILT ARTIST WILL RECEIVE COVETED 1998 SILVER STAR AWARD, THE
QUILTING WORLD'S ANSWER TO THE OSCAR

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Quilts.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cozy word that calls to mind a gaggle of grannies sitting
in a circle, sipping tea and sharing gossip as their fingers fly
across pastel-tinted squares of cloth.
</P>
<P>
   Quilts.
</P>
<P>
   Soft, warm things you snuggle under on a cold winter's night,
the fabric equivalent of a mother's hug or a warm glass of milk.
</P>
<P>
   With her brash ``oeuvre,'' Yvonne Porcella explodes these
notions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't call myself a quilter,'' she says earnestly, her blue
eyes magnified behind bifocals. ``I make quilts as art. I make
wearables as art. But it took a long time for me to verbalize
that.''
</P>
<P>
   A long time because Porcella went the conventional route. Wife.
Mother. Operating-room nurse. Never went to art school, never
earned a fancy art degree.
</P>
<P>
   What she did instead was fall hopelessly in love with color.
With image and design, hue and pattern. With the beauty of the
natural world, and the way it can be grasped and transformed
through cloth.
</P>
<P>
   Porcella, 62, is a pioneer in the Art Quilt movement, a
burgeoning subgenre that takes the homespun craft of quilting and
elevates it to the level of fine art. In Houston to attend the
International Quilt Festival, which begins Thursday and runs
through Sunday at the George R. Brown Convention Center, Porcella
will receive the group's coveted 1998 Silver Star Award, the
quilting world's answer to the Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   Her quilts are dazzling, alive things. Meant to hang on a wall,
not lie across a bed, they burst with movement and unorthodox color
combinations. Her art quilts, like her wearable art and artful
kimonos, have hung in museums around the world; in the Smithsonian
Institution's traveling exhibit, they shared space with works by
Auguste Rodin and Pablo Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   Her work has been exhibited in far-flung locales, from Kyoto,
Japan, to Lodz, Poland. She's traveled the world to teach and
lecture. She founded Studio Art Quilt Associates, a group that
promotes quilting as a legitimate art form. The latest of her eight
books, ``Art &AMP; Inspiration,'' traces her evolution from a simple
weaver to a maker of elaborate quilts.
</P>
<P>
   In the quilt world, Porcella is regarded with something akin to
reverence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her quilts are just breathtaking _ so bold, so dramatic, so
unlike anything that anyone else does,'' says Karey Bresenhan,
founder and director of the International Quilt Festival. ``They're
totally recognizable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Art Quilt movement began about 20 years ago as part of a
larger effort, in tandem with the women's movement, to gain new
artistic respect for traditional ``women's crafts.'' Porcella, who
divides her time between Modesto, Calif., and Arnold, a small town
in the Sierra Nevada mountains, is viewed by many as ``the mother
of art quilts,'' says Bresenhan.
</P>
<P>
   Pausing in a convention center meeting room days before the
festival to discuss her quilts, Porcella looks like an artist, with
wavy, bohemian hair and a silver belt studded with turquoise and
lapis. She wears a handmade black jacket trimmed with bold checks
and a hand-painted tangerine silk shirt. Even her speech is
tactile: She uses her hands and fingers (also studded in turquoise)
in describing fabric and the magic it can weave.
</P>
<P>
   So how is an art quilt different from a quilt quilt?
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is in the terminology,'' Porcella says. ``All
quilts are art, but art quilts were never intended for the bed.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, art quilts bring ``the discipline of fine art'' to
an otherwise homey craft. ``It's about looking at quilts as a
painting or mixed media,'' she explains. `` `Collage' is a good
term. We attempt to use fabric as collage.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, people from outside the traditional quilting
world _ people with formal art training _ have increasingly been
drawn to the medium. This influx has further ``broadened the
boundaries'' of art quilting, Porcella says.
</P>
<P>
   Her own entree into the textile world was accidental. A young
mother of four married to a physician, she was teaching herself to
weave and paint in her cramped laundry room. One day, one of her
kids knocked over an oil painting. It was ruined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two mediums just didn't work together, so that was it. I
switched to fabric,'' she says. ``That was my first love anyway _
the joy of it, the feel of it.'' She rubs her fingers together.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Porcella (who has never made a traditional
quilt) progressed from making her own fabric to weaving, to
collecting and weaving from ethnic textiles, to making wearable art
and kimonos. In 1979, she attended a quilting convention and left
inspired. What if I made art flat? she asked herself. Her first
quilt, titled ``Takoage,'' was full of unorthodox strips and
triangles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought to myself, `People are going to think some lunatic
put this together,' '' she says, smiling. `` `This is like no quilt
ever seen.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The piece now resides in the Smithsonian's Renwick Gallery at
the Museum of American Art in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Her art quilts have evolved as well, moving from primarily
color-based creations to quilts based on themes drawn from her
travels, memories or events. Some make political statements, such
as her work based on the Persian Gulf War, full of hearts
representing her grandchildren. (``Which heart do we send off to
war?'' she asks.)
</P>
<P>
   Her quilts bear recurrent motifs _ black-and-white squares,
polka dots, calla lilies, wild geometrics, striding figures. An
inveterate Polaroid picture-taker, Porcella also relies on ``visual
data,'' whether it's corrugated siding on an old building or a
field of flowers. She works from hand-drawn sketches, projecting
them onto a wall, then tracing them onto cloth. She cuts fabric to
fit, then sews the pieces in place by hand and machine.
</P>
<P>
   Porcella was thrilled when an issue of Time magazine devoted to
American art opened with an image of an Amish quilt. Recognition is
coming, but slowly, she says. The problem is that quilting is
traditionally regarded as ``soft art'' _ that is, the craft of
kaffeeklatsches.
</P>
<P>
   As an antidote, Porcella, through her Studio Art Quilt
Associates, urges peers to regard their quilts as art so that
others will, too. Art quilts are art, she says. They do what art
does: evoke an emotional or spiritual response from the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feed the soul,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Her hope is that a major museum will soon mount an art-quilt
exhibit. It's ``the next logical step, when you look at the breadth
of what's being done,'' she says. Other art quilters are pushing
the envelope even more _ painting their quilts, studding them with
``found objects,'' sewing X-Acto knives into the fabric as a
tactile joke.
</P>
<P>
   This boundary-stretching has produced its conflicts, she says.
Traditional quilters were slow to embrace the work of their more
revolutionary sisters. Porcella recalls a major quilt show in 1986
when a bus load of conventional quilters confronted a wall of art
quilts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a slap across the face to them,'' Porcella says.
``They were saying things like, `How can this be here? She didn't
even trim her threads!' or, `She must be on LSD!' It wasn't
acceptable to their sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a new unity has emerged, she says, with quilters of
all stripes giving one another equal respect.
</P>
<P>
   And Porcella has evolved once again. She unfurls two samples of
her latest work, a stunning series of heads resembling African
masks. (They go for $950 each; her other art quilts can sell for
thousands of dollars and are available exclusively through the
Connell Gallery in Atlanta. Her quilts are part of an exhibit and
will not be for sale at the festival.) The new series reflects
Porcella's urge to capture more ``spontaneity'' in her art, which
by its nature is time-consuming and labor-intensive.
</P>
<P>
   And, for her, painful. For years she's struggled with carpal
tunnel syndrome, even undergoing surgery for it. But she just can't
stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is in me, driving me to do it,'' she says, sounding
very much like an artist. &QL;

ROBERT EARL KEEN FAVORS THE OLD OVER NEW 
 
RICK MITCHELL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Three songs into his concert Saturday night at the
Aerial Theater, Robert Earl Keen introduced a new song called
``Feelin' Good Again.'' With its delicate finger-picked guitar and
a warm and fuzzy lyrical perspective, the song represents a mellow
change of pace from the rock-edged direction of his last album,
``Picnic.''
</P>
<P>
   Keen's new album, ``Walking Distance,'' is due in stores
Tuesday. The album is his second for the Arista Austin label, after
several releases for the independent Sugar Hill label.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 15 years ago, it was all I could do to get out of bed
and order a pizza,'' Keen told the not-quite sold-out house
Saturday night. ``It's a big step, from ordering a pizza to putting
out an album.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone could accuse him of excessively hyping the new
release. Unless I missed something, the set list included only one
other new tune; ``That Buckin' Song,'' a rodeo ditty that gets
maximum mileage out of its clever rhyme scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Keen's Texas cult-hero status has come at a certain price. Like
Willie Nelson, he balances two separate careers as a touring act
and a recording artist.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Nelson, however, Keen still considers himself first and
foremost a songwriter. And ``Walking Distance'' contains some of
the most personal and poignant compositions of his recording
career.
</P>
<P>
   The problem Keen must contend with is introducing his more
thoughtful and laid-back material to boisterous frat-guys eager to
bellow along on ``Swervin' In My Lane'' and raise a toast to
``Corpus Christi Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That Buckin' Song'' is destined to become an in-concert
favorite. But Keen didn't take many chances with his set-list. Even
more up-tempo new songs such as ``Travelin' Light'' and ``New Life
In Old Mexico'' were bypassed in favor of proven crowd-pleasers
such as ``Five Pound Bass'' and ``It's the Little Things.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the set did include a number of serious songs. The
melancholy opening tune, ``I Wonder Where My Baby Is Tonight,''
evokes an atmosphere of barely restrained desperation. ``Gringo
Honeymoon'' is a modern border town masterpiece, as well as an
unusually subtle love song.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to setting a mood, Keen has few peers among the
current generation of Texas songwriters. His approach has spawned a
growing legion of collegiate emulators, none of whom has come close
to equaling his knack for inventive melodies and non-cliched
lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Keen's road band is perhaps the tightest of its kind in the
state. It includes Keen's childhood friend Bryan Duckworth on
fiddle, Rich Brotherton on lead guitar, Bill Whitbeck on bass and
the newest member, Tom Van Shaik, on drums.
</P>
<P>
   Brotherton, who also plays with Toni Price, is one of Austin's
most underrated guitarists. He's capable of shifting gears from
acoustic bluegrass flat-picking to electric power chords on
``Levelland'' and the searing solo that climaxes ``Dreadful Selfish
Crime.''
</P>
<P>
   If the band sounded less inspired than it did at May's Texas
Uprising concert at the Woodlands Pavilion north of Houston, the
overly loud and improperly balanced sound mix might have had
something to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it was me, waiting impatiently to hear more new
material. After watching Keen duet with Steve Earle on ``Tom Ames'
Prayer'' and Joe Ely on ``Whenever Kindness Fails'' at the Texas
Uprising concert, the versions here inevitably sounded slightly
anti-climactic by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   And while ``The Road Goes On Forever'' will go down as one of
the anthems of our era _ an epic country-rock ``corrido'' in which
the party never ends _ you can only sing along on the chorus so
many times before the party becomes not quite as much fun anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Keen is a Houston native who now lives in Bandera, Texas. His
encore choices _ ``I'm Comin' Home,'' ``The Coming Home of the Son
and Brother'' and ``Merry Christmas from the Family'' _ emphasized
his Houston ties.
</P>
<P>
   The new album features a sequel to the last song called ``Happy
Holidays, Y'all.'' This might have been a good place to introduce
it. Oh, well. Maybe next Christmas, after the frat-guys have had a
chance to learn the words. &QL;

NOVEMBER TV PROGRAMMING HAS PLENTY TO OFFER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MIKE McDANIEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing to watch on TV? Phooey to that.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not finding stuff to like, you need to look harder.
It's out there aplenty, from ``Ally,'' ``Buffy'' and ``Biography''
to ``Frasier,'' ``Friends'' and ``Frontline.''
</P>
<P>
   And yes, there are several new series to like, too, from ``Will
&AMP; Grace'' to ``Sports Night,'' ``Charmed'' to ``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you need some extra incentive to turn on and tune in,
television offers it in November, one of the months set aside for
``sweeps.'' (Local stations use sweep ratings to set future ad
rates.) And this year, while there's no history-making event like
``Roots,'' there's a miniseries with a ``Roots'' connection. There
may not be an Olivier or Hepburn in a ``Love Among the Ruins,'' but
there's a determined performance from Christopher Reeve and a
bravura one from Leon, the actor with no last name.

PUMPKIN USED IN EVERYTHING FROM APPETIZERS TO ENTREES TO DESSERT

 &QL;
<P>
   Pumpkin wears many disguises for the Halloween table. It can
appear in everything from appetizers and entrees to dessert.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a stellar year for this fall favorite because of the
superhot weather during the growing season, according to one
produce wholesaler. There is an ample supply of jack-o'-lantern
pumpkins, but the quality of cooking pumpkins is off a bit, says
Jerry St. Laurent of Chef's Produce in Houston. Nevertheless, this
is the peak season to enjoy fresh pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   Interest has been growing the past few years in white pumpkins,
but you'll see them around, although they're not in great supply.
They also can be used for cooking. A mixture of mini pumpkins and
white pumpkins with a scarecrow figure makes an eye-catching
Halloween centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   A tureen of pumpkin soup or stew makes an elegant entree for a
holiday dinner party or a nourishing meal for trick-or-treaters.
For extra drama, serve the soup from a real pumpkin shell. Pick one
of these versions, add a salad and some hearty bread.
</P>
<P>
   Different types of pumpkins are needed for carving or painting
jack-o'-lanterns and cooking.
</P>
<P>
   For carving, choose large pumpkins. Pick those that are bigger
than 12 inches and from 20 to 40 pounds. Choose the smaller, bright
orange, round, ribbed, sugar or pie pumpkins for cooking. They
weigh 6 to 8 pounds, are 8 to 10 inches in diameter and have a
thick rind.
</P>
<P>
   Pumpkin is highly perishable and must be cooked the day it is
cut open. Chill cooked pumpkin immediately. Freeze the pulp if you
don't plan to use it within 36 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Pumpkin, a close cousin to squash, may be cooked like squash. It
also has a similar nutrition profile. Pumpkin is an excellent
source of vitamin A (1,320 international units in { cup cooked,
mashed pumpkin; enough for one day's needs); it's high in dietary
fiber (1 gram per { cup); high in carbohydrates (6 grams per {
cup); and negligible in fat (less than 0.1 gram per { cup). Fresh,
cooked, mashed pumpkin provides 24 calories per { cup; canned has
about 40 calories.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to use a pumpkin shell as a serving utensil, use a
cleaned-out raw pumpkin. Pumpkins darken considerably if baked long
enough that the meat softens enough to be scraped out, and
sometimes the shell collapses. Use a medium-to-large pumpkin and
watch carefully. Check at the minimum time listed in the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Following are basic cooking directions and some of the Houston
Chronicle's best pumpkin recipes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Cooking methods: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oven-cooking bag: Cut the pumpkin in halves, quarters or large
chunks. Scrape out the seeds and strings. Place pumpkin pieces, cut
side down, in a 16-by-10-inch or 14-by-10-inch oven-cooking bag.
</P>
<P>
   Close the bag with a twist tie and make 6 ({-inch) slits in the
top near the twist tie. Bake at 350 degrees 45 to 60 minutes, or
until the pumpkin collapses. When cool enough to handle, carefully
remove the peel from the pumpkin meat, and puree the meat in a
blender or food processor.
</P>
<P>
   Range top: Halve the pumpkin. Scoop out the seeds and fibers.
Cut the pumpkin into large pieces, then peel each piece with a
vegetable peeler. Cut pieces into {-inch cubes. Place cubes in a
large, heavy saucepan and cover with about 1 inch cold water.
</P>
<P>
   Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer covered until tender, 10
to 15 minutes (larger pieces may take 20 to 25 minutes). Stir
occasionally to prevent scorching. Drain and mash, or process in
food processor with a little cooking liquid to moisten. If desired,
add a little margarine and seasonings (salt, black pepper, dried
thyme, etc.) and heat until margarine melts.
</P>
<P>
   Oven baking: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Halve pumpkin. Remove
the seeds and fibers. Cut into 2-inch pieces and peel. Put peeled
pieces in a shallow baking dish, and brush with melted margarine.
Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake, uncovered, 45 minutes, or
until tender, brushing several times with margarine. Serve as a
vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   Microwave: Weigh pumpkin to determine the correct timing (do
this at the store if you don't have a scale). Allow 7 minutes per
pound. For a medium-size pumpkin, cut it in half vertically, then
scoop out the seeds and fibers.
</P>
<P>
   Place one half, cut side down, in a 12-by-8-inch microwavable
baking dish. Microwave on high, uncovered, 18 to 22 minutes, or
until tender, rotating dish once or twice during cooking time.
Repeat procedure for the other half.
</P>
<P>
   Cool until easy to handle. Scoop out pulp and place in a blender
or food processor. Puree at medium speed until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Like prune puree and applesauce, pumpkin puree can serve as a
fat substitute in breads, muffins and cakes, according to Sandra
Woodruff, author of ``Secrets of Fat-Free Baking'' (Avery
Publishing, $12.95). Woodruff says to increase the amount of
pumpkin as you eliminate fat.
</P>
<P>
   For half the butter, margarine or other solid shortening in
cookies, substitute three-fourths as much pumpkin (i.e., if a
recipe calls for 1 cup butter, use { cup butter and 4 to 6
tablespoons mashed pumpkin). Bake reduced-fat and fat-free cookies
at 275 to 300 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Note: If puree is watery, simmer over low heat in a heavy-bottom
pan instead of draining off liquid; draining removes much of the
flavor. &QL;

   Indian Pumpkin Soup Almondine
</P>
<P>
   from Houston Chronicle files &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To serve this soup family-style from a hollowed-out pumpkin,
select a uniformly shaped pumpkin with a level bottom, or cut a
thin slice from the bottom to make it level. Slice the top off the
pumpkin to make a lid. Scrape out seeds and stringy fibers, then
scoop out the meat, being careful not to puncture the sides of the
pumpkin. (The meat can be used for the soup or another use.)
</P>
<P>
   Before serving the soup, warm the pumpkin shell in a preheated
180-degree oven about 15 minutes, or microwave on high 5 to 8
minutes, depending on the size of the pumpkin. Pour hot soup into
warmed pumpkin shell and ladle into bowls at the table. Use hot
pads while handling heated pumpkin. Do not overheat or pumpkin will
collapse.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Day of the Dead (``Dia de los Muertos'') is one of the most
time-honored customs in Mexico, a festive occasion that celebrates
life, instead of a somber ritual. Mexicans believe the dead yearn
for the things they loved when living and return to share in the
festivities. Photos of the deceased and images of patron saints are
displayed on home altars (``ofrendas'') along with offerings of
favorite foods.
</P>
<P>
   It is customary to construct an altar. ``Ofrendas'' are adorned
with flowers (especially marigolds), herbs, palm leaves and other
greenery, candles, sugar-paste figurines, skulls sculpted in sugar
(``calaveras''), photographs, mementos and Dead Man's Bread (``Pan
de los Muertos'').
</P>
<P>
   Mexican culinary expert and writer Patricia Quintana describes
``Dia de los Muertos'' as a combination of pre-Hispanic Indian
beliefs and the Catholic traditions of medieval Spain. When reborn
into the Mexican culture, the All Souls Day of Spanish-Indian
Mexico became Mexico's Day of the Dead, Quintana says. Instead of
praying for those in Purgatory on All Souls Day, Mexicans
celebrated with those who have gone before, feasted with them and
welcomed them home for a visit.
</P>
<P>
   By tradition, on Oct. 31, festivities begin with parents
welcoming back ``los angelitos,'' the souls of departed children.
The next day the sweets and toys on the children's altars are
replaced by adult treats. On Nov. 2, families gather to ``raise the
dead,'' and food that has decorated the altars is consumed. Typical
of ``Dia de los Muertos'' menus are several kinds of mole, shrimp,
rice, pumpkin in syrup, tamales and fruits.
</P>
<P>
   Lucia Bettler of Lucia's Garden in Houston and a cooking
teacher, Jano Mott, constructed altars this year during cooking
classes for the public and the Houston Culinary Guild, an
organization of women food professionals.
</P>
<P>
   The menu included seasonal foods such as glazed sweet potatoes
with cinnamon and cloves, autumn salad and green pumpkin seeds,
which accompanied cinnamon-roasted chicken and flan.
</P>
<P>
   The Day of the Dead custom has not flourished in modern times
because the food takes so long to prepare and is so laborious, Mott
said. Candied sweet potatoes with cinnamon and cloves, for example,
had to bake in the oven 2 hours, basting every 20 minutes. The
sauce boiled for 2 { hours.
</P>
<P>
   At the Culinary Guild meeting, Dolly Bille added to the altar a
picture of her late mother, a handful of garbanzo beans, which her
mother liked, and an ice cream scoop to symbolize how much her late
father loved ice cream. Mott contributed photos of her former
husband, who died recently, and a photo of a beloved woman who
reared her and gave her an appreciation of home-grown foods.
</P>
<P>
   Heide Vukovic brought a Polish postage stamp (Poland was her
father's home), a photograph of her father-in-law from Yugoslavia
and a doily crocheted by her husband's grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Bettler displayed a picture of her grandfather and his rosary,
which is made of beans, and brought an artichoke, one of his
favorite foods.
</P>
<P>
   Other favorites added included cookies and chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   For more information and recipes for Day of the Dead, these make
good reading: ``Frida's Feasts'' (Clarkson Potter, $35) about
artist Frida Kahlo, who was married to Mexican muralist Diego
Rivera; ``Rosa Mexicano: A Culinary Autobiography with 60 Recipes''
by Josefina Howard (Viking, $29.95); and ``Mexico's Feasts of
Life'' by Patricia Quintana (Council Oak Books, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Howard tells about the celebration of ``Dia de los
Muertos'' in Xochimilco and the use of amaranth, a seed or grain
with similar nutritional value to sesame. The Spaniards prevented
the Indians from growing it because of its links to a pagan custom.
Pre-Columbian people traditionally made gods out of amaranth and
honey on the days when they remembered their dead. Afterward they
ate slices of amaranth.
</P>
<P>
   Amaranth seems to have been lost for many years; only the people
of Xochimilco still had it, Howard wrote. But after the Day of the
Dead was ``Christianized,'' it was again used.
</P>
<P>
   Amaranth is now considered ``the best food of vegetable origin
for human consumption'' by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences
and the World Food Organization, Howard writes. Amaranth seeds
heated on a comal, or in a frying pan, puff up like popcorn, she
said. &QL;

   Meriemil's Flan
</P>
<P>
   No ``Dia de los Muertos'' altar is complete without a freshly
made flan. This is one of our all-time favorites from a former
Houston Chronicle staffer, Meriemil Rodriguez. She uses an
ovenproof double boiler, but it can be made in a flan pan or other
type of container that will fit in a water bath.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients: &QL; 
Sugar &QL; 
2 tablespoons water &QL; 
1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk &QL; 
6 eggs &QL; 
{ teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
 &QL; 
Few drops lemon juice or { teaspoon lemon extract (optional) &QL; 
Grated lemon peel &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For caramel, combine { cup sugar and water in the top of an
ovenproof double boiler. Place top double boiler pan directly on
burner over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until sugar
becomes golden. Do not overcook. Set aside in pan.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Combine milk and 1{ cups sugar; mix
well. Add eggs, one at a time, stirring with an egg beater or
rotary beater until just mixed with milk. Add vanilla, lemon juice
and peel to taste. Pour mixture over caramel. Place double boiler
over simmering water in oven or set pan in a larger pan of hot
water. Bake until flan tests done, about 1 hour or when knife
inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove pan from water bath
and oven and let cool at least 20 minutes. Gently run knife around
edge; turn flan out onto a serving dish.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>

POP UP FUN FOR GHOULS AND GOBLINS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Which snack do you most often prepare in your microwave? If you
said popcorn, you're on the same wave length as other Americans who
pop their favorite snack in the microwave.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Popcorn Institute, Americans eat more popcorn
than any other nationality. Figures indicate that per-capita
consumption of popcorn in the United States is now 84 quarts
annually, up 11 quarts from just three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   We've been popping corn in the microwave almost three decades.
Before packaged microwave popcorn exploded in the marketplace, we
used popcorn poppers designed specifically for the microwave. Some
people even put popcorn into paper sacks _ which is a big no-no
since these can catch on fire during microwaving.
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury introduced microwave popcorn (frozen) about 20 years
ago. Now all microwave popcorn is shelf-stable.
</P>
<P>
   What pops up for selection on supermarket shelves is
mind-boggling. Some of the options are: Movie Theatre Butter, Zesty
Butter, Extreme Butter 2000 for the New Millennium, Butter Lover's,
Blast O Butter, Butter, Butter Light, Gourmet Quality, Natural,
Natural Light, Homestyle and Caramel.
</P>
<P>
   In reading the labels, we found it difficult to make a true
comparison regarding nutrient data. Some brands consider a serving
3 { cups, while others consider 4, 5 or 6 cups to be 1 serving. The
best way to compare calories, fat and sodium is to check the
figures for 1 cup popped corn (which is provided on some, but not
all, labels).
</P>
<P>
   Microwave popcorn is designed to pop 99 percent of the kernels.
Follow manufacturer's directions for popping and carefully open the
bag of popped corn to avoid getting burned from the steam. Don't
try to put the unpopped ones back in the microwave to pop, since
the bag could overheat and catch on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Now, pop into the kitchen, grab a bag of microwave popcorn and
conjure up a treat for your family to enjoy. &QL;

NEW COGNACS DON'T MEASURE UP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL LONSFORD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cognac is the mother of all brandies.
</P>
<P>
   There are several things you should know about cognac. It's the
brandy made specifically from the Cognac region of France. It can
age gracefully for decades.
</P>
<P>
   And it's gotten hideously expensive.
</P>
<P>
   What's expensive? Cognacs that used to sell in the $15 range are
now routinely in the $40-$60 range. And those in the three-digit
category are almost commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   The Cognac region is a pie with six irregular pieces. Each piece
is distinct, and their quality, in descending order, is: Grande
Champagne, Petite Champagne, Borderies, Fins Bois, Bons Bois and
Bois Ordinaires.
</P>
<P>
   (Trivia: But some cognacs say ``Fine Champagne'' on the label.
What does that mean?)
</P>
<P>
   You seldom hear about the last two districts, but the first four
are of particular interest and are the ones used regularly for
blending.
</P>
<P>
   And blending has been the key to quality cognacs for several
hundred years.
</P>
<P>
   But there's an undercurrent in Cognac these days to offer
bottlings from single districts of Cognac.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it's all that new. Several firms for years have offered
cognacs from Grande or Petite Champagne. After all, those are the
two finest-quality areas. But more recently firms such as Louis
Royer and Gabriel &AMP; Andreu have offered brandies from other areas
of Cognac, as well, the idea being that each offers special
qualities that hopefully will appeal to those who appreciate the
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Hennessey, probably the largest cognac producer, which
is taking the process a step farther. It is now offering three
single-distillery cognacs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hennessey has 27 distilleries,'' said Hennessey's Arnaud
Monnier. ``We own some; the rest we have under exclusive contract.
This enables our three distilleries to make their separate
products. These cognacs are still blends of different vineyards and
vintages, but from a single distillery.''
</P>
<P>
   Monnier said each of the three new cognacs ``possesses a strong
personality and taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are the three new single-distillery Hennessey cognacs:
</P>
<P>
   Le Peu: The distillery is in, and most of the cognac comes from,
the Grande Champagne heart of Cognac. It's a blend of cognacs from
five to 25 years old, with the younger brandies added for
liveliness and acidity, and the older cognacs for smoothness to
round out the blend. Le Peu (it means ``top of the hill'') _ 3
stars _ is light and refined, with a floral quality. Because it is
so light, I would drink it before a meal, not after.
</P>
<P>
   Izambard is the name of a venerable cognac-making family. Of the
three single-distillery brandies, this has the darkest color.
Izambard _2 { stars _ is heavier, too, with more noticeable oak,
along with what Monnier called ``forest notes.'' Both Izambard and
the following Camp Romain come from Fins Bois, said Monnier. To me,
Izambard is the most distinctive, yet one in search of a
personality.
</P>
<P>
   The Camp Romain distillery dates back almost 100 years, and sits
on the site of an ancient Roman camp; hence the name. Camp Romain _
3 { stars _ is one of the few Cognac distilleries run by a woman,
Betty Lesueur. This is the most complex of the three, and has a
butterscotch nuance, Monnier says. This is the one I'd drink after
dinner, in the cognac tradition.
</P>
<P>
   So what about this single-distillery business. Will it be a
short-lived fad, or is the trend of the future? I mean, Scotch
whisky distillers for years have offered both single-distillery
scotches as well as blends. And while the single malts have enjoyed
an increasing popularity in recent years, sales of the blended
whiskies haven't been so hot. Could this happen to cognac? If these
single-distillery items catch on, will cognac drinkers eschew the
traditional blends?
</P>
<P>
   Monnier said no, that because the production of the
single-distillery brandies was so small, they pose no threat to the
blends.
</P>
<P>
   I think he's right, but for a different reason.
</P>
<P>
   On my way home that day, I bought a bottle of Hennessey's
V.S.O.P. cognac, the traditional blend of which Hennessey makes
probably hundreds of thousands of cases a year.
</P>
<P>
   I did a little taste test at home that night and found that
while each of the three single-distillery cognacs had something to
offer, the Hennessey V.S.O.P. offered me more in the most important
department: pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as delicate as the Le Peu, it wasn't as complex as the
Camp Romain, but it just offered my comfort to my battered soul.
</P>
<P>
   And while it wasn't cheap _ about $40 _ it was less expensive
than the the new cognacs, each of which is about $48 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Hennessey may be onto something with their new products, but for
me, I'll stick with the old tried-and-true.
</P>
<P>
   Hennessey cognacs are handled here by Glazer's.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the right track: Domaine Carneros, owned by the Champagne
firm of Taittinger and which makes some of California's better
sparkling wines, last year released a table wine, the 1995 Pinot
Noir. I didn't like it; called it clumsy, overripe and too tannic.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the 1996 Domaine Carneros Pinot Noir _ 3 { stars _
which is much better. The fruit isn't as raisiny (that's good), the
wine shows better balance (that's good), but it's still a bit
tannic (that's not so good). A little bottle age could soften those
mouth-drying tannins, though.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a pleasant wine, and went pretty well with a
marinated pork tenderloin sprinkled with fresh rosemary.
</P>
<P>
   From Republic Beverage. Suggested retail: $22.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're a fan of single-malt scotch, there's an upcoming
``Scotch Whisky Distillery Tour'' March 20-28 that will originate
in Houston. On the itinerary are trips to various distilleries such
as Macallan, Edradour, Dalwhinnie, Glenlivet, Glenfiddich and
Glenmorangie, plus available side trips to Loch Ness or shopping
expeditions in Inverness and Edinburgh, not to mention at least one
stay in a genuine castle (Dalhousie).
</P>
<P>
   Cost is $2,950 per person (double occupancy), and is being
arranged through All Seasons Travel. Call Betty Feehan at
713-627-9900 or 800-666-5555 for reservations or information.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Trivia answer: ``Fine Champagne'' means that the cognac blend
must contain at least 50 percent Grande Champagne cognac, with the
rest Petite Champagne cognac.

California may become a state controlled by Democrats. It is a
thought that spooks Republicans such as Jerry Hogan, a salesman
from Sacramento who attended a recent GOP rally here.
</P>
<P>
   ``That scares me. That really scares me. It's just too much
control,'' Hogan, 34, said at Sunday's steak-and-oyster barbecue in
Elk Grove, an event that attracted Republican gubernatorial
candidate Dan Lungren and Gov. Pete Wilson, who is barred by law
from seeking a third term.
</P>
<P>
   Although the race is far from over, the Democratic lieutenant
governor, Gray Davis, is favored by voters in poll after poll over
Lungren, and there is unlikely to be a shift toward GOP candidates
elsewhere, including the Democratic-controlled Assembly and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the governor's office and the 120-member
Legislature were run by Democrats, Jerry Brown was governor and
Davis was his chief of staff. That does not escape Lungren, and
he's using it as a tactic on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long do you think it would take a Democratic governor with
a Democratic Legislature to turn back the clock to Jerry Brown
days?'' Lungren asked the Elk Grove crowd, which then groaned.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long do you think it would take to have them repopulate
our courts with judges like Rose Bird, who couldn't understand that
there was a difference between a criminal and a victim? ... I'll
tell you, it wouldn't take much time at all to do that, and we
cannot afford that,'' Lungren said. ``How long would it take for
them to raise taxes?''
</P>
<P>
   Although Lungren did not mention it, another important factor is
terrifying Republicans: After the 2000 census, California officials
must redraw the boundaries of every legislative district in the
state. With Democrats in control, party leaders and the governor
could reconfigure district boundaries in their favor, giving
Democrats a substantial advantage for at least a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hold a 43-37 majority in the Assembly, and there are
23 Democrats, 16 Republicans and one independent in the Senate.
Although the Assembly was controlled by Republicans in 1995,
Democrats are considered to have a solid hold on the Senate. About
nine Assembly seats are tightly competitive this year, but
Democratic strategists say Davis' campaign is helping them.
</P>
<P>
   Only three Democrats have served as governor of California this
century, and two of them were father and son _ Pat Brown and Jerry
Brown. Culbert Olson served one term starting in 1938. But since
Jerry Brown left office in 1982, Republicans George Deukmejian and
Wilson have done battle with a Legislature mostly controlled by
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans admit they would like to run the
government, they say the issue is ``balance.'' Wilson and
Deukmejian used their powers to counteract the Legislature. Such a
divided government, the conventional wisdom goes, creates a more
reasonable approach to lawmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Republican leader Bill Leonard said he was in the
minority party when Jerry Brown was governor, and ``it was awful.''
Leonard, like Lungren, is worried that the compromises Democrats
made with Wilson in the past eight years could be overturned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be very worried that our welfare reforms would be watered
down and even repealed,'' Leonard said, ``that our movement toward
school accountability would stop, that our building of prisons and
getting tough on violent crime would stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard admitted that being in the minority might energize
Republicans, just as it did when Jerry Brown was governor. Being in
the minority might also allow the GOP to play havoc with the
state-budget process, because passing the spending plan takes a
two-thirds majority of both houses. That means Democrats would have
to compromise with Republicans no matter who is governor.
</P>
<P>
   But Lungren's argument that Davis will take California back to
the Jerry Brown days assumes that Davis is the same as Brown. A
popular GOP bumper sticker reads: ``Gray. Just another shade of
Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   But the two men differ in many ways, not the least of which is
temperament. Brown, ready to take over in January as Oakland's
newly elected mayor, has dropped out of the Democratic Party. Davis
supports the death penalty and other tough-on-crime laws that Brown
does not.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has vowed moderation if he is elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly going to live within the resources that the
economy provides,'' Davis said, ``and I'm going to lead this state
down a moderate path into the next century.''

<P>
   BETHEL, Alaska _ Overcome with guilt, Wilson Naneng for months
believed he should have prevented his friend Evan Ramsey from
bringing the shotgun to school.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of at least 10 students who had gathered in the
Bethel Regional High library that morning, following Evan's
suggestion that ``something really big'' was about to occur. He
then stood by in horror as Evan killed 15-year-old Josh Palacios
and principal Ron Edwards, wounded two other students, then
surrendered under fire from police in the school lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Wilson, a promising junior, began to find ways to
injure himself. He bit his hands raw, drew knives across his arms.
Finally, during the state academic decathlon meet in Anchorage, he
strung up his belt in a hotel room and attempted to commit suicide
before friends and supervisors intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt betrayed by Evan and I felt some guilt that I should
have stopped it,'' said Wilson, now an 18-year-old freshman at the
University of Alaska at Fairbanks. ``I felt as if I had been shot
myself. When I talked about Evan, it was like he was dead. I felt
like I had lost a brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson hardly recognized Evan that morning _ Feb. 19, 1997 _
``all raged, full of his hate that he had.'' His soul-searching was
shared by others in Bethel, and, in many ways, throughout the
state, as people sought to understand how such a crime could have
been committed in the sanctuary of a public school, by a boy whose
life was so embedded in his community.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that two 14-year-old friends had helped Evan plot the
murders, and that other students had failed to act on the dark
hints that emerged beforehand, made the crimes all the more tragic
and perplexing. The case provoked fundamental changes in the way
the school district addressed its most-troubled students, changed
the way Alaska looked at juvenile crime, and foreshadowed a
national debate about school violence as the shootings,
grotesquely, seemed to repeat themselves across the country in six
other nationally publicized episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we no longer have that innocence where school is the
safest place in the community,'' Alaska Governor Tony Knowles, who
spoke at Ron Edwards's memorial service, said in an interview. ``We
have lost that.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan, who was 16 when he committed the murders, is now 18. Tried
as an adult, convicted in February of two counts of first-degree
murder, and awaiting sentencing Dec. 1, he alternated between
convincing remorse and callous indifference during a series of
interviews inside the Cook Inlet Pre-Trial Facility in Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at one point if he wished he had committed suicide in the
school, as he said he'd intended, Evan said: ``I do, but I don't. I
do because I wouldn't have to deal with this: with the chains, with
having to worry about getting (stabbed) or having somebody sodomize
me. But then, this also gives me an opportunity to get a message
out: that what I did ain't right. All these teenagers in the Lower
48, for whatever reasons they pulled their killings, I don't think
that it is really right.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his early child abuse and the harassment he endured
at school, he said: ``What I did was (expletive) up. I mean, I
killed two people. But then, there's also some (expletive) up
things that happened to me. I tried to go get help and nobody would
help, so I felt I had to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was less apologetic when asked about the effect of the
crimes on friends and relatives of the victims: ``I think I've
(expletive) these people's lives up _ temporarily. And if they're
not (expletive) morons they'll get on with their life. What
happened was really screwed up, but that don't mean that they
should just stop living and stop doing what they were doing
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he &UR;  &LR; was angry at Edwards, Evan, sitting in shackles
and his red prison jumpsuit, said: ``I don't remember. I think it
was one of those little things. I thought he was a (expletive) but
not the kind of (expletive) that you'd really want to hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the losses of Edwards and Palacios are still felt
deeply in Bethel. A veteran educator, Edwards, 50, was so
passionate about Bethel Regional High and its students that, had he
lived, ``I think this would have devastated him,'' said Les
Daenzer, a district administrator who became interim principal
after the shootings. ``I think he would have quit.'' Friends find
it hard to believe that Edwards, a former marine and National
Guardsman who had served in Vietnam, was killed in his own school.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to describe Ron in one word it would be `solid,'''
said Daenzer. A champion bodybuilder from Kalispell, Mont., Edwards
had risen through the ranks of the Lower Kuskokwim School District.
Before Bethel, he was principal in Kongiganak, a Yup'ik Eskimo
village of about 200 people. Conditions were so basic that Edwards
and his staff took showers at school. But within a few years he had
created one of the best-run programs in the district.
</P>
<P>
   At Bethel Regional, Edwards seemed to be everywhere at once:
running the lunch line, sitting in on classes, pushing papers,
picking up spare change, attending every sporting event and fawning
over his wife, Cindy, who was studying for her teaching certificate
and often substituted at the school. One of his unfulfilled dreams
was to see Ron Jr., the youngest son among his four children, play
baseball. His daughter, Meagan, was valedictorian the year after
his death.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards loved to hunt moose and pan for gold. He intermittently
worried about his weight: When friends cleared out his desk, they
found rice cakes and tuna in one compartment, mounds of candy in
another. At home, he would curl up in his favorite chair, announce
``the captain is in the command module,'' and watch Monday Night
Football. He was perhaps the biggest booster of the Bethel High
sports program, of which basketball, as in most schools in
hoops-crazed Alaska, is king.
</P>
<P>
   To many, Josh Palacios was the future of that program. A
sophomore, he already had made the eight-man varsity traveling
squad. He was 5 feet 4 inches tall and growing, dribbled well with
both hands, and was solidly built: He loved to flip up his T-shirt
to reveal his ``six-pack'' stomach to anyone willing to look or
touch. Half black, half Mexican-American, he was an exotic presence
in Bethel and girls found him attractive. His mother Claudia, a
women's health-care provider, put condoms in his Easter baskets. A
gifted artist, Josh once replicated a Van Gogh painting, which, he
wrote, ``symbolized a man sittin' and chillin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Claudia had moved her two sons, Josh and Corey, from Dallas to
Bethel after her marriage broke up in 1988. She wanted to be closer
to her mother, Linda, a nurse who had moved to escape inner-city
violence. Linda reached her breaking point one day when she pulled
a gun on a man who was tailing her on a Dallas freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the climate change, Josh's love of sports only deepened
in Bethel. He set up Nerf hoops all over the house to amuse himself
when it was too cold to play outside. ``In Bethel we had a rule
that the boys couldn't play outside if the wind-chill was minus-10
or below,'' said Linda. ``They'd be at home by themselves and
they'd call me up at work: `Grandma, it's only minus-9!' Josh would
get snow in his boots and his socks would freeze to the soles of
his feet. We had to put him in the bathtub with warm water to get
his feet out of his boots. And he had this short, nappy hair and
the snow would melt on his head and then it would freeze. It made
an ice cap on his head and he'd come in and you'd have to crack it
off his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated at an Anchorage restaurant, a few blocks from Josh's
grave, Linda and her daughter Claudia laughed, then cried. Josh had
so many friends that they all pitched in one year to send him to
basketball camp when it looked like he might not be able to afford
it. ``I can't tell you how many kids he brought over to our
house,'' said Claudia. ``It was never stray dogs, it was always
stray people.'' Josh, whose favorite NBA player was David Robinson
of the San Antonio Spurs, was buried in his Bethel Warriors
uniform. Claudia only wishes he had brought home Evan Ramsey one
day.
</P>
<P>
   Climate of harassment given intense scrutiny
</P>
<P>
   After the shootings, there was an outpouring of grief for both
Josh and Edwards. But those seeking change at Bethel Regional also
focused on the climate of harassment in which the murders took
place. Once the grief settled, the school board held a series of
emergency meetings. Task forces were assembled on everything from
cultural awareness to alcoholism to family values.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, meetings of the ``School Issues'' committee
were the most heavily attended. The committee looked at harassment,
violence, security, dropout rates, substance abuse, truancy, and
other issues. It made several recommendations, some of which were
implemented immediately. Bethel Regional added an unarmed security
guard who patrols the halls with a radio. The school repainted the
walls a brighter color, and stationed teachers in the hallways as
extra eyes and ears during class changes.

DREAMS OF SLAVIC SILICON VALLY FADE

<P>
   TROITSK, Russia _ It was supposed to become the Slavic Silicon
Valley, a mecca of high technology trade that would ignite a boom
in Russia's post-Communist economy.
</P>
<P>
   The merger of Soviet science and Russian business is under way
in Troitsk, a Cold War-era scientific research center 20 miles
south of Moscow, but today's reality is nothing like yesterday's
dream.
</P>
<P>
   In a dark, cluttered basement of a moribund research institute,
Emmanuel, the human face of Russian science in Russia's market
economy, ekes out his living as a one-man cottage industry. He
keeps a step ahead of tax authorities, protection rackets, and
anyone else who would stand in the way of his meager profits.
</P>
<P>
   Emmanuel barely makes enough to feed his family, but he keeps
the exact amount a secret _ as well as the names of his clients and
his own last name.
</P>
<P>
   A theoretical physicist by training, still nominally employed by
the institute, Emmanuel designs, assembles, markets, and sells
high-tech devices that utilize the latest advances in spectrum
analysis, such as a system used in diagnosing cancer that he
recently sold to a local hospital for $120.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few sales like that and I eat,'' Emmanuel said. ``I have no
plans to broaden my business, because these are not the right times
for that.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to look at businessmen like Emmanuel is that they are
the survivors who have been able to adapt to the free market. On
the other hand, as businesses go, Emmanuel's firm is more of a
postapocalyptic hunter-gatherer, scraping by in the rubble of
Soviet science, than a thriving engine of change in the new Russian
economy.
</P>
<P>
   It is a far cry from what Troitsk thought the free market would
bring.
</P>
<P>
   Racquetball, swimming pools, Western-style airports. Hotels and
jogging tracks, houses with carports.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that was the plan in 1990, when the Kremlin announced
a joint venture with California-based construction and engineering
giant Bechtel Inc., to turn this formerly closed city of 35,000
into ``Russian Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not worked out that way. Instead of racquetball and Route
128, Troitsk turned down the road to poverty after the Cold War
ended and the state funding for science dried up. Its vaunted
research institutes, where the Soviet Union's best physicists once
designed laser rays that could knock American spy satellites from
orbit, have fallen into disrepair since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; if,,.2l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   As with dozens of formerly closed ``academic cities'' throughout
Russia, whose top-secret research institutes once attracted the
country's best and brightest, Troitsk is struggling to pay its
bills and keep the specialists who have not bolted for jobs in the
West or left science for more profitable trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Silicon Valley? I forgot about that long ago,'' said Vadim
Brazhkin, deputy director of the Institute of High Pressure Physics
in Troitsk. ``My biggest problem is that they turned off our
phones, they turned off our heat, and where to find money to pay
salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Troitsk's hard times today provide a striking contrast with the
belief shared by many in the early 1990s that all the Soviet Union
need do to prosper was to stop making advanced military hardware
and put that know-how into high technology civilian goods.
</P>
<P>
   But Soviet research centers turned out to be much harder to
adapt to the market than anyone thought. One of the problems faced
by places like Troitsk is that they were set up to fuel Russia's
arms race with the West. An estimated 80 to 90 percent of the work
done by Russian science was for military purposes by institutes
that have no tradition of marketing their discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soviet technology did not serve higher living standards,''
said Brazhkin. ``The Soviets set an assignment of building a bomb,
or a space shuttle, and two laboratories with thousands of
employees would develop a single bolt. The Soviet government could
pull in the belts, force the whole country to come up with a
result.''
</P>
<P>
   This system produced some amazing results. In a rundown,
gargantuan building beyond a courtyard strewn with rusting spare
parts and scrap metal, Brazhkin showed his guests a five-story hunk
of steel, pistons, and grease called The Bolshoi Press, the world's
largest pressure chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The Bolshoi Press is a truly astonishing behemoth capable of
mustering 50,000 tons of pressure to crush most any material known
to man. The Bolshoi Press is also a virtually useless contraption.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the institute's jobs _ developing and testing
superlight, superhard materials, simulating earthquakes to test
their effects on buildings _ can be handled by the smaller,
10,000-ton pressure chamber across the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the biggest pressure chamber in the world, but no one
knows why,'' Brazhkin lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the institute build The Bolshoi Press? It had plenty of
free time, specialists, and funding on its hands. Now, Brazhkin and
his colleagues can only joke about the commercial potential of the
most pressure money can buy: Custom ritual services for New Russian
businessmen who want to be posthumously compacted into diamonds; A
new Terminator movie in which Arnold crushes the bad guy robot in
The Bolshoi Press.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good joke, but Brazhkin is not laughing too hard. He
does not know where he is going to get the money to pay this year's
heating bill.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is in the same boat in Russian science. German
Zagainov, who heads an association of 50 research centers across
Russia, can name dozens of examples of institutes that have put
their brain power toward developing quality civilian goods. His
favorite is an institute that took the technology it used to make
rocket fuel and invented a pencil-like spot remover ``that works
better than anything I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, you cannot find it in stores, partly because
Russian scientists generally lack the experience to develop and
market civilian technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists are not businessmen,'' Zagainov said. ``They need
managers, they need advertising and people who know how to attract
capital. In high technology fields you can't just go to a market
and sell your goods. It is not a supermarket.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny he should mention that. Ask anyone in Troitsk for the name
of a scientist who has been successful in business, he will
probably mention Nikolai Yefremov, a physicist who left his old job
at the Institute of Spectroscopy and founded a chain of food
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Retail, and import, and export of raw materials _ these have
been the money-making spheres in the new Russia, at least until
this summer's economic collapse ended their little boom.
</P>
<P>
   Various government ministers have addressed the problem of
conversion over the past six years, but little has been done to
promote it, scientists in Troitsk say.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Tumanov, deputy director of the Institute of Spectroscopy,
says his institute has a number of marketable ideas. The institute
makes spectrometers, which provide a rapid and accurate analysis of
the composition of bodies by examining the light waves that emanate
from them when illuminated by a laser. Tumanov says the
applications are endless: Criminology, archeology, medical
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to develop this technology, we'd need investment,
investors, laws governing this kind of thing, and, in the end, a
government program aimed at defining the purpose of having state
research centers,'' Tumanov said. ``For six years, we've had none
of that, and now, with the latest crisis, it's clear it will be a
long time before we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Two floors below in the basement, Emmanuel considered his own
future. Business, never good, took a big dive in Russia's latest
economic crisis, and Emmanuel is wondering if his one-man company
can survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, it was a crazy idea that a scientific city
would drive an economic revival,'' Emmanuel said. ``Instead, the
science city will die. Firms like mine will live on its ruins for a
little while, but this is not the sign of a healthy revival.''

IN FRIENDLY SEATTLE, US SENATE RACE GETS MEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ This is a city so friendly that strangers inquire if
you've had a good breakfast, and cabbies won't charge for a short
hop.
</P>
<P>
   This is a place so mellow that it created the US version of
espresso bars and made them as common around Puget Sound as salmon
on the menu and Microsoft millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, this is also the site of one of the season's
meanest Senate races, a bare-knuckles brawl between two diminutive,
middle-aged women with clashing personalities and wildly opposing
views on everything from gay rights to gun control, abortion to
affirmative action, free trade to taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for such an unlikely confrontation in this
picturesque part of the Pacific Northwest is US Representative
Linda Smith, a two-term Republican from Vancouver in the
southwestern corner of Washington state and perhaps the most
contrarian, in-your-face conservative in Congress. She defied state
party elders and trounced their preferred candidate, a moderate
with lots of money, in last month's primary. Now her sights are
firmly set on denying a second term to Senator Patty Murray, a
liberal Democrat from the Seattle suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who campaigned six years ago as a sweet ``mom in tennis
shoes,'' isn't running scared in the only all-female Senate race in
the nation and just the third such matchup in US history. Neither a
novice nor soft-spoken now, Murray has raised far more money than
Smith to saturate the airwaves with negative TV advertising, and
recent polls show her with a comfortable, double-digit lead going
into Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith, a former state legislator, has a history of ambushing
complacent opponents and outwitting the oddsmakers. In 1994 she won
the Republican primary as a write-in candidate, and in 1996 she was
declared dead until absentee ballots gave her an 887-vote victory
over her Democratic challenger.
</P>
<P>
   In this midterm contest, clouded by the Clinton scandal in the
other Washington, a combination of low Democratic turnout and a
crusade to go to the polls by Smith's energized army of Christian
conservatives and Ross Perot populists could upset both Murray and
conventional wisdom. The gender war some expected is more a
sideshow than an issue. In this state, which has more women
legislators than any other and a long tradition of electing females
statewide, a woman vs. woman race isn't a novelty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Smith can win,'' said Dale Foreman, state GOP
chairman. ``The woman is a powerful blend of charisma and chutzpah,
and she has always been underestimated.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the gates of the University of Washington's football
stadium on a drizzly homecoming Saturday, Smith worked the
60,000-plus crowd in what any other candidate would welcome as an
easy campaign stop. But just like the hometown Huskies, who eked
out a 35-34 win over Oregon State, the prickly GOP underdog was
here for a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon, Smith was debating a young teacher about her plan
to wipe out most of the US Education Department. She shook a finger
at a military veteran who thought Murray had a better record on
protecting his benefits. She argued with an African-American man
about a state ballot initiative she favors that would end education
and hiring preferences for minorities and women. ``You're
competent, I'll bet,'' said Smith, suggesting to the carpenter that
he might not have been hired because of affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   And after several minutes of hurling trade and employment
statistics at a Democrat who disagreed with her opposition to
raising the minimum wage, Smith told the man his views were ``a
bunch of crap.'' ``You've got a philosophical problem,'' Smith told
him, as local TV cameras rolled. ``Why don't you go campaign for
Patty Murray?''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who went straight from high school to marriage and then
into a career running a chain of H&AMP;R Block offices, later
explained, ``You've got to stick your neck out. These people are
going to get me for the next six years, so they'd better know who I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray's aim is also to define Smith, but as an extremist with a
protectionist agenda who is out of step with this socially
tolerant, trade-dependent state. So far, spending records show, the
incumbent has been successful convincing executives at Boeing and
Microsoft that she is the safe choice. Her task this week before
the election seems more daunting: to rally traditional Democrats to
go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a crowded labor-union hall in Tacoma last weekend, Murray
blended in with the audience that whipped into chants of ``Patty,
Patty, Patty'' when she said nothing less than the education of
their children, their Social Security, their abortion rights, and
their jobs were at risk if they sent Smith to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patty isn't glitz and glitter. She is one of us. She
understands working people, families, and people getting by on
$20,000 or $30,000 a year,'' said Pat Hunter, a forklift operator
and a member of the Teamsters local. ``Linda Smith, she has her own
agenda, and I think she is mean-spirited.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, 48, who grew up in a working-class family and went to a
state college, cultivated a down-to-earth, political outsider image
in her 1992 campaign. A former education activist and state
senator, Murray also capitalized on being a woman in an election
year when many voters were sour on men in the Senate for their
clumsy handling of the sexual harassment allegations against
Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. She won the open seat with
surprising ease.
</P>
<P>
   Constituents who initially thought Murray was very nice but not
too sharp say she has matured into an effective, attentive senator.
Aides tick off a string of legislative achievements _ sponsoring
the bill that just produced federal funds for 30,000 new teachers _
and boast that she can bring home plenty of bacon as a member of
the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who won't take money from political action committees,
accuses Murray of becoming too cozy with special interests and
pledging her allegiance to liberal leaders like Senator Edward M.
Kennedy instead of state voters.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who has ducked all but one debate, dismisses Smith as
desperate. ``I know who I am _ I'm someone who's grown over six
years, I've accomplished a lot, and I've become a real asset to my
state,'' Murray said after attending services at Seattle's
predominantly black Mount Zion Baptist Church. ``But that doesn't
mean I'm not still a mom in tennis shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   In a state that prides itself on independence _ 25 percent of
the voters backed Perot in 1992 _ Smith wears hers like a badge of
honor. In Congress, she drives House GOP leaders to distraction by
refusing to back their budget and tax bills for fear the measures
won't protect Social Security, and out of human rights concerns she
won't go along with free-trade measures, even when pro-business
Republicans beg. She refused to support Newt Gingrich's reelection
as House speaker in 1997, and she called for the president's
impeachment long before anyone knew about his recent extramarital
affair.
</P>
<P>
   But it was her backing of legislation to overhaul the campaign
finance laws that really got her into hot water with her party. The
Senate Republican Campaign Committee, which could have given Smith
more than $500,000 toward her race, has withheld almost all of it,
Smith said, because its chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky, is angry at her for calling him someone ``who likes the
laundering of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed when Smith made a media issue of it, the Republican
National Committee last week gave her campaign $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like Linda Smith precisely because people who pull the
strings in the Republican Party don't like her,'' said Mark
Ingersoll, an insurance salesman waving a Smith sign at the
football stadium. ``She's not a lap dog like her opponent. She
speaks her mind, sticks to her principles, and won't buckle
under.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, Smith picked up Ingersoll's toddler, aptly named
Reagan, and planted a kiss on her cheek. The 48-year-old candidate
said she misses her six grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, it can't be about who's the best mom in the race,''
said Smith. ``It's about two very different views of how the
country should look, and which woman is best able to move us
there.''

DREAMS OF SLAVIC SILICON VALLY FADE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROITSK, Russia _ It was supposed to become the Slavic Silicon
Valley, a mecca of high technology trade that would ignite a boom
in Russia's post-Communist economy.
</P>
<P>
   The merger of Soviet science and Russian business is under way
in Troitsk, a Cold War-era scientific research center 20 miles
south of Moscow, but today's reality is nothing like yesterday's
dream.
</P>
<P>
   In a dark, cluttered basement of a moribund research institute,
Emmanuel, the human face of Russian science in Russia's market
economy, ekes out his living as a one-man cottage industry. He
keeps a step ahead of tax authorities, protection rackets, and
anyone else who would stand in the way of his meager profits.
</P>
<P>
   Emmanuel barely makes enough to feed his family, but he keeps
the exact amount a secret _ as well as the names of his clients and
his own last name.
</P>
<P>
   A theoretical physicist by training, still nominally employed by
the institute, Emmanuel designs, assembles, markets, and sells
high-tech devices that utilize the latest advances in spectrum
analysis, such as a system used in diagnosing cancer that he
recently sold to a local hospital for $120.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few sales like that and I eat,'' Emmanuel said. ``I have no
plans to broaden my business, because these are not the right times
for that.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to look at businessmen like Emmanuel is that they are
the survivors who have been able to adapt to the free market. On
the other hand, as businesses go, Emmanuel's firm is more of a
postapocalyptic hunter-gatherer, scraping by in the rubble of
Soviet science, than a thriving engine of change in the new Russian
economy.
</P>
<P>
   It is a far cry from what Troitsk thought the free market would
bring.
</P>
<P>
   Racquetball, swimming pools, Western-style airports. Hotels and
jogging tracks, houses with carports.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that was the plan in 1990, when the Kremlin announced
a joint venture with California-based construction and engineering
giant Bechtel Inc., to turn this formerly closed city of 35,000
into ``Russian Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not worked out that way. Instead of racquetball and Route
128, Troitsk turned down the road to poverty after the Cold War
ended and the state funding for science dried up. Its vaunted
research institutes, where the Soviet Union's best physicists once
designed laser rays that could knock American spy satellites from
orbit, have fallen into disrepair since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; if,,.2l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   As with dozens of formerly closed ``academic cities'' throughout
Russia, whose top-secret research institutes once attracted the
country's best and brightest, Troitsk is struggling to pay its
bills and keep the specialists who have not bolted for jobs in the
West or left science for more profitable trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Silicon Valley? I forgot about that long ago,'' said Vadim
Brazhkin, deputy director of the Institute of High Pressure Physics
in Troitsk. ``My biggest problem is that they turned off our
phones, they turned off our heat, and where to find money to pay
salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Troitsk's hard times today provide a striking contrast with the
belief shared by many in the early 1990s that all the Soviet Union
need do to prosper was to stop making advanced military hardware
and put that know-how into high technology civilian goods.
</P>
<P>
   But Soviet research centers turned out to be much harder to
adapt to the market than anyone thought. One of the problems faced
by places like Troitsk is that they were set up to fuel Russia's
arms race with the West. An estimated 80 to 90 percent of the work
done by Russian science was for military purposes by institutes
that have no tradition of marketing their discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soviet technology did not serve higher living standards,''
said Brazhkin. ``The Soviets set an assignment of building a bomb,
or a space shuttle, and two laboratories with thousands of
employees would develop a single bolt. The Soviet government could
pull in the belts, force the whole country to come up with a
result.''
</P>
<P>
   This system produced some amazing results. In a rundown,
gargantuan building beyond a courtyard strewn with rusting spare
parts and scrap metal, Brazhkin showed his guests a five-story hunk
of steel, pistons, and grease called The Bolshoi Press, the world's
largest pressure chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The Bolshoi Press is a truly astonishing behemoth capable of
mustering 50,000 tons of pressure to crush most any material known
to man. The Bolshoi Press is also a virtually useless contraption.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the institute's jobs _ developing and testing
superlight, superhard materials, simulating earthquakes to test
their effects on buildings _ can be handled by the smaller,
10,000-ton pressure chamber across the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the biggest pressure chamber in the world, but no one
knows why,'' Brazhkin lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the institute build The Bolshoi Press? It had plenty of
free time, specialists, and funding on its hands. Now, Brazhkin and
his colleagues can only joke about the commercial potential of the
most pressure money can buy: Custom ritual services for New Russian
businessmen who want to be posthumously compacted into diamonds; A
new Terminator movie in which Arnold crushes the bad guy robot in
The Bolshoi Press.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good joke, but Brazhkin is not laughing too hard. He
does not know where he is going to get the money to pay this year's
heating bill.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is in the same boat in Russian science. German
Zagainov, who heads an association of 50 research centers across
Russia, can name dozens of examples of institutes that have put
their brain power toward developing quality civilian goods. His
favorite is an institute that took the technology it used to make
rocket fuel and invented a pencil-like spot remover ``that works
better than anything I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, you cannot find it in stores, partly because
Russian scientists generally lack the experience to develop and
market civilian technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists are not businessmen,'' Zagainov said. ``They need
managers, they need advertising and people who know how to attract
capital. In high technology fields you can't just go to a market
and sell your goods. It is not a supermarket.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny he should mention that. Ask anyone in Troitsk for the name
of a scientist who has been successful in business, he will
probably mention Nikolai Yefremov, a physicist who left his old job
at the Institute of Spectroscopy and founded a chain of food
stores.
</P>
<P>

been the money-making spheres in the new Russia, at least until
this summer's economic collapse ended their little boom.

says his institute has a number of marketable ideas. The institute
makes spectrometers, which provide a rapid and accurate analysis of
the composition of bodies by examining the light waves that emanate
from them when illuminated by a laser. Tumanov says the
applications are endless: Criminology, archeology, medical
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to develop this technology, we'd need investment,
investors, laws governing this kind of thing, and, in the end, a
government program aimed at defining the purpose of having state
research centers,'' Tumanov said. ``For six years, we've had none
of that, and now, with the latest crisis, it's clear it will be a
long time before we will.''

   ``In retrospect, it was a crazy idea that a scientific city
would drive an economic revival,'' Emmanuel said. ``Instead, the
science city will die. Firms like mine will live on its ruins for a
little while, but this is not the sign of a healthy revival.''

MAC OS IS BETTER THAN EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How unfortunate that 96 out of 100 personal computer buyers
might not care that Mac OS 8.5, Apple Computer Inc.'s new operating
system software for Macintosh computers, is easier to use, more
elegant, more innovative and more reliable than Windows 98. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But for the 4 percent _ Apple's current share of new computer
sales _ who do care, and for the unknown percentage of computer
owners who may be frustrated with the industry-standard Windows
operating system, the happy news is that Mac OS 8.5 is now
available, either as a $99 upgrade package for Macs of recent
vintage, or as the default system software on new Apple computers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mac OS 8.5 is certainly a better operating system than earlier
versions of the Mac OS, and, in some ways, for some users, better
than Windows. It is not free of headaches, of course, and an
operating system upgrade should never, ever be taken lightly.
Several of my favorite older applications crashed when introduced
to the new OS. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mac OS 8.5 was written specifically for the PowerPC chip, which
means it cannot be installed on older Macintoshes based on the
Motorola 68000 series microprocessors, including the popular
Quadras that preceded the current Power Macintosh line. Nor will it
work on older Macs even if they have a PowerPC upgrade card. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is a disappointment of high magnitude, especially for those
of us who own an assortment of older Macs and PowerBooks. It
signals that Apple has cut loose those older Macs, sending them
adrift just as it did the Apple II.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have a PowerPC Macintosh, however, and a minimum
24 megabytes of RAM and 155 megabytes of vacant hard disk space
needed for the upgrade, the main advantages of upgrading to the new
Mac OS can be summarized in a few points: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Version 8.5 is more stable and reliable than earlier versions.
In other words, it does not crash as often. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ It has some new tricks that are useful for people who spend
time connected to the Internet. These days, that means nearly
everyone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ It has a Sherlock, a search engine that alone is worth the
upgrade fee. Sherlock makes it easier to find files and
information, whether the information is on the user's computer, on
a local network, or on the World Wide Web. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ It is faster. Mac OS 8.5 has been written to take specific
advantage of the PowerPC chip, leading to quicker execution of
operations ranging from automated AppleScript tasks to transferring
files over a local network. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ It isn't Windows. Windows 98 has many fine qualities, and is
itself a great improvement over Windows 95, but its most compelling
feature, let's be honest, is that it is the industry standard. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That fact alone means that most computer users will choose a
Windows computer over a Macintosh computer, and it is hard to argue
against the logic. There is more software available for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   New products almost always come out for Windows ahead of the Mac
_ if they come out for the Mac at all. More support is available
for Windows machines. And Windows machines are cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Mac is surrounded on all sides, and
outnumbered 24 to 1. That is precisely the kind of situation that
invigorates Macintosh users, and now they have a new operating
system to cheer about.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is not whether Mac OS 8.5 is a worthy
operating system upgrade _ that is an easy call _ but whether it is
safe, and smart, to buy a Macintosh today. Six months ago, even
some of Apple's most loyal supporters struggled with those
questions.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the company that once did almost everything wrong now seems
to be doing almost everything right. Apple just reported its first
profitable year since 1995. At this point there is little fear for
Apple's survival.
</P>
<P>
   Under the leadership of Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder and
interim chief executive, the company has demonstrated that it can
survive and prosper. The next test is whether it can increase
revenues and regain lost market share. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   It seems to be on the right track. Apple introduced a series of
popular and innovative products this year, including the flat-panel
Studio Display, the G3 PowerBooks, and the funky iMac, which has
been wildly popular despite its flaws. If you are shopping for an
iMac today, be sure to get the ``Revision B'' model. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Apple asserts that the recent success of its iMac has persuaded
a number of software developers to create programs for the
Macintosh platform. Apple also contends that a substantial
percentage of its iMac customers are either first-time computer
buyers or born-again Macintosh users who lost faith and joined the
Windows camp, and who are coming home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And now comes Mac OS 8.5, which demonstrates that Apple managed
to salvage something good from the ``Copland'' operating system
debacle, in which Apple squandered a huge head start in operating
system design and allowed Microsoft Windows to catch up to the
Mac. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is it smart to choose a Macintosh today? Perhaps not in the
corporate world, where Windows has won almost all the desktops,
except in traditional Apple strongholds like graphics and
publishing. Apple's real strength _ and its best hope for the
future _ is in the consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's ``Think Different'' advertising campaign would lead one
to believe that Macs are popular chiefly among dead people. From my
observations, however, Mac users include some of the liveliest and
most creative individuals around.
</P>
<P>
   The key word is ``individual.'' For those who find safety in
numbers, Windows is the safe, smart choice. For those who simply
want the best tool for the job, the Mac is certainly worth
consideration. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few cautions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Before attempting any OS upgrade _ Mac, Windows, Linux, Be, or
whatever _ back up your hard disk.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have favorite applications that you depend on for your
productivity and sanity, check with the software makers to make
sure your versions are compatible with Mac OS 8.5. An upgrade to a
newer version, typically at some expense and loss of time, may be
needed to avoid system crashes.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, older versions of the Norton Utilities, Now Contact
and Now Up-To-Date, and Microsoft Word all had to be replaced after
they got the heebie-jeebies from Mac OS 8.5. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ If your Macintosh has been well-behaved, Mac OS 8.5's
automated installation process should be a breeze. It overlays the
new system file on top of the old and saves all the old preferences
and other bureaucratic settings, including Internet connection
settings that were probably no fun to create in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   But if you have endured occasional problems with balky system
extensions or other technical goblins and gremlins, consider
performing a clean install. A clean install, made easier with a
utility like Cassidy &AMP; Greene's Conflict Catcher, creates an
entirely new system file and requires the user to re-install every
extension, font, control panel and setting.
</P>
<P>
   It is a more grueling process, but doing so sweeps away the
virtual cobwebs that build up over time and cause internal
conflicts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, consider getting a Mac OS 8.5 help manual like ``Mac
OS 8.5 for Dummies'' by Bob Le Vitus (IDG Books, $19.95). Apple is
so proud of its online help system that it has reduced the printed
documentation for this upgrade to just a few pages. Some of us are
old-fashioned enough to get comfort from a book.

PATRICK KENNEDY HELPS HIMSELF WHILE HELPING OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Representative Patrick Kennedy campaigned earlier this week in
Fort Worth, nearly 2,000 miles and a time zone away from his Rhode
Island district.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is spending the days before the election helping other
Democrats and simultaneously helping himself land a slot on the
powerful House Appropriations Committee and a leadership post as
chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A congressman up for reelection usually sticks close to his
district the week before an election, but a recent Brown University
poll showed that Kennedy held a 53-point lead over his Republican
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, by the time he returns home Thursday to East
Providence, he will have completed a two-week campaign swing for 20
different Democrats running for various offices around the country.
In the past year, Kennedy raised $1.5 million for more than 40
Democratic House candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kennedy is basically going prime-time now, which is exactly
what people thought he would do,'' said Darrell M. West, a Brown
University political scientist and pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 31, the youngest of Senator Edward M. Kennedy's three
children, has emerged as a top contender for the campaign committee
job because of his fund-raising skill and his friendship with House
Democratic leader Richard Gephardt, aides to Gephardt say. He is
one of the most requested speakers on the congressional ``rubber
chicken'' circuit.
</P>
<P>
   While flying from Las Vegas to Fort Worth Tuesday morning, he
practiced saying, ``We need your vote'' in Spanish. After
campaigning for Representative Martin Frost of Texas, the current
chairman of the Democratic campaign committee, Kennedy stumped for
two Hispanic candidates running in San Antonio-area districts,
Charlie Gonzalez, and Ciro Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he began his campaign day at a Mass in Moline, Ill.,
with a Democratic House candidate. He then flew to Chicago,
Philadelphia and Las Vegas. The day before, he campaigned in Green
Bay, Wis., for freshman Representative Jay Johnson. The candidate
resurrected some old ``Kennedy-Johnson'' campaign signs from the
1960 presidential campaign and crowed that the ``ticket'' had been
reunited.
</P>
<P>
   While Kennedy has not ruled out running for the Senate in 2000
if Rhode Island's Republican Senator John Chafee retires, he is
focusing on his role in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the biggest draw we have in the caucus in terms of
campaigning requests,'' said Laura Nichols, a spokeswoman for
Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   His Rhode Island critics make an issue of his absences from the
state, and Kennedy acknowledges the concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically for me, my life would be a lot easier if I spent
every weekend in Rhode Island,'' he said. ``But I have a feeling
that my district is starting to appreciate what I am doing. They
elected me in some measure because of my last name and the
connections I promised I could make on their behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   His priority for the 106th Congress that begins in January is to
be named to the House Appropriations Committee. But he is also a
front-runner for the high-profile campaign committee job because of
his willingness to stump for Democrats and because of his
friendship with Gephardt, who selects the chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt emerged as his patron soon after Kennedy entered the
House four years ago as its then-youngest member. They formed a
joint fund-raising committee several years ago, and Kennedy has
become one of Gephardt's staunchest supporters.
</P>
<P>
   An unlikely combination of conservative Democrats in the House
and labor union lobbyists have floated the idea of splitting the
chairmanship of the congressional campaign committee into two jobs.
Representatives Nancy Pelosi of California and Sherrod Brown of
Ohio are frequently mentioned as candidates, along with Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy would like to head the committee, but he is also willing
to share the spot with Pelosi and would step aside for her is there
is just one chairman and no other women are chosen for House
leadership roles.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials, however, say Kennedy is a strong contender
whether one or two people head the campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick is a celebrity. He was born into that,'' said Loretta
Bowen, an official of the Communication Workers of America, who
favors the double-chairman idea. ``So why not take advantage of
that?''

THE CORRUPTION OF SCHOOL CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
 JACKSON-COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Annette Polly Williams knew in 1990 that giving
birth to school choice guaranteed a bitter custody fight for her
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew from the beginning that white Republicans and rich,
right-wing foundations that praised me and used me to validate
their agenda would do it only as long as it suited their needs,''
Williams said. ``I knew that once they figured they didn't need me
as a black cover, they would try to take control of vouchers and
use them for their own selfish interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee is the site of one of the nation's most highly watched
school choice programs. It is being watched partly because it is
one of the few programs that originated with African-American
support. Williams, a 10-term Democratic state representative and a
fierce advocate for low-income African-American youth, created
vouchers in an alliance with Republican Governor Tommy Thompson and
a Republican-led state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Williams did so out of frustration with a nationally maligned
public school system where the black male grade average was a D and
parents screamed for change. Williams wrote legislation that
allowed 1,500 low-income students to attend private, secular
schools on state money that comes to about $5,000 per child.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify, a family had to have an income no greater than 1.75
times the poverty line, or about $23,000 for a family of three. In
1995, in a move that has been appealed by civil liberties groups to
the US Supreme Court, the state expanded the program to allow up to
15,000 students to use vouchers for religious as well as secular
private schools. There are 104,000 students in the Milwaukee public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best way I could come up with to give low-income
families the same choices as a middle-class family,'' Williams
said. ``In my mind, this was not abandoning the public schools.
I've always felt that no more than, say, 25 percent of public
school students should have access to vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``More kids are always going to attend public schools. This was
something to put a little power in the hands of parents, the same
power that parents in the suburbs have to decide where their
children can go to school. I had hoped to nudge the public schools
themselves to respond to the challenge and work harder to keep
parents from wanting vouchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever power those low-income families have had is under
threat. In August, Mayor John Norquist set off shock waves by
saying choice should be expanded to all families.
</P>
<P>
   Norquist's director of communications, Jeff Fleming, said the
mayor has no intention of taking choice from low-income families.
Fleming said universal choice would help keep middle- and
upper-class families from fleeing Milwaukee because of the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hearing compelling stories like a woman who was $200
over the income cap but had to spend thousands of dollars to keep
her kids in private school,'' Fleming said. ``We're trying to think
about this in terms of a GI grant for students to use to select
where they feel they will receive a quality education.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said ``universal'' choice means white choice. She said
that wealthier will use their privileges, such as having more spare
time to game the system, to grab the first spots in private
schools. There is evidence for her fear. Cambridge, Mass., has
universal controlled choice, but privileged white families are
disproportionately clustered in the most desirable schools.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming said there will be room for all, especially since only
6,000 of the 15,000 slots are expected to be used this year.
Williams does not buy that for the long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why most black groups like the NAACP are against
vouchers,'' Williams said, ``because without the income cap, choice
just becomes a free-market program that keeps richer families happy
and Catholic and Lutheran schools solvent with state money without
any commitment to improve public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   To head off calls for universal access, Williams is considering
raising the cap to $35,000 for a family of four. So far, Governor
Thompson still stands by the income cap. Other legislators say the
voucher system has not been analyzed enough for its effectiveness
to expand it to everyone. The state's black legislative caucus has
urged its colleagues not to lift the cap.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Supreme Court upholds the use of state-funded
vouchers for private schools, Williams is concerned that
middle-class families will press hard to become eligible for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people in the voucher crowd exploit low-income black
children, saying we are creating vouchers for them when what they
really have in mind is bringing in a Trojan horse,'' Williams said.
``They can say what they want, but I've never seen a situation
where low-income people, when they have to compete in education
with people with far more resources, come out equal.''

A POLITICAL `PLEASANTVILLE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Pleasantville'' is not a profound experience,
but moviegoers will likely talk about it. Like ``Forrest Gump'' and
``The Truman Show,'' it serves up digestible philosophical musings
amid seamless special effects.
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, the movie resembles California politics. As 15
million registered voters in the Golden State decide whether or not
to vote, they confront a political landscape that resembles
``Pleasantville.'' The surface is slick and relentlessly pleasant,
but underneath, the plot can be stiff, stark, and anxious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, I'm home!'' William H. Macy exclaims throughout the
movie, mocking the signature of black-and-white situtation
comedies. ``The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet,'' ``Leave It to
Beaver,'' and others graced a pristine landscape in which art
imitated life and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, that much-parodied decade, two cultural and
political forces grew up together. Suburbia and television were
powerful adolescents, and California helped mold them both. The
Hollywood Freeway's opening in 1954 was a cultural and political
event, a plastic festival of crabgrass and conformity. All roads
lead to the Pleasantville that television producers imagine was the
national heart's desire. When American husbands in the 1950s said,
``Honey, I'm home!'' they inhabited a virtual San Fernando valley,
America's dream suburb, where television antennae sprouted like
dandelions.
</P>
<P>
   The major candidates for governor are 1950s archetypes. Democrat
Gray Davis, born in 1942, and Republican Dan Lungren, born in 1946,
are alike in ambition and different in ideology. They are no worse
or better than candidates in most other states, but they confront
the historic antipathy of Californians toward politics.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious since the Gold Rush of anything that hemmed in people
or curbed their acquisitiveness, Californians have built barriers
to politics. The robber barons of railroad and mining interests
bought the Legislature 100 years ago, leading to the birth of the
progressive movement. Hiram Johnson, the revered governor and
longtime senator, was Theodore Roosevelt's running mate on the
Progressive Party ticket in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was also a glum, un-Californian skeptic who could have
been the political boss in ``Pleasantville,'' brilliantly portrayed
by the late J.T. Walsh in one of his final performances. Johnson
demanded a republic of virtue and used the ballot referendum to
thwart railroad barons.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, special interests can concoct a grass-roots
campaign of instant artificial turf to sway the masses for and
against ballot questions. The grimmest black-and-white tableau in
politics today is the official 127-page voter information guide,
the Pleasantville white pages, a trackless waste of trivialities
and demagoguery.
</P>
<P>
   Californians decide 10 questions Tuesday, including whether ``to
prohibit the sale of horsemeat for food for human consumption.''
What hath Hiram Johnson wrought?
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, Goodwin Knight and Pat Brown, genial optimists of
different parties, governed California with a gospel of growth and
built what would later be called ``infrastructure.'' They were
succeeded in Sacramento by Ronald Reagan and Jerry Brown, another
bipartisan duo with captivating personalities whose optimism was
tempered by what the younger Brown called ``an era of limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the economy is roaring loudly enough to mute politics.
Prosperity has banished identity-politics controversy, with no
emotionally divisive ballot questions. This election is not as
exciting as ``Pleasantville,'' which evokes ``Singin' in the
Rain,'' with touches of D.W. Griffith, Leni Reifenstahl, and even
John Madden.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pleasantville, where it never rains, the weather diminishes
the zest for politics that enlivens East Coast Novembers. Election
day forecast for most Californians: sublime. This does not
guarantee a big turnout.

IN DARKNESS OF LA. PRISON, WRITER SEES REDEMPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A maximum security prison filled with murderers, rapists and
armed robbers would seem an odd place to go looking for God. But it
was precisely his desire to find evidence of the divine in the
grimmest of places that drove Daniel Bergner to spend a year at
Angola, Louisiana's infamous penitentiary. Bergner turned his
experiences into a recently published book.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, after witnessing both the degradation and the
brutish behavior of the inmates, the New York City author and
journalist did not come away with a soothing affirmation of God's
power.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he came away with a more complex appreciation of the
possibility of redemption for even the most heinous acts and the
indomitability of the human spirit in the worst conditions. And
what started out as an article for Harper's Magazine chronicling
Angola's annual inmate rodeo evolved into a book, ``God of the
Rodeo: The Search for Hope, Faith, and a Six-Second Ride in
Louisiana's Angola Prison.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways Angola is the ultimate proving ground of the
human spirit,'' said Bergner, sitting in an overstuffed chair at
the John Jeffries House on Beacon Hill during a recent visit to
Boston. ``This may sound strange, but I was trying to find some
kind of comforting parable within a place that was just so
dispiriting. How did these convicts construct their lives in a
place that doesn't offer them any hope whatsoever?''
</P>
<P>
   Angola, in a remote corner of Louisiana, is a hauntingly
beautiful place, a vast expanse of lush fields home to 2,000 cattle
and hundreds of horses, and surrounded on three sides by the
Mississippi River. It also is a place where 80 percent of the 5,000
inmates will never leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it's not a walled prison, as soon as you drive in
the air feels different. It feels thick with ugliness,'' said
Bergner, 38, dressed casually in a dark sport jacket, black top,
khaki pants and black leather shoes. ``It is a place of
overwhelming destruction. The destruction of the lives of the
inmates' victims and their families. The destruction that the
inmates have done to their own lives. You wouldn't think it's a
place where there could be any possibility of some kind of
mysterious, divine power.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the inmates' rodeo, which Bergner portrays as a cruel
and even inhumane exploitation of prisoners, had a transcendent
quality.
</P>
<P>
   The annual event, held every Sunday in October, recruits inmates
who have no experience with horses or bulls, to ride bucking
broncos and dodge flailing bull horns in front of a paying public.
Inevitably, there are a rash of injuries _ broken bones,
concussions, bloody gashes. A handful have been paralyzed after
being stomped by a bull.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeals to our worst instincts and impulses,'' Bergner
says. ``A need to see human beings bashed and broken and to
separate ourselves from `sinners' who we can look down at for
willing to be fools for our entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   But, on the other hand, the more he thought about it and the
more he talked with rodeo competitors, Bergner came to another
view. As he wrote in the February issue of Harper's: ``Get hit, get
stomped, get broken, get gored, bleed. What other means of
redemption had there ever been from the most terrible sins?
</P>
<P>
   ``These men had killed, they had raped, at best they had put
guns to other people's heads. Here was original sin, the loss of
God's spirit in the garden. ... And here, as in some vestigial and
distorted Passion, these men, sin's representatives, had arrived at
the place where they would offer up their bodies for purging.''
</P>
<P>
   So even in a spectacle ugly and vulgar, Bergner says he found
signs of God's grace: redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Bergner, a Jew, is neither pious nor naive. His parents, one a
doctor, the other a sociologist, disdained religion as an obstacle
to progress. Yet perhaps, Bergner suggests, in a sign of
generational rebellion, he is a believer. ``Religion is an
emotional need for me,'' Bergner said.
</P>
<P>
   And it is his constant wrestling with issues of faith, a quest
to discern the divine that permeates Bergner's honest and painful
portrayal of Angola.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't any miracles at Angola, Bergner finds. He does meet
Littell Harris, an armed robber who left Angola after 15 years and
is now a cross-country truck driver. It's one of the few success
stories he discovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what I took away from Angola is that we may be
absolutely right to take such total control of lives,'' Bergner
says. ``But it is the closest position we take to playing God. If
we're going to take that role we better think of it as sacred, and
we better watch over people the same way we would want God to look
over us.''

NOT THE CIVICS LESSON WE'D HOPED FOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It is not easy to teach your sons a civics lesson when
they have their fingers in their ears.
</P>
<P>
   My colleague, Joan Vennochi, and I had the best of intentions
when we asked her son, Nicholas, 9, and my son, Patrick, 10, to
accompany us to the last debate of the Massachusetts gubernatorial
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   We had planned to show them democracy in action. Instead, we
took them to a street fight. Who would have imagined that two boys,
one of whom I happen to know mastered his multiplication tables to
the blare of a boombox, would complain not that politics is too
boring, but that it is too loud?
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before the lights dimmed, Senator Edward M. Kennedy had
asked the boys to glance around the hall and to appreciate where
they were: ``Some of the greatest issues in our country's history _
the American Revolution, the Civil War, the right of women to vote
_ they were all debated right here where you are standing tonight.
It is why we are all so proud to be from Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   That was an easier sell at 7 p.m., Senator, than it was at 8
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   At a post-debate repast of pasta and Coca-Cola, Nicholas and
Patrick both had pounding headaches and a few reasonable questions
for Paul Cellucci and Scott Harshbarger: Why were you yelling when
you were standing right next to each other? Didn't anyone ever tell
you it's rude to interrupt? Why didn't you answer the questions
instead of saying ``take the pledge,'' ``tell the truth,'' ``our
crumbling schools,'' ``no new taxes'' over and over again?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, and who was Lincoln Douglas, anyway _ a boxer?
</P>
<P>
   An understandable mistake, given the moderator's hands-off
approach to the slugfest Monday night. ``This is the
Lincoln-Douglas portion of the debate,'' shrugged Harvard Law
professor Charles Ogletree, suggesting that the names of the two
political legends were synonymous with anarchy, not oratory.
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln-Douglas format means that candidates address one
another directly, without reporters acting as intermediaries. That
bears only a marginal resemblance to what happened in 1858 when
Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas engaged in seven debates during
their campaign for the US Senate in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas was 45, a two-term incumbent Democrat being challenged
by Lincoln, 49, a Republican former congressman. Lincoln had
prodded Douglas to debate him in a desperate bid to call attention
to his longshot candidacy. He asked only ``perfect reciprocity, and
no more. I wish as much time as you, and that conclusions shall
alternate. That is all.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, time was a different commodity in the 19th century.
Each debate lasted for three hours. An hour-long speech was
followed by a 90-minute rebuttal, which was followed, in turn, by a
30-minute rejoinder. That culture, too, bore little similarity to
our own. Politics was a preoccupation of Everyman. Those who had
the vote, exercised it. The debates took place across Illinois,
often in open fields under threatening skies. Still, thousands
came.
</P>
<P>
   The debates _ all of them about slavery _ occurred one year
after the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision said blacks could
never be citizens. Douglas argued that each new territory should
decide whether to sanction human bondage; Lincoln argued that
slavery should not be extended into new states. Reprinted by
newspapers across the country, the debates ignited a national
conversation about an issue that would soon divide the nation.
</P>
<P>
   All was not high-minded, however. The debates were entertainment
for the masses, as well. There were picnics and torchlight parades.
Lincoln's supporters escorted him to one debate in a wagon drawn by
six white horses. Douglas's partisans brought a brass cannon to
each debate to fire whenever their candidate ``hit'' his opponent.
Newspapers dubbed the short, squat Douglas ``The Little Giant,''
and the tall, gaunt Lincoln, ``Honest Abe.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln historian Harold Holzer writes in his introduction to
the texts of the debates that audiences hooted and jeered when the
candidates ``attacked each other and defended themselves with
biting humor, bitter sarcasm, and hellish fury...''
</P>
<P>
   That much, anyway, sounds familiar. ``I think I'd rather listen
to Paul Cellucci and Scott Harshbarger yell for one hour than talk
for three hours,'' Nicholas decided. Patrick had to agree.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't exactly the civics lesson their moms had in mind.

FOR THE LONELY: ADJECTIVES FOR HIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NATHAN COBB  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Her own personal ad might read something like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Trim, creative, green-eyed WF. Forties. Successful business
owner. Enjoys Paris, hiking, and fine wines. Seeks D/SFs and D/SMs
from late 30s through 60s who desire a lasting relationship but
can't write a personal advertisement that doesn't mention walking
on the beach or sitting in front of a roaring fire. Come to my
place and let's talk.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; And so they do, shlepping up three flights of narrow stairs to
the light-filled top floor of Susan Fox's Boston duplex
condominium. They come in search of Mr. or Ms. Right, and it is
Fox's job to make them sound downright irresistible. As a
professional ghostwriter of personal ads, she will not only
describe most of her clients as trim (a must for the women) or
professional (de rigueur for the men), but will let loose a
fusillade of adjectives that no reader in search of a relationship
could possibly withstand: passionate, witty, romantic, warm,
curious, resourceful, articulate, supportive, sophisticated,
expressive, outgoing, attentive, forthright, sincere ...
</P>
<P>
   Alas, such perfection does not guarantee that someone with
similar traits will reply. ``I tell my clients, `You're gonna have
to kiss some frogs,''' says the 47-year-old Fox. ``Well, maybe not
kiss them. But at least look at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who runs a small company called Personals Work, has been
coaching her single and ``re-singled'' clients for six years. The
majority, she says, are widowed or divorced; they're trying, as she
likes to put it, ``to get back up on the horse.'' They range in age
from their late 30s through their 60s, meaning that a lasting
relationship is more important to them than keeping raging hormones
at bay. About two-thirds of them are women, about 95 percent are
straight. Some have tried personal ads and failed, others are
newbies. Most are professionals, preferring to advertise in the
likes of Harvard Magazine and Cruising World. (It's a sailing
magazine.) And they are willing to pay Fox from $325 to $450 for
her services in addition to their advertising costs.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's not like they have a lot of options besides
personal ads, the 1960s alternative that has become throughly
mainstream. ``One client who's in her 50s asked me, `What else am I
gonna do? Sit in Star Market and wait for someone to walk by?'''
Fox says.
</P>
<P>
   And, hey, personals worked for Susan Fox. Nine years ago, the
onetime therapist, freelance writer, and independent radio producer
sat down with a couple of friends and wrote an advertisement for
herself (``Something about having lots of frequent flyer miles,''
she recalls). She was divorced, a recent engagement had fallen
through, and she was asking herself if she was desperate enough to
try the personals to the tune of $1,200. Result: meetings with 31
different guys over 10 months, from a taxi driver to an MIT
administrator. She chose the latter, Rick Hill, who is today a
computer consultant and her husband. She found a new career, too.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that anyone could compose a personal
advertisement, but Fox might disagree. She also might recite some
of the cliches found in many ads: pretty, blonde, 39; likes movies,
hiking, beaches, and sitting in front of the fire; seeks
successful, handsome man, 39-45. ``Well, just who is this woman?''
Fox laments. ``We know nothing about her except she likes movies,
hiking, beaches, and fires. We know she thinks she's pretty. And we
know she wants what everybody else wants. There's no meat there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox thinks personal ads should tell a kind a story, and the ones
she writes tend to speak of, say, small-town roots, the love of a
good Bordeaux, or dreams of a second home in Maine. Still, that
doen't mean you can't do it yourself, and she offers five
suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   _Start with a list of the qualities you're seeking, as well as a
list of your own qualities. ``If you don't know, ask your
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   _Don't make your ad too brief. ``The whole psychology of this is
that people tend to respond to ads that paint complete portraits.''
</P>
<P>
   _Don't get too cute. ```Juliet seeks Romeo' not only falls flat.
It also brings out the weirdos.''
</P>
<P>
   _Write mostly about yourself, not what you're seeking.
``Unfortunately, most people use about two-thirds of their copy to
describe what they're after, not who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   _Avoid cliches. ``OK, you can say you like beaches. But try to
add some interests with substance. Like philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's clients may have played the dating game in the past, but
the rules have changed since many of them took the field. ``They
never had to face AIDS, for one thing,'' she says. ``Also, women
today have to understand that they're allowed to take a more active
role in a relationship, to be the pursuer instead of being passive.
And they have to realize that going out means going somewhere of
mutual interest, not simply being picked up and taken somewhere. My
mother used to tell me when I went out, `Pretend to be interested
in what he's interested in.' But that's not true anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's apparently someone out there for everyone. Fox
recalls a woman in her mid-40s who came to her with a weight
problem. (``Men are hung up on weight,'' Fox says. ``It's audacious
and it's shallow. But it's true.'') The client also had very
specific demands: She wanted a man who was Jewish, had never been
married, had no children, and had never, ever lived with a woman.
``It seemed impossible, but she found him,'' Fox recalls. ``And he
liked overweight women, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Some folks get what they don't need, however _ like the woman
who received a reply to her ad from her ex-husband. But the real
downside is rejection. ``You really need ego strength for this,''
Fox advises, recalling one client who, after several promising
telephone conversations with a man who had replied to her ad,
finally met him for a day. ``He didn't like her,'' she says. ``She
was devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 60- to 90-minute interview that Fox says she conducts
before she puts word processor to paper, she tells her clients to
separate the ``non-negotiables'' they're seeking from their ``wish
list.'' Pies in the sky should definitely not be on the menu, even
in a world where everyone is described in flawless terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``People looking for the perfect prince or princess,'' says
Susan Fox, ``had better stop looking.''

JOHN UPDIKE'S UN-BETTER ANGEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My writer pal William Novak and I were discussing the reviews of
John Updike's new novel, ``Bech at Bay.'' ``It sounds
irresistible,'' Novak said. I have to admit he was right.
</P>
<P>
   Why irresistible? Well, for one thing here's a Pennsylvania
Lutheran, exiled on the featureless North Shore, kvetching about
the writing life in the voice of a lapsed Manhattan Jew. Updike is
notoriously gracious; his creation Bech is a jerk. Updike is
famously prolific. Bech is generally blocked. While Updike worries
out loud about the promises of the Christian afterlife, the
fictional Bech, now 74, has more down-to-earth concerns: He wants
to know where the next erection is coming from.
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase Abraham Lincoln (himself paraphrasing William
Seward; that's the kind of faux, showy erudition Bech would
simultaneously abominate and envy), Bech is the un-better angel of
Updike's nature. One could make the case that writers are not very
nice people. Paul Theroux has just written a whole book to settle
some ancient score with V.S. Naipaul. Philip Roth has devoted the
better part of a novel to trashing his ex-wife, supposedly payback.
To argue the writers-as-bad-people case, Henry Bech would be
Exhibit A.
</P>
<P>
   Better than most, Bech can describe the impossible anxiety that
attends a friend's success. A literary enemy's triumph is cause for
apoplexy. An enemy's death is cause for celebration. In the latest
book, the protagonist's 26-year-old lover looks on
uncomprehendingly while Bech revels in the obituary of the
once-powerful critic Lucas Mishner. ``The thought of him dead
filled Bech with creamy ease,'' Updike writes.
</P>
<P>
   Bech can quote verbatim from negative reviews _ what writer
can't? _ and, in the story ``Bech Noir,'' takes steps to eliminate
the authors of ``these insults, these hurled mud balls, these
stains on the robe of his reputation, (these) bleeding wounds.''
Although some writers feign to shun praise, on this subject as on
others, Bech is more unbuttoned than most: ``One appetite that had
not diminished with the years was for unambiguous, blood-raw
superlatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, Updike is asked how much he resembles Bech. He
dismisses the question with a quip and a smile. But he does drop
hints. On the first page of the first of the three Bech books,
written 30 years ago, Bech complains to his chronicler that he has
been rendered as ``something Waspish, theological, scared, and
insulatingly ironical, that derives, my wild surmise is, from
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men have been close in the past. In 1971 and 1981,
Updike submitted to lengthy, satisfyingly opaque (from the author's
point of view) interviews by Bech, published in The New York Times
Book Review. They share an interest in sex, ``that hint of eternal
life,'' as Bech calls it, and have both been scorned as
women-haters. Beloved by critics, Bech, like Updike, had to write a
``triumphantly sleazy best-seller'' called ``Couples,'' sorry,
``Think Big,'' to find a mass audience.
</P>
<P>
   Although outwardly cordial, Bech has at least once expressed
reservations about his colleague and creator. ``At bottom, (Bech)
didn't like any of his contemporaries' work,'' we learn. ``O'Hara,
Hersey, Cheever, Updike _ suburbanites all living safe while art's
inner city disintegrated. And that was just the Johns.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week I saw Updike read from ``Bech at Bay,'' and he plainly
delighted in his altered ego's fumbling explorations of life in the
material world. ``The purpose of the writer is to amuse himself,''
Bech once told an interviewer, and he clearly succeeds in amusing
Updike, as well as Updike's readers.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of what reads like the final Bech book, Updike grants
Bech not only the Nobel Prize for Literature, but something even
more valuable _ the secret of life digested down to two tiny
letters. (Hint: They're not ``o'' and ``m.'') You'll have to read
it for yourself; I suspect you'll find it irresistible.

LA CRITIC MIKE DAVIS FOCUSES ON SOCIAL JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; PASADENA, Calif. _ ``On a morning like this,'' said Mike
Davis, the self-styled ``doom-and-gloom'' chronicler of Los
Angeles, ``people say that people who write books like mine are
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The smog was thick over Los Angeles itself, a few miles to the
southwest, but the season's first Santa Ana-spawned brush fires had
burned out and the San Gabriel Mountains were clear _ if not
sharply so _ a mile or two farther to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is out of the muckraker tradition of the early part of the
century, when writers like Upton Sinclair, Lincoln Steffens, and
Frank Norris exposed the evils they saw in the meatpacking
industry, slum housing, and the railroads. Davis's focus has been
his native southern California, specifically Los Angeles, whose
political establishment he skewered in his 1990 book, ``City of
Quartz.'' That has become a cult classic for urbanists curious
about a city's political self-destruction. He has now followed that
with ``Ecology of Fear: Los Angeles and the Imagining of
Disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any way you look at it,'' said Davis, ``Los Angeles comes out
very, very poorly'' _ whether it's ``the $7 billion subway to
nowhere,'' the brush fires that periodically sweep down the Malibu
canyons, the deadly gang warfare on the streets, or a political
establishment that to Davis seems to ignore those events when it
isn't actually causing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In no other place,'' he says, ``is there the same combination
of natural disasters and social disorders.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis is a crusty 52 with close-cropped graying hair. His habit
of tightly folding his arms across his chest as he talks
underscores his blunt refusal to talk about himself. For him, his
work, his ideas, his causes, are his story.
</P>
<P>
   He lives with his wife, the Mexican-born painter Alessandra
Moctezuma, in a stuccoed bungalow with a swinging bench on the
porch and a faded photograph of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in direct
line of sight from the front door.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager in the early 1960s, Davis took part in civil
rights demonstrations and, after dropping out of Reed College in
Oregon, he worked as a long-haul trucker while doing community
organizing in southern California. At 30, he went back to college,
studying labor history at UCLA, but it is the dozen blue-collar
years that continue to establish his credentials as a social
critic.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, after a half-dozen years editing a Marxist
journal in London, Davis has been a part-time academic, teaching at
places like the Cesar Chavez Center for Chicano Studies at UCLA and
the Southern California Institute of Architecture. A self-described
``activist scholar,'' he often works behind the scenes advising
social-action groups involved in everything from negotiating a
truce between rival street gangs in Watts to working on strategy
with the city's militant bus riders union.
</P>
<P>
   He said his causes involve an awareness of good urban design,
credible alternatives to existing problems, ``and a social justice
component.'' That same sense of passionate concern carries over
into his writing.
</P>
<P>
   A centerpiece of ``Ecology of Fear'' contrasts the millions of
tax dollars spent to fight brush fires threatening ``the trophy
homes'' of Los Angeles celebrities in Malibu with the city's
refusal to inspect the firetrap apartments of immigrant workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $100 million cost of mobilizing 15,000 firefighters during
Halloween week 1993'' _ when firestorms burned over 18,500 acres
and 350 homes _ ``may be an increasingly common entry in the public
ledger,'' Davis writes. ``Needless to say, there is no comparable
investment in the fire, toxic or earthquake safety of inner-city
communities. Indeed, as in so many other things, we tolerate two
systems of hazard prevention, separate and unequal.''
</P>
<P>
   Recasting traditional urban planning models of the socially
engineered city for what others would see as free-spirited Los
Angeles, Davis locates a ``gulag rim'' beyond the ``gated affluent
suburbs,'' an ``outer rim of Los Angeles's ecology of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Out there is Calipatria State Prison, with what Davis describes
as ``the world's only bird-proof, ecologically responsible death
fence'' _ a 5,000-volt fence designed to guarantee instantaneous
death to any would-be escapee. It had to be modified when
environmentalists protested that it was killing birds that alighted
on it.
</P>
<P>
   That may be southern California at its most bizarre, but Davis
soberly recalls visiting Calipatria while researching ``Ecology of
Fear.'' ``There are 1,200 murderers at Calipatria,'' he said,
``half of them baby-faced kids who did drive-bys as 15- or
16-year-olds.''
</P>
<P>
   With the recognition that comes from winning a prestigious
MacArthur Foundation grant, Davis has gotten feelers from several
East Coast universities, but he says he is unlikely to leave Los
Angeles for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``For an activist,'' he said, ``this is the most exciting city
in America.'' The social struggles involving immigrant workers
``will define the trade union movement'' and ``this is where they
are. This is where the kids are who will have to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like New York in 1910,'' he said, ``the place where the
great social dreams of immigrants are being realized.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is also the perverse delight that Davis takes in the
view of Los Angeles that, by his count, has inspired 138 books and
films over the past 90 years. ``No other city,'' he writes, ``seems
to excite such dark rapture.''
</P>
<P>
   The books and films, he said, reflect ``one of the deep
structures of our national personality, the destruction of the evil
city.'' Watching ``Godzilla'' in a small-town movie theater in Utah
last summer, Davis said he ``felt like I was sitting with
Jeffersonian Republicans cheering the destruction of Federalist
Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   But watching local audiences of ``Volcano'' laughing as a flood
of lava consumes the Los Angeles County Museum, he said, ``I felt
proud of Los Angeles, finally developing an underdog sense of
humor.''

FORT WORTH, Texas: staight on end ... 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A lot of this stuff happened around the stairway. I'd
occasionally hear the flipping of pages, just as if someone had
taken a book and flipped the pages with his thumb. If you know that
sound _ frrrippp _ you can recognize it anywhere ...
</P>
<P>
   ``After careful reflection, I've decided that I believe in
ghosts. It's apparent that it has no intention to do any harm to
me. I think we definitely are hosts to a benign ghost.''
</P>
<P>
   YOU'LL NEVER DINE ALONE: The old Jett Building in downtown Fort
Worth's stylish Sundance Square district is known as the ``Chisholm
Trail Building'' because of the mural of a cattle drive painted on
the outside wall. Built in the early years of the century, the
three-story brick edifice was originally the office of the electric
tram utility. Later, it housed a bookstore and a series of
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Unverified reports say it was the site of a suicide in the
1940s, or perhaps a murder, or even multiple murders ...
</P>
<P>
   Mike Leatherwood, who runs several highly successful restaurants
in Dallas and Fort Worth, will remember the location as the site of
two of his eateries that failed within months of opening. ``I just
think the spirits were against us,'' he said. ``Unfortunately,
things were so slow at these restaurants that the hauntings were a
topic of daily conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Jett long had a reputation of being haunted, Mike
was unaware of it when he took possession in early 1994 ...
</P>
<P>
   Mike and Bill White, one of his partners, were moving items from
the basement to the third floor, a cavernous room with boarded
windows that they planned to use for storage. Mike said the only
access to the upper floors was an old wooden stairway. ``It was a
really neat curved stairway, crooked because it was so old,'' he
said. ``I got up to the third floor and it was pitch black ... I
had a really eerie feeling, like someone was watching me.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Bill took an armload of stuff to the top floor,
returning minutes later, severely agitated. ``He said he had to get
out of here,'' Mike recalled. ``And when I asked him why, he said
he had an extremely uncomfortable feeling of having been watched,
of not having been alone. I hadn't told him anything about my
experience.'' Retiring to a nearby restaurant, Mike and Bill were
discussing the strange occurrences when a bartender volunteered
that the building was widely acknowledged to be haunted.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before one of the restaurants opened, Mike said, the
manager worked into the wee hours writing training manuals. ``It
was about 3 a.m.,'' he said. ``She was working in the basement _
our office was in the basement _ when she heard crashing on the
floor above. She went up to investigate, but when she got to the
first floor, the noise was coming from the second floor. And when
she got to the second floor, it had moved to the third floor. We
had put a wire rack up there to store wine glasses that the
previous restaurant had left and that we weren't going to use.
Well, she stood there watching as the wine glasses crashed one by
one to the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most frightening event to occur at the Jett happened
to a young restaurant worker. ``She was in the stall of the women's
restroom (in the basement) changing clothes, and there was a song
on our sound tape that she really liked, so she started singing
along with it. Then she heard laughter coming from the adjoining
stall. She thought it was just another employee laughing at her
singing, but the laughter continued. She finished dressing then
peeked through the cracks in the stall door to see who was in
there. It was empty.''

COWTOWN GHOST STORIES: WHERE THE QUEST BEGINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Ghosts haunt Texas theaters, restaurants,
old homes and graveyards. The apparitions include dog, weeping
women, treasure guardians, hitchhikers and laughing children, as
well as women, usually in blue, who float in doorways and men who
stomp up staircases, sometimes yelling out the news of their
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   So say two Houston Chronicle reporters, modern-day ghostbusters
of sorts who set out to report just-the-facts, ma'am, on modern-day
horror tales in Texas cities. Richard Stewart, the Chronicle's East
Texas bureau chief, and Allan Turner, a roving state reporter,
applied their skills to the search for specters. What did they
find? That they, too, believe in ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Transparent Tales: An Attic Full of Texas Ghosts,''
scheduled for publication by Best of East Texas Press in
mid-November (with statewide distribution through Eakin Press), the
authors share the firsthand stories of businesspeople and lawyers,
university professors, homeowners, a gravedigger and a mother, all
of whom said they have had close encounters of the phantom kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we specifically set out to do was trace down people who
said these things happened to them, and interview them,'' Turner
says. ``We went in with open minds. We came away convinced that
things occur that defy logical explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of Halloween, Turner and Stewart agreed to share a
couple of Fort Worth ghost stories, condensed from their book:
</P>
<P>
   THE GHOST OF BARBER'S BOOKS: Step into the cool, dim recesses of
Barber's Books in a nondescript brick building over on Eighth
Street, and you could be in the 19th century. Sweetly redolent of
aging paper, the Fort Worth store's interior is a tonic for the
senses. Books stacked in disorderly rows line obscure nooks and
crannies. ...
</P>
<P>
   Presiding over the atmospheric chaos is Brian Perkins, who long
ago decided thaty the way to battle discount megachains was to
retreat from the dog-eat-dog world of new-book sales to a
gentlemanly trade in out-of-prints.
</P>
<P>
   Such a place should have a resident ghost. And it does.
</P>
<P>
   Brian and his wife, Larue, have heard a distinct, loud clomping
on the old wooden stairway leading to the third floor. And so have
their employees. ``I lost one worker over it,'' Brian said. ``It
sounded like a 200-pound man walking up the steps in heavy boots.
It was loud and clear. There's no way it was just the building
creaking.''
</P>
<P>
   When Brian bought Barber's, a venerable Fort Worth institution,
in 1960, he found that the landlord had sealed the door to the
third floor with steel plates. Brian unsealed the door to convert
the third floor to a display area. He found 17 rooms, the remnants
of an old walk-up hotel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For much of the building's life _ it was erected in 1908 _ the
third floor had been a fixture in downtown Fort Worth's flourishing
red-light district.
</P>
<P>
   And it was apparently also the stomping grounds of a ghost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most solid manifestation occurred when I was working alone
in the building at 2 or 3 in the morning,'' Brian said. ``Someone
ran up those steps in the back room. There are 20 steps leading to
the third floor, but I just heard six, seven or eight _ bong, bong,
bong ...
</P>
<P>
   Brian's first ghostly encounter occurred about 1965. The most
recent was in the autumn of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Sunday mornings, there's no traffic downtown, and you can
hear everything. It was a little before noon when I heard the
distinct sound of boxes being shoved around on the third floor.''
Going to investigate, Brian peered up at the top floor's door,
which, fitting loosely in its frame, shed light into the gloomy
stairway at its edges. ``Light was coming from around the door, but
it was being interrupted as if someone were moving around in here.
My hair stood straight on end ...

FIRING OF POLICE OFFICER FOR WEARING CROSS STIRS CONTROVERSY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF PRINCE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ National civil rights groups with vastly
different stances are taking interest in an Arlington police
officer who was fired in September for refusing to remove a small
cross from his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The interest could increase attendance at an appeal hearing Nov.
9, when former Sgt. George Daniels is expected to ask for
reinstatement to the Arlington Police Department where he worked 13
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Rutherford Institute, which has assisted Paula Jones in her
sexual harassment lawsuit against President Clinton, has agreed to
assist Daniels. The institute is prepared to seek court action if
Daniels is not reinstated after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on how that comes down, we will have to make a
decision on whether to file in federal or state court, but we will
be proceeding in court if we have to,'' said Jennifer Schans, an
attorney and regional coordinator for the Rutherford Institute,
which provides assistance in civil liberty and religious
discrimination cases nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise to some observers that the Virginia-based
group, which solicits donations, is pursuing the Daniels incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a law firm that agrees with people like Jerry Falwell
and Pat Robertson _ far to the religious right,'' said Robert
Boston, assistant director of communications with Americans United
for Separation of Church and State. ``It is a greater fund-raising
gimmick than it is a great legal case.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels said he does not wish to discuss the matter with
reporters and has asked attorneys to respond to questions, Schans
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials are referring inquiries to the city attorney's
office, which will represent Arlington in the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara G. Heptig, assistant city attorney, said the Nov. 9
hearing concerns a decision to fire an officer based on city
policy, a decision the city backs.
</P>
<P>
   No one complained about the cross on Daniels' collar, she said.
</P>
<P>
   National groups differ on whether a cross pin violates free
speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be offensive if Mr. Daniels starting telling a person
about Christ if someone says, `I don't want to hear about it,' ''
Schans said. ``There is a possibility that there is someone out
there that might be offended by the cross, but that doesn't take
away from Mr. Daniels' constitutional right to wear a cross.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rutherford Institute would also assist a police officer
fired for wearing a symbol of the antichrist, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not want to see that, but that is constitutionally
allowed, to wear that pin,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A government official such as a uniformed police officer makes a
declaration of belief and possible bias by wearing a religious
symbol that could intimidate someone with differing beliefs, Boston
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine if you were Jewish, Hindu, Muslim or whatever,''
Boston said. ``They might feel uncomfortable. You're not neutral
when your wearing a cross on your collar.''
</P>
<P>
   Events leading to the dismissal can be traced through a number
of memorandums.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels met with Police Chief David Kunkle on July 1 and asked
for permission to wear the cross. Kunkle rejected the request, but
Daniels continued to wear it.
</P>
<P>
   Kunkle wrote in a memo dated Aug. 10 that he had not authorized
nondepartment pins other than ones that promote programs in which
the city or police have participated.
</P>
<P>
   Kunkle offered Daniels several alternatives, including wearing a
ring or bracelet to depict the religious symbol, wearing a pin
under a uniform shirt or on the underside of a collar, or
transferring to a nonuniformed position.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels continued to wear the cross on his uniform. On Aug. 24,
Kunkle wrote another memo stating that he would proceed with formal
disciplinary action ``up to and including termination.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels touts his record with the department in a Sept. 10 memo
to the internal affairs division, including his recognition as
Rookie of the Year and Officer of the Year. He has also served as a
field training officer, patrol supervisor, accreditation manager,
detective supervisor and internal affairs investigator, a
nonuniformed position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to emphasize that I have nothing but the utmost respect
for Chief Kunkle,'' Daniels wrote. ``However, I am subject to a
Higher Authority, the Lord Jesus Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   In his eight-page memo, Daniels includes 143 references from the
Bible, references that he says support his decision to wear a
cross.
</P>
<P>
   Police Department policy states that ``no button, badge, medal
or similar symbol or item not listed in this General Order will be
worn on the uniform unless approved by the Police Chief in writing
on an individual basis.''
</P>
<P>
   An internal investigation ruled that Daniels violated the
department's uniform policy and was insubordinate for not complying
with Kunkle's order to remove the pin.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Marathon runner Ricky Cox hopes to be a
winner in this weekend's New York Marathon by slowing down. A
three-time winner of Fort Worth's Cowtown Marathon, Cox, 39, said
he ran the 1983 Boston Marathon in 2 hours, 17 minutes, a time
bordering on world class. Now he figures he'll be a winner in New
York if he finishes the 26.2 miles in 3 hours. This time, he's not
just running. He's serving as a guide for Mike Royal, a runner from
north Fort Worth who also happens to be blind. By PAUL BOURGEOIS.

</P>
<P>
   Equipment: Hubbard squash, bandanna, black felt, acrylic paint
in black and white, black marker, fine-tip paintbrush.
</P>
<P>
   Directions: Turn the squash so the stem becomes the nose. Using
pins, tack the scarf down and tie in the back. Cut out eye patch
and long, narrow piece of felt to secure it. Tack both pieces onto
squash with needles. With the marker, outline a mouth and eyes.
With a fine-tip paintbrush, paint the black lines. Allow to dry.
Fill in with the white paint.

</P>
<P>
   Equipment: Acorn squash, black spray paint, construction paper,
glue, paper clips, needles, fake fur.
</P>
<P>
   Spray-paint the squash, using masking tape to cover the stems.
It will take more than one coat. Allow to dry thoroughly between
coats. For less than 2 bucks, you can purchase fake fur for the
ears. Trim out ear shapes and attach with pins. For the whiskers,
unbend paper clips or any other malleable wire and trim into
different lengths. Acorn squash are very hard; do not try to
puncture with wire. With large sewing needles and thimble, create
holes near stem for whiskers. Squash will ooze a bit of liquid.
Wipe clean and insert whisker wires. Cut eyes out of construction
paper and glue to face.

</P>
<P>
   Directions: Spray-paint the squash with white matte paint. It
will probably take a couple of coats _ allow each coat to dry
thoroughly. With a pencil, draw face on squash, then use a black
marker to make the permanent outline. Finish by filling in with
black paint.

GREAT GOURDS: THINK OF SQUASH AS THE NEW PUMPKIN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Scare up a squash for Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the same old pumpkin, try some other vegetables of
the vine-growing sort. Turn a Hubbard into a patch-wearing pirate,
an acorn into a kitty cat and a butternut into a bottom-heavy
goblin.
</P>
<P>
   While you're at it, pick up extra squash for some delightful
fall fare. One to decorate, one to eat. Now there's one-stop
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   SQUASH AND CIDER SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6
</P>
<P>
   1 butternut squash, about 1 1/2 pounds
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, peeled and minced
</P>
<P>
   1 cup vegetable or chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   2 cups apple cider (approximately)
</P>
<P>
   Fine sea salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   With a vegetable peeler, peel the squash from top to bottom.
With a large, heavy knife, cut it in half lengthwise. Discard the
seeds. Cut the two halves in half lengthwise, and then cut across
to make large cubes. There should be about 4 cups.
</P>
<P>
   Swirl olive oil in the bottom of a large, heavy pot. Add onion
and garlic, and cook slowly until soft, about 5 minutes. Add squash
cubes, stock and 1 cup of cider. Cover and cook over medium heat
until the squash is very tender, about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Uncover, remove pot from heat and let rest 10 minutes. In a food
processor, puree the mixture, in 2 batches if necessary. Return the
mixture to the pot, and whisk in up to 1 cup of the remaining
cider, thinning mixture to desired consistency. Season well with
salt and pepper. Heat again until very hot, divide among 6 soup
bowls and serve. (Soup can be made in advance and frozen, or
refrigerated overnight and reheated before serving.)
</P>
<P>
   Variations: Just before it is served, the soup can be
embellished with a little dry mustard, cayenne pepper, sour cream,
yogurt or creme fraiche to taste. The soup can also be served in a
mug, with a cinnamon stick for stirring.

   PUREED BUTTERNUT SQUASH WITH GINGER
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds butternut squash, peeled and cut into chunks
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 teaspoons peeled and roughly chopped fresh ginger or 1
teaspoon ground ginger, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon brown sugar, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Place squash in steamer above about 1 inch of salted water.
Cover and cook until squash is very tender, about 20 minutes. To
microwave, place squash and 2 tablespoons water in a
microwave-proof plate or shallow bowl; cover with lid or plastic
wrap. Microwave on high for 3 minutes, shake container and continue
to microwave at 2-minute intervals, until squash is very tender.
</P>
<P>
   While it's still hot, place squash in container of food
processor with butter and ginger; process until smooth. Taste and
add salt, pepper and brown sugar if you like. You may prepare
recipe in advance up this point; refrigerate, well-wrapped or in
covered container, for up to 2 days before proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Reheat over low heat or in microwave and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Flavor variations: A seeded jalapeno or other chile; small
handful of fresh herbs, including parsley, cilantro, mint and sage;
maple syrup or honey in place of brown sugar; olive oil in place of

A NEIGHBORHOOD HERO; THE ABSENT FATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON BASS
 &HT;    c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   By the age of 6 or 7, most children grow heartily sick of
Barney, as evidenced by the wicked parodies my son and his friends
used to sing about the purple dinosaur and his mind-numbing show.
But for some mysterious reason, the same pre-adolescent kids never
seem to make fun of Mister Rogers, who has been inviting children
into his television neighborhood for 31 years and is an anachronism
if there ever was one.
</P>
<P>
   In an ambitious issue on heroes, the November  &UR; Esquire  &LR; attempts
to explain why that is so. Some of the stories fall flat _ how,
after all, do you make a hero out of a vigilante who disarmed a
teenager and then shot him with his own gun? But Tom Junod's piece
on Fred Rogers manages to show, amid some unnecessarily intrusive
glimpses into Rogers's private life, why the 70-year-old public
television icon remains so valued, not only by children, but by
street-smart teenagers and jaded parents alike. Children are often
the first to see through hypocrisy, and as Junod illustrates with a
series of telling vignettes, they know Rogers is the real article.
A deeply religious man, Rogers truly does believe, according to
Junod, that children _ no matter how disturbed, disabled, or angry
_ are close to God. And wearing the same cardigan sweater and
sneakers day in and day out _ in defiance of the neon pulse and
``dizzying'' MTVism of television _ Rogers manages to convey that
message to children of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   A few other hero pieces are worth reading as well, notably the
one about Richard Jewell. Not many of us, at first glance, would
consider Jewell a hero _ he's more a victim of FBI ineptitude than
anything else _ but this article will change that perception and
make readers a lot more understanding of what Jewell, who was
unfairly labeled as a suspect in the Atlanta Olympics bombing, has
gone through. There is one gaping hole: Author Sara Corbett never
reminds us what Jewell, a security guard in Centennial Olympic Park
the night of the explosions, did that made him a hero. He
discovered the knapsack containing a trio of bombs and quickly
moved people away minutes before they exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the article about Conrad Muhammed, a Nation of
Islam minister and prodigy of Louis Farrakhan before he was
unceremoniously dumped, is more thorough. Muhammed, now a
charismatic but penniless student at Harvard Divinity School, does
not come across as your garden-variety hero; the piece, though,
borders on the heroic in the un-PC way it reveals just how far
Farrakhan is willing to go to eliminate those who might someday
challenge his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the issue of growing up fatherless strongly resonates in
the black community, which explains why the November  &UR; Essence  &LR; 
devotes space to it, fatherless families are a heartache that
stretches across every ethnic group. In ``Daddy Hunger,'' Diane
Weathers writes movingly about how she was abandoned ``by the very
first man in my life'' and how it has affected her relationships
with other men.
</P>
<P>
   Weathers also points out that ``a father's presence in a girl's
life doesn't necessarily guarantee that (a father's) love will be
there.'' For that reason, her piece will speak to many women,
regardless of their family or ethnic background. And the magazine's
Q&AMP;A with three specialists is a good follow to Weathers's
first-person piece; it offers solid advice to all women whose
fathers may not have been there for them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While that kind of insight might be expected in Essence, the
most popular magazine for black women, it comes as a surprise in
 &UR; The Atlantic Monthly &LR; , which is not known for its women-oriented
offerings. And although most of the articles in the Atlantic's
November issue are true to form, including its cover feature _ a
disorganized and not particularly compelling look at Jack Kerouac's
papers _ tucked in the ``personal file'' column is a beautifully
evocative piece about a woman whose nonagenarian mother has lost
her mind. The story, by Lynn Freed, encapsules a daughter's attempt
to communicate with her mother across the divide of senility. For
anyone with an aging but beloved mother, it is a powerful, almost
haunting read.
</P>
<P>
   Far more haunting and difficult to read is the piece by
Holocaust scholar and retired Simmons professor Lawrence Langer on
the disturbing trend these days to look for some kind of purpose in
the Holocaust. Doing so, Langer argues, ``leads nowhere but back
into the pit of destruction.'' Langer's thoughtful denunciation of
attempts by Christian theologian Frans Jozef van Beek and artist
Judy Chicago, among others, to universalize the Holocaust is
difficult not only because of his somewhat pompous intellectual
tone, but because of the examples of atrocities he includes to
bolster his point. But his argument is well worth reading even so.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Life  &LR; magazine has compiled a surprisingly witty list of 100
things that Americans have to be thankful for, as Thanksgiving
approaches. Items range from the obvious (No.3: We are not at war)
to the trivial (No.38: There is one less Spice Girl now) to the
thought-provoking (No.15: The families of the switched babies _
Callie Conley and Rebecca Chittum _ acted in the best interests of
the children by leaving them in their respective homes). As we head
into the midterm elections and the impeachment proceedings, the
Life piece is positively cheering.

A FAMILY TREE THAT'S ROOTED IN CRANBERRIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHERYL JULIAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH HARWICH, Mass. _ Standing outside a warehouse once used by
hundreds of local cranberry growers, Alan Hall can hardly finish a
sentence. A pickup truck driving down Depot Street honks loudly as
the driver waves hello.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, another car honks, then another pickup, and more
and more vehicles, county workers, state trucks, and ordinary
citizens _ all flying down a road flanked by cranberry bogs.
``Guess I pretty much know everyone who drives down this street,''
says Hall with an accent that sounds like northern Maine but that
he insists is typical mid-Cape.
</P>
<P>
   Alan John Hall, 27, grew up on this street and spent his whole
life here, the son, grandson, and great-grandson of cranberry
growers. Since the family's arrival on the mid-Cape around 1650,
every Hall has raised cranberries, and even though some didn't farm
full time, ``it wasn't a big deal to have 10 acres,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His own family lived on 33 acres. All but two are gone now, and
Hall cultivates those. Two acres of cranberry bog that were dormant
for 15 years are rebuilt and flourishing. They are harvested the
old way, mechanically and without water, so that almost every
single berry picked from the bogs is in mint condition and can be
sold fresh. Hall moved his four-year-old business into the
warehouse this fall as its first lessee, set up a collection of
antique equipment to demonstrate cranberry sorting, learned the
names of every major figure in Cape cranberry history, and waited
for customers to come.
</P>
<P>
   The lucky are arriving slowly. Usually they're stopping by on a
ride along the bicycle path that runs behind the old warehouse,
which was once owned by Ocean Spray cranberries and used by its
cooperative growers as a ``screening house.''
</P>
<P>
   The screening process _ removing bad berries by hand from the
thousands of picked berries _ was done by women who sat at tables
for hours at a time. Old photographs suggest a scene ripe for an
``I Love Lucy'' episode, but this was serious work and important to
the locals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This building was a big source of income for people here,''
says Maura McKenna, Hall's girlfriend and partner in this venture.
``If you lived on the Cape, everyone had something to do with the
screening house.''
</P>
<P>
   After Ocean Spray sold the warehouse, it stayed empty for 30
years, in such disrepair that North Harwich fire trucks positioned
themselves there on Halloween night. The old place was an obvious
target for mischievous trick-or-treaters.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Bojanowski, who rehabilitates rundown buildings around the
country, bought the warehouse with a partner for $300,000 and began
replacing all the broken windows, pulling clusters of mushrooms off
the damp wood floors, peeling back the rotting roof shingles, and
posting signs to announce space for rent. The work continues and
Bojanowski still uncovers memories of another time, like the
announcement written with chalk on a wall. ``Quiet,'' it reads.
``Last berry Nov. 10, 1954, 10:20 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the last berry ever, explains Bojanowski, simply the
last of that year's harvest. In fact, the warehouse continued to
process berries until 1968. Perhaps it was the tradition for the
worker who handled the close of harvest to note that on a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and McKenna watched the place assume some of its old grace.
``I've been watching it all my life,'' he says. Then he saw the
``space for rent'' sign and came up with the idea of a retail
outlet.
</P>
<P>
   The trains are gone from Depot Street. Railroad cars transported
barrels of berries off the Cape. Hall knows exactly where the
station used to be. ``Right there,'' he says, pointing to a row of
pine trees.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving passengers were bound for Chatham Bars Inn in Chatham,
which was a hunting lodge, and the Belmont in West Harwich. ``They
were people who had money,'' Hall says, including Henry Ford.
</P>
<P>
   When Ford once found himself without a room in North Harwich
before his trip to Chatham, &UR;  &LR; says Hall, ``he stayed one night with
my great-great-grandmother, Ida Kay Chase.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall is the bearer of the family legend.
</P>
<P>
   Another legend involves his ancestor Henry Hall, who cultivated
the first cranberry vines in Dennis around 1816. Before that date,
they had only grown wild. ``Hall's role as pioneer of cranberry
cultivation remains unchallenged,'' according to ``Cranberry
Harvest: A History of Cranberry Growing in Massachusetts,'' edited
by Joseph D. Thomas (Spinner Publications, 1990).
</P>
<P>
   So Alan Hall comes to his cranberry business naturally. He was
quite young when his father, Arthur H. Hall, was diagnosed with
multiple sclerosis and 12 when the illness prevented the older Hall
from cultivating berries. He owned some of his 33 acres, leased
others, and held onto some he could give his children. Those are
the 2 acres Hall now cultivates.
</P>
<P>
   An acre of bog yields about 150 barrels of cranberries (100
pounds per barrel), which gives Hall 30,000 pounds total. He sells
a pound for $1.50 retail (about 95 cents wholesale).
</P>
<P>
   Because his berries are dry harvested rather than the more
common water-reel method _ in which the bog is flooded before the
berries are picked _ Hall gets more money. Dry harvest berries,
used for cooking and baking, are in higher demand than wet-harvest
berries, which are processed into juices and other byproducts the
industry created a demand for in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Dry harvesting yields fewer barries. Whatever his harvest, Hall
loses 20 percent of the crop on the bog, berries that drop off the
picking machines. ``It's a natural compost that goes back into the
soil,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't use water because ``I don't have the adequate water
supply, I only have a well. I want to do fresh fruit anyway,'' he
says. That means he doesn't have to deal with processors. Fresh
fruit stays well for 1 1/2 months in a cool, ventilated place.
</P>
<P>
   Hall is miffed that berries grown off-Cape are labeled and
shipped as a Cape Cod product. Off-Cape, explains Hall, encompasses
any town on the west side of the canal. There are major commercial
bogs between Wareham and Buzzards Bay, along Route 28, a road
commonly known as ``cranberry highway.''
</P>
<P>
   You get the feeling that Hall never crosses the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do,'' he says, ``but I don't have to because everything's
down here. I'm from the old school, for a young guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Off-Cape berries taste different, he says. His mother, Carolyn
Hall, agrees. ``They're all good,'' she begins, ``but it's the same
way you get a lobster on the Cape or one from Maine. The ground is
all sand here. The natural climate, the ocean's spray. Here, the
cranberry is tart.''
</P>
<P>
   With only 2 acres, Alan Hall had to keep his day job. He works
as building and grounds supervisor for the Harwich school
department. Even working full time, he couldn't touch the cost of
bog land anywhere on the Cape.
</P>
<P>
   ``An acre of bog costs $30,000 to $45,000,'' he explains, ``and
you should have 5 acres of upland around it. That's land other than
bog land,'' which protects the bog. An acre of &UR;  &LR; upland costs more _
about $55,000 _ because most of it is sold to developers. That
land, he says, ``is getting rare.''
</P>
<P>
   His parcel, which includes upland, comes to 9 acres.
</P>
<P>
   To start his venture, Hall received a $30,000 grant from
Barnstable County Extension Service in 1994. He pays his parents $1
a year plus the taxes on the land. Together they wrote up a 10-year
lease ``to make it legal,'' says Hall. He has to repay only 25
percent of the grant after the second crop, which will be a year
from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could flood the bog and get 5 to 10 more barrels of
cranberries,'' he says, but that wouldn't give him fresh fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, he went to pick up an old cranberry
separator, in which good berries bounce down a flight of wooden
steps (called ``bounce boards'') and bad berries roll into a rot
box. It seems incredible at first, until Hall explains that a good
berry bounces because it's hollow, while bad berries plop and roll
away.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted the separator so he could show people how it worked.
The new ones, with electric motors, are only marginally more
sophisticated and efficient.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Cleaning out the separator, he found a surprise. Inside the
hopper was the rubber stamp that his father and mother used decades
ago to label the crate of berries they shipped out. Large letters,
crimson from the ink pad it was dipped into for years, read:
``Hall's Cape Cod Cranberries, North Harwich, Mass.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, I kept asking you, `Where's the stamp?''' says his
mother. ``I don't know how it got into the separator. I can't
believe it.'' She gazes at the stamp, flooded with memories. ``It's
nice to have it back.''

   MARTHA-STEWART (New York) _ Armed with little more than a sheaf
of recipes, a glue gun, some dried flowers and a puritanical zeal
for modern homekeeping, Martha Stewart has built a $200 million
multimedia empire. Thus, it comes as no surprise that pretenders
are cropping up thicker than sprouts on a chia pet. Haunted by Ms.
Stewart's success and eager to promote their own domains, seven

All those blenders, mixers, grinders and other appliances serve as
gods _ mechanical lares and penates of the American home. Now the
godjets have been joined by another class of quasi-mythical
devices: spoons and spatulas, and salt and pepper shakers that look
like satyrs and nymphs, fauns and elves. Personified pourers and
peelers that are shaped to look animate are dancing and leaping

   NY-BRONX-GARDEN (Undated) _ There's a proud green serpent of
vegetables undulating over the grass at Wave Hill, the public
garden in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, known for its
imagination and unusual plants. I'd never seen columnar basil
before, for instance, until I saw it last week, marching along the
inner curves of an S-shaped fence that formed the backbone of this

called Dynamo, and red kale stands a good four feet over

SOME EQUITIES NO   LONGER SO SPECIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They were a quirky collection of small stocks with big plans
assembled by mutual fund manager Michael DiCarlo: One ran
fiber-optic communications networks, another sold cheescakes, a
third helped New York City cabbies finance the buying of their
medallions.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks, about 90 overall, made up the portfolio of John
Hancock Special Equities, a leading small company fund through much
of the 1990s that began to struggle two years ago. But things
changed in a big way after Hancock replaced DiCarlo with Laura J.
Allen as the new lead manager on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Allen decided what she wanted to keep and the rest went on the
block, from the start of July through September. What would have
been a tricky portfolio adjustment at any time turned into a
treacherous trading experience because the market for small stocks
suffered one of its worst quarters of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   When no one wanted small company shares, Special Equities was
putting millions of them up for sale. ``Clearly, this has been very
challenging for us,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Special Equities appeared to suffer from the shift, at
least in the short run. It lost more ground than even the
pulverized small-stock indexes; three weeks ago, its year-to-date
loss was within a whisker of 40 percent. The loss had been pared to
24 percent as of Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who owned some of the same stocks held by Special
Equities clearly felt the short-term effect of the fund's action.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Infinium Software Inc. of Hyannis had noticed
something odd in July, just after they announced record quarterly
revenue and profits that soared 300 percent: Their stock started to
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' said Daniel Kossman, the company's
chief financial officer. ``We had just reported a great quarter.
They were basically liquidating and it was driving our stock price
down.''
</P>
<P>
   But it turned out to be a good move for Special Equities
shareholders. Infinium couldn't meet forecasts for the following
quarter, and the stock plunged, two months after the fund sold.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock declined to identify individual stocks sold by Special
Equities since the summer. But a review of the fund's publicly
disclosed portfolio as of April 30 and the aggregate investment
changes by all of Hancock's mutual funds during the third quarter
fill in most of the details. Aggregate Hancock figures were a good
proxy for activity within Special Equities during the quarter
because the company's other funds rarely owned the same stocks in
bulk, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Allen appears to have sold at least 20 million shares of small
company stocks in her inherited portfolio during the quarter.
Special Equities eliminated positions in nearly three dozen
companies, most of which counted the fund as one of their largest
institutional investors, according to our estimates. Special
Equities had been one of the three largest mutual fund shareholders
in 31 instances; 15 of those had counted it as their largest fund
investor.
</P>
<P>
   Special Equities seems to have sold all of its 350,000 fixing
chartshares of Infinium Software. The fund also appears to have
eliminated positions in a few better-known companies, like its
million shares of San Francisco brokerage Hambrecht &AMP; Quist Group.
But mostly it sold stakes of 300,000 to 600,000 shares in
less-familiar names like Aviation Sales Co., Correctional Services
Corp., and Guitar Center Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said she and other comanagers targeted stocks that they
considered to have risky profit outlooks. The idea: When small
stocks finally regain investor interest, the companies on the most
solid footing will rebound highest.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said Hancock traders were conscious of the problems posed
by selling large blocks of small stocks, particularly shares of
companies that had just disappointed investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these companies reported earnings in July that were
much worse than we expected,'' she said. ``We were very careful in
disengaging in these positions. We did not want to completely sell
at any price.''
</P>
<P>
   But how do you get out of a 500,000-share position of a stock
that trades 50,000 shares on an average day, even if there is no
bad news affecting the company? With difficulty, sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers for Special Equities began to seek buyers for the fund's
500,000-share block of Affiliated Managers Group of Boston in
mid-August, according to people familiar with the stock's trading
activity. There were no takers right away, and soon it became
widely known that a big seller was trying to move stock. The
shares, which had traded at 24 in mid-August, fell to 15 15/16 on
Sept. 9, the one day trading volume soared and 572,500 AMG shares
changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   The stock started to move up the next day and finished Tuesday
at 21 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Allen didn't sell all the old Special Equities stocks. The
cabbie financier, Medallion Financial Corp., is still in the
portfolio. So is Family Golf Centers Inc., CareMatrix Corp., and
American Italian Pasta Co., by our reading.
</P>
<P>
   Special Equities has also added about as many new stocks as it
has sold. Among the new names: Duane Reade, a New York drug store
chain; technology outsourcing specialist Whitmann-Hart Inc.; and
Alkermes Inc., a Cambridge biotechnology company.

TWO NEW MAGAZINES ON THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The women's version of Sports Illustrated is on hold, and Conde
Nast's Sports for Women has absorbed and then become Women's Sports
and Fitness while cutting back to six issues a year. But that isn't
stopping Amy Love or Nancy Levin from putting two new women's
sports magazines on the launchpad.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary: Because they're willing to start small and
eager to skip the tips on beauty and fashion, both women see their
publications as serving a market that has yet to be tapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a women's magazine that does some sports, we're a
sports magazine for women,'' says Levin, whose magazine, Wsports,
is expected to debut in March, with two more issues in 1999 before
it goes bimonthly in 2000. ``We're going to be 100 percent about
women's sports, pure and simple. There's a big need for that, a big
demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin, who co-founded and captained the women's varsity soccer
team at Harvard before earning her master's degree in business from
Yale in 1987, has been publishing Women's Sports Connection, a San
Francisco area newsletter, since 1993. Wsports is an outgrowth of
the positive response to that publication, which features lists of
resources and calendars of local events in addition to news and
features.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at the real, authentic market: the people who
are participants, the people who are fans,'' says Levin, the
magazine's publisher and editor-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Real Sports, which will publish its inaugural issue
in December before going bimonthly in June and then monthly in
2000, aims at the serious sports market. Where it diverges from
Wsports is in its focus on team sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the growth in the marketplace, that's where
there is a huge groundswell of fan involvement and participation,''
says Love, who holds a master's in business administration from
Harvard and began last year to pursue her vision of a women's
sports magazine.
</P>
<P>
   It was a goal she set even before the breakthrough for women's
team sports at the 1996 Olympics. ``I made the decision while the
passion was there, but I couldn't make the numbers work yet, so I
put in on hold,'' says Love, who will publish out of San Jose. ``I
didn't feel it was time to lay out our playbook.'' But after she
saw the early efforts of Sports Illustrated and Conde Nast, she
felt reenergized. ``They chose to go after different market
segments,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Love has no doubt there is room for both magazines. ``This is a
market segment that has been just painfully ignored,'' she says.
``There is huge potential for a whole host of magazines.''

RIGHT, LEFT CRITICIZE FONG OVER HOMOSEXUAL ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Filed in the national news, ``a,'' category and political
news, ``p,'' category)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the final days of his race for U.S. Senate in
California, Republican Matt Fong's stance on gay rights has become
a dominant concern.
</P>
<P>
   The hubbub over Fong's recent contribution to an avowedly
anti-homosexual organization is delighting incumbent Sen. Barbara
Boxer and her fellow Democrats, who see the issue distracting Fong
and dividing Republicans before Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was kicked up again Tuesday as religious
conservatives, led by a Sacramento lobbying group, attacked Fong,
the state treasurer, for pledging to support what it called a
``homosexual agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a candidate to cave in to the gay activists in the final
days of the campaign shows a complete lack of conviction,'' Michael
Bowman, executive director of the Capitol Resource Institute, said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism came a day after Fong signed a pledge to support
gay causes such as benefits for domestic partners and
anti-discrimination laws, part of an effort by Fong to quell the
anger of gay Republicans over his $50,000 contribution to the
Traditional Values Coalition, which is led by the Rev. Lou Sheldon.
</P>
<P>
   The national Log Cabin Republicans, a gay group, reaffirmed its
support for Fong. But the San Francisco chapter of the organization
withdrew its endorsement, citing Fong's link to Sheldon, an ardent
gay-rights opponent who at one time suggested quarantining people
with AIDS in ``cities of refuge.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate has pitted religious conservatives, who are active in
Republican politics, against gay and socially moderate Republicans,
who want the party to take a softer line on issues of concern to
gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   And Fong, who has sought to find a centrist position, finds
himself being attacked by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raiser in the Chinatown section of San Francisco
Tuesday night, Fong said he would be a ``unifier'' and bring the
state together, but steered clear of any direct mention of the
controversy over his donation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a tremendous state made up of diversity,'' Fong told
300 supporters at the $200-per-person event. ``America is a great
country because we've always chosen hope over fear. We've always
chosen unity over division.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fong was less than eager to face questions related to his
$50,000 contribution. He canceled a public event and avoided
reporters at the Chinatown fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Fong spokesman Steve Schmidt said the candidate wasn't worried
about losing votes, either from gay Republicans or conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservatives have been with us from the beginning and will
continue to be with us,'' Schmidt said. ``No one has pulled their
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman, however, criticized Fong for agreeing to support
domestic partnerships, or unions of unmarried people, which he said
promote homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the leading candidates both support the homosexual
agenda to weaken families and society, conservative voters don't
have much of a choice on Election Day,'' Bowman said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials have tried to capitalize on the
division in the Fong camp. On Monday, Democratic strategist Bob
Mulholland faxed to gay groups around the state the story of Fong's
$50,000 contribution. On Tuesday, when Fong pledged his support for
gay issues, Mulholland faxed the story to Christian radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets squeezed on this issue,'' Mulholland said. ``Here it
is the last week, and this is what he's talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party officials tried to downplay the issue, which
they described as a fringe struggle between GOP groups that will
never agree on a common agenda on gay issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think voters believe there are more important issues,'' said
Mike Madrid, political director for the Republican Party. ``The
people who this concerns made up their minds years ago.''

RIGHT, LEFT CRITICIZE FONG OVER HOMOSEXUAL ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the final days of his race for U.S. Senate in
California, Republican Matt Fong's stance on gay rights has become
a dominant concern.
</P>
<P>
   The hubbub over Fong's recent contribution to an avowedly
anti-homosexual organization is delighting incumbent Sen. Barbara
Boxer and her fellow Democrats, who see the issue distracting Fong
and dividing Republicans before Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was kicked up again Tuesday as religious
conservatives, led by a Sacramento lobbying group, attacked Fong,
the state treasurer, for pledging to support what it called a
``homosexual agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a candidate to cave in to the gay activists in the final
days of the campaign shows a complete lack of conviction,'' Michael
Bowman, executive director of the Capitol Resource Institute, said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism came a day after Fong signed a pledge to support
gay causes such as benefits for domestic partners and
anti-discrimination laws, part of an effort by Fong to quell the
anger of gay Republicans over his $50,000 contribution to the
Traditional Values Coalition, which is led by the Rev. Lou Sheldon.
</P>
<P>
   The national Log Cabin Republicans, a gay group, reaffirmed its
support for Fong. But the San Francisco chapter of the organization
withdrew its endorsement, citing Fong's link to Sheldon, an ardent
gay-rights opponent who at one time suggested quarantining people
with AIDS in ``cities of refuge.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate has pitted religious conservatives, who are active in
Republican politics, against gay and socially moderate Republicans,
who want the party to take a softer line on issues of concern to
gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   And Fong, who has sought to find a centrist position, finds
himself being attacked by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raiser in the Chinatown section of San Francisco
Tuesday night, Fong said he would be a ``unifier'' and bring the
state together, but steered clear of any direct mention of the
controversy over his donation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a tremendous state made up of diversity,'' Fong told
300 supporters at the $200-per-person event. ``America is a great
country because we've always chosen hope over fear. We've always
chosen unity over division.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fong was less than eager to face questions related to his
$50,000 contribution. He canceled a public event and avoided
reporters at the Chinatown fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Fong spokesman Steve Schmidt said the candidate wasn't worried

RIGHT THIS WAY FOR WYATT-STYLE CORN-BREAD DRESSING

<TEXT>
<P>
   Men. First they won't ask for directions and, apparently, now
they're too shy to ask for recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Mencke writes, saying that he loves the corn-bread
dressing served at Wyatt's Cafeterias.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised eating at Wyatt's at least a couple of times a
week. Whenever they had turkey and dressing, I ordered it,'' Chuck
writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work out in Burleson, and we have a lunchtime caterer who
makes turkey and dressing. When I tasted her dressing, I knew it
was Wyatt's. I asked her about it, and she told me her
father-in-law had worked for Wyatt's for years, and he had taught
her how to make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have the nerve to ask her for the recipe, but if you
call her,'' Chuck writes, ``I'd love to have the recipe.''
</P>
<P>
   This reminds me of the time my husband and I were lost in
Bavaria. Instead of stopping to ask someone for directions, Mr.
Fluent-in-German stopped the car and sent me up to a farmhouse to
ask directions. Not only could I not ask the questions, I had not a
clue what the kind Herr was saying in response.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Chuck, I did call Dolly Fore, owner of Dolly's
Tamales in Burleson, and she was kind enough to send this recipe.
She learned it as a newlywed from Robert Lee Fore.

THE GREAT CONDUCTOR'S ALLEGRO LIFE

   Leonard Bernstein: Reaching for the Notes
</P>
<P>
   Director: Susan Lacy
</P>
<P>
   Rated: TVPG
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Leonard Bernstein: Reaching for the Note'' depicts its subject
as composer for Broadway, Hollywood, the opera house, and concert
hall; conductor; pianist; television educator; student; colleague;
teacher and mentor; supporter of Israel and liberal causes; son,
brother, husband, father, lover, friend; conflicted, tormented, and
triumphant self.
</P>
<P>
   That's quite a tall order for two hours of television, and
director Susan Lacy's film sometimes spreads itself too thin, like
Bernstein himself. After a somewhat confusing beginning, ``Reaching
for the Note'' is mostly chronological; presumably in order to get
to the popular stuff first, Bernstein is depicted as a conducting
star and a Broadway composer before we see him as a student at
Tanglewood, Mass. Most of the achievements are there, but there's
no time for anything about his work in the opera house _ yet
everything Bernstein did could be analzyed in terms of musical
theater. The film repeatedly captures him in his most frenzied and
grandiose moments on the podium _ yet he perhaps was a better
conductor of Haydn than of Mahler, genial, earthy, and spiritual.
Most of the major biographical issues also come up _ his conflict
with his father; his marriage and family; his complicated sexual
identity; his reckless living, rapid aging, and death. A few
attempts to read the creative work as pure autobiography are
feeble, but the life really was the work.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the film there are comments by people who knew
Bernstein well, including his brother, Burton, and his three
children, Jamie Bernstein Thomas, Nina Bernstein, and Alexander
Bernstein; with colleagues in his professional achievements (Betty
Comden and Adolph Green from the first carefree musical comedies;
Stephen Sondheim, Arthur Laurents, Jerome Robbins, and Carol
Lawrence from ``West Side Story''; Barbara Cook from ``Candide'');
performers such as Isaac Stern, Christa Ludwig, Jerry Hadley, and
Thomas Hampson; composers Lukas Foss, Harold Shapero, and John
Corigliano; conductors Seiji Ozawa, Andre Previn; Michael Tilson
Thomas and John Mauceri; members of orchestras in Vienna, Israel,
and New York; even a couple of critics. It is touching to hear the
voice of mezzo-soprano Jennie Tourel, one of Bernstein's closest
musical friends, on the soundtrack, even though it is not
identified. The most revealing voice is that of Bernstein himself,
the sound of an irresistible and overwhelming personality, which is
heard not only in rehearsal excerpts, television sequences, and
interviews, but also in an actor's reading of notes and diaries,
and in the memories of his friends (``If you are going to fall off
a ladder,'' Sondheim remembers Bernstein saying, ``fall off a high
rung'').
</P>
<P>
   Only Bernstein's children, Sondheim, and Laurents are permitted
to get beyond the sound-bite level. The involvement of the
Bernstein family also means that some issues are handled gingerly.
It is admitted that Bernstein was always a controversial figure,
but it is never quite clear what the controversies were about, or
that any criticism might have been about anything that mattered.
Inevitably ``Reaching for the Note'' is more about personality than
about music; in a way that is appropriate, because Bernstein
appropriated all kinds of music into his personality, and imposed
his personality on all kinds of music. He knew unreserved adulation
in every area of his activity except the one that mattered most to
him _ his concert music; the tragedy was not that his music was
misunderstood by others but that Bernstein himself understood its
limitations all too well. The film does admit Bernstein's
bisexuality, but does not concede his homosexual side any dignity
or depth.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its limitations in reach, focus, and detail, Lacy's film
is expertly made and often moving. There's some wonderful archival
footage _ original-cast members Carol Lawrence and Larry Kert
duetting in ``West Side Story'' 40 years ago _ and material never
before seen by the public, including a montage of sunlit home
movies of Bernstein frolicking with his family and friends in their
Connecticut summer house, deftly edited to the ``Candide''
Overture. The film opens with slow-motion photography of
Bernstein's funeral procession moving through the streets of New
York, with Beethoven's Seventh Symphony on the soundtrack; near its
close we hear the same music, the work Bernstein conducted in the
last concert of his career at Tanglewood. The final notes of ``West
Side Story,'' ``Somewhere,'' are the last we hear, notes that speak
of tragedy but also of hope.

HOPE FOR THE UNDERDOG: 50 YEARS AFTER TRUMAN'S UPSET VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 1)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDEPENDENCE, Mo. _ If, in these last hours before voters go to
the polls, underdog office seekers are searching for a shrine to
election-year miracles, they will find it here at 219 North
Delaware Street.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Harry Truman lived, and 50 years ago this week he
confounded the pollsters and upset the prognosticators by winning a
seemingly hopeless race for the presidency. Before the votes were
cast, it was the universal belief that Truman, who had succeeded to
the presidency on the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945, would
be defeated by the Republican nominee, New York Gov. Thomas E.
Dewey.
</P>
<P>
   Truman himself appears to have been almost alone among 150
million Americans in believing he would win.
</P>
<P>
   But win he did, and in doing so he became for all time a symbol
of the projected loser who becomes the ultimate winner.
</P>
<P>
   Even such Republicans as George Bush in 1992 and Bob Dole in
1996 sought, while trailing Bill Clinton in the public opinion
polls, to identify themselves with the plain-spoken Missourian who,
through perseverance, determination and political bravado,
converted defeat into victory in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Forgotten are Truman's mistakes and gaffes. Forgotten is the
fact that his foes called for his impeachment after he fired
General of the Army Douglas MacArthur in 1951 while Americans were
dying in the flaming cauldron of Korea. Forgotten, too, are the
scandals that tarnished his administration and the cronies who took
advantage of him.
</P>
<P>
   What is remembered _ in addition to the remarkable decisions he
made in the fields of foreign policy and national security _ is the
miracle of 1948, when an average-looking-and-acting fellow from
Independence stunned the nation.
</P>
<P>
   We have had other close presidential elections since then,
especially in 1960 when more than 68 million votes were cast
nationwide and the shift of fewer than 60,000 in Texas and Illinois
would have provided Richard Nixon with victory over John Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   But times and the technique of campaigning have changed
drastically since Truman squared off against Dewey. Television was
not an important factor in the 1948 campaign. The American people
got their information primarily from newspapers and radio.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates traveled more by train than by plane. There were no
debates between the Democratic and Republican presidential
nominees. All of the major public opinion polls forecast a Dewey
victory. One pollster, Elmo Roper, was so certain of the outcome
that he stopped sampling voter preferences two months before
election day.
</P>
<P>
   When Newsweek Magazine asked 50 influential bureau chiefs,
columnists and political reporters who they thought would win, all
50 said Dewey.
</P>
<P>
   But the Truman saga transcends politics and the presidency. It
is a tale that glorifies every man or woman who beat the odds after
being counted out.
</P>
<P>
   When Truman entered the presidency, he was largely unknown
outside his home state of Missouri, despite his chairmanship of a
Senate committee that exposed waste in national defense
procurement. He had served fewer than three months as vice
president and he had a tough act to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt, projecting supreme self-confidence and great charm,
had been the commanding figure in America for a dozen years,
guiding the republic safely through the Great Depression and World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Truman, an unpretentious onetime farmer who wore thick glasses
and spoke in a flat, midwestern twang, was no match for FDR _ and
he wisely chose not to try.
</P>
<P>
   He chose instead to be himself, an unadorned, middle-class
American who was reared in a farmhouse near Grandview, Mo. that had
neither plumbing nor electricity. He was the only president of the
20th century who did not attend college. But being a prodigious
reader, he educated himself.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles he faced in 1948 were formidable. The Democratic
Party was split three ways, with former Vice President Henry
Wallace leading a liberal faction opposed to Truman's Cold War
policies designed to contain communist aggression, and then-South
Carolina Gov. Strom Thurmond heading the Dixiecrats who opposed
civil rights for blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Two years earlier, Republicans had won control of Congress for
the first time since the election of 1930. The result was the
conservative 80th Congress, which Truman attacked pungently on the
campaign trail in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The two-story, 14-room Victorian house where he lived here is an
excellent reflection of an earlier America and of the personalities
of Bess and Harry Truman. Built by Bess Truman's maternal
grandfather more than 100 years ago, it is old-fashioned,
comfortable and filled with character.
</P>
<P>
   After all, its most memorable resident was the president who
ordered the atomic bombing that ended World War II, provided the
aid that saved Greece and Turkey from communism, established the
Marshall Plan and NATO and turned back the invasion of South Korea
by North Korea. Mementos of those actions and Truman's stunning
1948 victory, are recalled at the Truman museum and library, about
a mile from the Delaware Street house.
</P>
<P>
   When Truman began his nationwide whistle-stop campaign on Sept.
17, 1948, Kentucky Sen. Alben Barkley, his vice presidential
running mate, was at Union Station in Washington to see him off. As
the train pulled away, Barkley called out, ``Mow 'em down, Harry.''
</P>
<P>
   Truman shouted back, ``I'm gonna give 'em hell.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what he did, and he won. In the Truman legend, there
still is hope for those who seemingly are without hope.

 &HT;    CLINTON ANNOUNCES AIDS HELP FOR MINORITIES
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Warning of a ``severe and ongoing'' AIDS crisis in
minority communities, President Clinton announced a $156 million
program Wednesday to combat the spread of the disease among African
Americans and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   The new initiative includes a prevention campaign, improved
access to drug treatments, training for health professionals who
treat the disease and federal ``crisis response teams'' that the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will dispatch to
areas highly affected by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   While overall AIDS deaths have declined for two years in a row,
AIDS remains the leading killer of African-American men age 25-44
and the second leading killer of African-American women in the same
age group. African Americans account for more than 40 percent of
all new HIV/AIDS cases, and Hispanics represent over 20 percent of
new cases of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In many minority communities, ``there's still a misconception
that this is a gay disease and that other people aren't at risk,''
said Sandy Thurman, director of the White House Office of AIDS
Policy. For that reason, she said, part of the new program will be
to explain the wider dangers of infection to people in these
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be targeted prevention efforts'' to ``raise
awareness and erase the stigma'' sometimes associated with the
disease, Thurman said. ``We be making sure the messages are in
language in that people use and understand and that is culturally
sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, for instance, the program will look ``to the
leadership in the African American church community'' to ``talk
openly to congregations about AIDS,'' explained Thurman, 44, a
Georgia native who headed AIDS Atlanta before joining the 1992
Clinton presidential campaign. The program might enlist volunteers
from the sororities and fraternities at the city's historically
black colleges to help get out its message, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The program will also increase access to new drug therapies at
the city's neighborhood health centers and train the health care
providers there in AIDS prevention and treatment, Thurman said. The
most effective response is community based or ``home-grown,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Personifying this community-based activism, perhaps, is Denise
Stokes, an AIDS educational consultant from Atlanta who introduced
Clinton at Wednesday's announcement. Diagnosed with AIDS 12 years
ago, Stokes ``is one of the first people to put a face on
heterosexual HIV infection,'' said organizers of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the funding for the minority AIDS program was
provided in the Omnibus Appropriations Act that Congress passed and
Clinton signed into law last week. The remainder will come from the
HHS budget.

VOTERS JUST WIPE AWAY MUD AND PLOW ONWARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody seems to be disgusted with all those negative ads that
have been muddying up the political arena this election season. We
have a right to be disgusted; it's darn near impossible to find a
legitimate issue floating around in the muck.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the campaigns for statewide offices in Texas are no more
negative than usual, but they somehow seem to have a nastier edge
to them _ with the possible exception of the race for governor,
where incumbent George W. Bush has more or less ignored challenger
Garry Mauro, and Mauro has more or less confined his
misrepresentations of Bush's record to issues on which honest pols
can differ.
</P>
<P>
   But the races for lieutenant governor, attorney general and
comptroller? The worst. Listen to some of the TV ads put out by the
Republican and Democratic candidates for those offices, and your
first inclination is to burn your voter's card.
</P>
<P>
   If those people are half as bad as they describe each other as
being, Bush might want to get himself elected president of the
United States just to get away from the lowlife bums he has to deal
with in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ads, the major parties' candidates for the top
state jobs are:
</P>
<P>
   a. crooks.
</P>
<P>
   b. liars.
</P>
<P>
   c. political hacks.
</P>
<P>
   d. incompetent nitwits.
</P>
<P>
   e. all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   It must be disconcerting for voters to be confronted with such
disturbing revelations about previously well-respected public
servants. All but one of the candidates have been elected to public
office in the past. How did they achieve their current stature
without being unmasked as self-promoting, unqualified slugs?
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that the voters have heard it all before and just
don't care?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that voters don't care if a candidate is a crook or a
notorious scoundrel of some sort; it's just that they've heard
candidates describe each other in the most disparaging terms so
often that the negative blasts have turned into little more than
background noise.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations and counteraccusations begin to roll off the
voters' collective back just as easily as they roll off the tongues
of the faceless, hired-gun announcers whose voices have become so
familiar in political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   With allegations flying everywhere _ and with no way of knowing
which accusations are legitimate and which are unfounded
mudslinging _ many voters simply decide to ignore all the
accusations and base their votes on other criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Some vote for the candidate of their favorite political party.
Some vote for the candidate who best represents their views on
important issues. Some vote for the candidate who seems most
sincere or who looks the best on television.
</P>
<P>
   The great thing about democracy is that voters are allowed to
vote for any candidate they choose _ for any reason they choose.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, voters can sort through the inflammatory
rhetoric, the accusatory advertising and the cheap-shot
back-stabbing that passes for political debate. No matter how deep
the mud, conscientious voters almost always manage to wade through
it and arrive at a responsible decision when they enter the voting
booth.
</P>
<P>
   Negative campaigns do not in themselves erode the electoral
process. What damages the process is some voters' increasingly
common habit of using negative campaigns as an excuse for not
voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pox on all their houses,'' these voters say. ``I've got no
use for any of them. I'm staying home on Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that attitude doesn't punish politicians for
negative campaigns. Somebody will win every race, whether voter
turnout is 1 percent or 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The winner, in fact, will probably be the candidate who
conducted the most negative campaign, because attack ads are
designed not to lure voters to the attacker's side but to
discourage voters from supporting the candidate who is under
attack.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't vote, you actually validate the mudslinging that
you meant to protest by staying home.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't want to do that, would you?
</P>

MARATHON RUNNER, LEGALLY BLIND, DEPENDS ON ANOTHER'S VISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL BOURGEOIS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Marathon runner Ricky Cox hopes to become a
winner in this weekend's New York Marathon by slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   A three-time winner of Fort Worth's Cowtown Marathon, Cox, 39,
said he ran the 1983 Boston Marathon in 2 hours, 17 minutes, a time
bordering on world class. He figures he will be a winner in New
York if he finishes the 26.2 miles in 3 hours.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he will not be just running. He will be serving as a
guide for Mike Royal, a Fort Worth runner who also happens to be
blind.
</P>
<P>
   They run linked at the wrist by an 18-inch shoelace. They also
have verbal signals for things such as potholes and turns.
</P>
<P>
   Royal, 30, hopes that this will be the first step toward
qualifying for the Paralympic Games in Sydney, Australia, in 2000.
The games, for people who are physically challenged, follow the
Olympics by two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have become friends, and so if he achieves what he wants,
that will be my glory also. I will be happy for him,'' said Cox, a
Fort Worth resident and a supervisor for the Fort Worth
Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said that he and Royal got together this summer through The
T, as the transportation agency is known. One of The T's drivers
knew that Royal was having a problem finding a guide runner who
could keep up with him.
</P>
<P>
   Royal, manager of information technologies auditing for Union
Pacific Resources, said his condition was diagnosed as retinitis
pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease, when he was 5 years old.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a serious runner for about 10 years and has
completed more than a dozen marathons. Royal said his best time is
3 hours, 10 minutes and 48 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   He said that within the past two years, his sight has rapidly
deteriorated. He is legally blind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably within the last two years that I've had guides,
but I've had them drop out because they were too slow,'' Royal
said. ``Before, when they dropped out, I sometimes could still pick
my way through the crowd or follow somebody right in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Royal said, that is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've turned my trust over to him completely,'' Royal said. ``I
don't have to worry about running into another runner or taking a
corner too tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Royal said it's much harder for Cox.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge,'' Cox said, ``but I also wanted to help Mike
after talking to him, with him telling me what he wanted to do and
his problem with guys dropping out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what he wants to do, being blind. It's hard to do
having perfect vision. This is totally new for me, and and it's
quite a responsibility.'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   It's common for long-distance runners to have periods where the
mind drifts off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a humongous responsibility, to remain focused
and to remember that you are running with a totally blind runner.
I'm so comfortable with him now that I tend to forget he's blind,''
Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Royal said they hope to do the Cowtown and the Boston Marathon
in the spring and other shorter races in preparation for the
Paralympic Games.

MALE MIND BEST LEFT UNEXPLORED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is no secret that women and men view the world differently.
I've read and studied everything I could about men for years and
years, only to conclude that I have no idea how they think. I never
have and I never will.
</P>
<P>
   I don't even try anymore. Men are like calculus to me. All I did
to get through calculus was memorize the formulas, plug in the
numbers and hope for the best. It was never natural or intuitive
for me, like English or science. All I know is that if I do this,
he'll do that eight times out of 10. I can live with that. I don't
think that we're supposed to understand everything. It's OK to have
some mysteries in life.
</P>
<P>
   Even my darling sons are mysteries to me. I grew up with a baby
sister and lots of girl cousins. Girls I understand. Boys'
fascination with bodily functions mystifies me. Why does it matter
who can burp the loudest? How is this a useful skill? Why is it so
amusing?
</P>
<P>
   Why ask why?
</P>
<P>
   I frequently share things with my husband, expecting a certain
reaction, but I can never be sure how he will respond. Like when I
told him about our friend's new baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, guess what?'' I said. ``Cindy had her baby today. It's
a 10-pound little boy!''
</P>
<P>
   ``How much weight did she gain?'' he asked me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't know, but the baby is 22 inches long and he has a
head full of curly black hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he wanted to know, ``Does she have a private room?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess. She was only in labor three hours. Imagine that. She
said that it didn't even hurt. I am so envious. You know how much I
suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to that, he asked, ``Do you want a sandwich?''
</P>
<P>
   I keep thinking there's a connection here, but I sure don't know
what it could be. Somewhere in the midst of my confusion, I know
that he's happy for Cindy and her husband. And I know that he loves
babies. I just don't understand the private room thing. How is that
relevant? Is that something I should have asked Cindy? The baby is
in the nursery with 20 other babies. Will he resent his mother's
roommate?
</P>
<P>
   ``Gee, I finally get out of that noisy nursery, and now this
chick keeps talking to my mom. Look, lady, I just got here. She's
supposed to be concentrating on me. Put a lid on it, already.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything is bipolar with me and my beloved. If I like the
movie, he falls asleep. If he likes the movie, I think it is too
violent or lacking in redeeming social value. It's 60 degrees in
our bedroom; he's on top of the covers and I'm buried under four
blankets. When I'm all excited and upset, he's calm and rational.
If I say tomayto, he says tomahto.
</P>
<P>
   It used to bother me a lot until I realized that, when it comes
to the things that matter, like our family or his job, he is very
predictable and very reliable. Those other little things aren't
really that important. We accept each other and appreciate each
other for all the times that we've taken different paths to reach
the same conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, what's life without a little mystery?

 MEMORIES OF '50s POPULATE `PLEASANTVILLE`  
 By RUTHE STEIN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ As a screenwriter, Gary Ross is known for his
cleverness, a reputation that should be solidified now that he has
directed his first film, ``Pleasantville.'' While his movies may
seem like flights of fantasy, they're also anchored in things he
knows.
</P>
<P>
   Writing ``Big'' 10 years ago, Ross made the fable about a
13-year-old in a 35-year-old body ring true by drawing on the wish
of every boy to be bigger. His 1993 satire ``Dave'' _ about a dead
ringer for the president who is brought to the White House to
impersonate him _ contains Ross' insider view of politics gleaned
from having been an intern on Capitol Hill and from writing
speeches for President Clinton and other politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ross, 42, only caught part of the 1950s, his memories
of the period permeate ``Pleasantville.'' The film, starring Tobey
Maguire and Reese Witherspoon as contemporary teens who get sucked
into a television and become regulars on a '50s sitcom, finished
No. 1 at the box office last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started with the idea of two kids going through a modern
looking glass, which is a TV set,'' says Ross, sipping bottled
water near the pool of his hotel. ``Then I started thinking about
this hermetically sealed universe where everything was just too
perfect, and what a hell that would be.''
</P>
<P>
   The '50s suburban household depicted in ``Pleasantville'' is
right out of ``Father Knows Best,'' complete with a dad (William H.
Macy) who marches off to work every morning, briefcase in hand, and
a mom (Joan Allen) who is clueless about life outside the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the kind of house Ross grew up in, but it was one he
secretly longed for. The son of a blacklisted Hollywood writer, he
recalls being envious of the fathers he saw leaving for work.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some weird way, I longed for that stability,'' Ross
recalls. ``If your dad isn't working because he's blacklisted and
if you're in that kind of world where there is a little bit of
instability and mayhem, a dad who goes to work every day just to
make money with no higher purpose _ that was the most exotic thing
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   His close relationship with his mother, who fled the kitchen to
return to college when Ross was 13, helped him understand the
hidden frustration of many housewives during this period.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad wasn't that comfortable with her going back to school.
He was very liberal, but liberal doesn't mean feminist. I mean he
still wanted dinner on the table.'' The scene in ``Pleasantville''
where the father walks off in a huff after peeking into an empty
oven was inspired by an incident in Ross' house.
</P>
<P>
   When his father, Arthur Ross, was allowed to work, he wrote
``Creature From the Black Lagoon,'' ``The Great Race'' and many
episodes of ``Alfred Hitchcock Presents.'' By third grade, Gary
already was emulating him, polishing off a school play as epic as
its title: ``The Vikings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It got rewritten by the rest of the class. I was severely p_
off the way all writers are when someone else messes with their
vision,'' Ross recalls, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with many Hollywood screenwriters, Ross has been lucky
to have his work brought to the screen pretty much as he wrote it.
Early on, however, he realized directing was the only way to have
complete control.
</P>
<P>
   He served an informal apprenc &LR; ticeship watching Penny Marshall
direct ``Big'' and Ivan Reitman do the same on ``Dave.'' ``Penny
was a first-time director, so it was sort of a very forced
collaboration. But Ivan was tremendously gracious. He had one
monitor and I had the one next to him, and I learned an incredible
amount.''
</P>
<P>
   The visual look of ``Pleasantville'' was planned before Ross
ever stepped behind the camera. ``I had 700 pages of storyboard, so
I knew every shot in the movie,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, he intended to shoot the film in black and
white, like '50s sitcoms. His big inspiration was introducing color
to show characters being transformed by a sexual awakening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `What would happen if they fully began to blossom?'
The first image that came to me was a rose blooming. Then I
realized, I could color the rose and use it to show the
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your perception at the end isn't that you've seen a black and
white movie,'' Ross says hopefully, ``but that you've seen the most
colorful movie you've ever been to.''

 By JED STEVENS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once considered an engineering folly in a world of film and
video cameras, digital still cameras have become a booming industry
in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak introduced its first digital camera in 1991, an expensive
model bought mostly by photojournalists _ and well-heeled
photojournalists at that, because it cost more than $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Kodak offered the first digital camera it
marketed to less affluent consumers: the DC40, which cost less than
$800. Now Kodak, just one of many camera companies going digital,
sells a complete line of digital cameras. The industry is growing
so fast that sales revenue is increasing about 30 percent to 40
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Digital cameras come in four varieties and two price ranges:
expensive and ``if you need to ask. ...'' They cost a lot because
of the complexity of manufacturing the charge-coupled devices, or
CCDs, at the heart of nearly all digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The CCDs take the place of film in these cameras. A photographer
who wants a larger or better photograph needs a camera with a
larger CCD for greater resolution. Larger CCDs cost more money, and
the largest cost a lot.
</P>
<P>
   In the merely expensive range is the basic consumer model, which
usually costs a few hundred dollars and is almost always less than
$1,000. This is the basic point-and-shoot type of camera many
people might take on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Its resolution _ 640 by 480 pixels, for a total of 307,200 _ is
adequate for small prints and most computer applications, like
sending family snapshots on the Internet and illustrating Web
pages.
</P>
<P>
   For more resolution or larger prints, the next level up is the
35-mm single-lens-reflex camera. Cameras like these are used by
professional photographers like photojournalists and are made by
many of the major camera companies: Kodak, Leica, Canon, Nikon and
others. But you may need a friend at the bank to get one. They
range in cost from a few thousand dollars to about $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   The next two types are for professional photographers who need
even higher-quality photographs. The third type has a removable
back that attaches to either medium-format or 4-by-5 cameras and is
typically used where extreme definition is needed for things like
brochures or magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth is a camera that is really a scanner in a camera's
body; it registers an image pixel by pixel in such detail that it
is used for poster-size reproductions of stationary objects.
</P>
<P>
   But even though much attention has been paid to digital cameras
with CCDs, breakthroughs in a related technology could
revolutionize cameras as we know them. CCDs deliver enough pixel
density to make a good photograph look good. But an improved chip
called CMOS (pronounced SEA-moss), for complementary metal oxide
semiconductor, is expected to be the next big step for digital
imaging.
</P>
<P>
   The pixels in both CCD and CMOS chips convert photons into
electrons, but they differ in how information moves off the chip.
CMOS chips are much cheaper to manufacture, and there is room on
CMOS chips to include circuits for things like image stabilization.
</P>
<P>
   CMOS chips have been around for about 30 years, but they have
needed to be extremely large to deliver the same pixel density as a
CCD chip. So that has slowed the pace of their adoption by
manufacturers, even though they can operate with much less power
than CCD chips.
</P>
<P>
   Peter M. Davies, director of Kodak's marketing program for
digital and applied imaging, predicted that CMOS chips would
eventually be capable of images with the same clarity as CCDs and
be much cheaper. CMOS cameras will be able to operate much longer
without changing batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak recently signed agreements with both Motorola and Intel to
develop a high-density CMOS chip, but Davies said that effort would
probably not lead to CMOS cameras by Kodak for another year or 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   Marc J. Loinaz, a researcher at Bell Labs, part of Lucent
Technologies, said that as CMOS chips became smaller, digital
cameras would eventually be limited in size only by lens sizes.
``If there ever is a Dick Tracy video watch,'' he said, ``it'll use
CMOS chips.''

   Picture a cartoon: a woman opens a door labeled ``computer
room'' only to find shelves of loose-leaf binders and a surprised
group of labcoat-wearing men shuffling papers. ``We're updating the
database,'' the caption reads.
</P>
<P>
   That cartoon might come close to describing the task facing Bob
Mankoff, cartoon editor for The New Yorker and head of the Cartoon
Bank, the archive of 60,000 of the magazine's classic cartoons, and
an additional 20,000 from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   Mankoff, who also is a cartoonist for the magazine, is turning
the magazine's paper database into a digital one.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 30, coinciding with The New Yorker's annual cartoon
issue, the magazine plans to redesign the Cartoon Bank Web site.
The site, www.cartoonbank.com, will incorporate a searchable
database of about 5,000 cartoons, all digitally watermarked to help
prevent unauthorized use.
</P>
<P>
   Those interested in licensing any cartoon can search on the Web
site by keyword or description, and select the cartoon. But they
will have to place a phone call to complete the order.
</P>
<P>
   Mankoff has a long-time interest in technology. During an
interview, he volunteered to count to 32 in binary on the fingers
of one hand and he recently rediscovered a cartoon he did at age 7,
rendered in his trademark stippled style, showing a rampaging robot
with ``TILT'' lighted up on its chest.
</P>
<P>
   His interests in computers and cartooning made him an an early
believer that a revolution was brewing in the cartoon reprint
market. In 1991, he offered to set up an electronic system for New
Yorker cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it wasn't actually practical'' to build a digital
database at that point, Mankoff said, ``but I was intrigued by
it.'' At the time, the publication gave 100 percent of reprint fees
to cartoonists, so it didn't have much incentive.
</P>
<P>
   He then founded the Cartoon Bank privately, and represented both
New Yorker and other panel cartoonists for a 50 percent cut. With
substantial effort, Mankoff built up the library over the years
until 1997, when The New Yorker purchased the Cartoon Bank and then
shortly thereafter offered him the position of cartoon editor.
</P>
<P>
   Mankoff said that many contributors to The New Yorker now made
more in reprint rights than they did for the first appearance of
their work. He cited Peter Steiner's classic of one canine at a
computer saying to another, ``On the Internet, nobody knows you're
a dog.'' Steiner has earned more than $30,000 for reprints of that
cartoon alone, according to Mankoff.
</P>
<P>
   Mankoff's goal is to take advantage of the editorial process of
six decades that's spawned the enormous number of published
cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's extraordinary about this is that these 60,000 cartoons
have gone through this process of weeding out,'' Mankoff said. He
continually works on improving his methods for production and
distribution of the digital files, because he does not want to see
the quality suffer for reasons of technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have said to me, `This cartoon isn't funny,' '' Mankoff
noted, ``But they never said, `This cartoon is fuzzy.' ''

 By CLAIRE POOLE, with BRENDAN M. CASE in Mexico City, MERY
GALANTERNICK in Rio de Janeiro and THOMAS LONG in San Salvador 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Much like the Charles Dickens novel, ``A Tale of Two Cities,''
it's been the best of times and the worst of times for Latin
America's textiles industry.
 &HT;    It's been the best of times in places like Mexico, where the
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has opened up the huge
U.S. market to Mexican-made and -assembled textiles.
 &HT;    It's been the worst of times in places like Brazil, whose free
trade policies have hammered the country's inefficient
manufacturers with cheap imports from Asia.
 &HT;    At the same time, countries in Central America and the Caribbean
fight for NAFTA parity so they can increase their textile
industries as fast as Mexico's.
 &HT;    The times have been mixed for U.S. textile companies as well,
many of whom ship thread, yarn and fabric to Latin America for
assembly into apparel and other value-added products. ``For us, the
northern tier has been a big plus,'' says David Link, chief
economist at the American Textile Manufacturers Institute. ``But
(farther) down, it's unrealized potential.''
 &HT;    To top it off, the Asian economic crisis is starting to take its
toll on many countries' textile industries, which find themselves
competing with lower labor costs and better-made products coming
from China and the Pacific Rim at the same time they're battling a
flood of cheap Asian product coming through their borders.
 &HT;    In mid-July, for example, Venezuelan textile maker Sudamtex de
Venezuela announced it would cut its work force by nearly a third
and shut down its textile-manufacturing operations at Arrowvale in
the U.K. as a result of the Asian financial crisis. The move will
result in US$10.5 million in charges, severance payments and other
restructuring expenses.
 &HT;    Mexico sewn up. For Mexico, however, the textiles industry is
one of the country's great success stories. With open access to the
huge U.S. market guaranteed by NAFTA, which was implemented in
1994, domestic textile companies are flourishing while foreign
firms are flocking to take advantage of Mexico's low wages and
efficient work force.
 &HT;    A few optimists even predict Mexico will become the ``Hong
Kong'' of Latin America, the leader in all aspects of the textile
business from fibers to fabric to clothing. Working conditions vary
greatly. But in a country that needs jobs as badly as Mexico,
worries about the quality of jobs often take a back seat to the
need for more work.
 &HT;    In terms of volume, Mexico exported more textiles to the United
States than China as early as 1996. In terms of dollar value, it
took over the No. 1 spot this year, pushing through $2.9 billion
between January and May, up 25.3 percent.
 &HT;    Bancomext, the government's foreign-trade bank, reckons Mexico's
total textile exports could reach $9.6 billion by the end of the
year _ more than the expected value of the country's oil exports.
 &HT;    ``There has been a very important (transformation) in the
textile sector as companies have invested in new equipment,'' says
Jaime Farell Campos, who tracks the industry at Bancomext. ``Most
recently, the industry has been taking advantage of NAFTA in
finding new markets.''
 &HT;    Mexico is also becoming a primary focus for multinational
textile firms, drawn by the quick and easy access to the U.S.
market and wages that start at about $120 per month for low-skilled
workers. U.S.-based companies like Tommy Hilfiger and Phillips-Van
Heusen Corp. make shirts, while Wrangler and the Gap sew together
jeans. Du Pont S.A., a subsidiary of U.S.-based chemicals giant Du
Pont, makes a range of synthetic fibers.
 &HT;    In the last few months alone, Du Pont and Monterrey-based Alfa
have announced investments of $450 million to boost nylon
production and build a new polyester plant in the port city of
Altamira. U.S.-based manufacturer Guilford Mills is spending $100
million on a knitting, dyeing and finishing plant in Altamira.
Asian companies are also setting up factories.
 &HT;    Most recently, U.S.-based Burlington Industries, which
manufactures textiles, apparel and interior furnishings, announced
plans to invest $80 million over the next three years to build four
garment factories in Mexico. When completed, the new sewing and
cutting operations will add $225 million to the company's $2
billion in annual sales. ``The combination of our U.S. plants and
our Mexican facilities makes us globally competitive and presents
new growth opportunities, '' George Henderson III, chairman of
Burlington, said at the announcement.
 &HT;    All together, the National Textile Industry Chamber expects
textile companies to spend at least $1.2 billion over the next two
years modernizing plants and building new ones.
 &HT;    ``NAFTA is pushing all this growth, and the idea at Du Pont is
to manufacture these products in North America,'' says Horacio
Ojeda, director of business planning in Du Pont S.A.'s fibers
division. ``But it's broader than that. We're also interested in
exporting to markets in Europe, Latin America and Asia.''
 &HT;    There are still challenges left. Paradoxically, Mexico is
strongest in fibers production and the cut-and-sew business, in
which cloth is turned into garments. But it is weaker in the
intermediate stage of fabric production, the transformation of
fibers into cloth.
 &HT;    That might change soon. Late last year, Burlington Industries
announced it would spend at least $200 million on two new fabric
plants and a yarn-making plant in a joint venture with U.S.-based
Parkdale Mills. The three plants, all of which are located in
Morelos state, are near completion. Government officials want more
such facilities.
 &HT;    ``We hope that companies that just assemble will begin to add
more value locally, incorporating more domestic cloth and fibers,''
Bancomext's Farell Campos says. ``The goal is to create more of the
added value in Mexico.''
 &HT;    State governments are also eager for investment. In Morelos,
just south of Mexico City, Du Pont, Alfa, Burlington Industries and
Guilford Mills sponsored the Nustart development, Mexico's first
industrial park devoted exclusively to textiles. Nustart opened in
1997 and is already sold out.
 &HT;    Now states like Guanajuato, Oaxaca and Jalisco _ eager for the
hundreds of low-skill jobs the textile business generates _ are
trying to attract similar developments.
 &HT;    In other parts of Mexico, the textile business has become a
leading economic engine. Torreon, in the northern state of
Coahuila, has become a large denim production center, reviving
local cotton growers in the process. ``My sister is moving to
Torreon and she can't find a house,'' Du Pont's Ojeda says.
 &HT;    Brazil on the mend. While Mexico's textiles industry is
thriving, Brazil's is having trouble surviving, with a substantial
drop in cotton production, wide-spread layoffs and a significant
number of manufacturers that have either gone bankrupt or shut down
altogether.
 &HT;    The crisis began in 1995, when President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso put in force his economic stabilization program, the Real
Plan. While it slashed annual inflation from four digits to one, it
also jeopardized domestic industries that were not prepared to
confront the administration's free-trade policy.
 &HT;    ``It was a disaster,'' says Ricardo Steinbruch, director of
Vicunha Nordeste, South America's largest blue jeans and denim
manufacturer. ``Brazil became the wastebasket for Asian products.
They dropped prices to the bottom line and sent their products
here.''
 &HT;    The government realized its mistake and took some measures to
reduce the impact of the Asian invasion, such as more rigorous
control of export licenses and minimum reference prices for Asian
products.
 &HT;    The textile industry still hasn't regained its grandeur. Less
than 10 years ago, the textile industry was one of the Brazil's
leading employers, accounting for a work force of more than
540,000. That's been almost cut in half to 246,500, according to
the Institute for Studies and Industrial Marketing (IEMI).
 &HT;    That's not all. The number of textile companies has shrunk from
4,938 in 1990 to an estimated 3,638 in 1997. In the city of
Americana, the traditional textile center in Sao Paulo state, more
than 50 percent of 1,300 textile companies and garment plants have
closed or gone broke since 1995.
 &HT;    Cotton production has also fallen, from 1.8 million tons in 1992
to 1 million tons last year, largely because imported product is
cheaper than what's being made domestically. ``Manufacturers prefer
to import, borrowing foreign loans at lower interest rates than
local credit charges,'' says Ana Paula Gorini, a textile analyst
with the government's National Bank for Economic and Social
Development (BNDES).
 &HT;    As a result, textiles are becoming less important to Brazil's
overall economy. The industry contributed only 1.1 percent to the
country's gross domestic product in 1996, the most recent official
figure released by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and
Statistics (IBGE).
 &HT;    The industry's major players include Rhodia and Alpargatas
Santista Textil in Sao Paulo, Coteminas in Minas Gerais and Vicunha
in Sao Paulo and Ceara state. About 13 percent of Brazil's textiles
industry is made up of foreign companies, including U.S.-based Du
Pont and the Netherlands-based Polyenka.
 &HT;    Production stretches from basic fibers _ rayon staples and
polyester filaments _ to denim, twills and designer tailoring.
About 20 percent of Brazil's production is exported largely to
other Latin American countries and Europe.
 &HT;    In this survival-of-the-fittest contest, companies have reshaped
themselves by reducing their work force, installing computerized
machinery and making their plants internationally competitive. Some
have even migrated to Brazil's center west and northeast regions to
take advantage of tax incentives and cheap labor. Northeast garment
laborers, for instance, are paid $3 a day, less than half of the
wages earned by their counterparts in southern Brazil.
 &HT;    Textiles central. While Brazil's textiles industry rejuvenates
itself, Central America and the Caribbean, along with Mexico, are
gradually replacing Asia as the center of textile export production
to the United States, primarily maquiladora offshore assembly.
 &HT;    The countries belonging to the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI)
saw their share of U.S. textile imports increase from 16 percent in
1992 to nearly 24 percent in 1997. Last year alone, their exports
to the United States rose 26 percent to $7.7 billion, according to
the U.S. Commerce Department. In the first five months of 1998,
they were up another 12 percent.
 &HT;    A number of U.S. companies have textile plants in the area to
take advantage of lower labor costs, favorable tax treatment and
proximity to the United States.
 &HT;    Sara Lee is one of the biggest, with operations across the
region. Its knit-products division, which makes Hanes and Hanes Her
Way underwear and T-shirts, has manufacturing plants in Costa Rica,
the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, while its Champion division
operates garment manufacturing facilities in Costa Rica. Meanwhile,
Bali, its intimate-apparel division, makes bras in Costa Rica, the
Dominican Republic and Honduras.
 &HT;    While textile business with the United States is up, the CBI
countries have called for NAFTA parity so they can regain the level
of growth achieved before the agreement came into effect.
 &HT;    They've made some headway. U.S. President Bill Clinton promised
some relief during his 1997 trip to Costa Rica. He even included a
plan to expand trade benefits for apparel and textiles from CBI
countries in his 1998 budget.
 &HT;    But last November, a bill that would eliminate all quotas and
tariffs on CBI textile imports went up in flames two days before
the ill-fated fast-track bill was pulled from the floor of the U.S.
House of Representatives.
 &HT;    The U.S. Senate is now considering a similar bill, but this time
only products made with U.S. fabric would be allowed free entry. If
the bill doesn't pass through Congress by the end of its session in
October, which is likely, then it will have to wait until next
year.
 &HT;    Industry leaders in both the U.S. and Central America are
clearly dissatisfied with the new bill. ``The (House) bill was good
because it would have given the CBI nations the same benefits
Mexico enjoys and would lead to more free-trade agreements with the
U.S.,'' says Erik Autor, international trade counsel for the
National Retail Federation, a U.S.-based trade group. Complains
Alfredo Milian Jerez, coordinator of the textile advisory
commission of the Salvadoran Association of Industrialists (ASI):
``The U.S. idea of parity is not parity.''
 &HT;    Even without NAFTA parity, several Central American and
Caribbean countries have managed to become important centers of the
Latin American textile industry.
 &HT;    The textile sector in the Dominican Republic, for example, has
taken off.
 &HT;    Over the last five years, exports to the U.S. have risen almost
50 percent in dollar terms, from $1.2 billion in 1992 to $1.8
million last year. It is now the biggest textile exporter among CBI
countries, with more than 80 companies making everything from
T-shirts and blouses to shorts, trousers and skirts.
 &HT;    It's helped that the country has lowered its trade barriers
related to textiles. Last year, President Leonel Fernandez
eliminated all import taxes applied to raw materials for the
textile industry, including fabrics, yarns, chemicals, machinery,
equipment and parts. They were substantial: According to a U.S.
Commerce Department report, import taxes ranged from 10 percent to
25 percent of the value of the product and an ad-valorem tax for
the transfer of products and services amounted to 8 percent.
 &HT;    Not only did the opening help U.S. producers _ who supply 65
percent of imports _ sell into the Dominican Republic, it also
helped the country's producers, who could now bump up production
and renovate old machinery to improve production.
 &HT;    Honduras is also an important producer. In terms of textile
exports, it ranks No. 5 in the world, second among CBI countries
and first in Central America. Over the 12 months ended in May, it
exported $1.7 billion worth of textiles and apparel, up almost 22
percent over the same period last year.
 &HT;    Companies like Sara Lee and Fruit of the Loom have set up
manufacturing facilities in Honduras, while retailers like JC
Penney, the Gap, Wal-Mart and the Limited have contracted out local
companies to assembly clothing for them.
 &HT;    Next door in El Salvador, the textile industry has been hard hit
by NAFTA and its own government's monetary policies. But it's
managing to eke out some growth.
 &HT;    The country is currently the 10th-largest exporter of textiles
to the United States, pushing through $1.25 billion in 1997
(including non-maquila exports and foreign-source maquila inputs).
Its share of the total U.S. import market increased from less than
1 percent in 1992 to more than 3 percent in 1997.
 &HT;    El Salvador has 240 maquilas that either cut and make or cut,
make and trim textile products. Of those, approximately 30 percent
are foreign-owned-mostly U.S. firms such as County Line Sportwear,
Brooklyn Manufacturing and Sara Lee Intimates and South Korean
firms like Daewoo El Salvador. But they account for about 70
percent of total-sector export volume and about 70,000 jobs. In
addition, El Salvador has some 30 textile factories _ defined as
non-maquila processing and/or full-package plants _ that employ
about 10,000. Another 250 to 300 small plants target the domestic
market.
 &HT;    Besides NAFTA, Salvadoran producers and exporters have suffered
from a narrowly focused government monetary policy, which has
maintained the colon at a fixed exchange rate for the past five
years.
 &HT;    The policy was designed to foster macroeconomic stability and
attract foreign capital. But the country still lags behind all of
its neighbors in direct foreign investment, which was only $25
million in 1996 _ the latest available figure _ according to the
U.S.-based Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).
 &HT;    The fixed exchange rate effectively penalizes Salvadoran exports
and local producers. Exporters are at a disadvantage compared with
countries like Mexico and Honduras, which have devalued their
currencies in recent years.
 &HT;    Industry sources also say the monetary policy subsidizes
imports, which, along with declining import tariffs, are
threatening local producers' position in the domestic market.
 &HT;    To top it off, El Salvador has the highest production and labor
costs in the region after Costa Rica. And while Costa Rica enjoys a
higher standard of education and the image of safety, El Salvador
is considered the most violent country in the hemisphere, according
to a 1997 IDB study. Concerns over public security have kept many
foreign firms away.
 &HT;    Since it started exporting in the early 1980s, Guatemala has
also become a big textile producer in the region. It offers foreign
investors a vast array of tax benefits, mostly through free-trade
zones.
 &HT;    As a result, its apparel exports have mushroomed, from $5.5
million in 1986 to $299 million last year, according to Banco de
Guatemala. In the first four months of this year, Guatemala's
exports jumped 18 percent to $115 million.
 &HT;    NAFTA, however, took the wind out of Guatemala's textiles
industry. Since the agreement has been in force, the country's
textile exports have slowed from 44.2 percent in 1994 to 6.7
percent last year.
 &HT;    Guatemala just got a break. This past May, the United States
dropped a quota restraint on imports of cotton and manmade
fiber-skirts from Guatemala.
 &HT;    This is no small thing: Guatemala is the United States'
fourth-largest foreign skirt supplier, with about 6.3 percent of
the import market after India, Mexico and Taiwan.
 &HT;    The Central American country now wants to offer more
full-package production, which would help the apparel industry
develop more clusters of supporting industries.
 &HT;    The industry employs 54,000 workers at 234 factories around the
country _ 17 of which are owned by U.S. companies _ that make
everything from knit and woven shirts and cotton trousers, shorts
and skirts to wool coats, skirts and trousers.
 &HT;    Like Guatemala, Costa Rica also set up free-trade zones some
years ago that allow duty-free imports of product. The country now
does a bustling business with drawback companies, which import
precut cloth, assemble it into a finished or semifinished garment
and export it to the United States or Europe or sell it locally and
to the Central American Common Market. More than 50 drawback
companies are currently operating in Costa Rica.
 &HT;    But the real boost came in 1995, when Costa Rica signed a
free-trade agreement with Mexico. Modeled after NAFTA, the
agreement eliminated tariffs on $5 million worth of clothing
manufactured with foreign-made materials, rising 15 percent per
year until the end of 1999, when it will be abolished.
 &HT;    More importantly, the pact provided that Costa Rica and Mexico
could export an unlimited amount of non-qualifying apparel to each
other so long as the fabric needed to make the products is not
available in either country at the price or in the quality or
quantity required by the manufacturer.
 &HT;    The agreement enticed many major U.S. manufacturers to set up or
expand assembly or manufacturing operations in Costa Rica. They
include Hanes Tejidos Costa Rica and Manufacturera de Cartago,
divisions of Sara Lee that make ladies and girls intimate apparel;
Centro Industrial Manufacturero El Roble, the Levi Strauss licensee
for Central America; and Warner's de Costa Rica, which makes
women's lingerie.
 &HT;    ``With Wal-Mart and other retailers opening stores in Mexico, it
makes (a) tremendous amount of sense for a U.S. company to operate
in Costa Rica so it has the option of shipping to Mexico as well as
the U.S. market,'' says Jerry Watkins, general manager of Cartex
Manufacturera, a division of U.S.-based Harwood Companies that
assembles men's boxer shorts in Cartago.
 &HT;    The proof is in the numbers. According to Costa Rican textile
association Camara Textil Costarricense (CATECO), the country's
exports of textiles rose 16.8 percent last year to $788.4 million.
In the first half of this year, they amounted to $359.7 million.
Ninety-five percent of Costa Rican textile exports are to the
United States.
 &HT;    Outlook. While some Latin American countries' textile industries
have been hard hit by NAFTA and the fallout from Asia, there's
optimism all around.
 &HT;    Analysts predict Mexico will continue to boost its exports and
bring in new investment. Central America and the Caribbean are
expected to become more developed textile centers while they lobby
to achieve NAFTA parity. And Brazil is working to become more
efficient to combat cheap Asian imports.
 &HT;    Indeed, in this ever-increasing world economy, only the
strongest textile companies in the region are expected to survive.
``We've reached the end of the line,'' Vicunha's Steinbruch says.
''(Those) who were unable to modernize dropped out and those who
remain are ready to compete in a globalized market.'' En garde,
Asia.

TAPPING CYBERBRAINS FOR FINANCIAL ADVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROY FURCHGOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite recent stock market fluctuations _ or maybe because of
them _ investments remain hot cocktail chatter as boomers fret
about how to swing a comfy retirement. The money has to go
somewhere, and under the mattress won't do.
</P>
<P>
   So how much do you need, and what investments should you choose
to be able to retire to that cottage on Martha's Vineyard? While a
whole industry of investment firms and financial planners is ready
to counsel you, often for a hefty fee, budget-minded
do-it-yourselfers are turning to inexpensive software that assesses
their investments, tell them how much money they will need in
retirement and give guidelines on investing to meet that goal.
</P>
<P>
   At their best, these programs are simple, harvesting data from
an electronic checkbook to give you an accurate thumbnail appraisal
of saving and spending habits that will put you on track for that
beach house. At their worst, they resemble an Internal Revenue
Service audit.
</P>
<P>
   Your experience with them depends largely on your record keeping
and financial acumen. If you already have a program like Quicken or
Microsoft Money and keep detailed records, projecting your future
is a snap. If you keep old bills in a shoebox, you're in for many
hours of data entry. If you let your records pile up because you
don't know how to organize your finances, however, you might
consider using these programs to help you turn that pile of
receipts into a sensible balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at the 20 best-selling financial-planning CD-ROMs and
found three comprehensive planners. These programs prod you through
a detailed questionnaire to determine your long-term financial
status. They were Quicken Financial Planner, which can be purchased
separately or as part of the popular Quicken Suite (Quicken
products are the top-selling planners); Microsoft's Lifetime
Planner, which is integrated in the MS Money Financial Suite, and
Plan Retirement Quick &AMP; Easy from Individual Software, which also
makes Retire Ready Deluxe, which has more features but was not a
top 20 seller. And T.Rowe Price offers a planner you can get by
mail on CD-ROM or download.
</P>
<P>
   The plans all forecast and suggest investments based on several
factors, like how fast you want your money to grow, how much risk
you want to take and how various investments (stocks, bonds, funds)
have performed over time. Their pie charts telling you how to
divide your investments can be found in any personal finance book,
and even in many financial firms' brochures.
</P>
<P>
   These cyberplanners will not replace a flesh-and-blood financial
planner completely, and most offer a disclaimer saying so.
</P>
<P>
   To test these programs, I asked Kevin Condon, a partner in
Baltimore-Washington Financial Advisors Inc., which offers
traditional financial planning services, to feed the real financial
dossier of a family his company advises into these programs and
compare the results.
</P>
<P>
   Condon renamed the family members John, Jane and Lisa Doe. John,
56, an engineer, earns $51,000 a year and plans to retire in seven
years. Jane, 50, makes $65,000. She retires in eight years with a
pension of $38,000 a year and no Social Security because she's a
federal employee. Lisa, 15, is in a private school that costs
$16,500 a year and plans to attend a private college costing about
$30,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Does are very good savers and have invested $360,000 in
401(k) plans and about $267,000 in mutual funds, individual stocks
and bonds and a thrift savings plan. They would like to spend
$50,000 next year on a wish list of items. Expenses are low, they
carry little debt, and they put aside more than $10,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Their planners say the Does will be able to pay for Lisa's
education and manage a very comfortable retirement. Condon's
calculations assume a assuming 3 percent inflation, an 8 percent
return on investments before retirement and a 6 percent return
after retirement, and adjust the tax each year as income changes
(the overall average tax is 25 percent).
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Doe dies, (statistics say that she will outlive her
husband), she will leave Lisa an investment portfolio of $3.79
million. Ah, but what do the cyberplanners say? &QL;

   Part of the power of Quicken's planner is how well it takes
information from your checkbook to determine your spending and
saving habits _ provided you already use Quicken's software. The
planner will not work with other companies' checkbook files, unless
you have a full-featured Quicken program, which will convert them
to a Quicken file first.
</P>
<P>
   Quicken's financial planner is a straightforward workbook with a
lot of text that is not always easy to follow. The printed 34-page
users' guide is clearer, telling you what to enter at each step, as
well as what items should wait for later steps.
</P>
<P>
   We entered some income too early and had to go back and take it
out. For those curious about things like why inflation is set at 3
percent, an Expert Advise button leads you to information from the
financial columnist Jane Bryant Quinn. To understand how changing
your inflation number will affect your outcome, there is a help
button.
</P>
<P>
   Of all of the planners, this one moves along the most
methodically. It specifically asked about a pension, which Jane Doe
will receive. But it stumbled over the fact that Ms. Doe, who does
not pay Social Security tax, is ineligible for Social Security
benefits at retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The program insisted on automatically calculating a Social
Security benefit for her. We had to split John Doe's benefit
between and Ms. Doe and reduce the amount by 33 percent to get the
numbers right.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to jury rig it to take out her Social Security,''
said Kevin Condon, our adviser for this project. ``No government
employees need apply.''
</P>
<P>
   In planning college for Lisa, Quicken offers detailed expenses
for more than 5,000 schools, using data provided by the College
Board, a nonprofit education association. We clicked on a school
and got the costs for tuition, books and living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Condon liked the program's ``what if'' capability, watching how
the charts in the final report changed when we fine-tuned the
information entered. ``That's a great one, it modifies the whole
thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   How did the Does make out? Quicken assumes 3 percent inflation
(the long-term historical average), an 8 percent return on
investments before retirement and 6 percent after retirement, with
a 17 percent tax rate. (We did change one assumption by lengthening
Ms. Doe's life span by 10 years, to 95 years from 85.) When Ms.
Doe, the surviving spouse, dies, she leaves $10.66 million.
Congratulations, Lisa, you're rich.
</P>
<P>
   But is she that rich? Quicken's (and the other cyberplanners')
calculation was $7 million higher than that of the flesh-and-blood
planners. The discrepancy, Condon's company said, stems from a
couple of assumptions these electronic planners make.
</P>
<P>
   One is that all cash left after expenses will be reinvested.
Condon's group assumes that some of that will be spent and some
invested. (They use a modest growth rate of 4 percent.) Second,
Condon's plan reduces the size of investment accounts in the Does'
later years so Lisa will not get socked by estate taxes, a problem
that electronic planners didn't take into account. &QL;

   MICROSOFT MONEY FINANCIAL SUITE 99 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Microsoft, $64.95 (with $25 rebate through Nov. 30, 1999);
Windows 95, 98 or NT.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has harnessed the power of multimedia for its
financial planner, which is an annoyance. Actors woodenly talk you
through the planner features on a ``movie'' tour that is worth
skipping. There are enough clear prompts as you go through the
program itself to help you fill out the forms properly. It takes a
little time to grasp the control button layout on the attractively
designed page, but it soon becomes clear.
</P>
<P>
   Although data entry was clearly explained, the process was not
very thorough. It never asked about Jane Doe's pension, and we had
to hunt around to find the right area (``other income'') in which
to list it.
</P>
<P>
   Asking the Help feature, ``Where do I file my pension?'' sent us
to a different program, the budget planner. But using ``pension''
in the keyword search sent us to Other Income, right on target.
</P>
<P>
   The program also stumbled over a $19,000 revolving loan. It
wanted to reduce the amount of available principle, even though it
should not for that type of loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's trying to amortize your loan and give you a tax break you
aren't due,'' noted Kevin Condon, our planning adviser.
</P>
<P>
   MS Money also could not accept the idea that Ms. Doe would get
no Social Security at retirement, but a Microsoft representative
said that if we had imported her paycheck information from its
checking program, it would have spotted the zero contribution and
entered it accurately. It will also handle Quicken files.
</P>
<P>
   The program has a college cost estimator that used the same
database as Quicken, and it has similarly impressive ``what if''
capabilities. In addition, it has some nice drop-down work sheets
and calculators for tallying costs on the spot, and a quiz that
determines your risk tolerance to see if your expected returns are
in line with how much risk you can stand.
</P>
<P>
   MS Money _ assuming 3 percent inflation, an aggressive 9 percent
return on investments before retirement and 7 percent after, and a
tax rate of 19.05 _ says Lisa will be left a whopping $10.69
million.
</P>
<P>
   That's ahead of the human planners by about the same amount as
the other cyberplanners. Some glitches we hit in this program might
have been avoided if we had first used the Microsoft checkbook
program and the budget planner, which would have spotted, for
example, our surplus cash and asked us what we wanted to do with
it.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, we would have had to have gone into Tools, then
Options, then picked Stop Saving, all of which would have required
more knowledge than a reporter and two professional planners could
muster. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   T.ROWE PRICE RETIREMENT PLANNING ANALYZER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (T.Rowe Price, $19.95 on CD-ROM or $9.95 downloaded from
www.troweprice.com; Windows 3.1 or later.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The T.Rowe planner starts with a tutorial on why you save, how
money grows and how time and risk affect investments. A swift
tutorial demonstrates how to enter numbers and use the controls so
you don't need a manual, which is a good thing because if you
download the software from the Web, there isn't one. The program
then moves speedily through personal information in a simple yet
comprehensive way.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the planner starts out assuming that you don't
know what risk is, in the data entry section, it expects you to
have an understanding of asset classes and know an annuity from a
401(k).
</P>
<P>
   The program's no-nonsense design is underscored by the comments
of its expert, Lynn Hopewell, the editor of The Journal of
Financial Planning.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking on advice about choosing life expectancy numbers
elicits this from Hopewell: ``We could give you fancy charts to
show your probability of living past various ages. But a simple
approach will do the job. Just choose 90. There is only a 10
percent chance any of us will make it beyond that age.'' That kind
of blunt commentary has led to the description of the white-bearded
Hopewell as ``Burl Ives with an attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   This planner did not stumble on Jane Doe's lack of Social
Security benefits, and it did about as well in most other areas as
the more complex planners. But it cannot import data from your
computerized checking files. And even though its price is a
bargain, you pay for it with a word-from-our-sponsor conclusion
that divvies your money among T.Rowe Price funds that it
recommends.
</P>
<P>
   The result: T.Rowe assumes a conservative 4 percent inflation
but an aggressive 9 percent return on investments before retirement
and a hefty 8 percent return after. The tax rate is 28 percent. But
the analysis shows that Ms. Doe still leaves a tidy sum to her
daughter: $10.17 million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PLAN RETIREMENT QUICK AND EASY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Individual Software Inc., $19.95, Windows 3.1 and 95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plan Retirement Quick and Easy lives up to its name fairly well,
but this no-frills program leaves little latitude for temporary but
large expenses _ like college costs _ that people may need to
figure in, even if they mainly have retirement on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   This program was organized differently than the others. It asks
you to lump investments into taxable and tax deferred, and it
expects you to know the difference. It does offer work sheets at
the click of a button, but while they will help you get organized,
they still don't help with the taxable vs. tax-deferred question.
</P>
<P>
   While the program will track two people, presumably married, it
will not let them retire in different years. Romantic _ but
impractical.
</P>
<P>
   It did not have a provision for insurance, and it was the only
program whose charts did not register a financial blip (to account
for insurance benefits and lowered living expenses) at the death of
one spouse.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the results were not very far off of the other
planning programs. The final $4 million difference is probably the
effect of the $170,000 for Lisa Doe's tuition, which was not
removed from the investment kitty. (It would have been possible to
remove it as a lump sum in the form of a loan. But there was no
neat way of deducting it year by year. A new version set for
release by December will have this feature.)
</P>
<P>
   The program assumes 4 percent inflation, a 7.5 percent return on
investments before and after retirement, and an 18 percent tax rate
before retirement and 14 percent after. Lisa Doe apparently had to
skip college, but her mom leaves her $14.92 million, a nice
consolation prize.

 Por CLAIRE POOLE, con BRENDAN M. CASE en Mexico D.F., MERY
GALANTERNICK en Rio de Janeiro y THOMAS LONG en San Salvador 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A la industria textil de America Latina le ha sucedido algo muy
similar a la novela Historia de dos ciudades, de Charles Dickens:
ha tenido la epoca mejor y la epoca peor.
 &HT;    Ha sido la mejor epoca en lugares como Mexico, donde el TLC ha
abierto el enorme mercado estadounidense a los productos textiles
de Mexico.
 &HT;    Ha sido la peor epoca en lugares como Brasil, cuyas politicas de
libre comercio han aplastado a los fabricantes nacionales con
importaciones baratas de Asia.
 &HT;    Al mismo tiempo, los paises de America Central y el Caribe
luchan por conseguir los beneficios del TLC con el fin de hacer
avanzar su industria textil con la misma velocidad que Mexico.
 &HT;    Las consecuencias han sido diversas para las empresas textiles
de Estados Unidos, que en muchos casos envian hilo, hilaza y
tejidos a Latinoamerica para ensamblar ropa y otros productos de
valor agregado. ``Para nosotros, el segmento del norte ha sido una
gran ventaja,'' dice David Link, director de economistas del
Instituto de Fabricantes Textiles de Estados Unidos. ``Pero al sur,
hay un potencial sin aprovechar.''
 &HT;    Para colmo, la crisis economica de Asia ya le cobra un precio a
las industrias textiles de muchos paises, que compiten con costos
laborales mas bajos y productos de mejor confeccion que llegan de
China y la Cuenca del Pacifico.
 &HT;    A mediados de julio, por ejemplo, la textilera venezolana
Sudamtex anuncio que reduciria su fuerza laboral en casi la tercera
parte y que cerraria sus operaciones de manufactura en el Reino
Unido debido a la crisis financiera de Asia, todo a un costo de
US$10,5 millones en cargos, indemnizaciones por despido y otros
gastos.
 &HT;    Las costuras de Mexico. Pero en Mexico la industria textil ha
tenido un gran exito. Con el acceso al enorme mercado
estadounidense garantizado por el TLC, las textileras mexicanas
prosperan mientras entran firmas extranjeras para aprovechar los
bajos salarios de Mexico y su eficiente fuerza laboral.
 &HT;    Algunos optimistas llegan a pronosticar que Mexico se convertira
en el Hong Kong de America Latina, el lider en todos los aspectos
del negocio textil, desde las fibras y los tejidos hasta la ropa.
Las condiciones de trabajo son muy variadas. Pero en un pais tan
necesitado de empleos como Mexico, las preocupaciones por la
calidad de los trabajos ocupan muchas veces un lugar secundario
frente a la necesidad de mas empleo.
 &HT;    En terminos de volumen, Mexico ha exportado mas productos
textiles a EU que China desde 1996. En valor en dolares, ocupo el
primer lugar este ano, con US$2.900 millones entre enero y mayo, un
aumento del 25,3 por ciento.
 &HT;    Bancomext, el banco estatal de comercio exterior, calcula que el
total de exportaciones textiles de Mexico podria llegar a US$9.600
millones para fin de ano, mas que el valor esperado de las
exportaciones petroleras.
 &HT;    ``Ha ocurrido una transformacion muy importante en el sector
textil al invertir las companias en nuevos equipos,'' dice Jaime
Farell Campos, que estudia el sector en Bancomext. ``Mas
recientemente, la industria ha aprovechado el TLC para buscar
mercados nuevos.''
 &HT;    Mexico tambien se convierte en un importante foco de las
multinacionales del sector textil, atraidas por el acceso rapido y
facil al mercadoestadounidense y por los salarios, que empiezan en
unos US$120 al mes para obreros no calificados. Empresas
norteamericanas como Tommy Hilfiger y Phillips-Van Heusen Corp.
hacen camisas, mientras Wrangler y The Gap ensamblan jeans. Du Pont
S.A., filial del gigante estadounidense de los productos quimicos
Du Pont, fabrica fibras sinteticas.
 &HT;    Solo en los ultimos meses, Du Pont y Alfa, de Monterrey, han
anunciado inversiones de US$450 millones para impulsar la
produccion de nilon y construir una nueva fabrica de poliester en
la ciudad portuaria de Altamira. El fabricante norteamericano
Guilford Mills destina US$100 millones a una planta de tejido,
tinte y acabado en Altamira. Varias empresas asiaticas tambien
montan fabricas.
 &HT;    Mas recientemente, Burlington Industries, de Estados Unidos, que
fabrica productos textiles, ropa y productos para el hogar, anuncio
el plan de invertir US$80 millones en los proximos tres anos en la
construccion de cuatro fabricas de ropa en Mexico. Cuando esten
listas, las nuevas operaciones de corte y costura agregaran US$225
millones a las ventas anuales de la compania de US$2.000 millones.
``La combinacion de nuestras plantas en Estados Unidos y nuestras
instalaciones en Mexico nos da una capacidad de competencia
internacional y ofrece nuevas oportunidades de crecimiento,'' dijo
George Henderson III, presidente del directorio de Burlington, al
hacer el anuncio.
 &HT;    En total, la Camara Nacional de la Industria Textil espera que
las empresas textiles gasten al menos US$1.200 millones en los dos
anos proximos en la modernizacion y construccion de plantas.
 &HT;    ``El TLC esta impulsando todo este crecimiento, y la idea en Du
Pont es fabricar estos productos en Norteamerica,'' dice Horacio
Ojeda, director de planificacion de negocios en la division de
fibras de Du Pont S.A. ``Pero es mas que eso. Tambien estamos
interesados en la exportacion a los mercados de Europa,
Latinoamerica y Asia.''
 &HT;    Aun quedan retos. Paradojicamente, Mexico es mas fuerte en
produccion de fibras y en corte y costura, la operacion en la que
la tela se convierte en vestidos. Pero es mas debil en la fase
intermedia de produccion de tejidos, o sea, la transformacion de
fibras en tela.
 &HT;    Esa situacion puede cambiar pronto. A fines del ano pasado,
Burlington Industries anuncio que invertiria por lo menos US$200
millones en dos nuevas fabricas de tejidos y en una de hilazas, en
empresa conjunta con Parkdale Mills, de Estados Unidos. Las tres
plantas, situadas en el estado de Morelos, estan casi terminadas.
Los funcionarios de gobierno quieren mas instalaciones de ese tipo.
 &HT;    ``Esperamos que las companias que solo ensamblan comiencen a
agregar mas valor a nivel local, con la incorporacion de mas tela y
fibras de produccion nacional,'' dice Farell Campos, de Bancomext.
``El objetivo es crear mas valor agregado en Mexico.''
 &HT;    Los gobiernos de los estados tambien desean un mayor volumen de
inversion. En Morelos, al sur de Mexico D.F., Du Pont, Alfa,
Burlington Industries y Guilford Mills patrocinaron el proyecto
Nustart, el primer parque industrial de Mexico dedicado
exclusivamente a los productos textiles. Nustart se inauguro en
1997 y ya esta completamente vendido.
 &HT;    Ahora estados como Guanajuato, Oaxaca y Jalisco (ansiosos por
contar con los cientos de empleos de poca calificacion que genera
la industria textil) tratan de captar proyectos similares.
 &HT;    En otras partes de Mexico, la industria textil se ha convertido
en un importante motor economico. Torreon, en el norteno estado de
Coahuila, ha llegado a ser un gran centro de produccion de tela
para jeans, lo que ha revitalizado al sector algodonero local. ``Mi
hermana se muda a Torreon y no puede encontrar una casa,'' dice
Ojeda, de Du Pont.
 &HT;    Los afanes de Brasil. Mientras la industria textil de Mexico
prospera, Brasil enfrenta problemas debido a la gran baja de la
produccion de algodon, abundantes despidos y un gran numero de
fabricantes que se han ido a la bancarrota o han cerrado sus
negocios.
 &HT;    La crisis comenzo en 1995, cuando el presidente Cardoso
implemento su programa de estabilizacion economica, el Plan Real.
Aunque el plan redujo sustancialmente la inflacion, tambien puso en
peligro a industrias nacionales que no estaban preparadas para
afrontar la politica de libre comercio del gobierno.
 &HT;    ``Fue un desastre,'' dice Ricardo Steinbruch, director de
Vicunha Nordeste, el mayor fabricante de jeans y tela para jeans de
Sudamerica. ``Brasil se convirtio en la cesta de la basura de los
productos asiaticos. En Asia bajaban los precios hasta el minimo y
los enviaban para aca``.
 &HT;    El gobierno comprendio su error y tomo ciertas medidas para
reducir el impacto de la invasion asiatica, como un control mas
riguroso de las licencias de exportacion y precios minimos de
referencia para los productos de Asia.
 &HT;    La industria textil todavia no ha recuperado su vigor. Hace
menos de 10 anos, era una de las principales fuentes de empleo de
Brasil, con una fuerza laboral de mas de 540.000 empleados. Esa
cifra se ha reducido casi en la mitad, a 246.500, segun el
Instituto de Estudios y Mercadeo Industrial (IEMI).
 &HT;    Eso no es todo. La cantidad de empresas textiles ha disminuido
de 4.938 en 1990 a un estimado de 3.638 en 1997. En la ciudad de
Americana, el centro textil tradicional del estado de Sao Paulo,
mas del 50 por ciento de las 1.300 empresas textiles y fabricas de
ropa han cerrado o han quebrado desde 1995.
 &HT;    La produccion de algodon tambien ha bajado, de 1,8 millones de
toneladas en 1992 a un millon de toneladas el ano pasado, debido
principalmente a que los productos importados son mas baratos que
los de produccion nacional. ``Los fabricantes prefieren importar,
aceptando prestamos de instituciones extranjeras con tasas de
interes mas bajas que las locales,'' explica Ana Paula Gorini,
analista de la industria textil en el Banco Nacional de Desarrollo
Economico y Social (BNDES).
 &HT;    Como resultado, los productos textiles pierden importancia para
la economia brasilena. La industria solo aporto el 1,1 por ciento
del producto interno bruto del pais en 1996, que es la cifra
oficial mas reciente divulgada por el Instituto Brasileno de
Geografia y Estadisticas (IBGE).
 &HT;    Entre las principales entidades de la industria estan Rhodia y
Alpargatas Santista Textil, en Sao Paulo; Coteminas, en Minas
Gerais, y Vicunha, en Sao Paulo y en el estado de Ceara. Las
companias extranjeras, entre ellas Du Pont, de Estados Unidos, y
Polyenka, de Holanda, componen alrededor del 13 por ciento de la
industria textil en Brasil.
 &HT;    La produccion se extiende desde fibras basicas (productos
basicos de rayon y filamentos de poliester) hasta tela para jeans,
sarga y confeccion de disenador. Aproximadamente el 20 por ciento
de la produccion de Brasil se exporta, sobre todo a otros paises
latinoamericanos y Europa.
 &HT;    En esta contienda por la supervivencia del mas apto, las
empresas han reducido personal, instalado maquinaria computarizada
y aumentado la capacidad de competencia internacional de sus
plantas. Algunas incluso han emigrado a las zonas
centrooccidentales y septentrionales de Brasil, para aprovechar los
incentivos fiscales y la mano de obra barata. Los obreros de
confecciones del Nordeste, por ejemplo, ganan US$3 al dia, menos de
la mitad del salario que perciben sus colegas del sur de Brasil.
 &HT;    Las textileras del Caribe. Mientras la industria textil de
Brasil se rejuvenece, Centroamerica y el Caribe, junto con Mexico,
sustituyen gradualmente a Asia como centro de produccion de
exportaciones textiles a Estados Unidos, especialmente en el sector
de las maquiladoras.
 &HT;    Los paises que pertenecen a la Iniciativa de la Cuenca del
Caribe (ICC) vieron crecer su participacion en las importaciones
textiles de Estados Unidos del 16 por ciento en 1992 a casi el 24
por ciento en 1997. Solo el ano pasado, sus exportaciones a Estados
Unidos aumentaron el 26 por ciento, a US$7.700 millones, segun el
Departamento de Comercio estadounidense. En los primeros cinco
meses de 1998, crecieron otro 12 por ciento.
 &HT;    Varias companias norteamericanas tienen fabricas textiles en la
region que aprovechan el bajo costo de la mano de obra, el trato
fiscal favorable y la proximidad a Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    Sara Lee es una de las mayores, con operaciones en toda la
region. Su division de generos de punto, que fabrica camisetas y
ropa interior Hanes y Hanes Her Way, tiene fabricas en Costa Rica,
la Republica Dominicana y Jamaica, mientras su division Champion
tiene fabricas de ropa en Costa Rica. Entretanto, Bali, su division
de ropa intima, produce sostenes en Costa Rica, la Republica
Dominicana y Honduras.
 &HT;    Aunque el negocio textil con Estados Unidos esta en alza, los
paises de la ICC han pedido tener las mismas ventajas de las
naciones del TLC para recuperar el nivel de crecimiento alcanzado
antes de que el acuerdo entrara en vigor.
 &HT;    Han logrado algun progreso. El presidente norteamericano Bill
Clinton prometio cierto alivio durante su viaje a Costa Rica, en
1997. Hasta incluyo en su presupuesto de 1998 un plan para ampliar
los beneficios comerciales para la ropa y los productos textiles de
los paises de la ICC.
 &HT;    Pero en noviembre del ano pasado, una propuesta de ley que
habria eliminado todas las cuotas y aranceles a las importaciones
textiles de la ICC, se esfumo dos dias antes de que la malograda
propuesta de la via rapida sucumbiera en la Camara de
Representantes.
 &HT;    El Senado norteamericano ahora considera un proyecto similar,
pero esta vez solo se permitiria la entrada libre a los productos
fabricados con tejidos producidos en Estados Unidos. Si el Congreso
no aprueba la medida al finalizar en octubre el periodo de
sesiones, habra que esperar hasta el ano proximo.
 &HT;    Los lideres de la industria, tanto en Estados Unidos como en
Centroamerica, estan visiblemente descontentos con la nueva medida.
``La propuesta (de la Camara) era buena porque habria dado a las
naciones de la ICC los mismos beneficios de que disfruta Mexico y
habria dado pie a mas acuerdos de libre comercio con Estados
Unidos,'' dice Erik Autor, asesor de comercio internacional de
National Retail Federation, un grupo comercial radicado en Estados
Unidos. Alfredo Milian Jerez, coordinador de la comision de
asesoria del sector textil en la Asociacion Salvadorena de
Industriales (ASI), se queja: ``La idea que tienen en Estados
Unidos de paridad no es paridad.''
 &HT;    Aun sin una paridad con las naciones del TLC, varios paises
centroamericanos y antillanos han logrado convertirse en centros
importantes de la industria textil latinoamericana.
 &HT;    El sector textil de la Republica Dominicana, por ejemplo, ha
despegado.
 &HT;    En los ultimos cinco anos, las exportaciones a Estados Unidos
han aumentado casi el 50 por ciento en valor en dolares, y ahora el
pais caribeno es el mayor exportador de productos textiles entre
los paises de la ICC, con mas de 80 empresas que fabrican desde
camisetas y blusas hasta shorts, pantalones y faldas.
 &HT;    A este desarrollo ha contribuido el hecho de que el pais
suprimio barreras comerciales a los productos textiles. El ano
pasado, el presidente Leonel Fernandez elimino todos los impuestos
a la importacion de materia prima para la industria textil, como
tejidos, hilazas, productos quimicos, maquinaria, equipos y piezas.
Eran sustanciales: de acuerdo con el informe del Departamento de
Comercio de Estados Unidos, los impuestos a productos importados
eran del 10 por ciento al 25 por ciento del valor del producto, y
un impuesto ad valorem por la transferencia de productos y
servicios llegaba al 8 por ciento.
 &HT;    La apertura no solo ayudo a los productores norteamericanos (que
suministran el 65 por ciento de las importaciones) a vender mas en
la Republica Dominicana. Tambien ayudo a los productores del pais,
que pudieron incrementar la produccion y renovar maquinarias para
mejorar su rendimiento.
 &HT;    Honduras tambien es un productor importante. En exportaciones
textiles, ocupa el quinto puesto a nivel mundial, el segundo entre
los paises de la ICC y el primero en America Central. En el periodo
de 12 meses que concluyo en mayo, exporto productos textiles y ropa
por valor de US$1.700 millones, casi el 22 por ciento mas que en el
mismo lapso del ano pasado.
 &HT;    Companias como Sara Lee y Fruit of the Loom han abierto fabricas
en Honduras, mientras minoristas como JC Penney, The Gap, Wal-Mart
y The Limited han contratado a empresas locales para que les
ensamblen ropa.
 &HT;    Al lado, en El Salvador, la industria textil ha recibido un duro
golpe del TLC y de la propia estrategia monetaria del gobierno
salvadoreno. Pero el pais se las arregla para lograr algun
crecimiento.
 &HT;    El Salvador es el decimo exportador de productos textiles a
Estados Unidos, con un volumen de US$1.250 millones en 1997. Su
participacion en el total del mercado importador de Estados Unidos
crecio de menos del 1 por ciento en 1992 a mas del 3 por ciento en
1997.
 &HT;    El Salvador tiene 240 maquilas de corte y costura o de corte,
costura y acabado de productos textiles. De ellas, aproximadamente
el 30 por ciento son de propiedad extranjera, principalmente de
firmas estadounidenses como County Line Sportwear, Brooklyn
Manufacturing y Sara Lee Intimates, y de firmas surcoreanas como
Daewoo. Pero constituyen alrededor del 70 por ciento del volumen
total de exportaciones del sector y generan unos 70.000 empleos.
Ademas, El Salvador tiene unas 30 fabricas textiles que dan empleo
a unas 10.000 personas. Otras 250 a 300 plantas menores estan
dirigidas al mercado interno.
 &HT;    Aparte del TLC, los productores y exportadores salvadorenos han
sufrido los efectos de una politica monetaria gubernamental de
estrechas miras, que ha mantenido el colon a un tipo de cambio fijo
en los ultimos cinco anos.
 &HT;    La estrategia se concibio con el fin de impulsar la estabilidad
macroeconomica y atraer al capital foraneo. Pero el pais aun esta a
la zaga de todos sus vecinos en inversion extranjera directa, que
en 1996 fue solo de US$25 millones (la ultima cifra disponible)
segun el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID), con sede en
Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    El tipo de cambio fijo castiga, en efecto, a los exportadores y
productores salvadorenos. Los exportadores estan en desventaja
frente a los de paises como Mexico y Honduras, que han devaluado
sus monedas en los ultimos anos.
 &HT;    Fuentes del sector tambien dicen que la politica monetaria
subsidia a las importaciones, lo que junto con la reduccion de los
aranceles a la importacion, amenaza la posicion de los productores
locales en el mercado interno.
 &HT;    Para colmo, El Salvador tiene los costos de produccion y de mano
de obra mas altos de la region despues de Costa Rica. Y mientras
Costa Rica disfruta de un nivel de educacion mas alto y de una
imagen de seguridad, El Salvador esta considerado el pais mas
violento del hemisferio, segun un estudio que realizo el BID en
1997. La inquietud por la seguridad publica ha alejado a muchas
firmas extranjeras.
 &HT;    Desde que comenzo a exportar a principios de los anos 80,
Guatemala tambien se ha convertido en un gran productor textil de
la region. Ofrece a los inversionistas extranjeros una gran
variedad de ventajas fiscales, principalmente en las zonas de libre
comercio.
 &HT;    La consecuencia ha sido que sus exportaciones de ropa han
crecido de US$5,5 millones en 1986 a US$299 millones el ano pasado,
segun el Banco de Guatemala. En el primer trimestre de este ano,
las exportaciones guatemaltecas aumentaron el 18 por ciento, a
US$115 millones.
 &HT;    Pero el TLC le quito fuerza a la industria textil de Guatemala.
Desde que el acuerdo entro en vigor, las exportaciones textileras
del pais centroamericano han bajado del 44,2 por ciento en 1994 al
6,7 por ciento el ano pasado.
 &HT;    Guatemala solo tuvo un respiro. En mayo, Washington elimino una
restriccion a las importaciones de algodon y faldas de fibras
hechas a mano de Guatemala. No es poca cosa: Guatemala es el cuarto
suministrador de faldas de EU, con el 6,3 por ciento del mercado,
despues de la India, Mexico y Taiwan.
 &HT;    Guatemala ahora quiere ofrecer mas produccion, lo que ayudaria
al sector de la ropa a desarrollar mas industrias de apoyo.
 &HT;    El sector emplea a 54.000 personas en 234 fabricas en distintos
puntos del pais, que producen una gran variedad de articulos:
camisas tejidas y de punto, pantalones de algodon, pantalones
cortos, faldas y abrigos, faldas y pantalones de lana.
 &HT;    Al igual que Guatemala, Costa Rica establecio zonas de libre
comercio hace varios anos para importar productos libres de
aranceles. El pais ahora tiene un activo negocio con companias que
importan tela cortada, la ensamblan y la exportan a Estados Unidos
y Europa, o la venden dentro del pais y al Mercado Comun
Centroamericano. En Costa Rica hay mas de 50 de estas firmas.
 &HT;    Pero el verdadero impulso ocurrio en 1995, cuando Costa Rica
firmo un acuerdo de libre comercio con Mexico. El trato elimino los
aranceles a la ropa manufacturada con materiales hechos en el
extranjero por un valor de US$5 millones, con un incremento del 15
por ciento anual hasta fines de 1999, cuando el pacto quedara
abolido.
 &HT;    Lo que es mas importante, el pacto entre Costa Rica y Mexico
establecio que cada una de las dos naciones podia exportar a la
otra una cantidad ilimitada de ropa no contemplada en el acuerdo
siempre que en el pais receptor no haya el tejido necesario para
hacer los productos con el precio, la calidad y la cantidad que
requiera el fabricante.
 &HT;    El convenio llevo a muchas grandes empresas norteamericanas a
abrir o ampliar operaciones de manufactura o ensamblado en Costa
Rica, como Hanes Tejidos Costa Rica y Manufacturera de Cartago,
divisiones de Sara Lee que producen ropa intima para senoras y
ninas; Centro Industrial Manufacturero El Roble, concesionario de
Levi Strauss en America Central, y Warner's de Costa Rica, que
produce lenceria para mujeres.
 &HT;    ``Con la apertura de tiendas de Wal-Mart y otros detallistas en
Mexico, operar en Costa Rica tiene mucho sentido para una compania
estadounidense, ya que puede exportar tanto a Mexico como al
mercado de Estados Unidos,'' comenta Jerry Watkins, gerente general
de Cartex Manufacturera, division de Harwood Companies (Estados
Unidos), que ensambla shorts para hombres en Cartago.
 &HT;    La prueba esta en los numeros. Segun la Camara Textil
Costarricense (CATECO), las exportaciones textileras del pais
aumentaron el 16,8 por ciento el ano pasado, a US$788,4 millones.
En la primera mitad de este ano, sumaron US$359,7 millones. El 95
por ciento de las exportaciones textiles de Costa Rica se dirige a
Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    Perspectivas. Aunque el TLC y la repercusion de la crisis
asiatica han dado un duro golpe a las industrias textiles de varios
paises latinoamericanos, hay una gran dosis de optimismo.
 &HT;    Los analistas pronostican que Mexico seguira impulsando sus
exportaciones y captando nuevas inversiones. Se espera que America
Central y el Caribe se conviertan en centros textiles mas
desarrollados, mientras ejercen presion para lograr los mismos
beneficios del TLC. Y Brasil se empena en aumentar su eficiencia
para combatir las importaciones baratas de Asia.
 &HT;    En realidad, en esta economia mundial en pleno crecimiento, en
la region se espera que sobrevivan solo las empresas textiles mas
vigorosas. ``Hemos llegado al fin del camino,'' dice Steinbruch, de
Vicunha. ``Los que no fueron capaces de modernizarse, se han
retirado, y los que quedan estan listos para competir en un mercado
globalizado.'' Asia, en guardia.

<P>
   While the teacher settled his class down for a discussion of
``The Iliad,'' a 14-year-old student, Magnus Elhardt, chuckled at a
classmate's wisecrack. The moment was typical of a high school
literature class, except the teacher was 150 miles away, the
classmate was 3,000 miles away, and Magnus, a home-schooled student
in Thousand Oaks, Calif., was sitting in front of a computer in his
family's kitchen. His mother, Maria, was ironing a shirt a few feet
away.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson, transmitted via computer speakers and computer
screen, had the give-and-take of a classroom, complete with student
banter and teacher scolding. But on this particular morning, the
teacher, Fritz Hinrichs, was giving a lecture that was dogged by
audio bugs _ stutters, reverberations and interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the class was reminiscent of the Apollo 13 mission,
with Houston frantically trying to reach an errant spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   The technology may be rough, but educational experiments like
Hinrichs' are becoming increasingly common among home schoolers.
Since the 1980s, home schooling has largely been viewed as an
option for religious fundamentalists and ``Whole Earth Catalog''
types, but there may be a shift in the reasons people choose that
approach.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the number of home schoolers has tripled, and many
participating families say they see home schooling as an
alternative to mediocre public schools and expensive private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is difficult to categorize those participating in
home schooling, Patricia Lines, a researcher at the federal
Department of Education, said that in Florida, considered a
bellwether state, a survey of home schoolers revealed a shift in
recent years in the reasons for choosing home schooling:
dissatisfaction with public and private schools was listed first
most often, moving ahead of religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean they're secular home schoolers, but their
primary motivation has shifted,'' Lines said.
</P>
<P>
   Home-schooled children now number one million, according to
Lines, or 1.6 million, according to Dr. Brian Ray, a researcher at
the National Home Education Research Institute, a home-schooling
advocacy and research organization based in Oregon. (The estimates
are based on different sources _ it is difficult to track the
home-schooling population because reporting rules and mandatory
school requirements vary by state.)
</P>
<P>
   Technology is playing a role in the popularity of home schooling
by providing a support system for novices and helping to blur the
line between school-based and home-based education.
</P>
<P>
   Home schoolers, as a group, own computers at a higher rate than
other American families. As of 1996, as many as 86 percent of home
schoolers had computers and almost as many were using them to teach
their children, according to a study by Ray.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, computer ownership was less common among the
general population of families with children. Twenty-four percent
of single-mother households and 58 percent of married-couple
households with children owned computers, according to 1997 figures
from the United States Department of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Computers can give home-schooling parents expert support for
college-preparatory and elective courses for children of high
school age, and a large number of children taught at home in the
1980s have now reached adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Home-schooling sites on the Web range from online academies to
support groups for home-schooling parents. There are virtual
trading posts where home schoolers barter for used books or
supplies, and Web pages catering to special interest groups, like
self-described pagan home schoolers and home schoolers in military
families.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging role of the Internet in home schooling has cracked
open the door to more collaboration between home schoolers and
schools and led to more interest in home-based learning.
</P>
<P>
   In regions where home schooling is so popular that it threatens
the financial health of public school districts, some school
leaders have used computers to lure home schoolers partway back to
the fold. In 1997, an Alaska school district seeking to raise funds
to build a public boarding school developed a program that offered
home schoolers the use of new computers (for a $200 refundable
deposit), free curriculum supplies and support from an expert
teacher if they would enroll in the district.
</P>
<P>
   The families kept home schooling, but their enrollment allowed
the district to qualify for more state aid. The program attracted
2,000 applicants, far exceeding district estimates, and the extra
state money helped pay for the new school. Similar programs are in
place in Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   Some public school districts and charter schools are going a
step further, offering their curriculums on line. Usually such
services are free for home schoolers who pay local taxes; others
must pay tuition.
</P>
<P>
   One of the pioneering online districts, the Federal Way School
District in Washington State, began offering its Internet Academy
(169.204.208.10/Ia/newlook.htm) to home schoolers three years ago.
In its second year, only 2 of the 250 families enrolled dropped out
because of technical problems.
</P>
<P>
   The academy's principal, Linda McInturff, attributes the
program's success both to its strong technical assistance, both on
line and by phone, and to the home schoolers' willingness to help
one another.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I have found them adopting each other,'' Ms. McInturff said.
``They are so excited about getting our curriculum that they're
willing to go the extra mile.''
</P>
<P>
   Janie Levine Hellyer, a home schooler in Olympia, Wash., said on
her four-year-old online support network, the Family Learning
Exchange (www.flexonline.org): ``Home school parents, by design,
are motivated, Home schoolers aren't afraid to ask questions.''
</P>
<P>
   There is disagreement among home-schooling leaders about whether
the cyberwave is a major, positive trend or a minor, negative one.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who see technology in home schooling in a rosy light
are Mary Pride, publisher of Practical Homeschooling, a bimonthly
magazine published in Fenton, Mo., and Michael Farris, president of
the Home School Legal Defense Association, a lobbying group based
in Purcellville, Va.
</P>
<P>
   They characterize technology as a tool that makes it possible to
offer advanced classes to the growing number of home schoolers of
high school age and as a way to draw school-based students to home
schooling. They predict extensive growth in the number of home
schoolers using technology for direct instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe what we're seeing today is not even the tip of the
iceberg _ it's the glistening of the water underneath the
iceberg,'' said Farris, who offers a yearlong constitutional law
class on line.
</P>
<P>
   Home-schooling traditionalists, both religious and secular,
express concern about the trend toward high-tech schooling. The
skeptics include Susannah Sheffer, editor of Growing Without
Schooling, a 21-year-old bimonthly magazine, and Matt Hern, a
writer and home-schooling advocate. They see technology as, at
best, a minor tool that merely encourages the social networking
that home schoolers have done all along and, at worst, as an
unhealthy replacement for face-to-face community building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is not to slip into some kind of Luddite freak-out
but to realize that technology always replaces something,'' Hern
said. ``As a culture, we have an inability to limit our access to
technology and our use of tools like the TV and the car. To say
that to be a good home learner you've got to have a $5,000 Pentium
computer in the living room is confirming the elitist perception of
home schoolers.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Technology enthusiasts like Mrs. Pride, the publisher, counter
that the anti-computer home schoolers _ particularly those
affiliated with the so-called unschooling movement, which rejects
most packaged educational programs in favor of more free-form
learning activities guided by children's interests _ are the
elitists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think unschoolers sometimes exaggerate the benefits of doing
everything yourself,'' she said. ``There is a reason I don't pump
my own water and build my own well and make my own electricity and
grind my own wheat. Yes, I could be doing these things, but if the
objective is to have kids with characters and have a good
education, there are many routes to reach it. I feel to limit
yourself and say, I have to do it all myself, is a mistake. The
outsiders _ they are used to delegating things to other people.
It's this group we're discussing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pride holds degrees in electrical engineering and computer
systems engineering and was author of one of the first books
providing extensive software reviews for home schoolers in the
early 1990s, ``Pride's Guide to Educational Software'' (Crossway
Books, $25).
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pride has 10 computers in her home, three telephone lines
connectible to the Internet, and five children enrolled in online
courses. She has experienced the headaches and joys of using
technology for home-based learning. ``My 11-year-old is always
downloading some dumb game that I always have to delete,'' she
said, but the computers have been an unqualified godsend for her
18-year-old son, Theodore. He was born with fibromuscular
disproportion, a condition that led to uneven muscle development.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, he suffered a life-threatening bout of pneumonia
and endured a series of painful operations for scoliosis. Today he
lives with three steel rods attached to his spine and one-third
normal lung capacity. During his recuperation, his home-schooling
curriculum increasingly focused on the computer, and he was a
tester for several online learning academies.
</P>
<P>
   He still requires breathing assistance at night, but he has
nearly completed school and has started two Web-based businesses,
one that creates Web sites and one that monitors and updates
company Web sites, both of which he operates from two computers in
his bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Learning at home without computers would be much more
difficult and much less interesting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hundred years ago, he would have died,'' Mrs. Pride said.
``Fifty years ago, he wouldn't have been able to finish his own
education or have a job.'' Mrs. Pride is convinced that the
home-schooling movement will grow because technology increases the
comfort level of ``outsiders'' to the prospect of teaching their
own children.
</P>
<P>
   Even die-hard home schoolers like Maria Elhardt and her son
Magnus can see the advantages to getting some help. Neither felt up
to the task of tackling Homer on their own. The weekly online
sessions with Hinrichs might have static, but they provide a solid
structure for some challenging reading.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like it because I do learn a lot and it gives me an
opportunity to read these books,'' Magnus Elhardt said. ``I
probably would not do it on my own because of the length.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother added that Hinrichs knew more than she did about
Greek poetry and could do a much better job teaching the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for teaching expertise inspired Janet Hale, 40, a
longtime schoolteacher, to quit her job and reinvent herself as a
digital tutorial entrepreneur. The result is Willoway Cyberschool
(www.willoway.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who have never home-schooled before are
hesitant to start because they feel they're going to be completely
responsible for their child's education,'' Mrs. Hale said. ``Now
there's teachers behind it all.''
</P>
<P>
   She now operates from a nerve center in her Reading, Pa., home,
complete with eight computers and numerous tiny eyeball
videocameras so she can conduct classes via videoconferencing.
</P>
<P>
   For tuition of $2,250, she works with 40 home-schooled
middle-schoolers around the country as their full-time online
teacher. Her program is grounded in technology. Students create Web
pages to hand in assignments and form groups to take part in
teacher-guided Web searches for social studies and science lessons.
</P>
<P>
   To appeal to a broader audience, Mrs. Hale is seeking formal
accreditation for her program and planning to market it to schools
seeking support for supplemental gifted programs.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mrs. Hale and Hinrichs see technology as an opportunity for
teachers to tailor their work to their own needs. ``The bane of
teaching is paperwork _ teachers spend all their time doing
paperwork for the administration,'' said Hinrichs, 30, who founded
Escondido Tutorial Service (www.gbt.org) close to five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get to read. I get to really play the role of a scholar and
teacher.'' Today he and a partner in Idaho electronically teach a
total of 300 students through a $10,000 computer system run out of
Hinrichs' home, each earning a comfortable income of more than
$55,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   They teach classes at assigned times all day long using cameras
and microphones, and charge students a class-by-class subscription
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Easy access to proven expertise and guidance is a key appeal of
other online academies, too.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Pierce, 42, a home schooler in Boston, was overwhelmed by
the responsibilities of teaching her eldest daughter
high-school-level mathematics several years ago. She had to
compromise by reluctantly sending her teen-age daughter to junior
college classes to complete her high-school education.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she solves the same problem by linking her younger
children to Scholars Online and Regina Coeli Academies, a pair of
online educational programs offered by the Institute for Study of
the Liberal Arts and Science, a nonprofit corporation. These
academies link students to expert tutors in all the basic
high-school subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be lost trying to figure out the formulas and stuff,''
said Mrs. Pierce, who now works for the two online academies. The
academies began in 1995 as a Compuserve discussion group for a few
students by Linda Robinson, a schoolteacher in Louisiana at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Today the academies attract 140 students in 33 states, Canada
and South America. Classes include live chat, e-mailed assignments,
tips on Web surfing and help for parents in organizing the
curriculum. Junior-high-school classes cost $250 a year and
high-school classes range from $300 to $350 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The program technology is simple, like a ``schoolbus'' as Mrs.
Pierce puts it: ``It gets you there.'' The teachers work from their
home computers, monitoring chat sessions, fielding homework filed
by e-mail and organizing bulletin board discussions.
</P>
<P>
   As much as anything else related to technology, the online
tutorial is a communication form in transition. Will the ultimate
form lean toward canned lessons available through streaming video
coupled with moment-to-moment recording of student performance on
an online database, as Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft,
proposes?
</P>
<P>
   Or will it lean toward live lessons with video, audio and
various collaborative tools, as Hinrichs' model does? That may be
one of those questions answerable only by time and technical
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   The potential benefits of live interaction were obvious while
watching Magnus Elhardt study Homer. The students chattered in
class just as students do everywhere, only this time, their jokes
about the teacher's long-winded lecture and age were typed into the
chat page for everyone, including the teacher, to see.
</P>
<P>
   Several times, Hinrichs had to remind students not to just type
out their answers but to do the online equivalent of raising their
hands _ typing an exclamation point. There was something comforting
and familiar about this interaction, and both Magnus and his mother
enjoyed the interplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell the smart aleck in the class,'' said his mother,
peeking over his head at the computer screen.

 By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many homeowners become complacent about home security because
they think they have nothing worth stealing. What these homeowners
fail to realize is that a majority of burglars have no way of
knowing what is inside a home. Most break in hoping to get lucky.
Given enough time, a burglar will try to make his own luck by
tearing into a house, ripping apart upholstery, breaking up
cabinets and tearing pictures from the walls looking for salable
items.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small percentage of burglaries are the result of careful
planning and execution by seasoned professionals. Most are done by
a lone individual in need of money who drives around looking for
likely targets.
</P>
<P>
   What makes any house a good target? A number of groups have done
studies on the subject, usually based on interviews with actual
burglars. Since many burglars have their own individual methods and
preferences, the results are far from conclusive, but a number of
important factors are evident.
</P>
<P>
   One factor that influences many burglars is location. They
usually operate within 5 to 10 miles of their homes. When scouting
out neighborhoods for possible targets, they look for areas near
major traffic arteries, expressways or throughfares that may offer
a quick getaway. Usually they avoid houses on dead-end streets,
cul-de-sacs or circles.
</P>
<P>
   There is some debate on the effectiveness of street lighting in
deterring break-ins. Most law enforcement agencies maintain that
homes on well-lighted streets are less likely to be burglarized
than those on dark streets. Some studies have shown that street
lights are not a significant factor because a surprising number of
break-ins occur during the daytime, when the occupants are at work
and in school.
</P>
<P>
   When discussing potential targets, some burglars indicated a
preference for corner houses, while others liked homes in the
middle of the street. Some picked secluded houses, and some
preferred houses on busy streets. All burglars, however, agreed
that unoccupied houses were prime targets. Thus it behooves any
homeowner to make the house look occupied even when he is out.
</P>
<P>
   If you are away from home for long periods, you can make it look
as if your house is occupied by having a housesitter drop by at
different times. It may also be possible to prevail on a trusted
neighbor who spends most of the time at home to come over during
the day to open the curtains, draw the blinds or raise a few window
shades.
</P>
<P>
   You can also set up props to create the illusion of activity
around the house. Positioned on the front porch, things like a
child's tricycle, a snow shovel in the winter or a garden rake
suggest that someone is in the house and make come out to retrieve
them at any moment. When choosing props, select items that are not
so valuable or attractive as to invite theft themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Remember to stop all deliveries if you intend to be away for
long. Have a neighbor pick up the mail every day, and arrange to
have someone mow the lawn in the summer and shovel the walk in the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Your home should never be totally dark at night. It's best to
install timers to turn interior lights on and off periodically.
Exterior lights should also be regulated by timers or
photosensitive activators. All exterior lights should be protected
by wire guards so they cannot be smashed, and thus disabled, by
burglars or vandals.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of home burglar alarms is still open to
debate. It largely depends on the system itself. It seems that an
alarm system with lights and sirens may not be so effective as a
system that is connected to a law enforcement agency.
</P>
<P>
   Burglars themselves give alarms mixed reviews. Most say they may
enter a house with an alarm, but they will retreat if they trip it.
</P>
<P>
   Another deterrent strategy involves marking valuable items by
engraving an identification number on them. Often, local police
stations will lend the homeowner an electric engraving tool. This
effectiveness of this ploy, however, draws mixed reactions. Most
insurance companies, for example, point out that the engraved items
are no more likely to be recovered after a burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best deterrent against burglary is a network of
watchful neighbors. Unfortunately, most people, particularly in
large cities, feel that it is in their best interest to mind their
own business. Hence they often ignore strangers and suspicious
vehicles in the area.

The two studies were designed to test an idea on which many

combining three powerful antiviral drugs, the ``cocktail,'' might
diminish HIV infection to such a low level that the virus could
then be kept in check by fewer drugs and the body's own immune
system. That way, instead of having to take the triple combination
for life, as some experts had predicted would be necessary,
patients might be able to back off and escape some of the side

market investments. The plan would raise the tax paid on those
transactions to 0.38 percent from 0.2 percent now. A tax on
corporate earnings will rise to 3 percent from 2 percent. The most
sensitive measure would raise the social security tax paid by
government employees and _ for the first time _ collect the tax
from retired civil servants. The extra revenue is expected to come
to $2.2 billion. The actions are expected to slow the economy and
increase unemployment. By Diana Jean Schemo.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Daniel Shiffman, a lanky 25-year-old who is a self-proclaimed
computer geek, was never an athletic powerhouse. At the small
private high school he attended in his native Baltimore, he was
often ``well down near the bottom of gym class,'' he recalled with
a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   But when he is playing games on line, sitting in a loft
apartment in downtown Manhattan that he shares with three Net-smart
roommates and 16 computers, Shiffman, a financial planner and
freelance computer consultant, is a nimble giant of a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   His opponents, all sitting at their own computers somewhere
(anywhere, as long as they are connected to the Internet), know
only that he is a master player, capable of wielding a computer
joystick with the alacrity of Wayne Gretzky on the ice and pounding
his keyboard with speed and accuracy that might make boxing champ
Evander Holyfield wince.
</P>
<P>
   His game is Myth: The Fallen Lords, a world of magical
characters, intricate strategies and sudden death. Each player can
play against all the other players or in teams. As many as 16 can
participate in a game session.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer of this wildly popular game, Bungie Software,
offers advice that gives a glimpse into the game's free-for-all:
``Kill your enemies. Kill your friends' enemies. Kill your
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become an obsession of mine,'' Shiffman said happily
earlier this month in an interview at the Internet World conference
in New York. ``The novelty is that you are not playing yourself in
a dark corner of a room somewhere, but you are interacting with
actual people.''
</P>
<P>
   Shiffman has joined the swelling ranks of people who are finding
greater challenges and just more downright fun by using their
computers to play the cagiest opponents of them all: other people.
</P>
<P>
   They are using the sophistication of Internet connections to
play opponents all over the world in games like Myth and Ultima
Online or to go full throttle in the cockpit of a MiG-29 fighter
jet, matching wits and heat-seeking missiles against scores of
other chairbound fighter pilots _ in Manhattan, Denver or anywhere
_ all in the same virtual space that appears on the computer screen
as the airspace over central Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In what might seem an odd turn, high-powered computers are also
being called upon by people who want to play only old favorites,
like Checkers, Scrabble and Spades, with distant opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Internet game players can, for example, fly World War II-era
sorties over wartorn Europe, then reminisce later with fellow
cyberaces in virtual lounges _ if they survive their missions.
Depending on the game, the talking is done in text-based chat or
with full telephony that allows players to speak to one another as
if they were on a conference call.
</P>
<P>
   All of that tends to make the games even more addictive,
players, and people who criticize the games, say.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, computer-based games, including television-console
games like Nintendo and Sony Playstation, amounted to a $5 billion
industry last year, according to Forrester Research in Cambridge,
Mass., which studies Internet use and trends.
</P>
<P>
   Only 3 percent of that revenue is attributed specifically to
computer games played over the Internet. But by 2002, Forrester
forecasts, online gaming will account for close to a quarter of an
estimated $8 billion computer game industry.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a Forrester report noted that a poll of a wide
variety of game developers found that 76 percent had Internet games
under development.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are becoming more familiar with PCs,'' said Seema
Williams, a research analyst at Forrester. ``More and more
consumers have six months to two years of experience with them.
They are more open now to playing games on line.''
</P>
<P>
   In a report in April, Ms. Williams noted that more than a
million users of Microsoft's online Internet Gaming Zone had
registered to play its most popular game, Spades.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, which recently announced a redesign of its
popular Games Channel, noted that more than 3.4 million individuals
visited the channel in August, logging more than six million hours
of play.
</P>
<P>
   America Online _ the world's largest online service, with more
than 13 million members _ also discovered that who is actually
playing its online games defies widely accepted stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 76 percent of AOL's players are 18 or older, 51
percent of them are 35 or older and most surprisingly, given the
commonly held conventions about computer gamers, slightly more than
half of the gamers between 25 and 49 years old) were women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing games on line is one of the hottest new forms of
entertainment,'' said Lawrence Schick, executive director of
interactive entertainment for AOL. ``It's not just the kids who are
playing. Mom and Dad are, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it is the human-to-human interaction that makes
Internet games especially enticing, players say. IBM's silicon
chess whiz, Big Blue, notwithstanding, playing against a computer
simply cannot compare with using a computer to play against real
people, Internet game makers say.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of television-console game systems, like Nintendo and
Sony Playstation, have long known this. Many computer game experts
said console games, a $2.6 billion industry, owes much of its
success to the fact that people play such games against other
people.
</P>
<P>
   But people play console games with people in the same room; none
in the United States are capable of linking players across the
vastness of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the quicksilver world of computer innovation, the world
of multiplayer Internet games is relatively new. The sonic boom in
online gaming occurred only a couple of years ago, when smarter
computers, programs and fundamental improvements in the Internet
itself made online games seem to come to life with dazzling
graphics and blazing speed, explained John R. Taylor III, vice
president for strategic development at the Kesmai Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is satisfying to see where things have evolved,'' said
Taylor, who co-founded Kesmai, one of the oldest companies
specializing in online multiplayer games, in 1982. The early
Internet games took shape in a text-defined computer world of MUDs
_ Multi User Dungeons, relatively primitive multiplayer programs _
and Unix operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Since then, games have progressed to the point of evoking
convincing 3-D environments that offer movie-quality visuals with
CD-quality soundtracks and sound effects. But oddly enough, with
all the technology, what is most important is that they deliver
real people as opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with all the sophistication that computers have, there is
a trick or pattern to the way computers play,'' said David Campana,
30, an engineering manager. He said he much preferred playing the
personal computer version of the action game Quake II against
people rather than against his computer's integrated circuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play against people, all bets are off,'' Campana
said. ``You never know how people are going to react. It's much
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Internet is not the only game in town.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the most advanced CD-ROM computer games can be played
with multiple players on a local area network, or LAN, an in-house
network in which the computers are wired to one another, as well as
with players on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On a LAN, any computer on the local network that meets the
game's minimal speed, space and power requirements can usually be
used to join the action.
</P>
<P>
   David Campana, who works for a technology company in Princeton,
N.J., said that while he enjoyed playing action games on line, he
preferred to play his favorite game, Quake II, on a LAN at his
office after office hours.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes more than a dozen of his co-workers stay late to play
the game. On a LAN, all the players have identical connections to
the in-house network, which is generally not true for players
competing over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Connections vary wildly on the Net, depending on modem speed,
the computer's location service provider, and whether some players
have superfast connections like cable and T-1 lines. Invariably,
players with slow connections are at a disadvantage when drawing
their weapons against players with faster connections.
</P>
<P>
   In the lexicon of online game players, slow players are often
victims of what is called ``latency.'' In Quake II, a game that can
be won or lost on a hundredths-of-a-second response, a player with
slow connections can appear practically arthritic.
</P>
<P>
   But setting up and maintaining a LAN to play games is expensive
and cumbersome. And some players can run into the same problem with
LAN games that they run into in real-life games: finding someone to
play with when you are ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, that's is seldom a problem. At any given time,
millions are bustling from Web site to Web site, looking for
someone to play. And the Web also offers the ancillary benefits of
chat rooms, rankings and message boards to compare strategy notes.
</P>
<P>
   But to play on the Internet, players need an intermediary, what
Ms. Williams at Forrester calls a ``cyberrec room.'' These
services, called game centers, are proprietary online services,
with names like Kesmai's Game Storm and Mplayer.com, that allow two
or more players to compete electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these centers also offer chat rooms and message boards
to help players of similar interests and skill levels find one
another for online games.
</P>
<P>
   No two game centers are exactly alike. Some, like Mplayer, are
free. Others charge a fee, like Game Storm, which costs $9.99 a
month (but games are free and can be downloaded from the Internet
or from a disk that is mailed to members), and some, like America
Online's Games Channel, which is exclusively for AOL members, has
two rates for its more advanced games.
</P>
<P>
   On AOL, for example, Blackjack and Virtual Pool each cost 99
cents an hour to play, and Air Warrior II is $1.99 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Another major distinction among game centers is whether they
provide something called a ``persistent universe'' or ``massively
multiplayer gaming. In a persistent universe, the
computer-generated world is changed continuously as players enter,
affect it in various ways, and exit.
</P>
<P>
   Such environments _ like the mysterious medieval land of dragons
and sorcerers of Ultima Online, a pay-for-play game _ exist, almost
organically, whether 5,000 people are playing or no one is playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The characters' attributes are stored in the database,'' said
Chris Holden, chief executive of Kesmai, based in Charlottesville,
Va., explaining persistent-universe gaming. ``So when a player
comes back, he can pick up right where he left off.''
</P>
<P>
   Left the game and forgot to put your sword away? Ask another
player still on line to put it back in your castle for you. That is
possible in persistent-universe gaming, which tends to be very
expensive to maintain and support.
</P>
<P>
   Other online games are in the peer-to-peer category. Devotees of
persistent-universe games refer to these game centers disparagingly
as ``dating services.''
</P>
<P>
   Services like TEN and Mpath are peer-to-peer, which means that
they match up players for games that last only as long as the
competitors are playing. When players lose or quit, ending the
game, that particular computer world also dies.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these companies, Ms. Williams said, are supported by
advertisers that pitch anything from new computer games and
computer-game magazines to M &AMP; M candies between matches to a
mostly male audience of young adults.
</P>
<P>
   Both kinds of online games have indirectly created an often
unexpectedly strong sense of community, players and game makers
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about social interaction,'' Holden said, ``people
talking and making friends _ and enemies, for that matter. Anything
that happens in real life when people gather can happen on line.''
</P>
<P>
   Regular online players often organize themselves into teams,
squadrons or guilds, depending on the game. Some players meet off
line to discuss the game or deepen friendships made on line.
Holden's colleague, Taylor, said he had met his wife while playing
one of his company's Internet games.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams said the emerging Internet game world was ``a new
community and a new way to interact with that community.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for Daniel Shiffman in his Manhattan apartment, his online
Myth game is mostly just that: a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a really amazing one, a perfect combination of strategy
and fighting,'' he said with a chuckle.

TOTAL ANNIHILATION, A MULTI-PLAY STRATEGY GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a humbling sight: a silvery cloud of hover jets
descending upon my fortress cluster of laser towers, armament
factories and rocket launchers to reduce it all to smoldering
rumble.
</P>
<P>
   It had taken just more than an hour for someone who called
himself Hefty Lefty to vanquish me at Total Annihilation, a
computer strategy game at which I had long considered myself a
resourceful player.
</P>
<P>
   But I had played TA, as devotees call it, only as a single
player. Until a couple of weeks ago, the game for me was a contest
with only the game's _ and I say this loosely _ artificial
intelligence. Using the Internet to go nose to nose, mano a mano,
with another player _ unseen and, in the end, unstoppable _ was
exhilarating and sobering.
</P>
<P>
   Most humbling of all, however, was just managing to get into the
game, a process that can be daunting.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to choose a game. It is rare to find a
state-of-the-art computer game that does not have multiplayer
features. Some even have ``Internet Ready'' stickers right on their
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Some games are offered for downloading over the Internet. Other
games, like Ultima Online, are sold in stores but can be played
only on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Next, you choose a game center, a kind of cyberarcade that
matches up players. The most simple and popular is America Online's
Games Channel. But play is limited to the games available on the
channel, ranging from Spades to Starcraft II (more advanced games
can cost $1.99 an hour), and it is limited to AOL members.
</P>
<P>
   Game centers that are independent of Internet service providers
like AOL and Microsoft Network, which also has a game service, tend
to offer a much broader range of popular computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the hottest games on the market are offered in centers
like Game Storm. But these kinds of centers require users to pay a
monthly fee, usually about $10, to play. And first, of course, you
must have a regular Internet provider to get you to the Game Storm
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Using AOL as my Internet provider, joining Game Storm was
routine. It required by name, address, credit card number and only
a few minutes of downloading time with a 28.8 modem.
</P>
<P>
   But downloading one of the center's most popular games, Air
Warrior III, a World War II fight and flight simulation game, was
not. It took more than two hours to download the 23 megabytes (the
minimum installation) of the program. The game can be installed
much faster from a CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I found myself in the cockpit of a Mustang high over
Europe tangling with enemy planes, each piloted by some other
computer user also on line.
</P>
<P>
   But Game Storm only offers Total Annihilation through its link
to HEAT.Net, also a play-for-pay site. But HEAT will not work if
players are using AOL or Prodigy as Internet providers. So, using
AOL, I turned to Mpath Interactive's Mplayer.com. I suddenly felt
that I was getting closer to actually playing the game on the Net.
But I soon discovered that Mplayer.com, a free service (although
its new Plus features cost $3.95 a month), involved a long
downloading time for its proprietary software.
</P>
<P>
   To get the center's Mplayer and Gizmo software, essential to
using Mplayer.com, I needed more than an hour for downloading with
a 28.8 modem.
</P>
<P>
   Once the downloading was complete, the game center searched my
Total Annihilation software and found that it was inadequate for
playing on the Internet. Mpath then upgraded the game, which took
another 30 minutes. (Mplayer Interactive is testing new software
that promises downloading in less than 10 minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the computer was ready. Almost. When you sign in with a
player name and password, Mplayer.com routinely takes a few more
minutes to verify the account and then download last-minute
upgrades. Then, after clicking through advertisements for a
computer game magazine and waiting through a brief commercial for a
new game from Red Storm, I was, at last, facing a series of rooms
where people were actually playing Total Annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   Much like trying to get into a game of pickup basketball, I
would visit various sites trying to persuade someone _ through a
text chat box _ to let me play. Minutes later, I met Hefty Lefty
and hurried down the road to my dazzling defeat.

   (italics)Many roads lead to the world of multiplayer games on
line, each offering a different approach. Here are some of the most
popular game destinations:(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ULTIMA ONLINE: www.ultimaonline.com A fantasy role-playing game
that was designed from the start by Origin Systems as a multiplayer
game. Ultima is set in an ongoing world, with forests, castles,
villages and taverns, that continues to change even when you are
off line. The only way to play is on the Internet. Ultima Online
is, in essence, its own game center. To play, you must own a copy
of the game, which is about $50, and subscribe to Ultima's online
gaming service, which costs about $9.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   MYTH: THE FALLEN LORDS: www.bungie.com An adventure role-playing
game by Bungie Software that combines strategy and the hyperspeed
of action games like Quake and Unreal. This game, much like Ultima
Online, is set in an ongoing world, defined by magic and battle.
Playing Myth on the Internet is free through Bungie.net.
</P>
<P>
   GAMES CHANNEL: www.aol.com A game center on America Online that
is strictly for AOL members. Most of the most popular games, like
the virtual card game Spades, can be played at no cost (not
counting AOL's monthly membership fee of $21.95). More advanced
action and adventure games, which AOL groups under the rubric
Xtreme Games, cost $1.99 an hour.
</P>

THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO BREAK IN THOSE JEANS

   Q: What does the term ``stonewashed'' mean? _ E.G., Hurst, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Stonewashing is a process of softening denim and other
fabrics to makes them look aged. Stonewashed jeans started to
appear in the United States in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   A July 1, 1994, ``Esquire'' article describes several ways that
manufacturers stonewash jeans: adding pumice stones to the wash
cycle, using cellulase enzymes to ``digest'' the jeans' surface or
tumbling chlorine-soaked pumice stones in the dry cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The process was ``pioneered by the Japanese and French, who were
no doubt inspired by images of peasant women beating their clothes
against river rocks,'' according to ``Esquire.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds rough, consider another method of artificially
aging jeans: ``shotgun denim.'' Employees of the Jensen-Smith
company of Chattanooga, Tenn., shot the jeans and sold them with a
spent shell. They sold $1.5 million yearly, which ``would have been
higher if the company had been able to shoot more jeans,''
``Nation's Business'' reported April 1, 1995.

   Q: Does Bob Barker have pets of his own? _ L.S., Euless, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Barker, who ends every broadcast of ``The Price is Right'' by
reminding viewers to have pets spayed or neutered, owns a dog named
Federico and a cat named Dulce.
</P>
<P>
   Barker, who began his 27th year as ``Price'' host on Sept. 21,
is active on animal-care issues. In 1988, he stepped down as host
of Miss USA and Miss Universe because organizers awarded fur coats
to winning contestants.
</P>
<P>
   Write to Barker in care of The Price is Right, Price
Productions, 5757 Wilshire Blvd., No. 206, Los Angeles, CA 90036.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Christy Turlington? _ L.E., via the
Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to the model in care of United Talent Agency, 9560
Wilshire Blvd., Suite 500, Beverly Hills, CA 90212.
</P>
<P>
   In April, ``BusinessAge'' magazine compiled a list of the
top-earning models. Turlington, who will turn 30 on Jan. 2, was
eighth at $23.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, model Claudia Schiffer joined Turlington in
withdrawing from the Fashion Cafe chain of restaurants. The venture
was created in 1995 by Schiffer, Turlington, Elle MacPherson and
Naomi Campbell.  &QL;

   PCS cellular telephone transmissions would be much clearer if
not for one thing: the cellular telephone user's cranium.
</P>
<P>
   A Silicon Valley company, RangeStar International, contends that
the signals coming from PCS phones _ the latest generation of
digital wireless phones _ radiate through 360 degrees, meaning a
good portion of them run directly into, and are absorbed by, the
user's head. In an effort to find a way around the pesky cranial
protrusion, RangeStar is selling an antenna the company says will
redirect the cellular signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What our antenna does is redirects signals away from the head
and makes it more of an effective signal,'' said Alan Brune, the
company's director of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The small black device, which costs $29.95, clips onto the
existing PCS antenna and turns it into a high-performance antenna,
RangeStar said. The company contends that, as a result, it can
increase the phone's range, improve the effective battery life by
limiting time lost for dropped calls, and reduce by ``50 percent or
more the signal loss to the head.''

   `Fatal Error' on Entrance Test Turns Out to Be Not So Bad  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is no fun time to receive a ``fatal error'' message on
your computer screen, but 400 business school applicants found out
last week that some times are more unnerving than others.
</P>
<P>
   The applicants had just finished taking the three-hour
computerized version of the Graduate Management Admission Test _ a
prerequisite for admission to business school _ at test centers
when the words ``fatal error'' popped onto the screen.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the message was simply a ``display error'' caused by a
computer bug, said Kevin Gonzalez, a spokesman for the
Princeton-based Educational Testing Services, which administers the
GMAT. Gonzalez said that none of the test scores were affected and
that the bug, which affected 400 of 10,000 people who took the GMAT
between Oct. 12 and Oct. 21, has been corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of test-takers, who did not know that the glitch was
innocuous when they finished the test, were unnerved. Andrea
Wilson, a spokeswoman for Kaplan Educational Centers, which offers
test preparation courses, said some of the test takers called
Kaplan in a panic about the glitch.

   New Projection Television Promises Lighter Viewing  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Samsung Electronics America Inc. says it can make the decision
to buy a television less weighty _ by more than 40 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Samsung is preparing to introduce a new 40-inch television that
weighs only 65 pounds, far less even than some 27-inch models.
Samsung's secret is in what the viewer sees _ no, not lighter
programming _ but a rear-projection screen that the company says
requires less bulky infrastructure than the traditional
televisions.
</P>
<P>
   The picture on the screen is created when light from a 100-watt
halogen bulb is projected onto a 1.4-inch diagonal Liquid Crystal
Device. Mark Knox, a senior marketing manager at Samsung, said that
LCD-based screens require less glass than televisions with
traditional screens, and less space than most big-screen projection
televisions.
</P>
<P>
   Several television manufacturers already offer rear-projection
LCD televisions in several countries in Asia, but the market is
just opening up in the United States, Knox said. Meanwhile, just
because the television weighs less does not mean it will be light
on the wallet. Samsung suggests a price of $1,899 for the 40-inch
television, and $2,799 for the 52-inch version. &QL;

   With Security Fears Fading, It Is Time for Online Bargains  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORk _ A new survey indicates web users apparently need a
better reason to start shopping online than the mere idea of
shopping online. And the survey, from Jupiter Communications Inc.,
indicates that a good way to inspire greater E-commerce is if
online retailers would start offering lower prices, or very
attractive specials.
</P>
<P>
   It seems obvious, but therein lies a noteworthy change in the
thinking of prospective online shoppers, according to Nicole
Vanderbilt, one of the authors of the survey for Jupiter, a New
York market research firm. Ms. Vanderbilt said that, not long ago,
the biggest hindrance to online shopping was the fear that
transactions would not be secure; now, she said, the greater
obstacle appears to be that people simply are not finding the
bargains they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``This marks the next phase of consumer adoption of the online
channel,'' Ms. Vanderbilt said. ``If we did this survey two years
ago, the focus would've been on security. Now it's on incentive.''

   Electronic Combination Lock Designed to Keep Out Hackers
</P>
<P>
   The agency that helped create some of the world's biggest bombs
has now helped create its smallest combination lock _ a bit of
technology aimed at preventing attacks by computer hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at Sandia National Laboratories have invented a
combination lock the size of a button. The reason for its
diminutive size is that the lock is meant to be placed inside a
computer, where it can be used to secure the contents of the hard
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Like a standard combination lock, the Sandia invention has
mechanical wheels _ six of them _ that can be turned to the
combination that opens the lock. The wheels are microscopic and are
turned, not manually, but with computer commands entered with a
keypad.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, this class of tiny mechanical devices is
known as a microelectromechanical system. Practically speaking,
this could be an advance in the battle against hackers, said Frank
Peter, a mechanical engineer at Sandia who helped design the lock.
</P>
<P>
   When the device is in place, it essentially ``locks'' the
connection between the hard drive and the rest of the computer. As
a result, a hacker would not be able to gain access to the hard
drive from the network, or even sitting at the computer itself.
</P>
<P>
   Some security experts believe the Sandia scientists may have
locked on to a good idea. ``Certainly something like this, if
deployed properly, could keep you from getting away with''
sensitive information, said Robert Stratton, chief technologist for
Security Design International, a computer security firm in Falls
Church, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Sandia scientists say it will be two years before this device or
a form of it is commercially available. In the meantime, maybe they
can think of a better name for the combination lock, which, is now
simply called the ``recodable locking device.''  &QL;

   Funk &AMP; Wagnall's Available On the Internet, and It Is Free
</P>
<P>
   A long-time ago, there was something known as the print version
of the Funk &AMP; Wagnall's encyclopedia, a 29-volume set of the
world's history that sold door-to-door for thousands of dollars.
Here is how much things have changed: the encyclopedia now takes up
zero shelf space and is free.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Versaware Technologies Inc., which licenses the
digital content from Funk &AMP; Wagnall's, plans to publish the entire
encyclopedia on the Internet, for free, and including new
multimedia capabilities like audio and video clips. Versaware also
will publish hourly news updates from Reuters and access to the
Random House Webster's College Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   The move to give away the whole shooting match for free may
inspire some users to wonder whether New York-based Versaware
should itself use the dictionary to look up the word
``capitalism.'' A company spokesman, Mathew Barlow, said that
Versaware is not running a charity, but hopes to use the site to
inspire visitors to buy even more multimedia rich versions of the
Funk &AMP; Wagnall's encyclopedia that come on CD-ROM and Digital Video
Disc. &QL;

   Lawsuit Against a Spammer Filed Under New Oregon Law
</P>
<P>
   In what is believed to be the first lawsuit brought by a state
against a spammer, Jason Heckel of Salem, Ore., has been sued for
violating Washington's law against misleading commercial e-mail.
Heckel, 24, has admitted to sending between 100,000 and 1 million
pieces of e-mail per week soliciting interest in a get-rich-quick
scheme, said Paula Selis, senior counsel in the consumer protection
division of the state attorney general's office. A trial date has
been set for March 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington law, which took effect on June 11, prohibits
sending unsolicited commercial messages _ spam _ to any e-mail
account identifiable as belonging to a Washington resident, if the
messages have misleading subject lines, use a third party's domain
name without permission or misrepresent the message's point of
origin. Heckel's e-mail included the subject line of ``Did I get
the right e-mail address?'' _ the kind of subject line that might
appear on e-mail from a college friend.
</P>
<P>
   The law includes a fine of $2,000 per piece of illegal mail
sent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get angry about spam,'' Ms. Selis said. ``They don't
like receiving it, especially if it has misrepresentations in it.
Having a law like this on the books gives consumers and the
attorney general's office a tool to protect consumers.''

   Boy Scout Handbook Adds A Page About the Internet
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, ``The Boy Scout Handbook,'' that trusty life
guide used by almost 100 million boys throughout the century, will
include a page on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might already be using the Internet for school work,
hobbies, or simply for enjoyment,'' says the handbook, which is to
be released early next year. ``For all of its benefits, though, the
Internet can also present hazards you should know about and
avoid.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11th edition of the handbook _ the first revision this
decade _ cautions users never to disclose personal information like
addresses and telephone numbers. It also urges youngsters to never
agree to meet anyone who has contacted them online unless a parent
or guardian accompanies them. In other words: be prepared.

ON-LINE BUSINESSES TAP HOME-SCHOOLING MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Minn., Mass.)   (af)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The technology of home schooling has provided business
opportunities on several levels.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy and Dan Kihlstadius, a Bloomington, Minn., couple with
seven home-schooled children, established an online computer
reselling business and software review publication catering to
Christian home schoolers in the early 1990s
(www.homecomputermarket.com).
</P>
<P>
   Their reselling business now averages about 100 orders a month,
with business from Appalachian hill families as well as affluent
home schoolers from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their first computer guide was published in 1993 with only four
pages and was handed out free at home-schooling conventions. Today,
they charge $7 for their ``Home-schooler's Computer Guide,'' which
is more than 100 pages long and contains reviews of more than 300
educational software titles.
</P>
<P>
   Their annual catalog includes a section called ``100 Programs
You Should Not Buy'' and notes if a title features witchcraft,
magic or aliens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem with aliens as long as they're not mean
or nasty, but some of our readers don't like software with
aliens,'' Mrs. Kihlstadius said.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy and David Orth, a Cherry Valley, Mass., couple with six
home-schooled children, have built the gigantic, Homeschool
Publishing House(bravewc.com/hph), which produces the ``Homeschool
Seller'' catalogue. The Orths list home schoolers' used supplies in
the catalog at no charge, and when a sale is made, the home
schooler pays them 15 percent of the sale price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pays its own bills, but my husband certainly can't quit his
day job,'' Mrs. Orth said. Most of the items listed are
Christian-themed.
</P>
<P>
   Major educational publishers are eyeing the scene, but so far
few heavy hitters have embraced the home-schooling market. The
notable exception is Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft. Vulcan
Northwest, his 12-year-old umbrella organization for his business
ventures, is backing a new online tutorial called APEX (Advance
Placement Excellence).
</P>
<P>
   APEX, an advanced-placement tutorial, is in its pilot phase
(www.apex.netu.com). The first course is advanced placement
calculus. This winter, the curriculum will be expanded to include
microeconomics and American government.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to add five more courses next year and five more
each each subsequent year. The courses have been designed in
cooperation with the College Board, which oversees advanced
placement classes _ college-level courses offered to high-school
students that can count toward college credits.
</P>
<P>
   The company's is aiming to attract business from both the
home-schooling and the institutional schooling markets. For $300
per semester, a student can tap into a library of 15-minute
teacher-narrated tutorials with multimedia animations of key
concepts; participate in bulletin board discussion sessions, and
complete both online and off-line homework.
</P>
<P>
   The activities go into a database and can be reviewed, critiqued
and ``debugged'' by the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The calculus course involves more than 250 learning activities.
Between 30 and 40 students are taking it this fall, but as many as
150 could participate in the microeconomics and government courses.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For nearly 20 years, Steve Mann has pursued the dream of
developing a networked computer that would slip onto the human body
as easily as a layer of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, he wore a miner's helmet that held a video
camera and lights, a modem for Internet access, a communications
system to broadcast images to the Web, a keyboard, and a string of
battery packs that trailed behind him as he walked around the
campus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wanted to talk to the cyberpioneer _ from Time magazine
to The National Enquirer, which called him ``Web Man Walking.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is it like to be married to the world's most popular
cyborg? Betty Lo met her future husband in 1984 at the McMaster
University library in Hamilton, Ontario. She noticed a tall man
with ``metallic hair, kind of silver gray in places.''
</P>
<P>
   She asked him about it and Mann replied that his hair had been
``metallized.'' For his devices to work, at the time, he had to
render his hair conductive by using metallic dyes that proved to be
``somewhat permanent.''
</P>
<P>
   They were married in the summer of 1993, with Mann the cyborg
pulling double-duty as both groom and wedding photographer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mann, an economist by training who works as an auditor for
the Ontario government, has become a partner in her husband's work.
She was also the first human subject to appear in the photographs
and videos he took while wearing his cyborg suit.
</P>
<P>
   And in what might be interpreted as a gesture of love, Mann, who
is now an assistant professor of electrical and computer
engineering at the University of Toronto, has fashioned for his
wife a cyborg suit of her own that is electronically connected to
his.
</P>
<P>
   He devised radio links that connect both his suit and Ms. Mann's
to an Internet service provider, which allows them to send each
other images of what they were seeing. (For more on Mann's cyborg
work, visit genesis.eecg.toronto.edu.) The Manns have had fun going
out on photographic and video expeditions, although Ms. Mann did
not care for the way the earlier helmeted models of her suit messed
up her hair.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the speed and power of microprocessors has
allowed Mann to shrink his equipment to the point where his cyborg
suit consists principally of a pair of sunglasses, a battery-lined
suit jacket and a keyboard that can be held in the palm of his
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although his invention has become smaller,'' Ms. Mann noted,
``the amount of clutter he's needed to maintain it hasn't gotten
significantly smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann can still attract attention _ and does _ by doing things
like leaning toward a store radio to distort the frequency as a way
to pass the time while he is standing in line.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Mann attracted a large number of graduate students to
a cyborg course at the University of Toronto by putting up campus
flyers that advertised, ``You will be assimilated,'' a phrase
borrowed from ``Star Trek: The Next Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann's days as the world's only cyborg are over, but there are
times when he and his wife get borged up and enjoy a completely new
kind of spousal communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand each other more when we are connected,'' Ms.
Mann said. ``It's the same way the left side of your brain is
connected to the right side of your body, and so is the right side.
There is no argument between the two sides.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ In a preservation move both bold and unprecedented,
the entire New York City subway system will be nominated to the
National Register of Historic Places _ highlighting 48 of its
stations, 11 substations, 6 signal towers, 4 control houses, 3 yard
buildings and 1 tunnel, state officials confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll nominate everything but the screech,'' said J. Winthrop
Aldrich, deputy commissioner for historic preservation at the State
Parks Office. The State Parks Office now has all the research it
needs to complete the nomination, including a six-volume survey
commissioned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which
initiated the nomination process.
</P>
<P>
   State Parks Commissioner Bernadette Castro said Wednesday that
the subway is ``so New York.'' She continued: ``It never shuts
down, 24 hours a day. We can't really function without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Castro said she knew of no opposition to the National
Register listing, which would make the city's subway system
eligible for state preservation grants and, she added, would
``definitely'' increase its chances for a bigger slice of the $203
billion in federal transportation dollars allotted by Congress in
June. It would be the first complete subway system listed on the
register, said a spokesman for the National Register of Historic
Places, in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Barwick, who once ran both the Municipal Art Society and
the New York Landmarks Preservation Commission, said that the
proposed nomination was ``astounding'' and that ``we've come a long
way since the attitude of the city government was that the subways
were an embarrassment.'' The honor would be ``appropriate,'' he
continued, because the subway system ``made the modern city what it
is. By expanding to the `wilds' of Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx,
it made the city grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the system is listed, Ms. Castro said, she hopes the MTA
will target ``four or five'' more stations for restoration. She
said she would look favorably toward awarding a state grant for
``interpretation'' at these stations: new artwork and text to
educate riders about the history of the subways.
</P>
<P>
   While not the oldest subway system _ Boston has that honor _ New
York's system, which on Tuesday celebrated its 94th birthday, is
certainly the biggest in the country, and possibly the world, said
John Tauranac, a subway expert and urban historian, who designed
the 1979 subway map. ``Tokyo may have more riders,'' he said, ``but
New York's 722 miles certainly give it the edge, lengthwise.''
</P>
<P>
   As a fragment of history, it has no peer. Not only does New York
City still have the only complete system of local and express
tracks, but its mosaic tiles and bas reliefs by American master
potteries Grueby and Rookwood are extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Preservationists still bemoan Philip Johnson's makeover of the
49th Street station, blanketed with shiny orange tiles in 1975.
``Cheer is the word, like a big shopping center,'' Johnson
announced at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Or the demolition of the Bowling Green station starting in 1972,
when huge red tiles replaced elegant mosaic name panels and
neo-classical designs by Heins and LaFarge, who designed the 1904
and 1908 subway projects (along with part of the Cathedral of St.
John the Divine).
</P>
<P>
   Or the alterations to the Broadway and 103rd Street station,
where classic white glazed brick-shaped tiles and at least one
terra cotta escutcheon were covered by what Tauranac called
``penal-colony modern'' beige walls.
</P>
<P>
   Or the destruction of almost all the distinctive above-ground
kiosks, carted away in the 1960s, ostensibly because they blocked
the sight lines of traffic. ``The real reason,'' Tauranac said,
``is because they'd been neglected. The cast iron and glass were
leaking.'' A much-applauded reproduction kiosk was erected with
financing from Brooke Astor at the Astor Place station as part of a
major renovation in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But for every Astor Place, Barwick said, ``there are four more
stations that need work.'' Bleecker Street, his home station, is
``almost as beautiful as Astor Place _ and it could sure use a
little sprucing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Other preservationists grumble that Gov. George Pataki has only
recently emerged as a ``Born Again Subway Rider.'' When he took
office, he slashed $220 million from MTA subsidies while increasing
money to other transit systems across the state, including Metro
North and the Long Island Railroad. The recent fare discount
packages _ along with his boyhood reminiscences of riding the IRT _
are brand new.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, listing on the National Register of Historic
Places is an honor that carries little regulatory weight _
privately owned houses can be demolished without much of a fight.
But because the subways are owned by the MTA, a governmental body,
the listing would carry much more clout. Before any alterations or
demolition could be carried out on any of the historic parts of the
subway, an extensive review by the State Parks Office would be
mandated, Ms. Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, no one is expecting trouble with the MTA, which
not only backs the listing, but has also been consulting with the
state about ongoing changes to historic subway resources. A
spokesman said MTA Chairman E. Virgil Conway would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   To Gene Russianoff, the staff lawyer for the Straphangers
Campaign, a transit riders' lobbying group, the National Register
status could change the way New Yorkers think of the subway. ``When
it was built in 1904,'' he said, ``the tiles served not only to
beautify but to all the New Yorkers who spoke no English, they
showed the way: the beaver at Astor Place, the City Hall at City
Hall, Columbus' ship. They couldn't read the writing on the wall
but they could see the pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Russianoff has been critical of the MTA. ``Its
program to rehabilitate 91 out of 468 stations is way behind
schedule,'' he said. But the ones it has redone, are spectacular,
he said, adding, ``At Brooklyn Bridge, they put in Art Deco glass
blocks, some sort of cable sculpture and an old-fashioned kiosk.''
</P>
<P>
   Having the subway listed on the National Register, Russianoff
hopes, will ``create a mindset in both the public and the
governments that subways are vital public spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two bureaucratic hurdles. The first is the state
review board, which must go over the nomination _ this spring ``at
the very earliest,'' Ms. Castro said, adding that she would like to
use some of the federal transportation money to free up staff to
push the nomination. The next step is the formal enrollment of the
property onto the register, which officials said privately was a
foregone conclusion. (All 151 register nominations forwarded by New
York state from September 1996 to September 1997 were accepted.)
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sanchis, vice president for historic sites at the National
Trust, a private group that works closely with the National Parks
Service and its 70,000 National Register listings, saw no obstacles
to the proposed nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fits right in with current preservation thinking,'' he
said. Increasingly, he said, the register is recognizing
infrastructure: ``historic roads, historic canal corridors.'' He
continued: ``New York's Croton Aqueduct is on the register. So it
makes perfect sense.'' Sanchis also sits on the state review board
that will pass on the parks office's nomination before it goes to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There is no other subway system on the National Register, said
Marilyn Harper, a historian for the National Parks Service,
although there is a small segment of Boston's Tremont Street subway
listed _ between State and Boylston Streets _ built in the 1890s.
In Chicago, a 1978 effort to list a section of the elevated around
the Loop failed.

 By JAMES RYAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Armed with little more than a sheaf of recipes, a glue gun, some
dried flowers and a puritanical zeal for modern home-keeping,
Martha Stewart has built a multimedia empire worth $200 million, by
one conservative estimate. Thus, it comes as no surprise that
pretenders are cropping up thicker than sprouts on a Chia Pet.
</P>
<P>
   Haunted by Ms. Stewart's success and eager to promote their own
domains, seven gurus of the homely arts gathered last week in New
York for a Halloween photo shoot. These arbiters of design and
entertaining, cooking and crafts were armed with enough moss,
glitter, candles, dry ice, scarecrows and baled straw to raise Mrs.
Beeton from the dead, and were escorted by assistants, publicity
agents, and stylists. Most have already written books, and landed
half-hour slots in the rapidly expanding souffle of life-style
television. But they're just treading water compared with Ms.
Stewart, a polar-ice-breaking juggernaut who has churned out 22
books and by January will fill five hours of television programming
a week.
</P>
<P>
   Why the audience? Home-decorating shows are soothing _ like
those devoted to golf or bass fishing. Burton Jablin, the
programming chief for the fledgling Home and Garden network (HGTV),
said that his company had predicted a downturn in morning ratings
the day President Clinton's grand jury testimony was shown.
Instead, there was an increase. ``People want something safe and
apart from what's out there,'' Jablin said. ``We call it
`informational escapism.'''
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Goldstein, the author of ``Do It Yourself: Home
Improvement in the 20th Century,'' said shelter advice is, and has
always been, about ``wanting to be upper middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, some people just don't aspire to Ms. Stewart's
``casual country buffet for 40'' or $750 German glass tree
ornaments. Annabelle Gurwitch, a host of TBS' life-style parody
show, ``Dinner and a Movie,'' said Ms. Stewart and her ilk were
depressing: ``Watching some of those life-style shows is like
watching porn. There are some very tantalizing things happening in
front of me that I know that I'm never going to do in my
lifetime.'' But for those who have the time and inclination to gild
their pumpkins, homemaking is back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Domesticity for a long time got a dour, matronly rap,'' said
Katie Brown, 35, the anti-Martha who is the host of Lifetime's
``Next Door With Katie Brown.'' ``It was embarrassing to say, `I
baked these.' Women of my generation are embracing nesting again.''
What does this Gen X'er bring to the table: she uses a shower
curtain as a tablecloth.
</P>
<P>
   A healthy economy helped spark the explosion of decorating
shows, which range from impressive to infuriating. ``There are a
lot of wannabes out there,'' said Chris Casson Madden, 50, the
author of two coffee-table books, ``Kitchens'' and its sequel,
``Bathrooms.'' ``There are businessmen thinking, `Let's create the
next one,' like Milli Vanilli. But this isn't as easy as
lip-synching a song.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe it is. Ms. Madden has a program called
``Interiors by Design'' on HGTV whose slim content includes house
tours and discussions of barrel chairs and passementerie. Now, she
is planning her home-decorating empire. ``I'll probably do a
fragrance at some point, but it doesn't have to be tomorrow,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of imitators grows weekly as HGTV, Lifetime,
Discovery, TBS, Romance Classics and E! scramble to fill time
slots. Many will be chosen. Few, if any, will succeed. But here are
some helpful tips, including a few from Martha Stewart herself, who
says, `I'm not usually in the business of giving free consultations
to competitors''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHOOSE A NICHE &LR;  _ Barbara Smith, a New York restaurateur and
former model, is the host of ``B. Smith With Style,'' a syndicated
show. She has emerged as the African-American Martha Stewart. ``My
show has more rhythm,'' said Ms. Smith, 49. Her glossy 1995 tome,
``B. Smith's Entertaining and Cooking for Friends,'' features
Southern recipes, no-frills party tips and beaming children in red
and yellow Kwanzaa outfits.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Mary Emmerling, 56, the Country Martha Stewart.
Ms. Emmerling is the host of an HGTV show called ``Country at
Home.'' (Though she glorifies the American West, Ms. Emmerling has
lived in Georgetown in Washington D.C, Bridgehampton, NY, and, for
30 years, Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown, an actress/waitress turned cool camp-crafts
counselor, landed ``Next Door With Katie Brown'' last year. She's a
sunnier Martha, in the Katie Couric mold, who never stops acting
casual, even when sewing fabric butterflies for an indoor picnic or
making handmade paper in a blender from boiled newspaper pulp and
rose petals.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Cowie, a celebrity party planner, is kind of a Rococo
Martha. ``I'm on a mission to reinforce and reinstate our social
graces,'' said Cowie, who gives his age as 36. He is the author of
the voyeuristic paperweights ``Weddings'' and ``Effortless
Elegance.'' Not always hands-on, Cowie believes that effortless
elegance is achieved by having a chef assist him during cooking
segments of ``Everyday Elegance With Colin Cowie'' on Romance
Classics. If the going gets tough, he's not above plunking a waiter
in a cab to fetch Indian takeout.
</P>
<P>
   A glance around the cable spectrum reveals slots open for a
Latina Martha, a Sporty Martha and a Rock 'n' Roll Martha.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Martha says: ``I never wanted to go after a niche. I want to
teach as many people as possible.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OUT-MARTHA MARTHA &LR;  Ms. Madden and Bari Lynn, the former home
correspondent for ``Good Morning America,'' have taken on Martha
mano a mano, down to the casual attire and the straw-basket-blond
hair. ``The dream is to turn me into a brand name and license
products: crystal, china, window treatments, bedding,'' said Ms.
Lynn, 35, who is looking for her own television show.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Martha says: ``Why anybody would want to copy me or replicate
me is kind of crazy.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TAPE A SEGMENT ON `OPRAH' &LR;  _ ``Appearing on `Oprah' was a
turning point,'' said Ms. Madden, who landed her own show after
making herself invaluable to the busy Ms. Winfrey, redesigning her
private office to include watercolors of Ms. Winfrey's dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Cowie said he is now recognized at airports, thanks to his
annual ``Oprah'' appearance. ``I get a whole hour with her,'' he
boasted. Other Stewart wannabes have appeared on ``Entertainment
Tonight'' ( Cowie), ``Good Morning America'' (Ms. Madden, Ms. Lynn)
and the ``Today'' show (Lynette Jennings). The telegenic Ms. Smith
has appeared on ``Oprah,'' the ``Today'' show and ``Good Morning
America.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Martha says: ``If you're an expert in something very specific,
you may be invited on my show.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NAME DROP &LR;  _ Cowie, who is doing an all-Prada Halloween wedding
this weekend in Beverly Hills, Calif., has been a nuptial
coordinator for such taste mavens as Hugh Hefner, Kenny G., Paula
Abdul and Charlie Sheen. ``Because of the celebrity angle,'' he
said, ``I have been inundated with offers to do licensing
agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown's press kit mentions that she has catered for Quentin
Tarantino, Mira Sorvino and Diane Keaton. Ms. Madden trumpets that
she is Ms. Winfrey's favorite designer. One of the most popular
names to drop is that of the poet Maya Angelou. She was touted as a
guest, client or book subject by at least four of the seven
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Not to be outdone, Martha says: ``Even Oprah has said to me,
`Where do you get your ideas?''' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPLOIT A COLORFUL PAST &LR;  _ Ms. Stewart, 57, was variously a
model, a stockbroker and a caterer before she turned to life-style
management. Ms. Jennings, 50, studied architecture and owned a
company that actually built homes. Ms. Smith's career as a model
has given her poise, and 12 years of running her own restaurants in
New York, Washington and Sag Harbor have made her comfortable with
a wooden spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown said she learned cooking tips by pestering chefs
during her years in New York as a waitress. A childhood in Kitwe,
Zambia, and studies in pharmacy provided Cowie with inspiration to
become, as his biography states, an ``international arbiter of
taste.'' And Ms. Madden's success suggests that a background in
public relations works, too. She spent time in the publicity
departments of Random House, G.P. Putnam's Sons and Simon &AMP;
Schuster before becoming a design writer. ``I know a trend when I
see one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Martha would like to own up to a more colorful past, but says:
``I don't remember the last time I made a mistake.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FIND A NEW GIMMICK &LR;  _ So far, no one has come up with a
trademark to match Ms. Stewart's signature phrase, ``It's a good
thing.'' But that's not for want of trying. Ms. Emmerling is the
doyenne of five-minute decorating and promotes decor that might
best be termed rack and stack. Check her book ``Quick Decorating''
for details, but it involves piles of books, things hanging from
coat racks and folded blankets. ``Folding just comes naturally to
me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Madden so believes women need personal spaces that she wrote
a book, which includes an exegesis on a nun's adobe cell in Santa
Fe, N.M. Cowie, who employs the word fabulous as generously as a
truckstop waitress doles out ketchup, has elevated table-top decor
(seafood topiary anyone?) to an art worthy of a Hallmark card.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Martha says: ``I look for what isn't out there. My next book is
about hors d'oeuvres. There's a need out there for a good handbook
on hors d'oeuvres.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GET INTO PRINT &LR;  _ Ms. Lynn shot her own photos for ``Eclectic
Living,'' while Ms. Smith hired Andrea Gentl and Martin Hyers, a
husband-and-wife team who have worked for Martha Stewart Living.
Ms. Madden has one-upped them all: her editor at Clarkson Potter,
Annetta Hannah, used to be Ms. Stewart's editor.
</P>
<P>
   Cowie and Ms. Madden say they will start their own magazines
within a year. Ms. Brown, the new spokeswoman for Arm &AMP; Hammer
baking soda, said she currently has book offers from 21 publishers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Martha says: ``Whether it's as simple as roasting a chicken or
as complicated as making Jean-Georges' chocolate delight dessert,
readers want to know the real way and no short cuts. People never
put the real way in their books.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GET YOUR OWN SHOW &LR;  _ Without a weekly show, you're just another
guest stylist. Ms. Brown has managed to leapfrog her competition.
Come January, her show will expand to five half-hour segments a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jennings, a pioneer in the genre, has spent 10 years on the
Discovery Channel. Her highly professional series, ``Lynette
Jennings Design,'' combines instructional home tours with practical
decorating tips. ``I consider myself more of a teacher than a
celebrity, a hostess or a star,'' said Ms. Jennings, the Ted Koppel
of life style.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Martha says: ``I surf the networks at night, seeing how other
people are doing. People are not being offered quality programming
except for mine.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RESTORE, RECYCLE, RE-USE &LR;  _ Even Ms. Stewart in recent weeks
has recycled standbys like ``How to Load a Dishwasher'' and ``How
to Hang a Backyard Clothesline.'' How can any mere mortal
consistently come up with new ideas? ``Everything's recycled these
days,'' Ms. Emmerling &UR;  &LR; said. ``I don't care who you are _ you can't
do it all yourself. You get it from magazines, from books, from
store windows. Why did I see `Out of Africa' 20 times? I wanted to
see that living room again.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Martha says: ``I come up with 25 ideas a day.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THINK FRAGRANCE &LR;  _ Create a brand, and market it shamelessly.
Not everyone will have the longevity of Ms. Stewart, whose line of
Everyday sheets and towels for Kmart is expected to top $1 billion
in sales this fiscal year. ``Except for Martha, it comes and goes
for everyone,'' said Ms. Emmerling, who lost her line of sheets for
J.C. Penny and is now down to wallpaper and her American Country
West furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   While most empire-builders want to expand quickly, Ms. Jennings
held off until this year, when she became the spokeswoman for Home
Depot and signed deals with Delta (for crafts products), Crown
Craft (for bedding and throw rugs) and Time-Life (for books and
videos). ``We wanted to wait until we could work with the top
people in each field,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Martha says: ``I must have turned down 44 perfumes. I've never
licensed my name. That is not something that is going to be
fabulous.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPAWN A PARODY &LR;  _ Ms. Stewart is a target because of her
perfectionism and apparent lack of humor, as anyone who watched her
flock a Christmas tree with cotton candy on the David Letterman
show can attest. So far, none of the seven pretenders to Martha's
throw rug has proved worthy of parody. But what pleasures lie
ahead?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Martha says: ``Love the late-night jokes. But the parodies are
so stupid. I could do those better myself.'' &LR;

   The following stories, from The New York Times Education Life
supplement of Sunday, November 1, will move today.
</P>
<P>
   EDLIFE-TEACHER-STANDARDS (Undated) _ The debate on how to turn
out quality teachers has long bedeviled educators. It happened
after the Civil War, with the rise of industrialization and the
shift in skills needed as American workers migrated from the farm
to the factory. It happened after Sputnik, when the Soviet Union's
launch of the first satellite was taken as a sign of the poor
quality of American math and science education. And it is happening
anew, with test results showing that American students are behind
their peers in other industrialized nations on math and science,
and lagging in literacy. By Randal C. Archibald.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Features: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   EDLIFE-EARLY-ADMISSIONS (Undated) _ Over the last two or three
years it has become apparent that the college application process
has radically changed, at least at the most competitive colleges,
which are filling more and more of their classes early and leaving
fewer slots for regular applicants. While early decision-making
gives some students the ability to short-circuit a year of
agonizing over applications, for others it means enormous pressure
to pick a school quickly. By Peter Applebome. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   EDLIFE-OLEMISS-DIXIE (Oxford, Miss.) _ A century and a half ago,
the University of Mississippi sent its sons off to the Civil War. A
century later, it waged a civil rights battle of its own. But now,
under new pressures, the university is trying to take the dixie out
of Ole Miss. By Kevin Sack. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   EDLIFE-HOMESCHOOLING-GRADS (Undated) _ They are pioneers, in a
way: the first wave of the modern home-schooling movement, the
first generation of children to be taught primarily by their
parents. Some 15 years after states began legalizing home schooling
in earnest, these early graduates are starting to make their way in
the world. By Pam Belluck. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   EDLIFE-MAILORDER-HIGHSCHOOL (Undated) _ The Independent Study
High School, based at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, was
founded in 1929 as a correspondence program to educate rural
Nebraskans. The school has one of only a few fully accredited
distance-education programs offering high school diplomas. It
offers an option for the children of diplomats and missionaries, or
those who can't or don't want to go to a schoolhouse every day. By
David M. Herszenhorn.

   &UR; Whom You Gonna Call? Bad-Grammar Busters! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Need help positioning an adverb? Having an existential tussle
with ``me'' and ``I''? Elisabeth Piedmont-Marton, purveyor of the
grammar hot line at the University of Texas at Austin, will lend a
sympathetic ear. And she's heard it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call to confess, to settle bets, to gather ammunition for
arguments with their bosses and to voice jeremiads about the state
of American English,'' said Dr. Piedmont-Marton, Ph.D., who runs
the university's Undergraduate Writing Center and the hot line.
``But when they have spent hours arguing over whether it is correct
to say, `It is I' or `It is me,' you have to wonder if they
shouldn't be exploring something else about their relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The grammar hot line _ (512) 475-VERB _ will help untangle your
syntax from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Central Time, Monday to Thursday, and
to 3 p.m. on Friday. The staff receives several calls a day, a
dozen at midterms and finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine that answering the grammar hot line is a lot like
answering other kinds of hot lines,'' said Dr. Piedmont-Marton, a

   &UR; Stark White Paper: Those Were the Days &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons to create a personal Web site, besides
having a place to display photographs of your cat and Bon Jovi. It
can also be an electronic portfolio, featuring essays you've
written, scores you've composed, scenes you've acted in.
</P>
<P>
   Schools are beginning to see the potential, encouraging students
to create their own sites, or even requiring them at a few
colleges, like Kalamazoo in Michigan and Coe in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, all incoming students at Coe College are required to
start a site as a kind of journal of their work, adding to it as
they go along. Laura Skandera-Trombley, vice president for academic
affairs, calls the sites a way to ``archive their academic
achievements and to assist advisers in keeping track of student
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the ideal. In these early stages, students'
sites seem directed more toward their wired classmates than their
teachers. Content includes ``my vacation in Europe,'' ``my cat,''
``my mom,'' etc. One Coe student has constructed an
all-football-all-the-time site, offering a ``great link to keep up
to date with the NFL'' and the Green Bay Packers' home page, while
women tend to favor medievalism: unicorns, meadows, Goth fashion,
forest glades.
</P>
<P>
   Important questions to ask as assigned Web sites proliferate: Is
prose enhanced by a background of leaping flames and pulsating
rainbows? When does a personal Web site turn into just one more
seductive cathode-ray screen calling students away from homework?

   &UR; At Christie's, Master's in the House &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Education has become the weapon of choice in the war between the
two titans of the art market, Christie's and Sotheby's. Over the
last decade, both auction houses have opened special divisions
offering a range of courses about the history and appraisal of fine
art and decorative objects. Both even offer advanced degrees in
their London headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Now Christie's in New York is touting a sheepskin of its own:
this fall, 30 students began working toward their master's degrees
in connoisseurship and the art market, a program designed for
people who want to work in auction houses, galleries and museums.
The program, accredited by the New York Board of Regents, includes
classes on developments in painting and sculpture from 1850 to the
present; business courses; and field trips to view public and
private collections.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Watson, director of the Downtown Arts Project, an
arts-education umbrella group, explained why education is such a
potent weapon for the auction houses. ``It makes absolute sense in
terms of their marketing strategy,'' said Watson, who keeps tabs on
the scene via his art world newsletter, Simon Says. The auction
houses ``want to be a full-service, fine-arts provider, offering
one-stop shopping for any customer.'' It's all very Viacom, very
Disney, he said. ``They can learn about art there. They can get a
degree in art there. They can buy it. They can sell it and then
they can die there and move everything in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is much more important,'' he continued, ``than those
one-night lectures where you meet groovy people who are collecting,
drink a glass of champagne and maybe see John-John or something.''
When people actually invest in a master's degree, they ``become
troops,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Is Sotheby's threatened? Not really, sniffed Kathleen Martin,
the director of Sotheby's education division. They have been
thinking of adding a master's program in New York, too, she said,
and started ``the original'' master's in London. ``They're the ones
who got nudged,'' she said.

   &UR; A Style Perennial: Dirty Old Sweats &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Harvard and Yale may be America's most prestigious universities,
pantheons of scholarship and yada yada yada, but as far as
marketers are concerned, they are brands, trademarks that can
really move the merch.
</P>
<P>
   Ivy League cachet has sold everything from Harvard Beer (brewed
in Lowell, Mass.) to Harvard Cigarettes (smoked in India) to
Harvard Eggs (available in Korea; they make you smarter) _ all
unauthorized appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   But now Harvard and Yale, along with their English counterparts,
Oxford and Cambridge, have joined in an agreement, licensing their
names to a line of logo-emblazoned T-shirts, sweats and baseball
caps.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking any old T-shirts, sweats and baseball caps,
mind you. According to Helen Kauder, director of Yale's licensing
programs, this will be ``casual apparel that evokes, or is based
on, archival images of scholar-athletes from the '30s and '40s,''
like ``the ones of George Bush in his 1948 Yale baseball team
uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   The line, to be sold in the United States and Western Europe
beginning this winter, is the brainchild of Lee and Dan Mirman,
brothers and owners of Pangea, which markets European university
T-shirts and sweats on the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Mirman explained the aura: ``Imagine your great-grandfather
was a scholar-athlete at Cambridge. After three years of playing
rugby, he threw his jersey into his footlocker. Fifty years later
that footlocker ends up in your parents' attic, and you're up there
looking for something and come across this footlocker, and you blow
off the dust and there's the jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   How does this aura translate to T-shirts?
</P>
<P>
   Everything will look ``as if it's been worn 100 times,'' he
said. Cap visors and leather straps will be faded, brass buckles
scratched, cuffs prestretched.
</P>
<P>
   And how do the designs differ?
</P>
<P>
   They don't. Each university will be represented by the same
clothes. Only the logo will distinguish one scholar-athlete from
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just a few institutions that have a history rich
enough to do this,'' Ms. Kauder said.

   &UR; Workshops On Tornadoes And Terrorism &LR;
</P>
<P>
   After fatal shootings over the last school year in Oregon,
Arkansas and other parts of the nation, the mantra among
educational administrators is gun preparedness. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency, noting the prevalence of gangs and
other dangers in schools, has added a segment on violence to its
multihazards training course, which teaches education staff
techniques to evacuate and protect children in the event of an
earthquake, high winds or, now, a gun-toting intruder or student.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Villahermosa, who teaches what he calls the ``man-made
disaster'' component of the program for FEMA and individual state
agencies, said the number of times he has been hired to teach his
workshop on school violence has grown by 25 percent in the last
year. ``In tragedy we learn,'' said Villahermosa, who is also a
deputy sheriff in Pierce County, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Some tips:
</P>
<P>
   1. Take a proactive approach. ``Notice when a kid's behavior
starts changing,'' Villahermosa said, ``when he starts getting
moody, when his friends change, grades drop. In four or five of
these shootings, kids knew something was wrong with the shooters.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Learn hand signals to communicate with other staff members.
Two fingers raised means ``Don't leave me!'' A closed fist
indicates a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   3. Carry color-coded cards to the playground. A child can run to
the office with cards that signify different situations _ red, for
example, for ``Call 911.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Don't duck under a desk. While that strategy may work for
earthquakes and air-raid drills, ``if someone walks into a
classroom and opens fire indiscriminately, there's not one desk
that's going to stop a bullet,'' Villahermosa said. ``It's easier
to hit a nonmoving target. The people who survive run.''

   &UR; Package Deal For College &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In these boom times, with part-time jobs going begging in the
service economy, college students can afford to be picky. That's
why United Parcel Service in Louisville, Ky., the company's busiest
package-processing hub, began its own version of the G.I. Bill this
fall: free tuition at three local colleges _ the University of
Louisville, Jefferson Community College and Jefferson Technical
College _ in exchange for a semester-by-semester commitment to work
20 hours a week on UPS' most-difficult-to-fill midnight shift.
</P>
<P>
   And it's grueling, hefting boxes onto conveyor belts or into
trucks in the middle of the night. But people like Michael Hayes,
20, formerly of Flatwood, Ky., were so elated by the prospect of
free tuition that they moved to Louisville to take jobs. He now
lifts 25 large (up to 150 pounds) packages a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes is one of 850 employees _ 650 new ones lured by free
college and 200 company veterans _ who started school this semester
at what is being called Metropolitan College; 150 young people are
on a waiting list, and UPS expects to eventually put 2,000
employees a year through school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an inkling we could get more students if we could get a
college to offer classes on a schedule that was conducive to
working in the middle of the night,'' says Ken Shapiro, a UPS
spokesman, ``and we were ready to offer some kind of incentive to
get people in the door.''
</P>
<P>
   The unusual deal developed when UPS started talking about
expanding its plant, hiring more workers and, if necessary, moving
to find them _ maybe out of state. At stake were about 21,000 UPS
jobs. After learning of the company's staffing needs, the city
offered to pay 50 percent of the tuition in the program, as well as
provide the usual please-don't-leave tax breaks. (Tuition ranges
from $800 to $8,040 a year, depending on a student's residency
status, the school and the course load.)
</P>
<P>
   To insure that there are appropriate schedules for these special
students, who need to sleep during the day, the three schools added
a total of 78 classes in the hours of 5 to 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   UPS and the city are also constructing a dormitory (it won't be
free) with special soundproofing, heavy blinds and more classrooms,
and offering shuttle bus service between the job, the dormitory and
classes.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, said John Kinney, director of Metropolitan College, is
to ``develop a group who can function with an altered circadian
rhythm.''

<P>
   Another reason to be afraid, very afraid, of the world's
elementary school children: not only do they lack the grace to act
confused around computers, but an increasing number will also be
able to churn out term papers with the speed of court stenographers
by the time they reach the sixth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the ubiquity of home and school computers, typing
classes, once a backwater for high school students shunted onto the
vocational track, are becoming part of elementary school
curriculums around the country. The Pelham Union Free School
District in New York's Westchester County, for instance, puts all
its third graders into a four-day, touch-typing crash course using
Typin's Cool, one of several child-friendly teaching methods used
in schools from Williamsburg, Va., to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Typing classes in the 1990s are decidedly multimedia, and the
instruction features videotapes, cartoons and music. But most
students have yet to achieve court-stenographer speed. Fourth
graders at Colonial Elementary School in Pelham, N.Y., who began
its immersion course last year at 2 to 6 words per minute, ended up
at only 10 to 15 words _ but after the class, the students had
improved their ergonomic approach and had eschewed the
hunt-and-peck habit, according to Gerald Finelli, the principal.
</P>
<P>
   This is one skill started ``the sooner, the better,'' said
Georgina Hancock, one of the creators of Typin's Cool. Children at
7 or 8 are less reluctant to study a manual skill, she said, and
less phobic about getting stuck in the back office.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just seeing the keyboard as a tool to get their ideas
on the screen,'' Ms. Hancock said.

<P>
   Faculty members at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
huddled one morning this semester in the education department's
Africana Resource Center, a small conference room lined with stacks
of multicultural books.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was one of the college's ``teaching circles,''
meetings among faculty members from various departments _ on this
day, chemistry, English and math _ aimed at finding ways to
strengthen programs in the face of a looming crisis: Medgar Evers'
teacher-education program, like many other colleges' throughout the
state, faces decertification unless it improves.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant topic at the meeting was literacy. Everyone talked
about getting students to ``write across the curriculum,'' a buzz
phrase here and elsewhere that means giving students more reading
and writing assignments in all classes, even science and math.
</P>
<P>
   Then the discussion turned, as it often does, to the future and
to the hurdles the school must overcome to prepare tomorrow's
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many students do not know how to do the simplest algebra, and
that's true of science majors, too,'' said John Flowers, a
professor of physical science and computer science.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of my students come to us without having read a whole
book,'' said Zala Chandler, an English literature professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are afraid of math; they are afraid of arithmetic; I'm
not saying anything about geometry,'' said Tatyana Flesher, a math
professor. ``If they carry this attitude to the classroom, you will
maybe have kids who don't know geometry.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Simmons, the chairman of the education department, is
familiar with such laments, given the fact that many of the
students throughout the college come from some of New York City's
most academically inferior schools in some of its poorest
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the City University of New York's fabled and fading
open-admissions policy, the education program is taking a tack
being repeated on teacher-education campuses across the country: it
is raising its admissions and curriculum standards _ even at the
cost of turning away students, something the program has rarely
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are interested in quality at this point,'' Dr. Simmons
said.
</P>
<P>
   And for good reason. Like three other CUNY campuses _ York,
Lehman and City College _ Medgar Evers is positioned to lose its
right to train teachers if it does not meet new state standards.
Among the new benchmarks it must reach is insuring that 80 percent
or more of its graduates pass the state's licensing examinations,
beginning in 1999; the schools get three years to shape up. But
last year, just 41 percent at Medgar Evers passed the liberal arts
exam _ the worst performance in the state after City College, at 40
percent, and Boricua College in Manhattan, at 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety at New York's teacher colleges is not unique, nor is
the soul-searching about the teachers they are sending out and the
students they are letting in. Schools across the nation are taking
a hard look at their curriculums, with many shifting emphasis from
a theoretical approach to practical experience, and state after
state is introducing or toughening licensing examinations and
mandating higher standards in what amounts to an all-out assault on
education programs and budding teachers.
</P>
<P>
   _This summer Pennsylvania enacted reforms that include requiring
prospective teachers to maintain a B average in liberal arts
courses before they can be admitted to a training program and a B
in the subject they wish to teach. (Some colleges had been
admitting students with a C-minus average.)
</P>
<P>
   _Last spring Massachusetts introduced its first-ever
certification exam; nearly 60 percent flunked, and educators and
politicians have been fighting about the test and how to improve
teacher education ever since.
</P>
<P>
   _This fall a Texas law went into effect requiring 70 percent of
an institution's graduates _ and 70 percent of each racial and
ethnic group _ to pass the state's certification exam or face
probation. Of the state's 86 teacher colleges, 35 did not measure
up, threatening their accreditation if they do not improve their
rates within three years.
</P>
<P>
   _If the 80 percent requirement for New York's 113
teacher-education programs were in effect today, at least two dozen
colleges would lose accreditation, including four campuses of CUNY,
the main supplier of teachers for New York City public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Raising standards is a trend that will surely intensify another
expected crisis: a growing shortage of teachers. Nationwide, some
200,000 new teachers will be needed within the next 10 years. In
New York City alone, officials estimate that they will need to hire
30,000 within the next five years to fill gaps created by growing
enrollments, retirements and people leaving the profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you raise the bar, fewer people will get over it,'' said
David Imig, the executive director of the American Association of
Colleges for Teacher Education, based in Washington. ``The reality
comes every Tuesday after Labor Day, when you've got vacancies in
classrooms that have to be staffed.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate on how to turn out quality teachers has long
bedeviled educators. It arises periodically, usually after the
nation goes into spasms over the quality of education as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   It happened after the Civil War, with the rise of
industrialization and the shift in skills needed as American
workers migrated from the farm to the factory.
</P>
<P>
   It happened after Sputnik, when the Soviet Union's launch of the
first satellite was taken as a sign of the poor quality of American
math and science education.
</P>
<P>
   And it is happening anew, with test results showing that
American students are behind their peers in other industrialized
nations on math and science, and lagging in literacy.

</P>
<P>
   The latest bout of concern is traced to the 1983 report ``A
Nation at Risk,'' produced by the National Commission on Excellence
in Education, which called poor teachers a significant obstacle to
the preparation of elementary and secondary school students.
</P>
<P>
   Until the report, policy makers and educators had paid attention
primarily to what children were doing in the classroom, not who was
telling them how to do it. Teachers are now increasingly seen as
the missing component in the drive to raise academic standards in
elementary and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing body of empirical evidence of how important
teaching is, as opposed to everything else,'' said Charles Lenth,
the director of higher education for the Education Commission of
the States, a Denver-based nonprofit organization that studies
state education issues. ``You can raise standards, but if you don't
have good teachers, you won't make progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of failing New York's three-part, eight-hour
certification exams caused Sharon Johnson, a Medgar Evers student
who hopes to teach special education, to stay up all night crying
on the eve of the tests last semester.
</P>
<P>
   Among students, there is a renewed respect for the exams, which
measure knowledge in the liberal arts and sciences, the subject to
be taught and teaching skills. Many have tried to take the tests
cold, without studying guides or sample questions, or taking
preparation courses offered on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a technique to taking this test,'' said Ms. Johnson,
who passed and is scheduled to graduate in January. ``If you are
used to book learning, you are not going to pass this test. You
need a strategy like a person preparing for medical-board tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Hoyle, 38, chose Medgar Evers after a year at City
College, where she felt lost among the school's 2,500 education
students. Like many of her fellow students, she is a mother _ she
has two daughters, 18 and 9 _ and has worked as a teacher's aide.
Once so shy that she quit a speech class because it required an
oral presentation to her classmates, Ms. Hoyle now laughs at the
episode and chats freely, a change she credits partly to a
close-knit, nurturing atmosphere at school.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in June, she wants to work as an elementary
school teacher. But she, too, felt that her dream was being frayed
by the certification exams. She failed to prepare the first time
she took them in February, figuring her class work would stand her
in good stead. She failed the liberal arts and science test by
three points, crushing her spirit. ``I was sick,'' she said. ``I
could not believe I failed the exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it did show me my weakness,'' she added. ``At Medgar Evers
we are taught to write essays a certain way, with an introduction,
a thesis and three supporting details, but that's not what they
wanted. It was more like summarize what you read and then give your
opinion.'' Ms. Hoyle passed the exam on her second try.
</P>
<P>
   As elsewhere, students at Medgar Evers did far better on the
portion that was focused on teaching method and subject area than
on the part designed to measure knowledge of the liberal arts. And
some CUNY institutions did relatively well on all the exams,
including the liberal arts and sciences exam. For instance, at
Queens College, whose students are drawn heavily from Queens and
suburban Long Island, 88 percent passed.
</P>
<P>
   There is no easy measure of whether teachers are actually less
able, since many exams are new or have been radically changed. That
the tests don't judge teaching ability so much as general knowledge
was a criticism heard after recent poor showings at some schools in
New York and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand the public's need to sort of have a sense
that teachers are qualified and knowledgeable in their fields,''
said Joseph Caruso, the chairman of the education department at
Framingham State College in Massachusetts. But as a society we
place too much emphasis on tests.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the sweat over the exam, Ms. Hoyle does not regret her
decision to enter teaching or Medgar Evers, founded in 1969 in the
ferment of the civil rights movement and named after the slain
Mississippi civil rights leader. The college has long been proud of
its service to the African-American community, including sponsoring
an annual conference of black writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense to me to teach in Canarsie or Howard
Beach and then come home and look at the kids in my community,
where I live, who need me,'' she said. ``I want to graduate from
Medgar Evers and say I went to a predominantly black college, and I
want to work in my community.''
</P>
<P>
   Some administrators doubt that the state would ever really close
education programs, and indeed the state is considering changing
the way it calculates which test-takers would count toward the 80
percent cutoff, which could inflate pass rates. Nonetheless, all
the threatened colleges are seeking to raise admissions standards,
and suffering the consequences _ a drop-off in the number of
eligible students.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for instance, entering Medgar Evers students needed a
minimum 2.5 overall grade point average _ and a 3.0 in English
classes _ out of 4.0; previously, students with overall averages as
low as 2.3 could get in. And in a departure from previous years,
all students were required to pass CUNY's basic skills test before
they were accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have discussed raising the required GPA to 2.7 but are
reluctant, for fear of turning away even more students and
departing from the college's open-door spirit. Although the college
has not taken its census yet, Dr. Simmons says she is certain fewer
students are entering the program, which had about 900 students
last spring. Some courses had to be canceled this year because too
few signed up.
</P>
<P>
   Mwalimu J. Shujaa, dean of the school of liberal arts and
education, says losing the teaching program would set back efforts
to diversify the teaching work force, which is overwhelmingly white
in New York (66 percent) and the nation (87 percent). Educators
believe that a diverse teaching force would better respond to the
increasingly diverse student population.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure you are aware of the national profile of teachers,''
Dr. Shujaa said. White, female, suburban.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you need a lot of teachers but don't want to pay much, what
do you do?'' said Richard Soder, a professor of education at the
University of Washington in Seattle, who has studied
teacher-training and hiring. ``You go to women and make sure the
training is not significant, because they might find grounding for
areas where they make more money.''

</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the public school teaching work force of 2.7 million
nationwide is more than three-quarters female. And although some
states are seeking to raise teacher pay, the average beginning
salary remains well below that for fields like business and
computers.
</P>
<P>
   It has always been a struggle to attract top-flight teaching
candidates. Even within universities, support and respect for
education programs go lacking.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1997 National Center for Education Statistics
report, based on 1992-93 data, students in education programs
tested into remedial college courses at higher rates _ 18 percent
took remedial math, compared with 11 percent of majors in the
humanities and social science, and 13 percent took remedial
English, compared with 7 percent of humanities and social science
majors. Education students' entrance exam scores are also lower,
with about half as many education majors in the top quartile as
humanities and social science majors.
</P>
<P>
   John Silber, the chairman of the Massachusetts Board of
Education, put it rather tartly during a summer meeting of
education school deans smarting over the poor performance of
students on that state's teacher certification exams. ``Education
programs have a reputation as a place for dum-dums,'' he said, and
are considered ``the laughing stock by serious scholars.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We ought to take that to heart.''
</P>
<P>
   An additional problem is that universities do not tend to pour
money into their educational programs, which are relatively
inexpensive to run, requiring little in the way of equipment and
other resources in comparison with, say, chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``These places are cash cows,'' said Linda Darling-Hammond,
director of the National Commission on Teaching and America's
Future, based at Teachers College at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   The National Center for Education Statistics reports that
education professors are paid, on average, $11,000 less a year than
their peers in other departments. And colleges spend about $100
less per student credit-hour on education programs than for
engineering, though tuition is generally the same.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike medical or law schools, education programs are also not
required to be certified or accredited by a professional board,
although there is a move to change that. Of the 1,300
teacher-education institutions, about 500 have been accredited
voluntarily by the National Council for the Accreditation of
Teacher Education, a Washington-based professional organization
that conducts rigorous review of their faculties, curriculums and
student populations.
</P>
<P>
   Two states, North Carolina and Arkansas, require the council's
accreditation, and several others, including New York, now strongly
advise it, said Arthur Wise, the group's president. Only four
institutions in New York State _ Fordham, Hofstra, and Niagara
universities and the State University College at Buffalo _ are
accredited by the council.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the major crop to sprout from the baked earth of far
west Texas has been cotton, grown on great big farms that splash
green and white on the otherwise brown and crimson moonscape.
</P>
<P>
   Now the folks ``up at the college'' _ the University of Texas at
El Paso _ are trying to seed something else entirely, all in the
name of better educating the farmers and working-class residents
along the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   The university, recognized by the United States Department of
Education in its ``Promising Practices'' report on teacher
education in September, is growing a teaching hospital, but one
that aims to turn out teachers rather than doctors. And, to carry
the analogy further, the E.R.'s where the interns apply theory to
practice are schools like H.D. Hilley Elementary, right in the
middle of a cotton field in nearby Socorro.
</P>
<P>
   There, Maribel Alarcon, a student teacher, huddled on a recent
day with a pack of sixth graders who measured and snipped and
folded their multicolored construction paper into origami, all in
the name of geometry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you see the triangles?'' she asked as they twisted and
turned their frogs and whales to find the shapes. ``Is there a
parallelogram in there?''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a breather, Ms. Alarcon summed up the value of the
classroom experience: ``On campus we got a lot of theory, but here
we have hands-on practice with the kids. This gives us real
approaches.''
</P>
<P>
   It is such approaches that educators hail as the wave of the
future for education schools, which have been looking inward to
find ways to improve the way they themselves teach.
</P>
<P>
   Education students, like those with other majors, usually spend
the first couple of years taking a college's core requirement of
arts and sciences courses, like English and math, with the last two
years devoted to education classes. In this latter period, they
have traditionally done an 8-to-12-week ``student teaching''
experience at a school, and also taken courses that focus on
theory, methods of instruction and, in many cases,
multiculturalism.
</P>
<P>
   Most campuses devote considerable class time to teaching
student-centered learning, a method of instruction that discourages
teachers from standing in front of the classroom to lecture;
instead, they are taught to engage youngsters in group discussions
and activities that encourage the children to ask questions and
find their own answers, with guidance rather than instruction from
the teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be a sage on the stage, be a guide on the side,'' is how
Stephanie Hadley, an El Paso student, put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old way was teacher-directed, where they don't ask kids to
do anything,'' said Carmen Rotchford, another student, as if
recalling a bad memory. But they just lecture and stand up there in
the front of the class.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as their science-education teacher, Sally Blake, explained:
``Do you want kids that can do rote memorization, or do you want
ones that can think? You want ones that can think.''
</P>
<P>
   In her class, it is not unusual to see students doing the very
activities they would require of their pupils. One day last month,
for instance, her students found themselves doing a minute's worth
of jumping jacks, but not to limber up. They broke up into groups
of three: one student did the jacks; another counted them; and a
third recorded the time at intervals throughout the minute. The
goal was to measure the changing rate over time, and prepare a bar
graph showing the results. In most cases, the pace of the jacks
slowed over the course of the minute. ``It's something physical, as
opposed to word problems,'' Professor Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   Other education courses typically involve classroom management
and diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs from Professor Blake's class, Virginia Gonzalez
teaches ``Critical Pedagogy,'' whose reading list includes titles
like ``Pedagogy of the Oppressed,'' by Paulo Freire. In this class,
she said, they learn to respect students' viewpoints and to become
mindful of the displays of cultural diversity seen in a classroom,
like Hispanic immigrants' reluctance to question authority figures,
like teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a critical theorist, you are constantly deconstructing,''
she tells her pupils. ``You are creating a learning space for your
students. You are not defining them and saying, `You sit here and
this is what you do.' ''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, schools are reducing the number of such
courses, which have drawn ridicule from conservative scholars like
Silber, who would rather see education students spend more time
learning English and math than learning what he calls overly soft,
touchy-feely approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving away from the Mickey Mouse courses that always
focus on development and method and not enough on content,'' said
Richard Kunkel, dean of the College of Education at Auburn
University in Alabama and executive director of the Holmes
Partnership, a consortium of 120 universities seeking ways to
improve teacher education. ``Good training has a balance of content
and practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Pacheco, the dean of El Paso's education school, defends
the method courses as necessary to give teachers a grounding in how
to approach their students and develop lessons. Nonetheless, the
college in the last few years has scaled back on such on-campus
classes in favor of a field-based approach. ``Teachers are now
prepared more like doctors and nurses, and less like philosophers
or historians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, medical schools are seen as models for
teacher-preparation programs, which are driven more and more by the
need to strike a better balance between teaching theories of
learning and giving education students more practical, clinical
experience in elementary and secondary classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The National Commission on Teaching and America's Future
recommended such an approach in a report last year, suggesting that
field experience be increased to a full school year instead of the
typical half year, but under close supervision from instructors or
``mentor teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   The report did not suggest abandoning theory and methodology
courses, and to strong programs like El Paso's, striking a balance
is key.
</P>
<P>
   Even El Paso, though, has not been immune to the drive to raise
standards. The education program has raised its minimum grade point
average for admission (and staying in) to 2.5 from 2.25, and is
requiring its 1,500 students to take additional math and science
classes. El Paso has met the new state requirement, posting a 78
percent overall success rate on the certification exam, and about
70 percent for each minority group, including Hispanics, the
largest group on campus.
</P>
<P>
   The education program has restructured in the last few years,
with the centerpiece the drive to increase preparation in the
field. In keeping with the teaching-hospital model, seniors are
called interns and spend about 600 to 700 hours in the field _
double what they used to _ at 25 ``partner'' schools.
</P>
<P>
   They are like Christine Dalby, one of 13 interns spending this
semester at Ascarate Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not imagine not having this experience,'' said Ms.
Dalby, who found an answer to managing classroom discipline in
Renee Reszel's sixth-grade room. ``At the beginning of the class,
she didn't discuss rules or anything like that. Instead, she works
on the point system, where they get points for good behavior. It's
all positive reinforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   But reality often clashes with the high ideals espoused in the
lecture hall.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges can instill in their students the best theory, the
latest in methodology, but the effect of the teacher reform
movement boils down to what happens when schools send their new
recruits out to face veteran teachers and administrators suspicious
of different ways of thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Take Ms. Hadley, the enthusiastic intern determined not to be a
``sage on the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   One day she was helping a veteran teacher at an elementary
school with an exercise in which the pupils had to read a passage
and then answer questions about it. Taking the initiative, Ms.
Hadley saw an opportunity to make the lesson ``more connected to
real-life experience,'' she said. The passage dealt with developing
a ``world calendar,'' a reconfigured 364-day calendar in which
numbered days of the month fall on the same weekday each year.
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. Hadley had the students design their own calendars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought it was neat,'' she said. ``Their birthdays fell
the same day every year.''
</P>
<P>
   But inevitably, theory bumps into practice. What feedback did
she get from the more tradition-bound classroom teacher?
</P>
<P>
   ``She called me a twit.'' &QC;

<P>
   GREAT NECK, N.Y. _ The senior-year obsessing had the quality of
timeless ritual as eight top students at Great Neck South High
School gathered to discuss their college application plans one
morning in September.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was intent on a designer-label college (three Yale, two
Harvard, one MIT, two still thinking). Everyone said there was too
much pressure. A few voiced dutiful reminders that there were
plenty of great schools and no one should think his life is over if
he doesn't get into Harvard. But the underlying angst recalled
generations of high school seniors and parents in wound-too-tight
New York suburbs, where getting into the right college is the only
game in town.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that most seniors applied to four or five
colleges, usually by mid-January, and got word in March or April.
But every one of the Great Neck students, even those not yet sure
where they wanted to go, was planning to apply through some kind of
early-acceptance program. The plans allow students to apply to one
favored school in early fall, with an answer in mid-December, but
they also obligate them to enroll there if accepted.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago only a handful of students at Great Neck South
applied early. This year, in a class of 226, almost a quarter will.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two or three years it has become apparent that the
college application process has radically changed, at least at the
most competitive colleges, which are filling more and more of their
classes early and leaving fewer slots for regular applicants.
What's less clear is whether what's good for colleges is good for
students. If early decision gives some students the ability to
short-circuit a year of agonizing over applications, for others it
is leading to enormous pressures to pick a school quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some kids who know from the ninth grade where they
want to go,'' said Michael Cheng, a Great Neck senior who was
trying to decide between Stanford and the University of
Pennsylvania. ``But a lot of kids aren't sure where they want to
go, but they feel they have a better chance of getting in early, so
they really have to do it. That's where most of my friends are
right now. Most of them think that even if they're not sure, they
have to apply early.''
</P>
<P>
   The plans are not new. They have existed for decades for the
rare student committed early in the senior year to a single school.
But colleges are now adding programs willy-nilly. Two decades ago,
about 120 colleges and universities, mostly selective, private
ones, offered some form of early admission. Now almost 500 do. The
proliferation of plans and the perception that students will miss
out if they don't apply early are making the admissions process
much more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Studies by the National Association for College Admission
Counseling, in Alexandria, Va., indicate that almost everything _
from application due dates to chances of getting in early _ varies
from school to school.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a third of colleges surveyed use different
standards for early decision than for regular admission. Of these,
half say the early-decision standards are higher, and half say they
are lower. (They give special consideration to these applicants
because they show a strong commitment to the school.)
</P>
<P>
   Some schools, like Swarthmore, Stanford and Smith, now have two
early-decision deadlines, one in the fall and one early in the
winter. Most colleges are willing to defer a final decision on
early applicants who don't get in, rejecting only the weakest and
giving others a second look later. But a few, like Northwestern,
flatly accept or reject all early candidates. Northwestern says it
has the same admissions standards for all students, but other
schools, like Duke and Johns Hopkins, give an advantage to
early-decision applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Admissions experts say that because there are enough slots open
at all schools during the entire process, no one should feel
obligated to apply early. But for many parents and students,
applying early is seen more as a requirement than an option. The
panic is most pronounced in the Northeast and high-dollar pockets
in other parts of the country, where competition to get into top
colleges is most intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense that the whole process has gotten out of
hand,'' said Joyce Smith, the executive director of the National
Association for College Admission Counseling. ``People, at the
least, expect the process to be transparent; they want to
understand what the deadlines are and what the nuances are and how
decisions are made. I don't think that's the case right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the terminology can be a bit confusing. There are four main
admissions options:
</P>
<P>
   _The traditional process allows students to make multiple
applications, usually due by mid-January, with responses coming in
March or April.
</P>
<P>
   _In early-decision plans, students can apply early _ usually
between Nov. 1 and Dec. 1 _ to only one school. They agree to
enroll if accepted, though if financial aid is insufficient, they
can get out of their commitment. Students can have only one
early-decision application pending at any time, and once accepted,
they must withdraw any regular applications.
</P>
<P>
   _Early-action plans, which are far less common, but are used at
some top schools like Harvard, Brown and MIT, allow students to
apply early to one school. If accepted, they are not obligated to
attend but can go through the rest of the process knowing they got
into their early choice. Applications can be rejected outright or,
more often, deferred until the spring. Although these plans can be
riskier for colleges, top schools usually get a high enrollment
rate from accepted applicants. And since the programs have no down
side for students, they encourage strong candidates to apply.
</P>
<P>
   _In rolling admissions plans, which are also less common,
colleges review applications as they are received, sending out
acceptances and rejections throughout the school year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The more desired schools, in particular, are taking increasingly
big chunks of their classes before most applicants have even
applied.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, last year, for the first time, Harvard accepted
more than half its class early. Columbia accepted 45 percent;
Dartmouth and Yale, more than a third. Officials say the process
varies from year to year, depending on the number and quality of
the applicants, but the trend over the last few years is more early
admissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the colleges' point of view, it's great,'' said Tom
Gaines, the guidance office chairman at Great Neck South. ``They
get a lot of first-round draft choices and then they can use the
rest of the process to mold the demographics of the class from
there. If I'm a college administrator, I have to think this is the
way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other advantages. With the crush of applications, it
makes sense to start the process early. Early decision also gives
colleges more financial leverage. Students increasingly shop for
the best aid package, pitting one school's offer against another's.
With binding early decision, there's no such bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, early decision works best for students who are
least reliant on financial aid. It also works well for those who
don't need their senior year to improve grades or show increased
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the appeal for students is knowing before Christmas where
they'll go to college, as well as getting the chance to stretch: if
early-decision applicants get special consideration, the process
represents a shot at a school that may otherwise seem out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   So Kevin Hsueh, another Great Neck South senior, figured he'd
apply early to Dartmouth or Williams, and if he didn't get in, he'd
apply as a regular applicant to the University of California at
Berkeley, Wesleyan, Cornell and New York University.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you really know that this is the school for you?'' he
said. ``But I figure this gives me a chance to go for a little bit
of a stretch, so there's nothing lost in trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Others find the strategizing more complicated. Should you apply
early to your second- or third-choice school, to avoid being shut
out of it in the spring if your first-choice college proves too
much of a stretch?
</P>
<P>
   Generally, colleges and high school counselors insist that no
one should apply early unless certain of his or her choice. And the
pressure to narrow those choices can be particularly hard on
students Dr. Gaines refers to as ``throwbacks'' _ those who have
been more interested in learning than in building the right resume
to dazzle the Ivies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had a strong feeling I had to apply one place,'' said
Kyra Jucovy, a student who was trying to decide among a number of
schools, including Harvard, Brown, Swarthmore and Amherst. ``I wish
I had that sensation. I don't know where people get it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other problems. Having so many students already
accepted to colleges can put added burdens on high schools to keep
seniors engaged.
</P>
<P>
   It can also put certain strains on colleges. More than a third
of colleges in the association's survey said students are not
honoring early-decision commitments the way they used to. Though
students must file a nonrefundable deposit at some point, the
system operates on trust, not on anything legally binding.
</P>
<P>
   But since the process generally works for colleges, few expect a
concerted effort to move away from early applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say that the college board, our organization and
others have been grappling with this issue,'' Ms. Smith said,
``because it seems we've moved further and further away from the
traditional understanding and definition of early decision. But I'm
not sure much can be done about it. It feels like the train is out
of the station, and everyone is trying to catch up to it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rx for Application Fever: A Dose of Early Acceptance &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Early-decision programs, in which a student applies early to one
school and commits to enrolling if accepted, work for some students
but not all. Carol Loewith, president of the Independent
Educational Consultants Association, an organization of freelance
admissions consultants based in Fairfax, Va., offers a few tips:
</P>
<P>
   _Read applications carefully. Deadlines and details vary.
</P>
<P>
   _Visit a school before applying, and do it early. Campus visits
that used to be made in the fall of senior year should be done in
the previous summer or in the spring of junior year.
</P>
<P>
   _Do your homework. Does the school usually defer or reject early
applicants who don't make it? Is it easier or harder to get in? If
the standards are higher for early-decision applicants, and the
school usually rejects these applicants instead of deferring
consideration, you may want to wait.
</P>
<P>
   _If you've underachieved on grades or SAT's, a good showing
senior year will help your chances. Early decision may not work for
you.
</P>
<P>
   _If you're not sure a particular school is best, consider
early-action plans. Though far fewer schools offer them, they are
the most advantageous for students, assuring them acceptance
without obliging them to attend.
</P>
<P>
   _Don't panic and apply early to a school that may be wrong for
you. Except at the most selective schools, which rely on early
decision to fill more and more slots, the trend is not greatly
changing the admissions equation. No school takes so much of its
class early that a superior candidate doesn't stand a chance of
getting in during the regular admissions process.
</P>
<P>
   _Still, if you're interested in one of the most competitive
schools, give the early-decision option serious consideration. ``In
the past,'' Ms. Loewith said, ``I said early decision is only good
if you absolutely love the school. This year I find myself saying,
`If it's a place you really want, even if there are others you
might like as well, it might be worth doing.' If your best chance
of getting into Yale or Harvard or Columbia is early decision, then
in some cases it might be fine.''

GARDENING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

   Birdhouse Gourds
</P>
<P>
   Q. When are birdhouse gourds ready for harvest? Must they age or
dry out after harvesting? How does one make a real birdhouse from
the birdhouse gourd?
</P>
<P>
   A. Think small birds. Like most hard-shell gourds, bottle gourds
(Lagenaria siceraria), which are used for birdhouses or musical
instruments, prefer a long, hot season to grow and ripen. Start
seeds indoors, about three to four weeks before the last frost,
then plant outside in full sun once the night temperatures remain
above 60 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   I know a Northern gardener who helps his heat-loving vines along
by letting them climb and sprawl on an arbor built over an asphalt
driveway. The black asphalt captures heat during the day and
releases it at night, helping the vines to explode with lush, leafy
foliage and fragrant, night-blooming flowers. It also helps the
fruit to mature.
</P>
<P>
   Let the vines grow as long as they can, until light frost
withers the plants. Harvest the gourds, including a couple of
inches of stem. Hang them up to dry at room temperature, spacing
them for good air circulation. Let the gourds dry until you can
hear the seeds rattle around when you shake them _ anywhere from
six months to a year, depending on the size.
</P>
<P>
   If you want homemade maracas, you are done, except for the fancy
painting. For a birdhouse, cut a hole far enough up from the base
for a bird to feather its nest, but not up into the neck area. You
want the birds to be able to get in without banging their heads
against the back wall. The size of the hole depends on the birds.
Chickadees, for example, need a one-and-a-half-inch hole. Larger
birds will need a larger hole, and a larger gourd. Add one or two
small drainage holes in the bottom, clean out the seeds with a
spoon and it's ready. Or don't clean it out, and let the birds have
the seeds as a moving-in gift.
</P>
<P>
   Quick Cover
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you have any information as to which are the fastest
growing evergreens?
</P>
<P>
   A. It really depends on your needs. Most requests for fast
growing evergreens come from people who discover that their new
neighbor collects junk cars. If that's the case, then a fast grower
like white pine might not be a good choice. While it grows as much
as 50 feet in 25 years, it eventually loses some lower branches,
letting the glint from those old hubcaps shine through. It is also
sensitive to salt, making it a poor roadside choice if your
community uses salt in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Is your site wet? The tall, slender Atlantic white cedar
(Chamaecyparis thyoides) will do just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Are you making a hedge? Canadian hemlock works well, but wooly
adelgid attacks mean a high maintenance obligation.
</P>
<P>
   I know you see it everywhere, but Eastern arborvitae (Thuja
occidentalis) does make an effective, quick growing hedge. A more
handsome version _ the Western or great arborvitae (Thuja plicata),
does well from Boston to Cincinnati to Raleigh, N.C., despite the
Western connotation of its common name.
</P>
<P>
   A grouping of three to five tall, pyramidal Japanese cryptomeria
forms a screen, not really a hedge, although it works better as a
single specimen tree. The feathery Leyland cypress (x
Cupressocyparis leylandii) gives a more columnar screen, and grows
in coastal areas from Massachusetts to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   For large, single specimens, Norway spruce (Picea abies) and
Atlas cedar (Cedrus atlantica) grow quickly when young, then slow
down.
</P>
<P>
   Spend a little time looking before you buy. Large evergreens are
a strong presence in the landscape, summer and winter. This is a
great season to go to public arboretums and botanical gardens and
look at mature examples. Do you have the room? Is it as cute at 30
feet, or at 80, as it is in a container?
</P>
<P>
   Growing Cherimoyas
</P>
<P>
   Q. A few weeks ago in Chinatown I bought cherimoyas from a
street vendor. My first exposure to this fruit was 25 years ago in
Venezuela. Since then I've been hooked on its unique flavor, a
mixture of strawberry and pineapple. I have grown many exotics from
seed, but when I scarified and soaked my cherimoya seeds, sprouts
never appeared. I do not think that the fruits were frozen in
transport, nor did I refrigerate them. My only conclusion is that
they must have been irradiated by the Food and Drug Administration.
Is there hope in growing this wonderful fruit in my own backyard?
</P>
<P>
   A. The FDA does not irradiate or require imported food to be
irradiated. Quarantine and inspection are still the methods of
choice for protecting the food supply.
</P>
<P>
   You can grow cherimoyas if your backyard happens to be in a
subtropical, frost-free region that doesn't get too humid in the
summer. Israel would do, or Egypt, Chile, parts of South Africa or
some areas of California.

   It's too humid in Florida, but Dr. Jonathan Crane, a tropical
fruit crop specialist at the University of Florida's Tropical
Research and Education Center in Homestead, has experimented with
growing cherimoyas from seed. He found that the seed seems to have
an after-ripening requirement. Seeds that have been well cleaned
(don't want any fungus) should be left to age in a plastic bag at
room temperature for at least three months (six is even better).
Soaked for a day and planted one-half-inch deep in well drained
growing medium and kept moist, they will germinate in three to four
weeks. However, this only works if the pot has bottom heat so the
medium is kept at 80 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   That's the easy part, relatively speaking, and it will result in
a large, full-sun foliage plant. Fruit is another matter. After
three to eight years as a juvenile, your cherimoya may flower, but
the species of beetle that pollinates it will not be around _ the
FDA inspections keep them out of the country. And hand pollinating
is tricky because the male and female flowers bloom at different
times. Well, you've got a few years to figure out how to imitate a
beetle. &QL;

BUILDING ON A FIELD OF DREAMS IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ind., Fla., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By PHILIP NOBEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Forget Bilbao. The future of architectural pilgrimage may be in
Guadalajara, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   With a brand new fortune and an ambition that rivals that of
Walt Disney Co., the Omnilife Group, a Guadalajara-based
vitamin-drink company, is sponsoring a giant new
business-and-cultural center at the edge of that sprawling city.
</P>
<P>
   The imperial-scale project, which could begin construction as
early as February, promises to raise the bar on extravagance for
out-of-the-way places looking to put themselves on the
architectural map. Why settle for a single building by Frank Gehry
when you can afford to hire 10 other star architects as well?
</P>
<P>
   The list of projects for the new satellite city _ on a 750-acre
swath of farmland just beyond Guadalajara's beltway _ reads like a
lifetime supply of dream jobs: In addition to a possible
contribution by Gehry (who remains undecided), plans call for an
entertainment complex by Wolf Prix, a partner in the architecture
firm Coop Himmelblau in Vienna; a contemporary art museum by Toyo
Ito of Japan; a 25,000-seat amphitheater by the New York team of
Tod Williams and Billie Tsien; a hotel and 80 units of housing by
Stephen Holl of New York; a fairground landscape by Carme Pinos of
Barcelona, and a state-of-the-art convention center by Enrique
Norten of Mexico City, who is also overseeing the design of the
site plan and acting as the overall talent coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Libeskind, the American architect living in Berlin whose
first building, the Felix Nussbaum Museum, opened in Osnabrueck,
Germany, in July, is working on what the project's organizers call
a University of Success, to house departments of education,
government and architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Thom Mayne, the impresario behind the Santa Monica firm
Morphosis, is designing a ``palenque,'' a traditional Mexican
cockfighting ring to be used also for bloodless concerts and
sporting events. And on a site near the center of the project, the
French architect Jean Nouvel is to design a new headquarters for
Omnilife.
</P>
<P>
   The mastermind behind this play for architectural immortality is
Omnilife president Jorge Vergara Madrigal, 43. At first glance, he
is an unlikely Medici. Before he founded Omnilife in 1991, he said,
he earned a living by frying pork on the streets of Guadalajara.
Then he went broke. Struggling back to solvency _ and away from
fatty foods _ he became a distributor for Herbalife, a producer of
nutritional supplements, but he quit after becoming dissatisfied
with what he saw as Herbalife's insensitivity to Mexican culture.
</P>
<P>
   When he founded Omnilife, with six distributors and three
employees, Vergara set out to make vitamin-enriched drinks in
flavors, like coffee and cola, that he thought would better appeal
to the Latin American palate. Adopting the pyramidal distribution
structure used by Herbalife and Amway, Omnilife grossed, Vergara
said, $240 million last year in sales of its 52 fortified beverage
products, through the efforts of its reported 700,000 Mexican
distributors.
</P>
<P>
   The company also operates in Guatemala, Costa Rica, Colombia,
Peru, Argentina, Spain and the United States, primarily in
California and the Southwest. In the United States, it has
recruited 12,000 mostly Spanish-speaking distributors to sell its
wares.
</P>
<P>
   Given Omnilife's youth and rapid expansion _ and the fact that a
final construction budget will not be released until January _ many
of the architects involved admitted to feeling wary at first about
Vergara and his project, which is also to include an undetermined
amount of additional housing and commercial space in a projected
second phase.
</P>
<P>
   At a forum sponsored by the Architectural League of New York on
Oct. 8, Ms. Tsien described how she and Williams reacted to the
project: ``We said, `Oh, great, we're going down to Mexico, and
there's this guy who sells vitamins who is somehow going to make
this project work?' It seemed too good to be true.'' Now, after
having worked with Vergara since May and having visited the site,
they are more optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Prix attested to the ``incredible power'' of his client. ``He
has charisma,'' Prix said, ``and I was impressed by his social
thinking. He really believes that when he builds a school it will
improve education for young Mexican kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Gehry's skepticism remains unassuaged. The other architects
are reserving a site for what would be his building, a performing
arts center at the edge of an artificial lake, but Gehry said he
needed to hear more about the feasibility of bringing
infrastructure like water, sewers and roads to the undeveloped
site. ``When I'm convinced it's real,'' he said, ``I'll jump in.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike similar projects, such as those by Cummins Engine Co. _
which turned Columbus, Ind., into something of an architectural
museum, with buildings by Saarinen, Pei, Weese, Meier, Polshek and
Venturi, among others _ or by Disney _ which has amassed a
collection of trophy architects at its theme parks and in
Celebration, Fla. _ Vergara has directed his team to collaborate
very closely on all phases of the design.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent visit to Manhattan, he waved his hand at the
view from his high corner suite at the Four Seasons Hotel. ``Here,
you see all these different buildings, and some of them don't
integrate well with each other,'' he said. ``I want the architects
to be able to join together to plan how to make a more beautiful,
more livable space, and to think how their buildings would
integrate with the other guy's building across the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether this grand vision of architectural harmony is too good
to be true may be apparent soon. The amphitheater and fairgrounds
are expected to be completed by December 1999, in time to be the
site for what Vergara calls a ``millennium cultural event.'' The
rest of the complex is scheduled to be finished by 2003, when the
Pan American Games go to Guadalajara. &QL;

 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's a proud green serpent of vegetables
undulating over the grass at Wave Hill, the public garden in the
Riverdale section of the Bronx, known for its imagination and
unusual plants.
</P>
<P>
   I had never seen columnar basil before, for instance, until I
saw it last week, marching along the inner curves of an S-shaped
fence that forms the backbone of this garden, where giant heads of
a metallic-blue cabbage named Scarlet O'Hara are set off by the
smaller heads of a green cabbage called Dynamo, and red kale stands
a good four feet over grassy-green oak-leaf lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   The basil is called Aussie Sweetie. ``I hate the name, but it
has a wonderful shape,'' said Marco Polo Stufano, Wave Hill's
director of horticulture. ``It's a woody plant, and it gets taller
than this, but we just shear it like a hedge.''
</P>
<P>
   Aussie Sweetie _ which makes a peppery pesto, by the way _ is
just one of the stars of a vegetable garden that's more like a
living sculpture, with its grand architecture of vine-covered
towers and raised pots full of red and purple chili peppers or
flaming lettuces, flanked by billowing golden amaranth, Swiss chard
leaves as big as canoe paddles, and carpets of curly parsley.
</P>
<P>
   Like many works of art, it began in a hardware store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw this reinforcing wire in a building supply store,''
Stufano said, explaining the bones of his latest piece of
performance art. The sturdy fencing _ 4-by-4-inch squares of wire _
has been used to build cylindrical towers, which vary in height,
from 12 feet at the head of this beast to 5 feet at its tail. The
same fencing forms an S-shaped backbone down the middle, creating a
satisfying horizontal to the vertical towers.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, before all that chlorophyll started pumping away
and these wire cylinders and curving fence were still bare, they
were satisfying in a different way. ``Every stage of design should
feel good,'' Stufano said. ``If it doesn't, the bones aren't
right.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, each vegetable, so beautifully tended, is in itself a
work of art. The swirling leaves of a cabbage head are kind of
astounding, if you take the time to look at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People enjoy seeing vegetables grow,'' Stufano said, ``and
they  &UR; should &LR;  see them. We could have planted them in rows, but
this isn't a farm.''
</P>
<P>
   I'll say. ``Some people have never seen an eggplant growing,''
he continued, ``and they'll stop and say, `Oh! So that's what it
looks like.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sort of like seeing a cow being milked at one of those farms
that has to take in tourists to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I've ever seen that,'' Stufano mused. ``I
don't know if I ever  &UR; want &LR;  to see that. And I have no interest in
drinking warm milk, fresh from the cow.''
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to tell the man to eat his vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love kale,'' he said, his voice getting cozy as he nodded
toward a diagonal line of curly kale, the plants as high as his
chest. ``I eat it sauteed with garlic, over pasta.''
</P>
<P>
   And although he's disappointed with the color of Bright Lights,
the Swiss chard with the supposedly sunny yellow veins (more like
curdled cream), its hefty leaves inspire a dish his Italian mother
used to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would brown some garlic in olive oil, then add some
potatoes,'' he said. ``When those are half cooked, you add the
cut-up chard and maybe a little chicken stock. It turns into this
sticky, wonderful comfort food.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only 11 a.m., and I was starving.
</P>
<P>
   The vegetables have been planted with Stufano's exquisite eye
for pattern and color. A generous blue-green terra-cotta pot, set
inside a waist-high cylinder of reinforcing wire, is bursting with
the crinkled, dark crimson leaves of a lettuce called Merlot.
</P>
<P>
   The curving fence supports a vine of filigreed leaves and
strange oblong fruits that appear to be covered with blisters.
Balsam pears, as they're called, start out pale green, then turn
orange as they ripen, finally opening at their tips to dangle big
red seeds at gaping strangers. It's sort of a Times Square,
pre-Disney vegetable. When I asked what it tastes like, Stufano
mumbled something about an Indian friend who says you can fry the
skins like potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why we bring British gardeners here to design
kitchen gardens,'' Stufano said, referring to garden designers like
Rosemary Verey and Penelope Hobhouse, who have many American
clients. ``Americans have a long tradition of vegetable gardens,
like Mount Vernon and Monticello. And even a farm row has a kind of
beauty, with space between the rows, and between each plant, so you
can see its architecture. The repetition is part of it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought of the pilgrims I had seen in Ms. Verey's kitchen
garden north of London, meticulously copying the patterns and
plants into notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A garden shouldn't be a clone,'' he said. ``Or a decoration
for the house. It should be an expression of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The vines on the towers are a study in contrasts, from the
delicate cardinal vine, with leaves as finely pointed as birds'
feet and little red flowers, to the sturdy leaves as big as hands
that scramble over the tallest cylinder. This is Sicana oderifera;
its common name, cassabanana, must refer to its enthusiastic
fruits, which turn orange-crimson and are quite odoriferous under a
tropical sun. Here, they just stay green.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the cucumber family,'' Stufano said, pointing to two
fruits way overhead that seemed to have forgotten that cucumbers
are not the size of watermelons.
</P>
<P>
   I left the garden wondering who first got this notion of
vegetables as sculpture. The Egyptians painted sheaths of wheat on
their tomb walls. Did Pliny the Younger twiddle with cabbages on
the terrace of his seaside villa near Rome? Was a gardener in
Pompeii admiring her curly parsley when the volcano blew?
</P>
<P>
   I'll get back to you on that. But in the meantime, check out the
works of art at Wave Hill.

DESIGN NOTEBOOK: WHIPPING UP MARTINIS AND HOME GLAMOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGH POINT, N.C. _ Blenders whirred all day in the Rowe
Furniture showroom at the International Home Furnishings Market,
which opened here Oct. 15 and ran through last Friday. Behind an
antique bar, young assistants in white jackets whipped up fresh
fruit smoothies for the buyers shopping Rowe's line of mid-priced
furniture. Come 5 p.m., however, a glowing neon olive in an
oversize cocktail glass signaled that Rowe was shaking up martinis.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of market: plenty of sensible high-fiber
furniture, but with a surprise serving of swank, expressed in
silver-plated drawer pulls at Henredon, fake-fur upholstery at
Fendi and an Art Moderne-style coffee table in polished goatskin at
Ralph Lauren. ``People are looking for better goods,'' Rob Pitt,
head buyer for Crate and Barrel, said. ``Or at least the perception
of better goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 8-million-square-foot market, the world's largest
furniture exposition, ``relaxed comfort'' _ the mantra of recent
years _ was dressed up and recast as self-indulgent luxury,
inspired by everything from 1930s Hollywood to the new popularity
of cashmere in apparel. ``It's the times,'' the designer Larry
Laslo said. ``Glamour makes you feel desirable, successful and on
top of the world.'' And with luck, cushioned against the economic
storm clouds darkening other segments of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, furniture buyers and sellers had reason to feel on
top of the world. Under nearly flawless autumn skies, the estimated
71,500 market visitors basked in what the trade newspaper Furniture
Today calculated was the strongest business climate since the
mid-'80s, with furniture shipments 14 percent ahead of this time
last year. With interest rates falling, housing starts and home
sales strong, low unemployment, rising household income and a baby
boom generation just coming into its inheritance, industry analysts
were expecting the good times to roll well into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the new glamour looked a lot like the old cocoon,
dressed in silkworm fantasies. Clubby leather chairs, recliners
that didn't look like recliners and sleek Art Moderne armoires had
a lot more to do with staying home than stepping out.
</P>
<P>
   Glamour had its own practical logic. Mindful that an economic
slowdown was only a matter of time, manufacturers sought to move
furniture into the nearly recession-proof realm of luxury goods.
``Luxury goods manufacturers are doing fabulously well right now,''
said Chris Plasman, president of Baker, who will bring out leather
furniture in January licensed by Coach.
</P>
<P>
   High-profile retailers like Crate and Barrel and Pottery Barn
were also credited with accelerating the trend toward luxury goods,
if only by reaction. Pushed by their success, many mid-priced
furniture manufacturers have cleaned up their acts, adding
Shaker-esque contemporary collections to their more traditional
lineups. Even Sears is seeking to shed its dowdy image with
contemporary leather upholstery from Natuzzi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smooth and sleek isn't news anymore. People are beginning to
look for a little more craftsmanship,'' said Diane Granda, design
director for John Widdicomb, which introduced a collection of
high-style Georgian and Regency furniture inspired by British
museum pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Some exhibitors tried to stir up a little excitement by hitching
their products to well-known names. Thomasville Furniture
executives in neatly pressed safari jackets conducted tours around
the 96-piece collection of licensed Ernest Hemingway furniture (the
most unlikely entry: an armchair upholstered in fabric printed with
manuscript pages of ``The Sun Also Rises''). Models flown in from
Dallas vogued around the American Drew showroom, where the
surprisingly sedate Bob Mackie collection of mid-priced
rococo-style furniture was introduced.
</P>
<P>
   But the real news was generated by some old market hands.
Barbara Barry, whose first Art Deco-esque collection for Baker had
its debut in 1996, added about 35 pieces, most prominently in a
glossy off-white enamel finish. At John Widdicomb, Laslo added
eight pieces to his Moderne Collection in mahogany, wenge and
sycamore. Henredon, no stranger to excess, upped the glamour
quotient with Circa 2000, a pastiche of Art Moderne and Hollywood
fantasy in maple and silver leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers tried to distance themselves from the glitzy '80s
opulence that Michael Delgaudio, vice president at Century, called
``swag and gag.'' Quiet but tactile was the byword.Baker, for
instance, showcased Ms. Barry's new pieces in a boudoir vignette,
using a writing desk as a dressing table complete with silver tray,
love note and Chanel No. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mitchell Gold, which has staked a solid claim in the middle
of the market, introduced a new Platinum collection of plushy
furniture cushioned in goose down and priced around $2,500 for an
88-inch sofa. ``Furniture has to compete against all those other
luxury goods for the consumer's dollar,'' said Bob Williams,
Mitchell Gold's design director, ``and it better be luxurious.''
</P>
<P>
   In upholstered furniture, luxury was widely interpreted as
``soft modern'' _ tight upholstery, tailored slipcovers and exposed
legs. At Mitchell Gold, the reigning prince of squashy comfort,
oversize slipcovers were banished to the back of the showroom.
</P>
<P>
   In many showrooms, chairs and sofas broke out of the rectangle
into polymorphic, organic shapes. Vladimir Kagan designed a
three-level sofa, Dot.com, for American Leather. At Dellarobbia, an
amoeba-shaped ottoman was upholstered in a fabric inspired by old
Spirograph designs. Karel McKinney, national sales and marketing
director for Dellarobbia, said: ``The Pottery Barn look? Been
there, done that. Our customer wants more.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cecilia Bartoli does not dance onstage with Angel
Corella every night, but she did on Tuesday when American Ballet
Theater opened its new season. Corella did not break into song.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a perfect match: young Italian mezzo-soprano
superstar (Bartoli) meets young Spanish ballet virtuoso (Corella)
and both knock out audience at chock-full-of-chuckles gala.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, this special opening of Ballet Theater's second
annual season of mixed bills at City Center (131 West 55th St.,
through Nov. 7) was packed. Ms. Bartoli, who also sang four
selections on a Spanish theme, appeared as a guest, exuding both
good humor and just plain humor, in a vignette choreographed by
Kevin McKenzie. Wisely, it was called ``Piece d'Occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the evening was just as lively. A revival of Anton
Dolin's 1957 ``Variations for Four'' made implicit some competition
among four male soloists while Antony Tudor's satiric ``Gala
Performance'' made the competition among three turn-of-the-century
ballerinas more than explicit.
</P>
<P>
   The program was completed by ``Sinfonietta,'' Jiri Kylian's
exuberant paean to mother earth, enhanced by trumpeters letting
loose with fanfares while standing at both sides of the proscenium.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bartoli is a fan of Corella and on this evening, he returned
the compliment she offered by appearing with him. They met on the
same ground, virtuosos in their respective arts and both exhibiting
a love of performance.
</P>
<P>
   Happiness is a performance by Angel Corella, but at the ripe old
age of 23, he has also grown out of his whiz-kid bravura to combine
an astonishing technique with artistic depth.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie, who welcomed the audience in a curtain speech as
Ballet Theater's artistic director, choreographed to Corella's
strength, and ``Piece d'Occasion,'' in its references to Spain, was
a tribute to him. One has never seen him circle the stage or fly
across its diagonals in his jetes or a variety of pirouettes with
such amazing speed. Yet McKenzie also wittily integrated Ms.
Bartoli into a star vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Insofar as Ms. Bartoli can be said to hum anything, she entered
humming the air that introduces the heroine's seduction scene in
Bizet's ``Carmen.'' It was enough to make Corella stop dreaming
about his paella as he lounged at the feet of the onstage pianist,
Steven Blier.
</P>
<P>
   Snaking and whirling her way through a mock seduction dance, Ms.
Bartoli's red-bodiced Carmen took less then 10 minutes to steal
Corella from Ashley Tuttle, a good sport enlisted for the straight
man role.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tuttle had a brief solo on toe during Ms. Bartoli's
exquisite rendering in French of a lover's lament, ``Hai Luli!'' by
Pauline Viardot-Garcia and she was turned upside down in a duet,
accompanied by Ravel's ``Vocalise-Etude (en Forme de Habanera).''
</P>
<P>
   Understandably drawn by the richness of Ms. Bartoli's voice,
Corella sent Ms. Tuttle packing and walked, dazed, toward Ms.
Bartoli. And she became a chattering shrew, thanks to one of the
``Canciones Negras'' that the Catalan composer Xavier Montsalvatge
wrote in what he called a West Indian style.
</P>
<P>
   More fun came in ``Gala Performance,'' which featured Susan
Jaffe's ever-superb performance as the Italian prima ballerina with
a stealthy tread and exaggerated balances on one leg. The
character's marble-like demeanor was only a facade for a lethal
interior, as her hapless rivals found out.
</P>
<P>
   Eleena Melamed may be a corps member, but her debut as the
applause-milking Russian ballerina caught the right mix of pathos
and arrogance. Bent over, thrusting her face toward the audience,
dynamically right in shooting out her legs in a flamboyant display,
she was less a cliche than a case study that Tudor, the king of
psychological ballet, distilled with genius.
</P>
<P>
   Yan Chen's debut as the French ballerina offered some delightful
frills, not the usual fussiness, to describe the character's
flightiness. Vladimir Malakhov, new as her partner, combined his
elegance with some hilarious glowering. Ethan Brown, as Ms. Jaffe's
partner, got the right idea across with terrific comic timing, a
19th-century partner used as the equivalent of stage crew. Tudor's
commentary, set to Prokofiev, is not about a once vital Romantic
style but about its decadence. There is a difference.
</P>
<P>
   What this revival of Dolin's ``Variations for Four'' is about is
not clear. Maxim Belotserkovsky, Jose Manuel Carreno, Ethan Stiefel
and Vladimir Malakhov are major dancers, and each had a solo in
this presumed display of male virtuosity and precision in classical
technique. Dolin choreographed the work in England for Festival
Ballet and two of the company's former stars, Jelko Yuresha and
Belinda Wright, are credited with this less than coherent staging.
</P>
<P>
   The sum is less than the parts. Belotserkovsky and Carreno turn
very well and Malakhov's princely line is seen to fine advantage in
an adagio variation. Stiefel elicits applause in springing up in
diamond-shape jumps and fabulous scissor leaps. But he looks like a
jester, not a dancer, just as this theatricalized showcase now
resembles a classroom demonstration. Failing to ``spot'' at the
same time (the equivalent of keeping your eye on the ball) the men
lost their unison in turning a la seconde with leg extended: the
pinwheel approach, one presumes.

WITCHES ONLINE: NOTHING NEARLY AS SPOOKY AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   It's perfectly reasonable that you'd be able to work magic over
the Internet,'' said Kristin Spence, a former editor at Wired
magazine. ``It's just another tool. Instead of a cauldron, you're
using a keyboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spence is a self-proclaimed witch. She's ``out of the broom
closet,'' she said, she's proud, and she's got plenty of company.
There are posting and chatting sites for witches (or Wiccans, as
the more serious devotees prefer to be known) on Usenet
(alt.wicca), Internet relay chat ((NU)wicca) and in online
conferences (America Online's Pagan Board, the Commons at the
Witches' Web, www.witchesweb.com/commons.html). There's an entire
search engine, www.avatarsearch .com, devoted to the occult. The
Witches' League of Public Awareness, based in Salem, Mass., of
course, even has an area devoted to improving witches' image in the
media (www.celticcrow.com).
</P>
<P>
   Fritz Jung, Webmaster of the Witches' Voice (www.witchvox.com),
a clearinghouse of Wiccan information, estimates that there are
2,000 witchcraft-related Web sites. He says his own site receives,
on average, almost 17,000 hits a day. Why does he think there's
such a heavy witch presence on line?
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized the medium's communication and networking
potential early, and embraced it in a major way,'' Jung said. ``You
could also say that we had a stronger need for the Net. The big
religions have long had communication networks in place, but we
were very fragmented. The Net was a wonderful opportunity for us to
connect.''
</P>
<P>
   In his nonwitch life (and please, witches disdain the term
``warlock'' _ ``witch'' is sexually nonspecific), Jung is the
management information systems director for a musical instrument
retailer in Clearwater, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't see any contradiction in the fact that an earth-based
religion thrives in a silicon realm, or that a goddess-focused
faith flourishes in a largely male techie preserve. Some witches,
in fact, find that witchcraft and computers have a lot in common.
``Programming is like alchemy,'' said Ms. Spence, who signs her
e-mail with a smiley emoticon wearing a conical witch hat,  &QL; 
:) .
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like divination, a magical thing. You have a spell
or computer program you want to create, so you find an elegant way
to use a main routine and subroutines that refer back to
themselves. You construct a system of elements that need to work
together in harmony and balance to give the desired outcome.''
Presto.
</P>
<P>
   Witchcraft, or Wicca (both words are probably derived from the
Indo-European root wic, ``to bend''), is a modern take on an
ancient pagan belief system.
</P>
<P>
   Francesca De Grandis, author of ``Be a Goddess! A Guide to
Celtic Spells and Wisdom for Self-Healing, Prosperity and Great
Sex'' (Harper San Francisco, 1998), has a site full of rituals and
spells. Among them is one ``to free oneself from excessive computer
enchantment.'' Her site is
www.well.com/user/zthirdrd/WiccanMiscellany.html.
</P>
<P>
   Carrye De Mers, an editorial assistant at a math publishing
company in Emeryville, Calif., has an off-line coven but uses the
Web to enhance her spiritual practice. She rattled off the courses
she has taken through Pandora's Pagan Web, a site affiliated with a
Wiccan bookstore in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see, there's Introductory Tarot, Candle Magick, Urban
Pagan and To Stir a Magick Cauldron _ that's the follow-up to Ride
a Silver Broomstick.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Ms. Spence be celebrating Halloween, the most important
witches' holiday, in cyberspace?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a purist in a lot of ways, so it's hard for me to imagine
that those who practice only in cyberspace are getting the full
hit,'' she said. ``I'd like to wrench people away from their
computers and make them stand on the beach in their bare feet. This
is a nature-based religion. But if on line is the catalyst to make
people feel safe and not alone in their beliefs, that's great.''

`STAR WARS: BEHIND THE MAGIC': `STAR WARS' WORLD WITH A SENSE OF
HUMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: CD-ROM publication notes at the end of review.) 
(js) 
 BY J.C. HERZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, there was a movie
that was so resonant it became a universe. After a big cultural
bang, it grew and grew and grew to include sequels, novels, comic
books and galaxies of T-shirts, lunch boxes, towels, blankets and
toys. And miraculously, even the little bits of plastic had soul. A
Darth Vader action figure or plastic X-Wing fighter was more than
the sum of its mass-produced parts. It was a relic of the film, a
speck of the original magic. It was a way of connecting to the
``Star Wars'' universe.
</P>
<P>
   Star Wars: Behind the Magic is a multimedia chronicle of that
universe and the process of creating it _ a Baedecker of the George
Lucas trilogy containing 700 cross-referenced glossary terms,
detailed biographies of minor characters and an exhaustive
chronology of the overarching epic (``Star Wars,'' ``The Empire
Strikes Back'' and ``Return of the Jedi'' are only the middle chunk
of the nine-part saga.) Each alien is identified by species. Han
Solo's early history indicates why he became one of cinema's great
swaggering jerks.
</P>
<P>
   And in case you couldn't get enough of Leia in her slave-girl
outfit, there is a fully rotating 3-D model of her in a variety of
costumes, narrated in the plummy British tones of a Christie's
auctioneer: ``For rallying troops on the frozen world of Hoth or
exploring damp asteroid caves, nothing is more comfortable or
stylish than this functional rebel uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Further along the continuum of camp, a 30-second
computer-animated fashion show sends Leia vamping down the runway
in combat fatigues and ceremonial evening gowns as flashbulbs pop
and house music, intercut with dialogue clips, thumps in the
background. ``Star Wars'' meets RuPaul.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Weapon Comparison Test Bay, where an unlucky storm
trooper suffers everything from Ewok stoning to Death Star cannon
fire, is Monty Python in drag. No doubt this will be heresy to the
true believers. But it's heartening to see the folks at Lucas Arts
spoofing themselves, as if to say, c'mon people, it's only a movie.
</P>
<P>
   That's what separates the Lucas Arts people from the folks at
Star Trek headquarters, who publish excruciatingly earnest CD-ROMs
like the Star Trek Technical Manual, a fully functioning
virtual-reality starship with all the knobs and dials laid out,
deadpan.
</P>
<P>
   Trek fandom revolves around technology because the Star Trek
universe was founded on ham-fisted dialogue and ``Gong
Show''-caliber acting. But the fictional science has always been
brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   The science in Star Wars is nonsense, and everyone knows it. But
no one cares because Star Wars isn't about science. It's epic
drama. It's about those incredibly well-developed characters and
the moral decisions they face. People don't get into debates about
how the second Death Star works. They get into debates about the
ethics of blowing it up, since all the construction workers aboard
were independent contractors with no allegiance to the Empire
beyond their weekly paychecks. Star Wars fandom is about stories
and the kind of wallop stories can deliver on a really big screen.
It's about our fascination with movies.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Behind the Magic is a digital product, it's
really about the particularities of cinema. From the scratchy black
and white 3-2-1 countdown that starts the program to the
scene-by-scene analysis with shot-numbered stills and annotated
screenplays, it's an ode to the filmmaking process. It lays bare
the revisions and the script doctoring, the discarded drafts and
lost scenes, and what happens when a writer-director changes his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, these films appear seamless and inevitable. But
when you see a badly printed outtake, or a rough edit before the
sound is added, it becomes apparent that no, this story did not
spring fully formed from the skull of George Lucas. It may be
mythic, but it's also an object. It was constructed. It is the sum
of 10,000 arbitrary decisions.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, seeing the skin pulled back doesn't compromise the
romance of these films. In fact, it enhances their mystique.
Witness the obsessive Star Wars prequel speculation on Web sites
like The Force (www.theforce.net). Episode one of the Star Wars
saga, ``Shadows of the Empire,'' won't be released until May 1999.
But on the Internet, storyboards, production designs and entire
screenplays are taking shape around the prequels' hypothetical
dimensions, based on crumbs and scraps of information gleaned from
a network of informants and spies: moles inside the Lucas movie
machine, trespassers hopping the fence at Leavesden Studios in
England to root around in the trash for filmmaking offal and media
junkies who trawl the news for cast members' stray remarks.
</P>
<P>
   What you see online is a potential film, a what-if blueprint,
the shadow of ``Shadows of the Empire.'' As information accrues,
the phantom movie grows to resemble its real-life counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   And when the information matches perfectly, when the real film
is released, the phantom film will cease to exist. But its archive
will remain as a document of the process, a record of the films
that might have been, a fan-fiction version of Behind the Magic.
Because if you really love a story, it's not enough just to hear
it. You want to help build it, if only by proxy.
</P>
<P>
   All these digital extensions and outgrowths on the Web only
enhance the aura of the original story, which is to say, the films.
Because the proliferation of small screens _ televisions, computer
monitors, LCD cellular phone displays, personal digital assistants
_ only aggravates our desire for the huge screen in a plushly
upholstered movie palace with three-dimensional symphonic sound.
The more fractured information becomes, the more we long for an
epic story that simply washes over us _ and not over one of us at a
time, but over all of us at once. The world is crawling with sound
bites and gadgets, and everyone's flocking to Imax.
</P>
<P>
   If we can't have The Force, we'll settle for the movies.

 DESPITE TESTS STACKED AGAINST IT, eBOOK PASSES  
 (af)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was 7 years old, my father took me to the public library.
While I browsed the familiar collection of picture books, he
disappeared down another aisle and reappeared carrying something
that looked entirely different from the usual
see-the-pretty-seashells fare.
</P>
<P>
   It was the size and shape of an adult's novel, filled with black
type. But on the front was a picture of a girl my age and the title
``Black-Eyed Susan.'' Excited, I realized this novel must be a
children's book, but in a format that was completely new to me. I
took home an armload of novels that day.
</P>
<P>
   For years I have not thought about ``Black-Eyed Susan,'' except
to wonder once in a while if the story of a Midwestern girl and her
bike was still on the shelf at my hometown library in Elmhurst,
Ill. But then last week an electronic gadget called the Rocket
eBook reminded me just what it is like to discover a new way to
read.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocket eBook is the name of the so-called electronic book
that Nuvomedia started selling last week. Frankly, I had been
prepared to hate it. Ever since ``Black-Eyed Susan,'' I have been
shamelessly addicted to the perfection of that simpler medium known
as paper books. How could the gray plastic eBook hope to compete?
</P>
<P>
   As I unpacked the test unit, I muttered something about useless
toys for the nouveaux riches. The Rocket eBook, after all, was just
another computer, roughly the size of a paperback, with a
backlighted screen that displayed text.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, it came with two cords _ how I hate unfamiliar cords,
with confusing sets of prongs that have to be plugged into
previously unexplored ports on my PC. Worst of all, it could not be
as egalitarian as a paper book.
</P>
<P>
   The eBook costs a whopping $499, and that's just for the device.
You will have to pay for the books you download onto your eBook
from Barnesandnoble.com. (Prices will be announced any day, a
Nuvomedia spokeswoman said, and are expected to be roughly the same
as for paperback editions.)
</P>
<P>
   But as I started to poke at the screen with my finger (I
immediately abandoned the flimsy plastic stylus), I grudgingly
began to respect the design. When it comes to gadgets, the last one
that I figured out how to use _ throwing down the manual in
frustration and then whining to a tech support person for at least
an hour _ was a blow dryer. That has become my standard for
user-friendly technology.
</P>
<P>
   So I was amazed that within seconds I figured out not only how
to turn it on and off but also how to call up the text of ``Alice's
Adventures in Wonderland,'' one of three preloaded titles on the
test unit. Lewis Carroll's words and John Tenniel's illustrations
looked clear and crisp, and so of course I got carried away by the
story.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching the bottom of the page, I pressed an obvious-looking
button on the eBook's spine. Immediately, the next page of text
appeared.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to put the eBook to the real test _ the Black-Eyed
Susan test _ and see whether it interested my daughter. I hooked up
the eBook (via those two cords) to both my Windows machine and a
wall outlet, so I could register the unit at Nuvomedia's Web site
and download other books. Ten minutes later, I had ``Charlotte's
Web'' and ``Sarah, Plain and Tall.'' (Unfortunately, ``Black-Eyed
Susan'' went out of print years ago.)
</P>
<P>
   Then the moment of truth arrived. My 7-year-old, Ella, came up
to my office to see if I was ready to go to the library later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did Dad say you could play with his Palm Pilot?'' she asked,
eyeing the eBook accusingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something else,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I see?'' Within seconds, she had figured out how to jab
the bookshelf icon to see a list of available titles (the eBook can
hold about 10 books). As I watched, she pressed the line of the
menu that read ``Charlotte's Web,'' and then an Open button below.
</P>
<P>
   She wandered off reading the eBook, and later I saw her fiddling
with the underline function, as well as annotating the text using a
built-in keyboard (``My sister Zoe is trying to take this book away
but I said NO mommmm gave it to me Zoee'').
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if I had actually paid $499, I would not have sent it
off so blithely in the care of the sort of person who would ask, a
few hours later, if it was OK to put the eBook in the bathtub to
see if it would float. But the eBook was going back to its
manufacturer in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   So that night, I let Ella take it to bed with her. The
backlighted screen acted as a night light; she could read in bed
for the first time since we moved her baby sister into her room
last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Will the eBook be a hit with parents? It will if Nuvomedia can
do two things. The first is to make it childproof. Apple has
already proved that this is possible, with its discontinued line of
eMate portables, which could withstand being dropped from a school
desk.
</P>
<P>
   The second would be to get the cost down to what a grandparent
might be willing to spend on a birthday gift _ say, $50. And why
not? Not long ago, handheld calculators cost hundreds of dollars. A
friend of mine got one free last week when he filled his gas tank.
</P>
<P>
   I called Cynthia Mun, Nuvomedia's director of product
management, to tell her what I thought. ``Um, thanks,'' she said.
``In fact, we were thinking it would be fun to have a sports
model.''
</P>
<P>
   The eBook passed another test in my house. Ella's introduction
to electronic reading devices did not supplant her love for good
old paper books; it supplemented the experience. The next day, I
found her old paperback copy of ``Charlotte's Web'' on the floor
next to the bathtub.

`INCIDENT AT TWENTY-MILE': TRYING TO RESCUE THE OLD WEST FROM THE
DUSTBIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can't help thinking of Hannibal Lecter at the start of
Trevanian's new novel, ``Incident at Twenty-Mile,'' his first to be
published in a decade and a half. The year is 1898 and in the
maximum-security wing of the state prison in Laramie, Wyo., Guard
Private John Tillman is touring the special cells to check on the
so-called moonberries, local slang for the criminally insane.
</P>
<P>
   Tillman starts with a man convicted for throwing acid in the
faces of children. `` `If I don't do it . . .,' he had explained to
the judge `. . . who will?''' He passes ``The Politician,'' who is
arguing with the space in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Then he comes to ``the baddest of the bad,'' a brilliant and
literate madman named Lieder who has maimed whole families in the
cause of electing William Jennings Bryan president and saving the
farmer and workingman from being crucified ``on a Cross of Gold,''
but who never kills because he knows he would hang for it.
</P>
<P>
   It's Lecter-like the way Lieder lures Guard Tillman into his
cell by pretending to want to be saved by Christ, and then proceeds
to strangle him to death and escape, taking two other prisoners,
who happen to be sodomites, along with him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet surprisingly enough, there's an overtone of unseriousness
about it too, just as there's an element of playfulness in all that
follows, when Lieder and his gang descend upon and terrorize the
tiny population of Twenty-Mile, a mere stopping-off place for
silver miners looking for Saturday night fun, ``so called because
it was 20 miles from a spot 20 miles away.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieder is sadistic and vengeful. He shoots helpless animals. He
paddles to death a former teacher of his. He tortures the owner of
Twenty-Mile's whorehouse by making him remain in his chair until he
urinates on himself. He threatens to rape the virginal town beauty.
</P>
<P>
   One's outrage with him grows and grows. But there is little hope
that any of the town's mostly defective people will be able to
stand up to him, including Matthew Dubchek, another stranger
recently arrived in Twenty-Mile, who models himself after his
literary hero, the Ringo Kid, but who tells a lot of lies and
lapses into a stupor every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   Although the story holds your attention completely, you don't
take it quite seriously. The author has too much fun with language:
``A susurrous scurry of sliding scree drew his attention to three
men climbing up the slope toward him.'' Too many of the characters
verge on parody, not least the town's three prostitutes: Frenchy,
``a tall, lean, yellow-eyed black woman from New Orleans; Chinky,
``a shy Chinese girl who spoke little English''; and Queeny, ``a
loud, laughing, sloshy-breasted old Irishwoman who was said to be
able to drink anything that didn't eat the bottom out of a glass
before she got to it.''
</P>
<P>
   And the author has to know his story has been told many times
before, from E. L. Doctorow's first novel, ``Welcome to Hard
Times,'' to films like ``High Noon'' and ``Unforgiven,'' to mention
only the most obvious. (``Incident'' even contains what can be read
as homages to its predecessors.)
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly is going on here? In an interview sent along
with the book's publicity material, Trevanian _ recorded in Who's
Who in America as the pen name of Rodney Whitaker, a former
professor at the University of Texas _ talks about his previous
novels, ``The Main,'' ``The Eiger Sanction,'' ``The Loo Sanction,''
``The Summer of Katya'' and ``Shibumi.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his readers have taken these books seriously enough as
entertainment to make them international best sellers, the author
insists they were written as spoofs of different genres as well as
``spoofs of spoofs.'' (In fact, he says, the name Trevanian was
originally intended for only those spoofs of what he calls ``the
derring-do/espionage/crotcharama genre,'' but legal complications
forced him to use it for his subsequent novels.)
</P>
<P>
   Is ``Incident at Twenty-Mile'' intended purely as a spoof of the
western genre, then? Probably not. It is written with too much
evocative detail. Its story holds you too closely in its grip. And
in its concluding pages you discover that the details of its plot
are taken from an actual event, and you learn of the delight the
author took in enriching those details with the juices of his
imagination (although at moments this postscript also reads like a
spoof of a scholar at work).
</P>
<P>
   So what you finally have in ``Incident at Twenty-Mile'' is more
complicated than myth or parody. A piece of found art, it tries to
rescue the western from the dustbin. For all its talk about the
closing of the frontier, it suggests that some of the conflicts of
this classic genre, those between effeminacy and virility, between
escape from the self and self-renewal, are still going on in the
West today.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Lieder's ultimate aim is to form a militia to fight
what he sees as an international conspiracy to people America with
immigrants from all over the world. He might as well be tilting at
black helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incident,'' then, is a blend of classic revenge tale,
nostalgia and parody, written by someone who says he believes that
even the writer's voice and persona have to be confected. Reading
it you can never rest comfortably with any single perspective. The
result is slightly unsettling, but it works.

   NEW YORK _ Murray Louis surely glanced back with pleasure and
looked forward with confidence as he planned the two-week season of
Murray Louis and Nikolais Dance, which opened on Tuesday night at
the Joyce Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, Alwin Nikolais became dance director at the
Henry Street Playhouse on the Lower East Side and began the
choreographic experiments that eventually made him an
internationally acclaimed master of mixed-media dance.
</P>

   A year later, Louis joined the Nikolais company and soon
attracted attention as a virtuoso performer and talented
choreographer. Forty-five years ago, he founded his own company,
yet continued to be a star of the Nikolais troupe. The groups
merged in 1989 and Louis has directed the organization since
Nikolais' death in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Louis celebrated its achievements with a program that included a
premiere, an old work and two more recent ones.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Millennium Loop,'' to an electronic score composed by
Scott Killian in collaboration with Carol and Lawrence Lipnik,
began with all 10 members of the company carrying objects
resembling small metal fences.
</P>
<P>
   The dance technique Nikolais and Louis developed emphasizes
quick, precise movements and these performers showed their mastery
of it as they darted and hopped in a slightly staccato manner. They
also peered quizzically ahead. Both turmoil and rejoicing awaited
them.
</P>
<P>
   Two women battled. Peter Kyle at one point stood imposingly like
an emperor who had made everyone else on stage his slave. Later,
however, the dancers returned in costumes by Frank Garcia that made
them look like happy country folk going to a square dance. But this
idyll did not last, and the work ended with a man and a woman
staring nervously while the image of an apple was projected on the
backdrop. Presumably Adam and Eve were about to be tempted in a new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of Louis' dances, ``Millennium Loop'' was lively and
inventive. But, like a few of them, it did not develop its ideas
fully. Although one could enjoy its cleverness, the work might have
made an even stronger impression if Louis had revealed more of what
he thought about the problems and the promises of this millennium
and the next.
</P>
<P>
   But Louis can certainly devise eye-catching steps. And he has
been doing so for quite some time, as a revival of ``Bach Suite''
revealed. This festive suite of 1956 to recorded pieces by Bach
proved a delight.
</P>
<P>
   It began and ended with people moving gregariously together, and
there was a duet in which Kimberly Gibilisco and Kyle appeared to
be devoted companions who also preserved a measure of personal
independence. The work's pace was usually brisk, and the shapes
bodies made in space were clear and precise.
</P>
<P>
   Clarity of design was also a virtue of ``Figura,'' which dates
from 1979, and ``Sinners All,'' a group work of 1996 in which Louis
portrayed a man who arose from his contemplations to move with
pattering feet and trembling fingers. Yet ``Sinners All'' involved
more than visual spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Louis seemed to be trying to comment on the follies of
apprehensive and fallible people, and Alberto del Saz brought a
slightly sinister presence to a few scenes. Nevertheless, as in
``Millennium Loop,'' thematic ideas remained hazy. But when, at the
conclusion, mannequins rose into the air like resurrected bodies
ascending heavenward, the implication was that at least some souls
can be saved. Louis is surely a choreographic optimist.
</P>
<P>
   The company will offer several programs of works by Louis and
Nikolais through Nov. 8 at the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Ave., at
19th Street.

<P>
   UNDATED - ``I AM TELLING YOU FOR THE LAST TIME,'' my mother
yelled from the living room, ``there are NO SUCH things as ghosts.
Now, go back to bed before I take all of your friends home!''
</P>
<P>
   I shuffled back to my bedroom where my friends were waiting and
knew it was my own fault. We should have known better than to have
a seance on Halloween, even if it was my birthday and I was having
a slumber party.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of people think it would be cool to have a birthday on
Halloween, but it really isn't. Who would want to come to my house
to play ``Pin the Grin on the Pumpkin'' when there were blocks of
houses giving away free candy? Who was going to come to my house
for a lousy piece of cake when Milky Ways and Hershey bars were
literally floating down the street?
</P>
<P>
   As a result, only two of my fifth-grade classmates showed up at
my house in costume on that Saturday night, out of the seven I had
invited. My mom bought us pizza, then got all of us _ my friends
and my two younger sisters _ ready for the annual trek down the
street for the trick-or-treating bonanza. Since there were five of
us, I had secretly hoped that we could all don white polyester
gowns and go as Sister Sledge, belting out the chorus ``WE ARE
FAMI-LEEE!'' whenever anyone opened the door, but my mother shot me
a look and put her hand on her hips.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we are not doing that,'' she said sternly. ``If you think
I have time to stand here and braid all of your heads into
cornfields, you've got another thing coming!''
</P>
<P>
   My friend Jamie came to my party as a witch, and my other
friend, Kassie, came in a rhinestone cowboy outfit, since her
father owned horses and she rode in competitions. I had bet all of
my options on the Sister Sledge theme, so I had to come up with
something quick or my mom would throw a plastic bag over my head
and make me go as trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I going to be?'' I whined, going through my closet.
</P>
<P>
   My mother grabbed a pencil and a spiral notebook and handed it
to me. ``Just be Anne Frank again,'' she said as I sulked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was Anne Frank last year!'' I whined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Anne Frank or the trash bag,'' my mother said. ``That
girl stayed in the attic for a long time _ you can be her for two
years in a row!''
</P>
<P>
   My mom stood close by us as we went trick-or-treating from house
to house, smoking a cigarette near the curb as we knocked on each
door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me see your candy,'' she demanded after every treat.
``That woman's a nut job. Did she try to give you an apple? Did her
house smell funny?''
</P>
<P>
   When we returned to our own house, my mother cut the cake and I
opened presents. I got a can of Love's Baby Soft, a bottle of
Charlie and a 45 of ``Play That Funky Music,'' which we took into
my room immediately because we heard there was a dirty word sung on
it.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie, Kassie and I were listening to the record over and over
again, but since we had no idea what the word might be, we got
bored pretty quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's have a seance!'' I said suddenly, and Jamie turned off
the lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we say?'' Kassie said, her rhinestone hat still
shining in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about, `Oh spirits, come down and have some of Laurie's
birthday cake,' '' Jamie replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good,'' I agreed. `` `Have some of my birthday cake and
tell us what the dirty word in the song is . . .' '' I trailed off,
trying to be spooky.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Come to the slumber party, spirits,' '' Kassie said,
laughing. `` `We'll give you candy!' ''
</P>
<P>
   We were all giggling when, suddenly, the closed door to my
bedroom swung open, hitting the wall behind it, slammed shut, swung
open, shut, open . . . shut.
</P>
<P>
   We were quiet for a moment, and then we screamed. We had all
seen it. We had all seen the same thing. The door swinging open by
itself, shutting by itself, and each time it swung open again, we
could see the brightly lit hallway and the fact that it was empty.
There was no one there.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jamie who ran to the light switch and turned it on. ``Oh
my God,'' was all she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom!'' I yelled, getting up and running into the living room,
where my parents were. ``Mom! My door opened!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back to bed,'' she instructed. ``We're watching ``Sonny and
``Cher''!'
</P>
<P>
   ``It opened by itself,'' I insisted. ``It opened and slammed
shut by itself!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you she was getting weirder,'' my mother said to my
father, then pointed to me. ``If you keep acting this way, no one
will want to marry you when you grow up! And you're not living here
for the rest of your life!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all saw it, Mrs. Notaro,'' Jamie said from the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   My mother looked at my father. ``All right,'' she complied. ``Go
get your trick-or-treat bags, and empty them on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   We did what she said, and my mom started looking at every piece,
even the cheap saltwater taffy pieces that we never would have
eaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing?'' my father asked her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember Art Linkletter's daughter?'' she whispered, even
though we could hear her. ``Look for anything with the letters L, S
and D on it. That nut job down the street probably slipped them a
chocolate mickey! You girls stay off of the roof, you hear me?''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't find anything, and I knew she wouldn't. When I
insisted one last time that there really was a ghost in my room,
she threatened to take my friends home.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a very vivid imagination,'' I heard her say to my
father as I shuffled back to my bedroom. ``Remember when we went
camping last year and that cow bumped into the trailer and she
started screaming that it was Bigfoot? Yes, you do so remember!''
</P>
<P>
   When I got back to my bedroom, Jamie and Kassie had already
started pulling my desk across the carpet. We closed the door
again, very gently, pushed the desk against it and then tried very,
very hard to go to sleep. &QL;

   OXFORD, Miss. _ Not so long ago, it would have been considered
an act of cultural treason: Allison Grisham, a white sorority
sister at the University of Mississippi, stood onstage at Fulton
Chapel and explained to a hushed crowd why it was so important for
students and alumni at football games to stop waving the
Confederate battle flag and singing ``Dixie.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside her friend Jada Love, who is black, Ms. Grisham
told a forum sponsored by President Clinton's advisory board on
race that she understood that many students regarded the rituals as
a demonstration of school spirit, inherited from red-sweatered
parents on family pilgrimages to Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   But, she argued, those days have passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need of the university to be welcoming to all students far
outweighs the perceived tradition of the controversial flag and
song,'' she declared.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd's ovation, the most enthusiastic of that March night,
accelerated quickly to a crescendo, no one applauding more
admiringly than Chancellor Robert Khayat, the man who has made it
his mission to change the hidebound image of Ole Miss. With Ms.
Grisham and Ms. Love side by side, here was the embodiment of the
university of his aspirations, a place where a fresh breeze of
civility might finally cut through the fog of stale tear gas and
defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the old Ole Miss lingered in the audience. Before long, a
man from DeSoto County, Bryant Walker, rose to declare, ``It's my
freedom to fly that flag.'' He then suggested that the university
was suppressing its symbols only to recruit black football players.
``I'll tell you one thing,'' Walker concluded, ``before it comes to
me losing a flag that I believe in, I'll lose football games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Faulknerian tension between past and present never eases for
long at Ole Miss, a university that sent its sons off to war in
1861 and then waged a civil rights battle of its own a century
later.
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery behind the basketball arena holds hundreds of
Confederate dead from the days when classrooms were converted into
hospital wards for the wounded from Shiloh. Nearby, the columned
administration building, known as the Lyceum, is still pocked with
bullet holes from the riot that greeted the court-ordered arrival
of the first black student, James Meredith, in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Many white Mississippians have long venerated the University of
Mississippi as sacred space. But nationally, because of its violent
resistance to desegregation and the suppression of academic freedom
that followed it, the school has been regarded by many as a place
where scholarship seemed secondary to the preservation of a bygone
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office three years ago, Khayat (pronounced KI-yat)
has shown fierce determination to change all that. In a turnabout
worthy of Nixon to China, Khayat, a former Ole Miss student,
football hero and law professor, has effectively staked his legacy
on recasting the school's image by aggressively confronting its
shortcomings, both real and perceived.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that Khayat, 60, explains his goal for Ole
Miss as a dual one: ``To be _ and to be perceived as _ a great
public university.'' Image, Khayat understands, is a university's
most precious asset. When it gleams like a gilded dome, a school
sells itself effortlessly, whether its reputation is deserved or
not. Conversely, when a school's image is tarnished, it is doubly
hard to attract top students, star faculty, alumni support and
research grants, no matter how outdated the perception.
</P>
<P>
   In the academy, perhaps more than in any other realm, perception
often lags reality by decades. And nowhere has that phenomenon been
more crippling than at Ole Miss, which has struggled for decades to
claw its way out of the disastrous public relations hole it dug for
itself in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ole Miss is not the national repository of racial guilt,''
Khayat said, ``and we are not the last bastion of the Confederacy.
We lived through the Civil War and we lived through the civil
rights movement, and the university was significant in each of
those. But this is 1998. We are a fully integrated, open, caring,
nurturing, vital community, and I am ready for the rest of the
country to understand that that's where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is why Khayat invited the president's advisory
board to Oxford in the first place, to demonstrate that it was now
possible to have an open conversation about race at Ole Miss. But
that evening, like other recent events, also made it clear that
change does not come without challenge in a place where history
resonates so strongly. Last year, for instance, when Khayat
broached even the possibility of examining the university's
remaining Old South symbols, including the flag, he received hate
mail so virulent that the university tightened security around his
house.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in this, the university's sesquicentennial year, there
are signs of progress. Most visibly, and perhaps most remarkably,
the Confederate flags have virtually disappeared from
Vaught-Hemingway Stadium on football Saturdays, the result of
repeated efforts by the administration, the coaches and the student
government. Grandstands that once swirled with Rebel flags, even as
dozens of black players took the field, are now largely an
impressionist blur of red-and-white pompoms.
</P>
<P>
   Less evident, but perhaps more significant in the long term, are
Khayat's notable fund-raising successes and the gradual improvement
in the university's persistently mediocre academic standing. But
even with the improvement, Ole Miss remains well behind other
Southern universities in critical areas, like faculty salaries,
research grants and number of library volumes. Yet its forward
momentum, however tentative, may prove the best cure for the
university's reputation as a static, backward-looking place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chancellor Khayat's great goal is to free the University of
Mississippi from these negative images,'' said David Sansing, an
Ole Miss historian and the author of the university's
sesquicentennial history. ``And he feels that if you can maximize
the positive images of this institution, the negative images will
take care of themselves.''

HISTORIANS URGE HOUSE TO FORGO IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, WARN OF
UPSETTING BALANCE OF POWERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A group of American historians Wednesday urged the
House to forgo its wide-ranging impeachment inquiry of President
Clinton, saying the potentially limitless search could forever
upset the balance of powers spelled out in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vote of the House of Representatives to conduct an
open-ended inquiry creates a novel, all-purpose search for any
offense by which to remove a president from office,'' the
historians wrote in an open letter to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new processes are extremely ominous for the future of our
political institutions. If carried forward, they will leave the
president permanently disfigured and diminished, at the mercy as
never before of the caprices of any Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, the historians said the framers of the
Constitution never intended for a president to be expelled from
office for misdeeds unrelated to his public responsibilities, such
as Clinton's efforts to cover up his extramarital affair with
Monica Lewinsky. Although his escapades with the former White House
intern and his attempts to hide the relationship were
reprehensible, Clinton's actions did not sink to the level of
``high crimes and misdemeanors'' that the Constitution says are
grounds for impeachment, the historians said.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton University history Professor Sean Wilentz, the chief
sponsor of the letter, said he circulated the document to fellow
historians in an effort to focus public attention on the
irreparable harm to the presidency that could result from the
pending inquiry. Wilentz said the letter, which about 425
historians have signed, should serve as a warning of the damage a
freewheeling Congress can do to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We face a choice between preserving or undermining our
Constitution,'' the historians wrote. ``Do we want to establish a
precedent for the future harassment of presidents and to tie up our
government with a protracted national agony of search and
accusation? Or do we want to protect the Constitution and get back
to the public business.''
</P>
<P>
   The historians' letter, which Wilentz said he plans to have
published in a major newspaper, followed the House's 258-176 vote
Oct. 8 to begin an open-ended impeachment inquiry against Clinton.
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said the
authority to conduct an unlimited investigation is essential to his
panel's mandate to determine whether Clinton committed any
impeachable offenses. But, Hyde said, ``I will use all my strength
to ensure that this inquiry does not become a fishing expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   Two renowned historians are helping Wilentz in his drive for
signatures: Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., who served as a special
assistant to President John F. Kennedy and later wrote the Pulitzer
Prize-winning biography ``A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the
White House;'' and C. Vann Woodward, at 89 the dean of American
historians. Schlesinger and Woodward said Clinton's allegedly
perjurious attempts to cover up his extramarital affair do not
involve abuses of power and therefore are not grounds for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perjury in certain circumstances might be an impeachable
offense,'' such as a presidential lie involving activities related
to his official duties, Schlesinger said. The effort of
congressional Republicans to equate lying about one's love life to
grounds for impeachment shows they are suffering from ``an overdose
of partisanship or an overdose of morality,`` he said.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward said high crimes and misdemeanors refer solely to ``an
offense against the state.'' &QL;

 OXFORD: of themselves.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To most of the 255 colleges and universities with chapters of
Phi Beta Kappa, the honor society's presence on campus is so taken
for granted that it hardly merits mention. That is what makes its
absence so hurtful _ humiliating, really _ to the handful of
flagship universities where the quality of undergraduate liberal
arts education is not deemed high enough to rate membership in the
club.
</P>
<P>
   Khayat has made it his obsession to win a Phi Beta Kappa chapter
for Ole Miss, which shares its ignominy with the universities of
Alaska, Montana and Nevada. Success, he said, would help Ole Miss
overcome an inferiority complex that he said seems native to all
Mississippians. ``As our self-perception changes,'' he said, ``then
the external perception will change as well.''
</P>
<P>
   When Phi Beta Kappa denied the University of Mississippi's
membership application in the mid-'80s, it cited the school's
substandard libraries and laboratories and its inability to attract
and challenge the brightest students.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then. Although the honor society's officials will
not formally visit the campus until next spring, its executive
secretary, Douglas Foard, already offers a complimentary
assessment. ``In all cases, images lag,'' he said, ``and there's
still a lot of that old mint julep image left. But my sense is that
it's a much improved academic institution, that it's no longer a
Southern party school, that it's a much more serious place for
students to study and for faculty to do research and teach.''
</P>
<P>
   Phi Beta Kappa's judgment will provide only one gauge of
progress. With other yardsticks, the university's standing depends
on whether it is measured against its past or against its peers.
Compared with the Ole Miss of a decade ago, it is a more diverse,
more selective and more rigorous school. But compared with the
prestigious state schools that Khayat hopes to compete with
someday, like the universities of Michigan, North Carolina, Texas
and Virginia, it has a distance to travel.
</P>
<P>
   Research funding at Ole Miss, for instance, has grown to $20.5
million this year, from $13 million in 1989. But that sum pales
when compared with other flagship schools: the University of
Georgia, for example, reports $209 million in annual research
funds.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the last three years, Ole Miss has broken its
previous record for the average ACT score of its entering freshmen.
This year, that score has increased to 23.44 (out of a possible
36), from 22.21 in 1990. Its scores now are comparable to those
reported by the University of Alabama, the University of Arkansas
and Louisiana State University, but are well behind those of other
Southern schools, like the University of Florida and the University
of North Carolina. And faculty members complain that many students
are ill prepared, particularly in their writing and analytical
skills, shortcomings they attribute to the poor quality of
Mississippi's public schools.
</P>
<P>
   In a state that is 36 percent black, the number of black
students is only 11.4 percent of the total enrollment of 10,731
students, but that represents an increase of nearly 50 percent in
the last 10 years. A new honors college has helped to attract
bright students of all races who might not otherwise have
considered Ole Miss.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Markeeva Morgan, a black sophomore from Strayhorn,
Miss., said he chose Ole Miss over Harvard and the University of
California because of its nurturing environment. ``Looking at pure
academics,'' he said, ``I don't think I could justifiably compare
Ole Miss to the other two. But when I compared the personal
atmosphere as well as the intellectual rigor, there was no
comparison. I was determined to go to a university where I wasn't a
number. There's a genuine interest in the administration and the
professors to see a student excel.''
</P>
<P>
   Like students at many colleges, those at Ole Miss tend to
segregate in dining halls and at parties. But a new biracial group
of university students is addressing questions of race and
diversity, and students have also formed a foundation to raise
$150,000 to commission a civil rights memorial for the campus. They
have raised about a third of that sum in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most challenging issue remains the recruitment of
black faculty, currently 6 percent of the total. The school's
respected Center for the Study of Southern Culture, for all its
research on the blues and other aspects of African-American
heritage, has never employed a black professor. Natashia Gregoire,
a black senior who is editor of the student newspaper, said she had
yet to take a class taught by a black faculty member.
</P>
<P>
   But Ole Miss still has done better than many of its peers. And
one of its faculty appointments speaks volumes in symbolism. Donald
Cole, one of seven black students who were expelled after a racial
protest in Fulton Chapel in 1970, is now the associate dean of the
graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, the university's image has hindered recruitment
of black faculty, just as it has limited its appeal to black
athletes. Tommy Tuberville, the football coach, and Rod Barnes, the
basketball coach, maintain that they lose recruits because rivals
play the race card against Ole Miss. Cole said the same holds true
in the competition for black professors.
</P>
<P>
   ``With faculty that are highly sought,'' he said, ``other
universities will use our past against us. I often think about
whether we can get on the fast track out, or do we just throw up
our hands and say it's hopeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice Murray, a black New Yorker, remembers the puzzled looks
she got last year when she decided to leave Yale to become chairman
of the art department at Ole Miss. ``People would say, `What's
wrong with you? Are you running away from something?' '' she said
with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   But after a year, Ms. Murray is charmed by Faulkner's hometown,
with its endearing courthouse square. She likes her colleagues and
admires her students and their manners. ``I probably heard more
`thank you's' in the first week here than I heard in 10 years,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   And she quickly became captivated by the university's history.
She fell hard for the story of the University Greys, a company of
young students who marched off to protect the Confederacy in 1861,
only 13 years after the university opened its doors. Almost all
were killed or wounded, many during Pickett's charge at Gettysburg.
</P>
<P>
   As she told the tale over dinner in a crowded restaurant one
night this fall, she began dabbing her eyes with her napkin. ``They
almost all died,'' she said.

CANCER VACCINE SHOWS PROMISE IN MELANOMA CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Retransmitting for all needed)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ An experimental cancer vaccine has prompted a
surprisingly strong immune system response in patients dying from
malignant melanoma, partially destroying advanced tumors with no
toxic effects, according to researchers from the Harvard Medical
School and several Boston hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the patients have died, as expected, from the spread of
their cancers beyond the initial skin lesion to various organs. The
Phase I trial under Food and Drug Administration guidelines was a
small safety study in terminal patients and not designed to show
clinical effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Following the vaccine treatment, 11 of the patients agreed to
undergo biopsies to check for antitumor effect. In those patients,
the vaccine destroyed 80 percent or more of each of the tumors
biopsied, said Glenn Dranoff, the research leader.
</P>
<P>
   The tumors didn't shrink _ they were destroyed from the inside,
leaving a rim of scar tissue, said Dranoff. Moreoever, the
scientists noted with surprise that the vaccine destroyed the blood
vessels feeding the tumors _ an effect known as anti-angiogenesis.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first immune therapy to show promise in deadly
melanoma, and the study was too small to show whether it benefited
the patients in any way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important point is that the vaccine really elicited
very impressive levels of antitumor activity with no toxicity,''
said Dranoff, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard and
director of the gene transfer laboratory at the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The results were reported this week in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was gratifying and quite surprising was that we saw this
kind of response so consistently, because this group of patients is
the most difficult group to see something happen in,'' Dranoff
said.
</P>
<P>
   A cancer immunology specialist at the National Cancer Institute
said the results add to the growing optimism about an eventual
payoff from immune system therapies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting any time there's any kind of an immune
response'' to a cancer vaccine, ``and it's a well-done study,''
commented Dr. Jeffrey Schlom, chief of the laboratory of tumor
immunology and biology at the NCI. But he was cautious about its
potential importance, saying, ``This (new study) is just a piece of
the puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their name, cancer vaccines are not preventive measures
but therapies designed to stir up the patient's immune system and
to enable it to recognize a tumor as a foreign enemy to be sought
out and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   In the present study, the vaccine was created by removing cells
from the patients' tumors and using a crippled virus to carry
certain genes into the tumor cells. Equipped with these genes, the
tumor cells could produce copious amounts of a potent immune system
stimulator, called granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating
factor, or GM-CSF.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers radiated the altered tumor cells to prevent them
from growing, and to make them more vulnerable to the body's immune
defenses.
</P>
<P>
   They then returned the cells by injection, ``like a flu shot,''
said Dranoff. With their added GM-CSF genes, the tumor cells
sounded a biological alarm that recruited immune cells to fight the
tumors. The GM-CSF, known as a cytokine, helped immune cells
recognize cancer cells as foreign.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine was tailor-made for each patient, a process that
took two months and required that the tumor cells be sent to a
California biotech company to be grown in laboratory culture so
they could be genetically altered.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, the process has been greatly simplified and
takes only about a day, said Dranoff, adding that the researchers
are widening the approach to test in lung, breast and other
cancers. Co-authors on the paper include Dr. Robert Soifer from
Dana-Farber and Drs. Thomas Lynch and Martin Mihm at Massachusetts
General Hospital.

 OXFORD: she said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   That a black woman could shed tears over Confederate dead seems
incongruous on a campus whose history has so mirrored the racial
conflicts of the South. By the 1950s, even as integrationist
movements were gaining strength elsewhere, the imagery of the Lost
Cause had been thoroughly woven into the fabric of the university,
according to Sansing. It had adopted the nickname Ole Miss, a
phrase once used by slaves to refer to the mistress of the
plantation. Its athletic teams bore the name Rebels, as they still
do today. Its hallowed shrines included the Confederate cemetery, a
monument to the Confederate dead and a stained-glass window that
paid tribute to the Greys.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, the same year that the segregationist Dixiecrats
revived the use of the Confederate flag, the Ole Miss band began to
play ``Dixie'' and unfurl an enormous battle flag as part of its
halftime routine. In 1950, students inaugurated ``Dixie Week,''
which featured a ceremonial reading of the Ordinance of Secession
and the auctioning of cheerleaders as slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the autumn of 1962, under federal court order, Meredith
became the first black student to enroll at the University of
Mississippi. His arrival on campus was greeted with a riot that
became a seminal moment in the civil rights movement, prompting
President Kennedy to send in nearly 30,000 federal troops. The
rioting left two people dead, hundreds injured and hundreds more
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, the desegregation of the campus was
followed by intermittent purges of faculty members judged to be too
liberal on race. An exhibition by Ray Kerciu, an art professor, was
ordered removed after complaints that his paintings degraded the
Confederate flag. Robert Farley, a law school dean who was
considered an integrationist, was forced to retire. James Silver, a
prominent historian, left under fire after arguing that Mississippi
had become a totalitarian society.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, as black students and faculty became more integrated
into campus life, the university officially dissociated itself from
the Rebel flag, meaning that it would no longer be carried by
cheerleaders or sold in university bookstores. But some students
and fans continued to wave the flag in the stands and to display it
proudly in the Grove, the lovely oak-filled green where lavish
pregame picnics are held. And each time the university seemed
poised to move forward, some embarrassing event always managed to
pull it back.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, for instance, the first black fraternity house being
built on Fraternity Row was torched in an unsolved case of arson.
(White fraternities helped raise the money needed to rebuild.) A
year later, some white fraternity pledges kidnapped a white
upperclassman and left him naked at Rust College, a predominantly
black school nearby, with racial epithets scrawled on his chest.
After the incident, the fraternity was disbanded, and a number of
students were disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone can make the case that Ole Miss must change, the
university's loyalists say, it is Robert Khayat. He is, after all,
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Moss Point near the Mississippi coast, Khayat was an
all-conference baseball player at Ole Miss. He also led the nation
in scoring as the football team's place-kicker in 1958 and 1959,
and then played for the Washington Redskins for four years. He
returned to Ole Miss for law school, then later taught and served
as associate dean there. As a professor, he earned a reputation for
prescience when he returned an examination to a student named John
Grisham with the comment, ``Although you missed most of the legal
issues, you have a real talent for fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   As chancellor, he exudes the courtliness and amiability of a
small-town lawyer. He picks up litter on morning jogs through the
campus and brakes his Jeep to chat with students. Freshmen get the
sweats when his secretary summons them to his office, only to
discover that he simply wants to see how they are enjoying the
place. He has personally made 30 recruiting trips to predominantly
black high schools.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni have responded enthusiastically to his vision for the
school. Not accounting for inflation, he has raised more money
during his tenure than all of his predecessors combined, according
to school records. The university's endowment has nearly doubled to
$204 million. Large private gifts have financed the honors college,
an international studies institute and salary increases for liberal
arts professors. The compact campus is bustling with construction,
including the $20 million first phase of a new performing arts
center.
</P>
<P>
   Khayat has attacked the university's image as a party school by
pushing fraternity and sorority rush from the first week of fall
term to the sixth week. He has insisted that the university library
remain open 24 hours a day and has redesigned course schedules so
that more students have classes on Fridays, undercutting their
tendency to begin weekends on Thursday nights.
</P>
<P>
   After deciding to attack his university's image problem when he
took over in 1995, Khayat turned for help to Harold Burson, an Ole
Miss alumnus and the chairman of Burson-Marstellar, the world's
largest public relations firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert called me up and said, `We're going after a Phi Beta
Kappa chapter,' Burson said, `and I'm just concerned that the one
thing that could knock us down is the perception that we're a
racist school.' He said, `I'd really like to change that, but I'm
not sure how to go about it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   They decided to start with a national opinion survey, but in
announcing it last year, both Khayat and Burson made it clear that
the assessment might raise questions about the university's
remaining Old South symbols, including the continued use of the
Confederate flag, the name Ole Miss, the nickname Rebels, campus
street names, like Confederate Drive, and the white-haired mascot,
Colonel Reb.
</P>
<P>
   A backlash swelled quickly. Students formed groups dedicated to
the preservation of Ole Miss traditions. Letter writers, egged on
by the Sons of Confederate Veterans, scorched Khayat in Mississippi
newspapers and in messages sent to the university.
</P>
<P>
   It quickly became apparent that Khayat would have to moderate
his approach to avoid a self-immolating firestorm.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, somewhat surprisingly, in Burson's survey
relatively few people raised the issue of the symbols at all, and
race relations was mentioned even less frequently as a liability
than the university's reputation as a party school. The larger
problem, Burson asserted, was not that Ole Miss had a negative
image, but that it had little image at all.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Khayat used Burson's findings to downplay the need to move
aggressively against the symbols. It fell to the student government
to pass a resolution last fall encouraging students to leave their
Confederate flags at home on game days. The athletic department
helped by banning flag sticks in the stadium because they posed a
safety hazard. (Banning the flag, it was thought, would violate
free-speech protections.)
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the flags have disappeared. But a small
number of students have responded by outfitting themselves in
Confederate-flag skirts on game days. And a few alumni still place
statuettes of Robert E. Lee on their brunch tables in the Grove, a
bastion that remains so white on football Saturdays that some black
students and faculty refuse to traverse it.
</P>
<P>
   Some faculty members criticize Khayat for backing away from a
confrontation over the symbols after gauging the resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling of many faculty here was that he raised the issue
in dramatic fashion, and that was important,'' said Charles Reagan
Wilson, the director of the Center for the Study of Southern
Culture. ``But he got so much criticism from people outside the
university, these neo-Confederates out there, that he really felt
the force of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But others, including some black professors, say Khayat had
wisely concluded that his other ambitions for Ole Miss would be
threatened by a fight to the death over the university's symbols,
and that such a confrontation might harm the university's image
more than improve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be a lightning rod if you want to stay,'' said Ms.
Murray, the art department chairman. ``And if you've got goals for
this place, you've got to be here.''

UTENSILS GET CUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PHIL PATTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Godjets,'' is what the architectural historian Reyner Banham
called the household gadgets that Americans love so well as to
almost worship. All those blenders, mixers, grinders and other
appliances serve as gods _ mechanical lares and penates of the
American home.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the godjets on our Formica prairies have been joined by
another class of quasi-mythical devices: spoons and spatulas and
salt and pepper shakers that look like satyrs and nymphs, fauns and
elves.
</P>
<P>
   Personified pourers and peelers that are shaped to look animate
are dancing and leaping across the counter tops, verging into
cartoon characters. I think of Disney's dancing teapot from
``Beauty and the Beast,'' Mrs. Potts dancing about with her son
Chips the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   These cutensils, as I will call them, made their first and
high-concept appearance a few years ago in products by Alessi, the
Italian firm known for architect-designed teapots and Philippe
Starck juicers, bottle tops and napkin rings in bright plastics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family Follows Fiction'' was Alessi's name for the extended
clan of insouciant, even insolent, plastic characters that ranged
from Guido Venturini's grinning sugar sifter with eyes, snout and
feet to ``monster'' napkin rings and bottle tops in bright
plastics.
</P>
<P>
   Cutensils have gone mass market, in such products as Urchin, a
sort of molar-shaped vase, and Mano, a hand-shaped container
designed by Roberto Zanon for Benza. Now come the creatures of
Koziol, the German firm, romping in bright orange and red and blue
through the displays at Fortunoff or Bed, Bath and Beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideas for friends'' reads the slogan on the Koziol products,
designed by the German design firm Orange, based in Darmstadt
(otherwise best known for its particle-physics research
laboratory). Koziol's line of items, like a pasta tool that stands
up on its handle to grin at you, grows out of the idea of lending
character to ordinary things, giving personality to the mundane.
</P>
<P>
   There is the Dolphin toilet brush, rearing on a little flipper
tail, a scrub brush that looks like a hedgehog, and Tweetie the
vegetable brush, no relation to the Warner Brothers characters.
</P>
<P>
   The Koziol vegetable peeler is vaguely phallic, and the ice
cream scoop named Scream, with wide eyes and open mouth, is part
Munch, part munchkin. Other makers are turning out shapes straight
from Toontown _ Ren and Stimpy-shaped peelers for potatoes and
asparagus.
</P>
<P>
   These joke objects tend to polarize. Showing them around, I
found a mixture of chuckles and shudders. Some products, like the
snack bowls that electronically oink when opened, verge on kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   But cutensils also literalize some of the ideas of ``product
semantics'' as taught in the design schools in the 1980s, most
notably at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.
Such semantic products speak visually of their functions, like a
toaster shaped like a piece of toast or Sony's little hand recorder
shaped like a cartoon speech balloon.
</P>
<P>
   While cutensils seem to me as contemporary as flickering cartoon
images, others see them as revivals. Peter Stathis, the chairman of
the department of three-dimensional design at Cranbrook, says he
believes they trade on a ``latent nostalgia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alessi products _ as carefully engineered as the company's
Sapper or Graves teakettles, he argues _ ``threw down a gauntlet
and challenged ideas of high and low design.'' The Koziol friends,
by contrast, ``enter the realm of the souvenir,'' Stathis said. ``I
find I don't take them seriously as objects. I park them on a shelf
like collectibles.''
</P>
<P>
   All this cutting up on the cutting board grows out of an
admirable enough goal: giving tools personality. We now invite
friends into the kitchen. But the cute route may not be the best
way to user friendliness.
</P>
<P>
   The architect Moshe Safdie once criticized post-modernist
buildings like Philip Johnson's Chippendale clock-styled AT&AMP;T (now
Sony) Building as ``private jokes in public places.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutensils share the same sort of problem. The joke pales long
before the building falls. And here the joke grows dull long before
the peeler does. A favorite tool can be a friend, but sometimes the
``ideas for friends'' seem like products for people who have only
ideas for friends.

   NEW YORK _ Marxism may be in relative eclipse these days, but
Karl Marx, Frederick Engels and the Communist Manifesto have not
been forgotten. In fact, the manifesto will be the focus of a
two-day celebration of its 150th anniversary Friday and Saturday in
the Great Hall at Cooper Union at Third Avenue and Seventh Street
in the East Village.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:30 p.m. Friday, poets, writers and performers including
Amiri Baraka, Wallace Shawn, Tony Kushner, Vinie Burrows, Sandra
Esteves and Louis Reyes Rivera will combine poetry and music by the
klezmer/swing ensemble Hot Pstromi with dramatic readings from the
manifesto. The second day of the event, called the Manifestivity
and organized by the Brecht Forum, home of the New York Marxist
School, will culminate in a 7:30 p.m. reading followed by a
round-table discussion of society's problems and the challenges of
the manifesto on the eve of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket Talk
</P>
<P>
   To widen distribution of the 2,000 passes issued each day for
admission that day to ``Van Gogh's van Goghs,'' which ends Jan. 3,
the National Gallery of Art in Washington is limiting passes to
four per person instead of six. Since the exhibition opened on Oct.
4, it has averaged 4,527 visitors a day.
</P>
<P>
   Gratitude
</P>
<P>
   From Robert Zemeckis to the University of Southern California's
School of Cinema-Television in Los Angeles, with thanks, goes $5
million. The Academy Award-winning director of ``Forrest Gump,''
whose filmmaking credits also include the ``Back to the Future''
trilogy and ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' gave the money to his alma
mater to create a digital arts facility. Construction of the Robert
Zemeckis Center for Digital Arts is to begin in May.
</P>
<P>
   Voiced Dismay
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Barenboim, Pierre Boulez, James Levine and Zubin Mehta
were among a dozen conductors who expressed their ``deep distress''
about the Royal Opera House in a letter Wednesday to The Times of
London. Colin Davis, Carlos Kleiber and Mstislav Rostropovich also
signed the protest against plans to close the opera for nearly all
of 1999 to clear up its financial problems. ``What will become of
the orchestra and chorus?'' the letter said. ``It takes a long time
to build up so excellent an orchestra and chorus and no time at all
to destroy them.''
</P>
<P>
   Up From Egypt
</P>
<P>
   A perfectly preserved granite sphinx with a likeness of the head
of Ptolemy XII, the father of Cleopatra, emerged Wednesday from
Alexandria harbor after 1,600 years of submersion. Divers led by
Franck Goddio, president of the European Institute of Underwater
Archeology, based in Paris, also recovered a relic of the first
century A.D.: a statue of the Great Priest of Isis holding an urn.

   MONTREAL _ Quebecers go to the polls next month with the fate of
all Canada riding on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Lucien Bouchard, committed to breaking Quebec away from
Canada's 131-year-old confederation, put his political career on
the line Wednesday with a call for make-or-break early provincial
elections on Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the Quebec referendum of 1995, in which separatists
came within a whisker of winning a vote on independence, has a
provincial showdown meant so much for the rest of the country. The
campaign will be followed closely not only in Ottawa but also in
Washington, Paris, and other foreign capitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``A quarter of Canada's population lives in Quebec, and this
might be the vote that shows, finally, where they want to go,''
said Chris Sands, Canada analyst for the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. ``The
province may be heading for a watershed.''
</P>
<P>
   As always in recent Quebec history, the contest pits the
separatists of the Parti Quebecois against federalists determined
to keep the province in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, voters will also be choosing between two of the
most charismatic politicians ever to vie for the soul of North
America's only important bastion of French culture.
</P>
<P>
   On the one side is Bouchard, 59, the fiery champion of Quebec
independence. After only three years in office, he is not required
to risk a ballot box showdown until next year, but he believes the
time is ripe for the Parti Quebecois to seek another popular
mandate for its separatist vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a moment of truth for me,'' he told the newspaper Le
Devoir. ``It's the political fight of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   For in the opposite corner is the first genuinely popular
defender of unity with Canada that Quebec has seen in a generation:
Jean Charest, 40, who this year reluctantly bowed to immense
pressure to resign his seat in national Parliament to take up the
tattered federalist crusade as head of the Quebec Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quebecers cannot afford to to squander their time and energies
in a futile sovereignist quest,'' said Charest, whom polls show to
be the only politician capable of unseating Bouchard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold on to your hats,'' Charest said. ``The battle will be
close, the campaign will be tough, and I expect it to be very
intense. I'm heading into the biggest political fight of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Strictly speaking, the election is not a race between the two
men. Whichever party wins a majority in the 125-seat National
Assembly, as the provincial legislature is called, will head
Quebec's government. Neither Bouchard nor Charest is likely to lose
his seat.
</P>
<P>
   However, nearly every analyst agrees on one thing: Loss of the
election would finish Bouchard's political career and perhaps dash
forever the old dream of a French-speaking republic rising north of
New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the end of Lucien Bouchard,'' former prime minister
Brian Mulroney, a Quebecer, was quoted as saying in the Montreal
Gazette. ``He'll be turfed by the Parti Quebecois within 24
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Bouchard who in October 1995 almost single-handedly
rallied the separatist movement and came within a few thousand
votes of leading Quebec to independence in a referendum that served
as a stunning wake-up call to the rest of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   By Quebec standards, the two politicians are almost polar
opposites.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard is aloof, even arrogant, and far more cerebral than is
usually acceptable in politics. Son of a truck driver, he was
raised in Quebec's French-speaking heartland, educated as a lawyer,
and spoke hardly a word of English until his mid-20s, although he
has become eloquent in that tongue. Ironically, he is married to an
American, Audrey Best, who makes little secret of her antipathy
toward the separatist cause.
</P>
<P>
   Charest, a populist who seems happiest when out pressing the
flesh, is the child of a ``mixed marriage'' _ one parent of French
heritage, the other of English _ raised in the Eastern Townships
region near Vermont. He has no patience with the ethnic/linguistic
hostilities that have haunted Quebec since it was surrendered by
France to the English empire in 1763.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in my lifetime have I felt there was a contradiction
between being a proud Quebecer and a proud Canadian,'' Charest said
this year.
</P>
<P>
   That's a notion many Quebecers dispute. Roughly 80 percent of
the province's 7.3 million inhabitants are French speakers, and
polls consistently show that a third are hard-core secessionists
while another third are so-called ``soft nationalists,'' favoring a
sovereign Quebec but only if it can be won without bloodshed or
serious economic sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   But recent polls also show that Quebecers are weary of the
separatist debate and would prefer to put off the wrenching ordeal
of another referendum on independence, at least for the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Bouchard in a precarious position. If he backs away
from the secessionist struggle, he risks alienating the
ultranationalists who form the backbone of his support. But if he
aggressively pushes the separatist agenda, the Parti Quebecois
might suffer massive defections of soft nationalists to the Charest
camp.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Bouchard is performing a bit of a highwire act,
asserting that he remains unswervingly commmitted to separatism but
insisting that his most immediate priorities are job creation and
general improvement of Quebec's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My commitment is to hold a referendum that will be won,''
Bouchard said. ``We will do everything that we can to create a
climate _ a social, economic, and political climate _ in which we
will launch a referendum on sovereignty, and win it.''

<P>
   They are pioneers, in a way: the first wave of the modern
home-schooling movement, the first generation of children to be
taught primarily by their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Some 15 years after states began legalizing home schooling in
earnest, these early graduates are starting to make their way in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Some have found the transition challenging, especially when
trying to convince colleges and employers that home school is as
good as high school, or when trying to get used to working in
groups and socializing with peers. Others have had easy success,
building on talents nurtured in their home incubators and drawing
on a sense of competence fed by their teacher-parents' undivided
support.
</P>
<P>
   The experiences of these young adults have paved the way for the
increasing numbers of children coming after them. Following years
of court battles, home schooling is now legal in every state. While
there are no exact figures, estimates suggest that the number of
home-schooled children has jumped to anywhere between 500,000 and
1.5 million today, from 15,000 in 1970. Many, if not most, go to
college, and schools like Harvard and Yale now have policies for
evaluating their work. The Internet has vastly broadened the range
of home curriculums.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many mainstream educators remain wary _ about
socialization skills and about the potential inability of parents
to give their children the rigor and depth they need in all
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   There are two major trends in home schooling: one philosophy is
rooted in religious objections to the secularization of schools and
to teaching subjects like evolution; the other, the more free-form
philosophy called unschooling, initially embraced by families who
considered themselves part of the counterculture, encourages
independent expression and exposure to a broad menu of experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, home schooling is appealing to more conventional
families, too _ parents who worry that their children are not
getting enough individual attention in school and are either
excelling faster than their classmates or need more help in certain
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Today home schooling can involve strong links to local schools:
consultations with teachers, playing on school sports teams, even
attending a class or two. Many states now require standardized
tests or portfolios of work for evaluation by state authorities or
certified teachers, mainstream benchmarks that were up to parents
to accept or reject in the earlier years of modern home schooling.
Still, some families have almost no dealings with schools and view
grading systems as inadequate or irrelevant to real learning. Other
parents take care to immerse their children in extracurricular
programs so they will meet children their own age. Still others
encourage individual activities, including internships and
volunteer work, which help make their children comfortable with
adults, but not always at ease with their peers.
</P>
<P>
   All of these decisions shape the way home-schoolers adjust to
the larger world.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Big Achievements, High Expectations &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Other kids always asked Tad Heuer why he wasn't in school and if
he spent his days watching television. Sometimes in his hometown,
Holliston, Mass., west of Boston, he'd get stopped by a police
officer who would ``try to get me for truancy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Heuer, now a 20-year-old senior at Brown University, loved
being able to study American history and music without having to
switch subjects every 50 minutes. He also loved going on a
monthlong tour of Civil War battlefields and coal mines. ``I'm sure
there were points when I was just miserable and said, `How could my
parents do this to me?' '' he said, ``but I don't think there was
ever a time that I wanted to be in school.''
</P>
<P>
   Like an increasing number of contemporary home-schoolers, Heuer
had an education that was constantly intertwined with the
conventional school system. His mother, a former elementary school
teacher who thought she could do better than the schools, made sure
he and his younger brother took the Iowa Test of Basic Skills and
enlisted certified teachers to review her sons' work.
</P>
<P>
   Heuer took science classes at the high school, partly because,
he said, ``it's not easy to buy one frog in formaldehyde'' for home
study. In 11th grade, he took an English class. He had violin
lessons at the school, played on the basketball team and worked on
the school newspaper. These activities connected him with children
his age and with what they were learning.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he had to work hard to be accepted by the
world of mainstream education. When he decided that he wanted the
``credential'' of a high school diploma, the Superintendent of
Schools and the school committee were reluctant, suggesting he take
a year of college first or seek a high school equivalency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of inherent mistrust of someone who's been
home schooled _ `How do you know you did the same thing everybody
else did?' '' Heuer said. He persisted: he deserved a diploma
because of his strong links to the school and community, he said,
and the officials gave in.
</P>
<P>
   He had less trouble being embraced by the working world. At 15,
he spent a summer working for a Democratic Massachusetts State
Representative, Barbara Gardner, after she wrote him a letter
praising an article on term limits he'd written for a local
newspaper. Ms. Gardner said he seemed more well-rounded and mature
than others his age.
</P>
<P>
   At 16, he worked for the unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign of
Mark Roosevelt, a Democrat, impressing the staff so much that he
was promoted from making copies to doing research on the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess would be home-schoolers would give you pause if they
seemed to be a person of average talent,'' said Michael Gritton,
Roosevelt's former communications director, now policy director for
a nonpartisan think tank, the Massachusetts Institute for a New
Commonwealth, where Heuer also worked after the Roosevelt campaign.
``You'd be thinking, `Who is this person? What have they done? What
do they know?' You'd think to yourself, `Are they, like, coming out
of a cult or something?' But he's so talented, you think, `Well,
geez, maybe this home-schooling thing is something to consider.' ''
</P>
<P>
   With a combined SAT score of 1290 (the national average is
1017), Heuer applied to nine colleges, improvising a 55-page
application that detailed the work he had done and included
exhibits _ a science paper on Canada geese, a tape of his viola
playing. The transcript his parents created was 30 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Heuer was rejected by Harvard and Yale but accepted by Johns
Hopkins, American University, Catholic University and Brown, where
he is pursuing a bachelor's degree in public policy and a master's
in political science. Last spring he won a $30,000 Harry S. Truman
Scholarship, one of 105 such awards given annually nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Heuer felt comfortable at college immediately, introducing
himself at orientation. ``No reason I was going to be any different
than anyone else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His home-schooling background has made him interested in a
career involving education policy, trying to ``transfer the
schooling I got into the public schools,'' he said. But he's not
sure he'll end up home schooling his own children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could save the world and home school my kids at the same
time,'' he said, ``no question I would home school my kids.'' But,
he added, ``Am I going to please everyone who's expecting me to go
off and do great things, be a high-powered lawyer or whatever? It's
weighing the advantages that we've received from home schooling,
and do we put that back into home schooling?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Now, a Drink or Two - and Evolution &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When Julie Vickery's parents pulled her out of school in the
sixth grade, she was in shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was something they did in the 1800s,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vickery grew up in Central, S.C., near Greenville, and had
been one of the better students in her elementary school. She was
convinced that she was going to be a failure because she wasn't
going to regular classes.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents, she explained, decided on home schooling primarily
for religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents were quite fundamentalist in their approach to
life,'' said Ms. Vickery, now 23. ``They thought the public schools
would brainwash the kids, not teach them how to read and write, but
teach them all this horrible liberal thought. They were concerned
about creationism versus evolutionism and the move away from the
phonics approach to reading.''
</P>
<P>
   Religious home schooling tends to be structured more like a
classroom setting, with the mother serving as teacher and using
religious materials to supplement more standard academic lessons.
Ms. Vickery's mother, a homemaker, tried that approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two weeks,'' Ms. Vickery recalled, ``I said, `Mom, you
don't know anything. Let me do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Ms. Vickery was allowed to choose her own textbooks _
ones that approached history, science and art from a biblical
perspective _ and she became an indefatigable learner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a core curriculum based on scriptural principles,''
said Norma Vickery, Julie's mother. ``At the same time that we were
doing the academic study, we were also incorporating the biblical
principles that went with them.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Ms. Vickery's social world turned upside down. ``My
three or four best friends all told me, `My mommy and daddy don't
want me playing with you anymore,''' she said. ```They say your
parents are really strict.'''
</P>
<P>
   That hurt. But Ms. Vickery, who had also been teased at school
because she was a brainy, nonathletic child, said she soon had an
experience common to many home- schoolers: she began making friends
outside her age group. She asked the Clemson University professors
who lived in her neighborhood about geology or history. She played
piano at a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of missing out on socialization,'' Mrs. Vickery said,
``we probably were more selective in the kind of socialization she
was getting. Sometimes in the school situation, they can socialize
with the wrong kind of people, people with entirely different
values or no values, or just troublemakers and that sort of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   To broaden her experiences, her father took her on a ride with a
truck driver, on a tour of an automobile factory and to see how a
newspaper worked. Going to the grocery store became a lesson in
math.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ms. Vickery was 14, she had ``finished every high
school course that was recognized by the state of South Carolina,''
she said, and had taken the SAT's and scored a combined 1390. She
spent the next two years researching and writing papers, mining the
libraries of five nearby universities.
</P>
<P>
   At 17, Ms. Vickery and her parents decided she would go to
college. ``You're not going to gain acceptance in the world if you
don't have the credential,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She chose Northland Baptist Bible College, a small, religious
school in Dunbar, Wis. ``I think if I had gone to a larger
setting,'' Ms. Vickery said, ``I would have had more of a problem
getting adjusted.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, she felt more comfortable socializing with the staff
than the students. The hardest part was learning to ``work as part
of a team,'' she said. ``That was very difficult for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In one course, for example, Ms. Vickery, who was majoring in
education, had to collaborate with other education students to
determine the best way to tutor a child. ``One person wanted to
complete the textbook,'' she said. ``One person wanted something
else; not all of those ideas could work. At the beginning I was
hesitant to express my ideas to others. I thought, `I haven't been
through the system; they have. I don't know how students are
supposed to learn, I just know how I learned.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Things improved as she became more comfortable. But she was
still hesitant to talk about her home-schooling experience. Her
faculty adviser did not find out until her sophomore year and, she
said, ``He just about choked. He said, `You couldn't have been home
schooled, you can read and write.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Ms. Vickery went to Korea to teach at a
private language institute affiliated with a church. Told she would
be teaching English-speaking high school and college students, she
was disappointed to find that her students were Korean-speaking
preschoolers. At the end of the year, she returned to this country
and formed a group called Teachers for Christ International, a
religiously based educational organization geared toward giving
young teachers more control over their educational careers
overseas. She plans to return to Korea but is spending this year
getting a master's degree in education at Bob Jones University, a
conservative Christian institution in Greenville, S.C., that
emphasizes religion.
</P>
<P>
   She believes that her home-schooling background can help her
teach effectively because she can see classroom problems from an
``outsider's perspective.'' But now she wants to learn the
insider's ropes, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vickery said she is not as conservative as her parents. She
allows herself to wear pants in public, for example. She also
allows herself an occasional drink or two. And while she does not
believe in evolution, she would teach the theory as part of a
science class.
</P>
<P>
   These days, she has a group of friends her age and goes on
casual dates.
</P>
<P>
   She does not unequivocally recommend home schooling. She has
seen other home-schooled children who, at 10, cannot read and spend
their days running around outside, saying they are looking for bugs
for a science lesson. ``There are some kids who are so social, they
thrive on team sports,'' she said. ``You lose that if home
schooled.''

CANADIAN MARGIE GILLIS TAKES HER FAMOUS FOOTWORK AROUND THE WORLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Margie Gillis is one of Canada's most notable cultural exports:
a modern dancer who gained international attention for performing
in China and who drew rock-concert-size crowds to a stadium in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a self-described ``problem child'' who disliked
school and still has trouble telling left from right.
</P>
<P>
   Although she is one of the most renowned dancers and
choreographers in the world, Gillis says she had an unusual
childhood. Described as intelligent but with an attention-deficit
problem, Gillis struggled in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I avoided school as much as possible,'' she says. ``I was a
problem child.''
</P>
<P>
   But she excelled as a dancer and gymnast. Although her tone and
demeanor are those of a free-spirited intellectual, the solidly
muscled upper arms bespeak an athletic background.
</P>
<P>
   As an adult, she finally learned that her problem is dyslexia.
But dyslexia may well be one of the elements that gives her dancing
its special quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't dance from technical instruction,'' she says. ``I have
trouble knowing left from right. I can't keep count.''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents, Olympic skiers who met while competing, encouraged
their children to take physical risks. Margie Gillis was 3 and her
brother, Christopher, was 5 when they started dance and gymnastic
classes together. Although he eventually went to New York to dance
with the Paul Taylor Company, she remained in Montreal and pursued
her own vision, starting to dance in small theaters and museums
when she was 18.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent van Gogh and Janis Joplin inspired her, but she found
that it was dance, not painting or music, that gave her the
opportunity for expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance involves every part of you,'' she says. ``Dance doesn't
lie. I heard a voice that said, `Dance.' I was afraid, but the
passion was stronger than the fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of her career, Gillis has set all kinds of
music to dance, and a variety of poetry as well. ``I love the sound
of the spoken voice,'' she says. Her unique style focuses on, but
is not limited, to her performances as a soloist in her own works.
</P>
<P>
   She was ``discovered'' at a national dance conference in Canada
in 1977 and remains based in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, she visited mainland China as a tourist and ended up
dancing in theaters there. Since then, she has performed around the
world, appearing for crowds as large as 35,000 at a football
stadium in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of becoming an international dance star, Gillis
also became a Canadian cultural icon. She was awarded the Order of
Canada, the Canadian equivalent of knighthood. She jokes that the
medallion that comes with the honor is so heavy, it makes the
wearer lean to one side.
</P>
<P>
   She is well-known for the performances she presents every other
year at the Joyce Theatre in New York. She also tours and has
become a favorite guest artist for ballet company gala
performances; she is pleased that the classical ballet world has
embraced her form of dance.
</P>
<P>
   Her brother, Christopher, was her soul mate and chief
collaborator for many years as dance partner and co-choreographer.
His death five years ago from AIDS marked a turning point in her
life. Since then, she has sought collaborators with whom she has a
similar feeling of empathy.
</P>
<P>
   That group apparently includes Fort Wort-based dancer and
choreographer Bruce Wood, whom she met years ago in Canada, and
with whom she has collaborated to create a suite of dances, ``I
Came So Far for Beauty,'' set to the music of apocalyptic pop
singer-songwriter-poet Leonard Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Gillis says she intends to continue collaborating with Wood and
has yet another work for the company in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Bruce is doing with this company is astounding,'' she
says. ``I hope the community will support his artistry. This
company could be world-class, and it's 90 percent there.'' .MDNM/

with the Paul Taylor Company, she remained in Montreal and pursued
her own vision, starting to dance in small theaters and museums
when she was 18.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent van Gogh and Janis Joplin inspired her, but she found
that it was dance, not painting or music, that gave her the
opportunity for expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance involves every part of you,'' she says. ``Dance doesn't
lie. I heard a voice that said, `Dance.' I was afraid, but the
passion was stronger than the fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of her career, Gillis has set all kinds of
music to dance, and a variety of poetry as well. ``I love the sound
of the spoken voice,'' she says. Her unique style focuses on, but
is not limited, to her performances as a soloist in her own works.
</P>
<P>
   She was ``discovered'' at a national dance conference in Canada
in 1977 and remains based in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, she visited mainland China as a tourist and ended up
dancing in theaters there. Since then, she has performed around the
world, appearing for crowds as large as 35,000 at a football
stadium in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of becoming an international dance star, Gillis
also became a Canadian cultural icon. She was awarded the Order of
Canada, the Canadian equivalent of knighthood. She jokes that the
medallion that comes with the honor is so heavy, it makes the
wearer lean to one side.
</P>
<P>
   She is well-known for the performances she presents every other
year at the Joyce Theatre in New York. She also tours and has
become a favorite guest artist for ballet company gala
performances; she is pleased that the classical ballet world has
embraced her form of dance.
</P>
<P>
   Her brother, Christopher, was her soul mate and chief
collaborator for many years as dance partner and co-choreographer.
His death five years ago from AIDS marked a turning point in her
life. Since then, she has sought collaborators with whom she has a
similar feeling of empathy.
</P>
<P>
   That group apparently includes Fort Wort-based dancer and
choreographer Bruce Wood, whom she met years ago in Canada, and
with whom she has collaborated to create a suite of dances, ``I
Came So Far for Beauty,'' set to the music of apocalyptic pop
singer-songwriter-poet Leonard Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Gillis says she intends to continue collaborating with Wood and
has yet another work for the company in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Bruce is doing with this company is astounding,'' she
says. ``I hope the community will support his artistry. This
company could be world-class, and it's 90 percent there.'' .MDNM/

 UNDATED: home schooled.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Close to Home &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When Mae Shell was a child, her parents homesteaded in
Washington State, building their own houses and living off the
land, for a time without running water. So when it came time to
educate Mae and her three younger sisters, the method they chose
seemed to fit right in _ teaching them at home in the small town of
Georgia, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it pretty informally,'' said Ms. Shell, now 21. ``It
was very self-directed. We did horseback riding at a stable nearby.
We went everywhere with my mom, to the grocery store, to run
errands, to the theater. Math was kind of the only thing we really
sat down at our desks to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shell said she did not read until she was 8, which she
realizes is considered late. She and her sisters also had little
interaction with the local schools or the state system, and didn't
take standardized tests. ``There wasn't really anything we wanted
to do in school,'' she said, ``or that we thought the school had
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   They received diplomas and transcripts from their parents, who
lobbied unsuccessfully against a change in Vermont law requiring
home-schooled students to submit a portfolio of work to the state
or have their work reviewed by certified teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned about how much control the state would have
over how home schools worked,'' Ms. Shell said. ``True learning
takes place when it is directed by the person who needs to be
learning it. In the public schools it's sort of forced on the
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   At 17, she took a few classes at a local community college. She
enjoyed a short-fiction class, but found it difficult to be given
an assignment to write. She preferred to be naturally inspired and
did not like ``learning in such a formal way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She was much more excited about working in the public library in
nearby St. Albans, where she began volunteering at 16. She
considered going to college and trying to get a master's degree in
library science, but ``No college in Vermont offers that,'' she
said, ``and I didn't really feel like I wanted to go out of state
at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   So while two of Ms. Shell's younger sisters went to college (one
is at Smith College, the other at the University of Massachusetts
at Amherst), Ms. Shell decided to live at home and get a paying job
at the library, where she maintains the Web page, enters catalogued
books into the computer and takes books to nursing homes and
shut-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Wade, a librarian at St. Albans Free Library, said that
compared with children educated conventionally, the Shell daughters
were ``more mature in a lot of ways and less mature in some ways.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no problem talking with adults,'' she said. ``But
sometimes they seem nave about certain things. They haven't had to
be kids. They've just had to be people.'' They have had little
experience with the kind of competition or teasing common among
schoolchildren, she observed, because they spent their time among
family members. ``They may not understand why people would even
tease someone in a cruel way,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   She said home-schooled children, who are relatively common in
the St. Albans community, seem to ``do things that are less likely
to put themselves in situations where they have to be cutthroat,
because they haven't had to be,'' Ms. Wade said. ``They have been
often raised by people who are potters or farmers. One of the
home-schoolers has a father who is a produce manager. That's about
as competitive as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in Growing Without Schooling, a magazine about
unschooling, Ms. Shell wrote of her only complaint: ``I feel very
separated from my schooled peers because of seemingly
insurmountable differences in our values. I have many friends, but
they are all significantly younger or older than me. I often feel
lonely, and long for friends my own age who are going through the
same experiences as I am.''
</P>
<P>
   She has dated but finds it hard to meet many men her age. Still,
she says that for now she is happy living with her parents: her
father builds wooden boats, and her mother is a former potter who
went back to college several years ago to get a master's in
counseling. Ms. Shell helps out at home by doing the grocery
shopping and chauffeuring her youngest sister to dance classes. She
also writes poetry and designs Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like it here,'' she said. ``I don't feel the need to
go anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Life With Great Books &LR;
</P>
<P>
   School just wasn't working out well for Emily Murphy. A bright
child who started reading as a toddler, Ms. Murphy puzzled her
teachers, who seemed uncertain where to place her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were shipping me off to gifted classes in the morning,
putting me in higher grades,'' recalled Ms. Murphy, now 25. ``One
teacher in first grade took an irrational hatred to me. I was
really unhappy. The other kids would kind of pick on me because I
was different.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers were also so critical of her handwriting, saying it was
illegible, that she hated to write.
</P>
<P>
   After third grade, her parents decided to teach her at home,
where she could proceed at her own pace. There was an added
advantage: stability. Ms. Murphy's father worked for a railroad and
had to move the family every couple of years, settling finally in
Wellsboro, a small town in central Pennsylvania. Home schooling
``fit the transient life style,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murphy's parents worked to help her feel comfortable
writing. She would dictate essays, and her father would write them
down, until ``it got to the point where he couldn't write as fast
as I would dictate,'' Ms. Murphy said, ``so I got frustrated and I
would just write it myself. I doubt the school system would have
had the patience.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday evenings, they held sessions to review what Ms. Murphy
and her younger brother and sister, also home schooled, had
accomplished and to set goals for the following week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them could be very tense,'' Ms. Murphy said. ``We did
clash quite a bit when I was a kid _ `I don't want to do this';
`You have to do this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents, now both English professors at Mansfield
University, in Mansfield, Pa., decided that the children should
take standardized tests and submit work to schools for approval.
``The way you beat the system is to learn how to do standardized
tests really well,'' Ms. Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   She also took classes in dance, drama and art, enrolled in
courses at a community college, and by 13, was working in a local
library and in a historical society's rare-books collection. Her
parents encouraged their children to talk to adults about their
work, including the plumbers and electricians who came to the
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents had the attitude that the world is not made up of
30 people your own age,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murphy always intended to go to college, and scored a
combined score of 1330 on the SAT's. But one of the two schools she
applied to, Penn State, ``basically sent me a rejection letter
because I didn't fit into their system,'' she said. The other
school, St. John's College, a small institution in Maryland,
accepted her. She felt right at home with its ``great books''
curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   She said colleges seemed to be more receptive to home-schoolers
by the time her siblings applied. Both chose Williams College.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ms. Murphy is an assistant registrar and curator of
photographs at the Maryland State Archives in Annapolis. She
squeezes a social life into her busy schedule but says she hasn't
had time to date. Her answering machine's outgoing message features
quotes from Jane Austen and Emily Dickinson.
</P>
<P>
   Would she home school her own children?
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom is a saint,'' she answered. ``I have no clue how she
managed to handle three kids, all very bright, all rambunctious. I
don't know that I would have the patience to do it.''

Q &AMP; A: ANTIDOTES FOR CRASHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Does anti-crash software really help?
</P>
<P>
   A. While the promise of an absolutely crash-free computer ranks
right up there with the Easter Bunny, there is utility software on
the market that is supposed to help avoid crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the more popular anti-crash programs for Windows 95 and
98 are Symantec's Norton Crash Guard Deluxe and Cybermedia's First
Aid. These programs, about $50 each, scan your system for
conflicts, glitches and corrupted files and often fix the problems
found. Crash Guard is also available for Mac users.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to scanning on command, this type of program will
also lurk quietly behind the scenes as you work, monitoring your
system for things like software conflicts or damaged system files.
Both utility programs can check the Web for the most recent
anti-virus, driver and bug-fix software and update your system.
</P>
<P>
   Some users say anti-crash programs cause more problems than they
fix, depending on the system configuration and programs used, but
if your computer is heading south more often than it should, you
may want to try one of them. If not, you can help avoid crashes by
regularly defragging your hard drive, running virus scans and
deleting unneeded files (like your browser cache and old temporary
files).

ELLIOTT CARTER AT 90: YOUNG MUSIC FOR A YOUNG AUDIENCE

 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ninetieth-birthday concerts, when they happen at all,
are usually retrospectives. Speculum Musicae's evening of Elliott
Carter at the Miller Theater on Tuesday night was, on the other
hand, a showcase for the new and the recent. Only the eminent
Double Concerto (1961) and a brief song written 60 years ago looked
very far into the past.
</P>
<P>
   The rest did not sound like old man's music. ``Shard'' sent
David Starobin's solo guitar on a rhapsody of busy passage work,
delicate harmonics and abrupt attacks. The five songs called ``Of
Challenge and of Love'' were more like duets between voice and
piano than song and accompaniment. Carter's linear style had little
use for orderly metric schemes. John Hollander's poetry took the
music where it would.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most arresting music of the night was ``Luimen'' for
six very different instruments. The mix of colors is striking, with
sharp exchanges between trombone and trumpet and more genteel
colleagues like the mandolin and vibraphone. There is a
fastidiousness in Carter's ear for colors and the way he separates
them one from another. The notes of a single horizontal line often
fragment and pass from one instrument to the next; silences let in
light. Perhaps this is why music so dense with diverse agendas can
sound so clear.
</P>
<P>
   From the newest piece, ``Tempo e Tempi'' for soprano, violin,
English horn and bass clarinet, come the words (in translation):
``There's not just one tempo: there are many strands/ that glide in
parallel/ often in opposite directions and seldom intersect.'' How
better to explain music busy with many inner lives: lines that
function at their own pace according to their own rules and
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Pieces like ``Luimen'' indicate that Carter at 90 is finding
better ways to render this intense volume of information
intelligible. If the evening had a contrasting tone, it was the
Double Concerto _ piano and harpsichord, each with its own small
band, clashing heatedly onstage. The gray militancy of this music,
thick with martial drums and percussion, poses problems that the
late chamber music seems to solve.
</P>
<P>
   That Carter has survived and prospered in an environment that,
for the moment at least, has turned away from his austere,
anti-tonal language is cause for celebration. Miller Theater, not
very big to begin with, had empty seats, but what must have been
heartening for the composer was the presence of young students,
musicians and composers to mix with more venerable colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the place to put Elliott Carter in his proper
niche. There will be time to decide whether his music shines ahead
to the future, or whether it is more like a brilliant taillight
receding down an increasingly unpopulated road. These dicta,
moreover, will be different according to the era that makes them.
As an example, Carter is a problem. Indeed, his remoteness from the
public may have helped music down a blind alley from which it
extricates itself with difficulty. As an individual, however, he is
an acknowledged master.
</P>
<P>
   A host of players and the soprano Lucy Shelton, a fervent and
accomplished Carterian, seemed to love their jobs Tuesday. And as
long as good musicians feel the exhilaration of tackling Carter's
complex problems, they will keep on playing his music.
</P>
<P>
   Aleck Karis was the evening's pianist. Chris Oldfather played
the harpsichord in the Double Concerto. William Purvis faced a
nightmarish conducting job with skill and courage.

   Torrential rain and pounding surf battered the Hondorus and
Belize coasts Wednesday as powerful Hurricane Mitch edged closer
toward land. After achieving rank as the fourth-strongest Hurricane
of record in the Atlantic basin, Mitch slowly weakened Wednesday as
a portion of its circulation moved over Central America. Hurricane
forecasters expect the slow westward drift of Mitch to continue
Thursday, bringing the tropical cyclone's center close to the
Belize coast.
</P>
<P>
   On the U.S. mainland, gusty breezes from the northwest will
direct cooler air into the Northeast behind a departing front.
Residual moisture in the lowest few thousand feet of the atmosphere
will cause clouds and spotty showers to linger over the New England
mountains. Meanwhile, air descending the higher terrain will help
dissipate the clouds near the Northeast coast, producing intervals
of sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonable warmth and ample sunshine will cover Florida and
much of the Southeast on Thursday as high pressure at 20,000 feet
thwarts inclement weather from the region. Partial sunshine will
extend across the southern Plains and the lower Mississippi Valley
but as an approaching cold front lifts the humid air in place,
isolated strong thunderstorms will erupt from central Texas to
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and a few thunderstorms will also accompany a jet stream
disturbance moving from the northern Plains to the western Great
Lakes. Elsewhere, low pressure over Nevada will generate clouds and
showers across the west-central Rockies while partly to mostly
sunny skies extend along the Pacific Coast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Self-Destruction
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch which has been moving very little while
battering the coast of Honduras, may be sowing the seeds of its own
destruction. The gusty winds of a hurricane stir up the ocean along
the path of the storm. The mixing of the ocean brings cooler water
from below to the surface. For several days, in the wake of a
typical hurricane the cooler ocean water produces an inhospitable
environment for another hurricane to form. Because Hurricane Mitch
has moved little during the last few days, the cool water that it's
motions have raised from below are contributing to its own gradual
weakening.  &QL;

THE MET BUYS ITS FIRST PAINTING BY JASPER JOHNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a move to strengthen its holdings of postwar
works, the Metropolitan Museum of Art has bought ``White Flag,''
its first painting by Jasper Johns, the museum announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 1955 painting is the second in a series that the artist
based on the American flag. Measuring 6{ by 10 feet, it is also the
largest of the flag paintings and his first monochrome of the
image.
</P>
<P>
   For the Met, which has drawn criticism for not always choosing
the best examples of postwar art, the acquisition is a big step,
both in financial commitment and in terms of the history of its
collecting. The museum already owns 52 prints and a drawing by
Johns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fills a cruel gap with an authentic masterpiece,'' said
Philippe de Montebello, the Met's director, calling the painting
``as good as they come.'' While he refused to say what the Met paid
for ``White Flag,'' experts estimate its value at more than $20
million. Many consider it the artist's finest painting.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition was announced days after a windfall of two
important van Gogh drawings received as a bequest of philanthropist
Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. Mrs. Rockefeller, who died in 1948 and
was a founder of the Museum of Modern Art, initially gave the
drawings to the Modern. But she stipulated that they would no
longer be considered modern after 50 years and should then go to
the Met, a museum she perceived as devoted to older art. (Two
drawings by Seurat, also part of her bequest to the Modern, were
sent to the Art Institute of Chicago.)
</P>
<P>
   The Johns painting was bought directly from the artist, who had
steadfastly refused offers from collectors and other institutions.
``They approached me, and I thought the Met was the right place for
it,'' Johns said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``White Flag'' has been widely exhibited, and over the years it
has been lent for long periods to the Yale University Art Gallery,
the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen in Duesseldorf, Germany, and
the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The painting is only 44 years old, and it's already an icon,''
said William Lieberman, chairman of the Met's department of
20th-century art. In honor of the acquisition, Lieberman delivered
what might be called a ``matched'' gift. He has promised the museum
``Flag,'' a 11~-by-16}-inch white oil painting on brown paper
mounted on board that the artist made in 1957, two years after
``White Flag.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, while Lieberman was a young curator at the Museum of
Modern Art, he persuaded his mother to buy ``Flag'' when it was
available through the Modern's Art Lending Service (which also sold
works of art). It is in pristine condition, Lieberman said, because
his mother ulimately decided she did not like it and kept it in a
trunk.
</P>
<P>
   This small ``Flag'' is an example of how Johns likes to repeat
an image in another medium. The far larger ``White Flag'' was
painted on three separately stretched panels of fabric: one, on the
upper left side of the painting, showing 48 stars; a second, the
seven upper stripes, and the third, six longer stripes below that.
</P>
<P>
   Johns worked on each panel separately in his signature surface,
encaustic, an ancient technique involving pigment suspended in
melted wax that he is frequently credited with reviving. The
material sets rapidly and allows every brush stroke to remain
distinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``White Flag'' was made in layers. Johns outlined the flag
design in charcoal, then put down a ground of unpigmented molten
beeswax. Next he dipped collage elements like bits of newsprint,
other pieces of paper and scraps of fabric in more beeswax and
stuck them to the canvas. After joining the three panels at the
back, he painted the surface with short strokes of more wax
pigmented with shades of white and added touches of oil paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``By draining most color from the flag but leaving subtle
gradations in tone,'' said Nan Rosenthal, a curator in the Met's
department of 20th-century art, ``the artist shifted the emphasis
from the flag image to the very subject of the way that he painted
it with short, distinct gestures.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosenthal, who organized a retrospective of Johns' drawings
in 1990 when she was the curator of 20th-century art at the
National Gallery of Art, brokered the purchase for the Met, people
close to the discussions said. Like most such negotiations, it took
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been waiting for the right Johns,'' said de Montebello,
who visited Johns in his Connecticut studio to persuade him to sell
the painting to the Met.
</P>
<P>
   With the artist's red, white and blue ``Flag'' (1954-1955) in
the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, and the superimposed
``Three Flags'' from 1958 at the Whitney Museum of American Art,
three major New York museums now own examples of Johns' early flag
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   From the Met's perspective, its strong holdings in Abstract
Expressionist paintings provide an excellent context for this early
work by Johns. But the museum still has other holes to fill in the
area of second-generation post-war art. The Met has no paintings by
Robert Rauschenberg, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The Met has wasted no time in putting ``White Flag'' on view.
The painting has just been hung in the museum's 20th-century
galleries, marking an anniversary of sorts: it is exactly 40 years
since ``White Flag'' was first exhibited. The occasion was Johns'
first one-man show, at Leo Castelli's gallery, which was then on
the Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of two paintings that didn't sell,'' Johns said.
``The other was a target painting. Since Leo wanted the target, I
kept the `White Flag.'''

 (ATTN: Neb, Texas, N.D)  (For release Sun., Nov. 1) 
(JT) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After bouncing in and out of so many schools in Europe, Africa
and the United States that he can't remember all their names,
Simone Liverani found himself in Kolokani, a town in Mali, the west
African country where his mother worked for a company drilling
water wells. There was no diplomatic or international school
anywhere nearby, so he tried a local high school.
</P>
<P>
   Liverani, an Italian who also speaks English and understands
some French, had been told classes would be taught in French, but
most teachers spoke Bambara, the native language. ``This was the
last straw,'' he said. ``It was a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   An official at the United States consulate suggested the
Independent Study High School, based at the University of Nebraska
in Lincoln. Founded in 1929 as a correspondence program to educate
rural Nebraskans, the school has one of only a few fully accredited
distance-education programs offering high school diplomas; other
well-known programs include the North Dakota Division of
Independent Study in Fargo and Texas Tech University Distance
Learning in Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   They offer an option for the children of diplomats and
missionaries, or those who can't or don't want to go to a
schoolhouse every day. Among young athletes and actors who have
studied through Nebraska are Michelle Kwan, the Olympic silver
medalist, and Lisa Bonet, a star of ``The Cosby Show.''
</P>
<P>
   While most students take courses to fill gaps in their school
records, some 3,400 students have received diplomas from Nebraska
since 1968. With the emergence of home schooling as a viable choice
for teen-agers, enrollment has increased almost 50 percent in the
last decade, according to James Schiefelbein, the Nebraska school's
principal. Today there are some 5,000 students at any given time,
representing more than 130 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the new wave in distance education, the school has begun
offering on-line courses and is developing a complete on-line,
four-year curriculum with the help of a $15 million grant from the
federal Department of Education. For now, students must take a mix
of Web and correspondence courses to meet diploma requirements,
which are 40 courses, or 200 course hours.
</P>
<P>
   A course can be completed in as little as five weeks of
intensive study, or stretched out for as long as a year.
Assignments are submitted by mail, fax or e-mail to 9 permanent
teachers, who grade them with help from 10 to 15 part-timers. When
written examinations are required, a proctor approved by the school
administers the tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids do very, very well post- secondary,'' Schiefelbein
said. ``They are not dependent on somebody to tell them what to do
and when, so they have a little bit of an advantage on their peers
because they have become more self-disciplined workers.''
</P>
<P>
   The school designed a program for Liverani, now 28, that allowed
him to finish his diploma requirements in a year and a half. From
his remote home, he sent assignments by mail, and they were graded
and returned that way. ``They managed to make you feel that you
were part of a school,'' said Liverani, who worked this past summer
in New York City as an intern at The Economist and is hoping for a
journalism job in Europe. ``I sent in a lot of material, and it
would be corrected. They would write a lot. That was important
because it was a continuous relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison Rizzuto, of Omaha, an Independent Study graduate,
remembers getting a big box of experiments in the mail for physical
science class. ``It's kind of funny, because you are in the kitchen
with a bunsen burner and you have to do all these experiments by
yourself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rizzuto, worried that attending a traditional school until 3
p.m. would derail her career, had convinced her parents to let her
take correspondence courses so she could sing in a folk-pop group
with her three older sisters.
</P>
<P>
   She studied from 8 a.m. to noon for four years, spending
afternoons practicing or touring the county and state fair circuit.
In May her group, Mulberry Lane, named for the street the sisters
grew up on, released a debut CD, ``Don't Cry _ Til You Get to the
Car,'' which they recorded themselves in their home studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned to be self-motivated,'' said Ms. Rizzuto, now 22.
``In correspondence school, every textbook you get, you have to
finish the whole thing. You read every page of the book.''

STANFORD COLLEAGUES RAISE CASE OF IMPRISONED CHINESE SCIENTIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A top Chinese missile scientist who has lived in the
United States since 1989 is in prison in China awaiting trial on a
charge of revealing state secrets, say colleagues at Stanford
University, where he was a research associate.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist, Hua Di, 62, was arrested in January during his
first trip home in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this decade, he was charged in absentia with divulging
secrets in some of his writings in the United States on Chinese
military issues. But in a meeting in Hong Kong last October,
Chinese security officials assured him that if he visited China he
would not face arrest, Hua told friends before he left for Beijing
on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 6 he was arrested, and in February he was charged with
divulging state secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The American Embassy in Beijing said Wednesday that it had
raised the issue with China on behalf of Hua, who is a permanent
resident of the United States and is seeking citizenship but
remains a Chinese citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford officials have also argued on Hua's behalf in letters
to President Jiang Zemin. Colleagues at the university's Center for
International Security and Cooperation, where Hua worked, say they
are deeply concerned about his health. Shortly before leaving for
Beijing he had surgery for a rare form of male breast cancer, and
he was to receive chemotherapy on his return to California last
winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has not commented publicly on the case.
Until recently not even relatives were allowed to see him, and
family members who have since had contact are not speaking to the
press. He has a lawyer, who has also declined to speak to the
press. Some people familiar with the case expect it to go to trial
in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Stanford pressed his case quietly in hopes that he
would be released. But this week, newspapers in Hong Kong and
Taiwan reported on his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   A child of China's Communist elite, Hua was educated in Moscow,
spent decades as a leading military scientist and in 1978 was given
a national prize for his contributions to China's ballistic missile
and satellite programs.
</P>
<P>
   To an unusual degree, Hua was allowed to maintain contacts with
experts abroad, and in 1980 and 1981 he spent more than a year in
the United States at the University of Washington and then at
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, senior Chinese officials authorized Hua to provide
advice to an American researcher on Chinese defense, John W. Lewis,
who was writing books on China's nuclear and missile programs,
Lewis said in an interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is the former director of the Center for International
Security and Cooperation and has worked closely with Hua for the
last nine years. The center has often served as an unofficial
conduit for sharing information between the Chinese and American
militaries.
</P>
<P>
   In this shadowy world of trading in semipublic defense
information, Hua became a major player, often saying he had special
contacts and information on Chinese programs, American defense
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1989, during China's crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, Hua was attending a conference
in the Soviet Union. He decided not to return to China _ he later
said he had played a role in the democracy movement and feared
arrest _ and moved to California when offered a position at the
Stanford research center.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s at Stanford, Hua wrote or was co-author of
articles on the development of China's ballistic missiles and other
sensitive topics. He collaborated with Lewis, for example, on an
unusually detailed account of China's submarine nuclear missile
program, said to be one of the items now held against him.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said Wednesday that Hua had never provided vital
information that was not already in the public domain or that he
had not been previously authorized to share.
</P>
<P>
   At two international conferences in 1993, Hua had friendly
meetings with top officials from China's military industries, Lewis
said. ``There was no sense that he'd done anything wrong,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For personal reasons, Hua wanted to return home, and late last
year he sought the October meeting in Hong Kong with Chinese
officials to see what his prospects were. He returned to Stanford
confident that he would have no problem, say friends who spoke with
him before his departure for Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Hua's arrest comes at a time when the Chinese military
establishment is in some turmoil, with Jiang forcing out formerly
powerful officers and attacking high-level corruption and outside
business activities.
</P>
<P>
   It could be, speculated one American defense expert who spoke on
condition of anonymity, that Hua's former contacts or protectors in
the military or defense industry here have lost power.

THE YEAR OF THE WOMAN IS A DISTANT ECHO FOR MANY WOMEN CANDIDATES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ The ``year of the woman'' seemed a distant
echo as Barbara Boxer swept through this old farm hub in her
volatile fight for re-election to the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But might an echo be enough for Boxer to stave off defeat?
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, the consummate liberal was one of four Democratic
women who surged into the Senate in 1992, more than doubling the
seats held by females.
</P>
<P>
   The victories resulted from a number of factors, but notably
from the disgust many women felt at the perceived unfairness in law
professor Anita Hill's treatment as she told the all-male Senate
Judiciary Committee about alleged sexual harassment by Supreme
Court nominee Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this moment when people saw a face of the U.S.
Senate that I think they hadn't seen before, which was how white
and how male it was,'' said Debbie Walsh, associate director of the
Center for the American Woman in Politics at Rutgers University's
Eagleton Institute of Politics. ``These men didn't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   When some female House members marched across Capitol Hill to
confront the Senate on its treatment of Hill, Boxer was in the
lead. Her subsequent election to the upper chamber was seen, in
part, as voter approval of her outspoken activism on women's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   As the Nov. 3 election nears, there is little sense in
California _ or nationally _ that female candidates enjoy any
special momentum this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot that's different,'' Walsh said, pointing to the
possibility that women will be disproportionately turned off by the
seamy revelations in President Clinton's sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   It would be rich political irony, because another factor in the
1992 success of female Democratic candidates was Clinton's sizable
``gender gap'' as he defeated Republican incumbent George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, wondered Walsh: ``Will they be so fed up with it
they just stay home?''
</P>
<P>
   Her view was echoed by Stephanie Cohen, spokeswoman for Emily's
List, a fund-raising organization for women who support abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women very strongly support Democrats,'' Cohen said. ``But
it's all a matter of will they vote.'' Like many analysts, Cohen
said the Republican takeover of the House and Senate in 1994 was
partly due to women who voted in 1992 staying away from the polls
two years later.
</P>
<P>
   This year, some of the most endangered incumbents are Democratic
women, including Boxer. She has been locked in a statistical dead
heat with her Republican opponent, state Treasurer Matt Fong.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Los Angeles Times poll found Boxer with a 5
percentage-point lead, a reversal of her standing a month ago. But
she still could not claim a clear majority of those surveyed, a
worrisome standing for an incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   If the ``year of the woman'' is to echo in Boxer's race, it is
likely to be in the gender disparity in her support that is
reflected in polls. The Times survey last week of likely voters
found Fong with an 11 percentage point lead among men and Boxer
with 19 percentage point lead among women.
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, surveys of likely voters show Democratic Sen. Carol
Moseley-Braun trailing Republican Peter Fitzgerald. Things are
apparently brighter for Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., also from the
Class of '92, who holds a seemingly firm lead over another woman,
Republican Rep. Linda Smith. And in Maryland, Democratic Sen.
Barbara Mikulski appears headed for a landslide victory in her bid
for a third term.
</P>
<P>
   Mikulski's easy trot to re-election, Walsh said, proves a woman
``can develop a safe seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Open Senate seats hold slim prospects for women. In the Ohio
race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. John Glenn, Republican
Gov. George Voinovich has maintained a lead in most polls over
Democrat Mary Boyle.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, women hold nine Senate seats. Six are Democrats and
three Republicans, including Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas. In
California and Maine, both senators are women. Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., was also elected in 1992, but to a partial,
unexpired term. She was narrowly re-elected in 1994 in a race that
saw former Houston energy heir Michael Huffington spend $37 million
of his own fortune roughing up Feinstein's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The varied and shifting landscape for women candidates is
related to more than turnout, argued Susan MacManus, a political
scientist at the University of South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women candidates at all levels are no longer novelties,''
MacManus said. ``Women (candidates) have gotten into the same
campaign mode as men, including negative ads,'' which are generally
considered more objectionable to female voters than men.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's television ads against Fong generally seek to paint her
challenger as a knee-jerk conservative out of step with
Californians. Fong's ads center more on himself and his vision for
the state. But with Boxer now ahead, his final ads may begin to
mirror the stance he takes in public appearances, where he relishes
jabbing at Boxer as a liberal who is _ yes _ out of step with
Californians.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the final days of the campaign, Boxer has outspent
Fong about 2-1 on television ads and the national Republican
senatorial committee has sent Fong an emergency infusion of about
$1 million. Republican pollster Ed Goeas said Boxer appeared to be
``pulling away'' from Fong based on her financial supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   At a community center in Stockton, Boxer argued: ``This election
is not about me, and it isn't about Mr. Fong.'' But later, a senior
California Democratic strategist countered: ``That's hooey. It's
still all about Barbara. She's the incumbent, and she has had
terribly high negatives (in polling). If she can succeed in making
it about Fong, she has a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, campaigning in a run-down Stockton neighborhood, was
painfully aware of the battle in which she is engaged. Before
racing off to another stop down the nation's richest agricultural
valley, Boxer said she must be resigned to tight races when ``you
stand up for the things we stand up for: a clean and healthy
environment, sensible gun control, women's right to choose,
education for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Stockton Mayor Joan Darrah seconded Boxer's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very outspoken,'' Darrah said. ``She takes hard stands
on issues that other candidates don't have the courage to take.''
</P>
<P>
   The translation: It's tough in California, as in many states,
for an out-and-out liberal like Boxer to win, and it may never be
with a big margin.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer won with 48 percent in 1992, running 6 percentage points
behind the more centrist Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   For the television cameras inside the community center, state
Sen. Patrick Johnston, a Stockton Democrat, praised Boxer as a
candidate who in 1992 ``promised to help'' and as a federal
official ``has delivered.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the Boxer caravan pulled out, he spoke with a reporter
about what he sees as the problems of ideology and image that his
Democratic colleague faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always going to be tough,'' said Johnston, an 18-year
state legislator. ``She's a liberal candidate in a state that's, on
balance, right down the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's another issue that Johnston said transcends Boxer's
voting record and is reflected in the sizable gender gap that polls
have found in the race. Johnston began by exclaiming: ``White,
middle-aged men ought to grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara's kind of in-your-face,'' Johnston said. ``Men who are
in your face don't seem to offend other men.'' But if a woman
politician is assertive, Johnston said, ``you have a chance of
getting ahead in a man's world, but you also bring out the male
hormonal resentment. Men just have a visceral reaction to Barbara
Boxer, and they don't have that problem with some pushy man.'' &QL;

EDITORS: This story is a sidebar to WOMEN-SENATE story for
Thursday, Oct. 29 By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In 1992, when Carol Moseley-Braun became the first
black woman elected to the U.S. Senate, she was a political
supernova.
</P>
<P>
   Now as she seeks re-election, Moseley-Braun is perhaps the most
imperiled Senate incumbent in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a star,'' said Paul M. Green, a political scientist at
Governors State University. ``Now it's gone. It's faded.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are manifold, but the bottom line seems clear:
Moseley-Braun was swept into office with strong support from white
suburban women, many of whom are nominal Republicans. Like other
female candidates in 1992, Moseley-Braun seemed to benefit from a
disquiet among women voters about the way the all-male, all-white
Senate handled Anita Hill's accusations of sexual harassment
against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need any more arrogant rich boys in the Senate, and
that's what this campaign is all about,'' Moseley-Braun said in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Moseley-Braun is trailing her Republican opponent _ a
really rich white guy, state Sen. Peter Fitzgerald _ by about 10
percentage points because recent polls show many of those women
have deserted her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's disconnected with her base,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the 1992 election, Moseley-Braun became ensnared in
activities that raised doubts about her political judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Under the apparent tutelage of her then-fiance, Moseley-Braun
visited Nigeria for consultations with the government of the
strongman Sani Abacha, whose murderous regime had been condemned by
the State Department. She returned for up to five additional
visits.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley-Braun was investigated for mishandling Medicaid
financial dealings relating to her mother. The Internal Revenue
Service has been delving into her tax filings, an inquiry for which
Moseley-Braun has refused to make public any documents.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the fall campaign progressed, Moseley-Braun's sister was
caught attempting to sell tickets to the senator's fund-raising
events while on her government job in the Cook County prosecutor's
consumer fraud division.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do this, sweetie,'' the senator told sister Marsha
Moseley over the telephone, as a local reporter listened in. ``Your
sister is particularly vulnerable to this kind of (thing). A
mistake like this can be a big damn deal.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the questions have persisted and are at the center of
Moseley-Braun's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has become the issue,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald, who has poured about $10 million of his inherited
banking fortune into the race, has pummeled Moseley-Braun about her
troubles in television ads and has compared her in public comments
to the leader of her party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carol Moseley-Braun is one of the only public officials whose
own scandals eclipse those of President Clinton,'' Fitzgerald said
recently.
</P>
<P>
   Until polls consistently showed her trailing Fitzgerald,
Moseley-Braun sought to tough out the criticism. But recently she
has begun to air an I'm-sorta-sorry television ad as part of her
underpowered media campaign. As of Sept. 31, the Democrat had
raised only $3.6 million, less than half her opponent's
self-financed war chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've made some mistakes and disappointed some people,''
Moseley-Braun says in the commercial. ``But I want you to know I've
always tried to do what's best for Illinois.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald laid out $7 million of his own money to win the
Republican primary, without the help of the GOP establishment,
which feared his hard-line views against abortion, federal
involvement in education and other sensitive issues would make it
more difficult for him to take on Moseley-Braun.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley-Braun has kept up the attack on Fitzgerald's affluence
and what she says are his extreme political views.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bring to the Millionaire Boys Club they call the U.S. Senate
a working person's perspective,'' she told a union audience
recently.
</P>
<P>
   As an analysis of the race in the Illinois edition of the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch said recently: ``This is turning out to be
exactly the 1998 the Democrats dreaded since 1992.'' &QL;

IN YEAR OF THE WOMAN, THE QUESTION IS `WHICH WOMAN?' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It's still the ``year of the woman'' in Washington
state. But which woman?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate race, only the third in U.S. history when both
major-party candidates were women, is a contest between:
</P>
<P>
   Democratic incumbent Patty Murray, who won her first term six
years ago on a campaign as ``a mom in tennis shoes,'' a distinct
alternative to the blue-suit image of the predominantly male
Congress. Back on the campaign trail this year, the
moderate-to-liberal Murray still sometimes appears in a windbreaker
or sweatshirt and her trademark Nikes.
</P>
<P>
   Republican challenger Linda Smith, a conservative congresswoman
from a district in southwestern Washington state who once declared:
``God put me in Congress.'' Smith, a favorite of the Christian
Coalition, has made her reputation as a maverick, refusing to
support Newt Gingrich for re-election as speaker and supporting
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates disagree on many major issues, including two
watched closely by female voters: abortion and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Smith opposes Medicaid funding of abortions for victims of rape
and incest, and once said: ``We don't kill children because their
father is a jerk.'' Murray opposes attempts to limit late-term
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Smith supports, and Murray opposes, the initiative on the
Washington state ballot Nov. 3 to abolish almost all state and
local governments' affirmative action programs for women and
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Murray has used a superior fund-raising effort to power herself
to what a recent Seattle Post-Intelligencer poll found to be a 13
percentage point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's internecine battles with party leaders, including Sen.
Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, chairman of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee, have not helped her in generating sufficient
campaign cash.
</P>
<P>
   Smith once said that McConnell was ``one belligerent person who
likes the laundering of political money.''
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, the NRSC belatedly decided to give Smith's
campaign $100,000 _ less than a fifth of the amount it could have
under federal law. Although Smith has refused to take money from
special-interest political action committees, she said she would
accept the donation from the national GOP group, much of whose
money comes from those same PACs.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's campaign immediately labeled Smith's decision the
``ultimate hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray's lead has surprised some of her fellow Democrats. Party
leaders in both Washingtons worried that Murray's profile in her
first term had been too subdued, that her impression on voters had
been so indistinct that a talented opponent would be free to
characterize her in an uncomplimentary way.
</P>
<P>
   But Murray seems to be using the low-key approach to her
advantage for what seems a very conscientious but laid-back
electorate. One of Murray's campaign brochures says she's working
``quietly and diligently'' for her constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Murray is, in the word's of the Seattle Weekly, ``the Senate's
self-designated normal person.''
</P>
<P>
   But in other ways, Murray has played the shrewd incumbent,
rejecting all but one debate with Smith. The single encounter was
taped on a Saturday night (because Smith said her religious beliefs
would not allow her to debate on Sunday) but delayed for broadcast
until low-viewership Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Murray also used her seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee
to wedge $30 million for teacher technology training into a
higher-education bill and was at the White House when President
Clinton signed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's proposal for federal funding to hire 100,000 new
teachers failed by one vote when it was considered separately, but
she worked to get the measure restored in last-minute negotiations
on the massive federal spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that kind of thing that catches the eye of key suburban
swing voters,'' said a Washington state Republican strategist.
``She has played the outsider-insider game very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of Smith's record in opposing some federal education
spending, Washington state's Democratic Party has aired television
ads of the Republican wearing a dunce cap. But even a local
Democrat said some of the claims in the ad are overstated or
wrong. &QL;

USE YOUR DRAGON BREATH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Friday Oct. 30)   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since I last wrote about feng shui (literally ``Bride of
Chucky'') earlier this year, I have been besieged (one letter) by
requests for a follow-up.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, as you probably don't recall, I appointed myself
official feng shui consultant for the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, a
building that couldn't have worse feng shui if a poltergeist
suddenly took up residence in its computer system. (Many employees
claim that one already has.)
</P>
<P>
   Feng shui, of course, is the traditional Chinese scam _ excuse
me, art _ of fiddling with one's living (or work) space so that all
is balanced, leading to happiness, health and wealth for feng shui
consultants like myself and, possibly, you, too.
</P>
<P>
   I argued, unsuccessfully, that the Herald-Tribune's feng shui
would be dramatically improved if management were relocated in our
cramped, dim, airless cubicles and the employees took over the
swank executive offices overlooking the McDonald's parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken me some time (three weeks probation) to recover
from that setback, but I'm now ready to impose my will (for a fat
fee, of course) on another feng shui-infested area, namely lawns
and gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Assisting me in this undertaking is a new book by feng shui guru
Lillian Too titled ``The Complete Illustrated Guide to Feng Shui
for Gardens'' (Element, $24.95.).
</P>
<P>
   Lawns and gardens are infested with feng shui, both of the good
and bad variety, Too said. The problem, of course, is knowing which
one you're dealing with, which is where the book comes in handy.
</P>
<P>
   According to the author, ``Identifying and dealing with poison
arrows that are present in the environment are an essential part of
feng shui practice.''
</P>
<P>
   While you may think that your lawn and garden is poison-arrow
free, there are a lot more out there than you might think.
</P>
<P>
   A poison arrow, Too says, is anything that is sharp, pointed,
straight or triangular, or that appears hostile or threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Using that definition, that might include a crack in your
driveway, sand spurs, a ``trespassers will be shot'' sign, your
neighbor's pit bull, or, simply, your neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Poison arrows are bad because they're made of Shar Chi or
``killing breath,'' which is to say pure negative energy.
</P>
<P>
   The reason your lawn and garden is full of weeds and fire ant
hills is not because you're a lazy, good-for-nothing slob who would
rather lie on the sofa, drinking beer and watching senior golf on
TV than risk heat stroke in the great outdoors; it's because
neighbors _ possibly people you've never even met _ are peppering
you with Shar Chi-tipped arrows faster than you can say ``Cupid
this!''
</P>
<P>
   What you need to do, Too says, is blast the Shar Chi negative
energy back from whence it came with the help of your own feng shui
``cannon'' (available through Sears, $49.99).
</P>
<P>
   If you're afraid of guns or simply worry that aiming a feng shui
cannon at your neighbor's pool deck will simply make matters worse,
you might want to begin collecting Sheng Chi, or green
dragonbreath.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Shar Chi, which travels in straight, lethal lines, Sheng
Chi meanders all over the place, and wherever it accumulates, good
things happen.
</P>
<P>
   Good sources of Shar Chi are bright flowers, goldfish ponds
(presumably one in which the goldfish are not floating belly-up),
turtles, children and dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking here, apparently, is that if you acquire all these
sources of Shar Chi you will be much too exhausted and/or broke to
notice whether someone is shooting poison arrows at you or not.
</P>
<P>
   Either that or it will lead to a Green Dragon's Breath war
between yourself and your neighbors, the resolution of which,
needless to say, will require the intervention of a high-priced
feng shui consultant such as myself.
</P>

DENTON DOCTOR LISTED ON ANTI-ABORTION WEB PAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SUSAN GILL VARDON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ During the past two years, Dr. Mary Smith has
grown accustomed to the sight of pickets waving signs and chanting
slogans in front of the Elm Street clinic where she performs about
seven abortions a week.
</P>
<P>
   But that hardly prepared Smith for what she saw this week as she
viewed the Nuremberg Files Web page and found herself referred to
as ``The blood red rose of Texas'' and among the nation's ``Third
Trimester Butchers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's appalling,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Web page, dripping with simulated gore, lists personal
information such as home addresses and telephone numbers for Smith
and other physicians who perform abortions, plus their driver's
license numbers and the names and birth dates of their spouses and
their children.
</P>
<P>
   It also highlights the names of doctors who have been killed or
wounded. After Dr. Barnett Slepian was slain Friday in his Amherst,
N.Y., kitchen by a sniper, a slash appeared through his name on the
Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Christian Gallery Web site, originated by the
Georgia-based Creator's Rights group, are concerned that the
Nuremberg Files could serve as a hit list for the more radical
element among anti-abortionists.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 53, said Tuesday that she refuses to let her prominent
inclusion on the Internet site intimidate her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I afraid for my life? Realistically, no,'' said Smith, who
has practiced in Denton since 1978. ``How can you live your life
that way? I am more afraid for my life driving to Dallas to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tend to think that people realize I'm a nice person,
and that they wouldn't want to shoot me,'' she said. ``My husband
says I'm naive.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who practices in Denton and Dallas, also said that she
has never performed a third-trimester abortion. Those procedures,
she said, are reserved for severe medical emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Creator's Rights Internet site lists abortion providers whom
group members want to face ``Nuremberg trials'' for performing
abortions, which they call ``crimes against humanity.'' The site
asks users to send personal or legal information about doctors who
perform abortions or others associated with abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Horsley, founder of the site, did not return two telephone
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan O'Toole, a member of the Creator's Rights group, told
The Boston Globe this week that the violence will continue until
``Roe v. Wade is reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI officals said this week that they will review what role, if
any, the group played in the circumstances leading to Slepian's
slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Price, president of Texans United for Life, cautioned that
Creator's Rights is ``obviously on the lunatic fringe of the
pro-life movement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole battle that we fight is a battle to win the public
mind and heart on this issue, and when these things happen like
this, it makes that very difficult,'' said Price, who lives in the
Dallas suburb of Carrolton. ``It goes so far against the goals that
98 or 99 percent of the people in the pro-life movement have.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said she suspects that North Texas anti-abortion groups _
particularly the Denton-based Life Dynamics group _ gave her
personal information to the Internet site. She said other, more
prominent, physicians in the Metroplex and other areas are not
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am, this little doctor with a little practice, and they
can't get rid of me. They are frustrated; and that's why I'm on the
Internet,'' she said. ``It's not because I am well-known or do a
lot of abortions in Denton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why they targeted me.''
</P>
<P>
   Life Dynamics, which lobbies to restrict access to abortion and
assists attorneys on behalf of women injured in abortions, operates
the Susan B. Anthony Women's Center. Last year, the center moved
next door to Smith's Denton Health Services for Women clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Life Dynamics President Mark Crutcher declined to comment on
Smith's assertions unless the Star-Telegram met certain demands.
</P>
<P>
   The National Federation for Abortion, an association of 350
abortion clinics, has asked its attorneys to determine whether it
can take action to remove some of the personal information from the
Nuremberg Files Web site, spokeswoman Stephanie Mueller said. The
attorneys are expected to report back in a week, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see it as an invitation to intimidation or harassment or
violence,'' Mueller said. ``There is absolutely no reason to put
personal, private information on a Web site unless it is to evoke
the kind of action that occurred Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven people have died nationwide because of anti-abortion
violence, she said. The victims were three physicians, a client
escort, two clinic staff members and a security guard. Nationwide,
15 abortion-related homicide attempts have occurred since 1991,
Mueller said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the protests at her clinic and her listing on the
Internet site, Smith said she has never had negative telephone
calls. First United Methodist Church of Denton, where she sings in
the choir, has been picketed. But church leaders continue to back
her, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never felt so supported,'' Smith said. ``There are a
lot of older women in the choir, and they are really behind me. I
don't think I could do it without the support.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion has been a prominent issue this year in Denton. In
January, Commissioners Court approved an anti-abortion resolution
that condemns the 25th anniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark
Roe vs. Wade decision.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was sponsored by Commissioners Jeff Krueger and
Scott Armey, Republicans who said it reflects their political,
personal and religious beliefs. Krueger brought up the proclamation
at the behest of resident Tom Cyr, a fellow member of Immaculate
Conception Catholic Church and a Life Dynamics employee.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Krueger called the Nuremberg Files Web site ``totally
outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't approve of the treatment that has been given to Dr.
Smith, although I don't condone what she does for her profession,''
Krueger said. ``That's not the style that I would fight abortion
and abortion laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey said the Web site could create a public safety problem for
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the senseless murder of any individual is completely
condemnable, and if there's anything that we can do through the
county through our Sheriff's Department or through any type of law
enforcement to help protect Dr. Smith, we're going to take whatever
measure we can to do so,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the daughter of a fundamentalist minister, said that she
saw the results of back alley abortions while she was in medical
school and that she considers the role of giving women a choice ``a
mission.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I do, and I will probably do it until I'm 85 or
until I can't see,'' she said. ``The more they picket me, the
longer I'll be here.''

80 EXPERIMENTS ON TAP FOR DISCOVERY ASTRONAUTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Discovery's seven astronauts plan to tackle more than 80 science
experiments in disciplines as diverse as astronomy, biotechnology,
entomology and agriculture as well as medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle is scheduled to blast off Thursday at 2 p.m. EST,
climbing to an altitude of 345 miles, more than twice as high as
John Glenn's Friendship 7 capsule soared in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   The large number of activities planned by the six-man, one-woman
shuttle crew will make the flight much more than a joy ride for the
77-year-old astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was happy to come fly with us, obviously '' said Discovery
commander Curt Brown. ``But he may not be happy after a few days in
orbit. We plan to work him to the bone.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn has trained to participate in 15 or so of the experiments,
stationed in a closet-sized module called Spacehab, which is linked
to the shuttle's crew compartment by a tunnel. He will also likely
be called upon to assist his crew mates in other ways over the
mission's nine days.
</P>
<P>
   One of the shuttle's primary payloads is a reusable satellite
called Spartan that has been equipped with a pair of telescopes.
Using the shuttle's 50-foot long robot arm, the astronauts plan to
deploy Spartan for free-flying, pre-programmed observations of the
sun's corona or outer atmosphere, whose energetic discharges
influence climate and electronic communications on the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery will soar ahead of Spartan, then rendezvous for
retrieval by the robot arm after a two-day separation.
</P>
<P>
   A similar test was aborted last November when another shuttle
crew improperly activated the satellite, then sent it into a tumble
when it made a hasty attempt at recovery.
</P>
<P>
   During Spartan's recovery, the satellite will allow NASA
engineers to test an automated rendezvous and docking system it is
developing for use by cargo capsules traveling to the new
international space station.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's unusually lofty orbit matches that of the Hubble
Space Telescope, permitting the shuttle to test a new cooling
system, data recorder and computer destined for installation aboard
the observatory by astronauts in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The cooling device relies on tiny pumps designed to spin at
400,000 revolutions per minute to circulate neon to chill an
infrared camera on the Hubble. It will replace a less suitable
cooling device that relied on frozen nitrogen.
</P>
<P>
   The infrared camera allows the Hubble to observe the most
distant reaches of the universe as well as peer into the dust disks
that surround prospective planet-forming star systems.
</P>
<P>
   An experiment called Hearts in Space will employ a mechanical
device to demonstrate why the hearts of astronauts shrink in space.
Researchers believe the muscle shrinks because the blood that
courses through it is weightless
</P>
<P>
   A series of biotechnology experiments are designed to improve
the medicines used in the treatment of diabetes, colon cancer,
Chagas disease as well as grass and pollen allergies. Others in the
category will examine potential techniques for improving grain crop
production with the reduced use of polluting fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
   Oysters, toads and fish will serve as subjects in an experiment
that records the impulses between the gravity sensing organs and
the brain as the animals adjust to weightlessness. Initiated as an
experiment to study how astronauts adjust to the absence of
gravity, the results could also prove useful in explaining the
balance disorders of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle will carry eight experiments devised by students
from Argentina and Italy as well as the United States.
</P>
<P>
   One developed by students from a Lanham, Md., high school will
study dozens of roaches, some in the larvae and others in the adult
phase, as they develop in weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   The insects are enclosed in a container in Discovery's payload
bay where they will not come in contact with the astronauts. &QL;

 &HT;    BUSH BROTHERS' FORMULA MAY BRING HISPANICS BACK TO THE GOP
 &HT;    650&AMP;add. With LATINO-VOTERS-DATA. For release Saturday, Oct. 31.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican strategists are watching the
gubernatorial campaigns of the Bush brothers in Texas and Florida
for clues on how to woo Hispanic voters in the next presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And some Democrats are worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen Republicans who just innately understand that
vote the way the Bush brothers do,'' said Celinda Lake, a leading
Democratic strategist.
</P>
<P>
   Lake, part of a team that conducts a series of ``Battleground''
election-year polls, said that if the GOP follows the lead of Jeb
and George W. Bush, Hispanics will be ``a real battleground vote''
in the 2000 presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Ed Goeas, Lake's ``Battleground'' poll
partner, is not as certain. He believes it may take his party a
decade to repair relations with Hispanics that have been damaged by
polarizing battles over immigration, welfare, welfare, affirmative
action and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is ... a majority of Hispanics have now come
to believe that Republicans would rather have an America that did
not include them,'' Goeas's Washington-based firm, the Tarrance
Group, concluded in a strategy paper distributed to GOP leaders and
congressional candidates this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Tarrance Group has been studying Latino voting trends for 10
years, long before most political strategists in either party
recognized the demographic and political tidal wave that Hispanics
represent. But until recently, its advice that ``conservatism can
be compassionate without losing its conviction'' has largely been
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with the Bush brothers, however. Their campaigns are
expected to become models for a GOP strategy to win back a group of
voters who were solidly Republican in the glory days of Ronald
Reagan _ and thereby reclaim the White House.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush won only 28 percent of the Hispanic vote when he
was elected governor of Texas in 1994. But since then, he has
promoted issues of importance to Hispanics _ education and economic
opportunity, in particular _ and has stood up to anti-immigration
legislation in the GOP-led Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Today Bush _ who Spanish in campaign radio ads and regularly
appears in Hispanic media _ is overwhelmingly popular with all
Texans, including Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   His brother Jeb has had an easier time of it in Florida, where
most Hispanics are of Cuban descent, overwhelmingly Republican and
not as attuned to immigration issues as the Hispanics of Mexican
descent in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In his unsuccessful campaign for governor in 1994, Jeb Bush got
71 percent of the Cuban-American vote. But he is not taking that
vote for granted this year. His campaign even has a
Spanish-language Web site.
</P>
<P>
   And on the issues, he sounds more like his brother in Texas than
himself in 1994. The hard-edged conservatism is mostly gone,
replaced with a unifying message of education and economic
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats question whether simply modeling a presidential
campaign on the Bush brothers can undo the hard feelings caused by
the GOP's treatment of Hispanic voters since 1992. It may take one
of the brothers themselves: George, who is quickly emerging as the
front-runner for the 2000 GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are Hispanic voters up for grabs this year? No, because the
Republicans are doing everything they can to make Hispanics mad,''
said Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, the general chairman of the
Democratic National Committee. ``Republicans don't even want to
count them in the census. We couldn't have had a greater gift in
terms of getting the Hispanic vote than what the Republican Party's
record has been.''
</P>
<P>
   Goeas's strategy paper puts it in less harsh terms:
``Republicans should realize that ten years have passed and their
image among the Hispanic community has not improved. And it may
take that long to simply turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began in 1992 with the anti-immigrant tirades of Pat
Buchanan as he challenged incumbent George Bush for the Republican
presidential nomination. That same year, Bill Clinton, in defeating
Bush, became the first Democrat in four presidential elections to
win a majority of Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing has driven Hispanic voters into the Democratic Party
more than California Gov. Pete Wilson's championing of ballot
measures beginning in 1994 to cut off state benefits to illegal
immigrants, outlaw the state's affirmative action programs and
eliminate bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   As Wilson was waging his campaign, the Republican Party took
control of Congress and immediately began pushing a similar agenda,
including a proposal to cut benefits for illegal and legal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, the GOP national leadership has taken steps
to improve its standing with Hispanics. The Republican National
Committee now has a Hispanic ``outreach'' program, for example, and
congressional leaders, once advocates of ``English only''
legislation, routinely translate their weekly national broadcasts
into Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP is currently fighting to prevent scientific sampling
of the population in the next census, a procedure designed to
prevent an undercount of minorities and ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   A ``report card'' this month by the National Hispanic Leadership
Agenda gave House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia a ``zero''
rating in support of Hispanic issues. House Democratic Leader Dick
Gephardt of Missouri scored 75.
</P>
<P>
   And a generic congressional ballot test by the Tarrance Group
found Hispanics supporting Democrats over Republicans by a 20-point
margin, 52 percent to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, the number of Latinos registered to vote has risen
30 percent, to 6.6 million, and 75 percent of them have registered
as Democrats in states that have party registration. In California,
home to half of the nation's Hispanics, Latino registration has
grown 600,000 since 1994, to 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, a survey earlier this year by the Thomas Rivera Policy
Institute, a leading Hispanic research institution, found evidence
of hope that the Republican Party could recover lost ground. More
than two-thirds of Latino voters in California and more than half
in Texas and Florida told the institute's researchers that their
party affiliation is weak.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats ``should be asking how strong the Latino shift to
their party is,'' said Harry Pachon, the institute's president.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Goeas's associate, Geoff Becker, contends that Hispanics
are ``strong believers in family, church and hard work'' and hold
many of the ``same virtues and values'' as Republicans. Winning
them back will require a campaign emphasizing tax relief,
bolstering education and ``standing up against immorality in our
community,'' Becker said.

   There is a song-and-dance number on Martin Short's 1989
television special, ``I, Martin Short, Goes Hollywood,'' that his
friend Dave Thomas believes exemplifies a central truth about
Short. It is a number in which the comic actor appears as an
unpainted wooden fence, wearing little more than a fig leaf and a
few slats.
</P>
<P>
   He is playing Dale O'Day, a supposedly ``legendary dancer's
dancer'' from the 1940s, who, the viewer is also told, would later
meet a tragic and untimely death crushed by furniture while dancing

   In the scene, Short skips, prances and gambols across the stage,
his slats flapping, then breaks into wild dancing. He leaps onto
hay bales, jumps between them, pirouettes _ all the while singing a
song called ``Man in the Moon'' to a small boy who has offered to
ask the man in the moon for some paint to cover the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a classic I'm-Mr.-Showbiz song,'' recalled Thomas, an
actor who worked with Short in the Second City comedy troupe in
Toronto and on the television show ``SCTV Network.'' Thomas said he
thinks of Short as ``Mr. Showbiz'' _ a performer who can also sing,
dance, be funny, be serious and be dramatic, but who ``is
absolutely driven to entertain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been very difficult, in film and television and
the various mediums that he's performed in, for the vessel to
properly contain him,'' Thomas said. ``The best outlet I've ever
seen for Marty is the stage, where he can launch himself like a
rocket at the audience and give them in 3-D the full benefit of his
insanely manic energy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway lately, Short has been lifting off every night in
previews of the Roundabout Theater Company revival of ``Little
Me,'' the 1962 musical comedy for which Neil Simon wrote the book.
</P>
<P>
   In the show, which opens on Nov. 12 at the Criterion Center
Stage Right, he plays not one but eight men in the life of Belle
Poitrine, nee Schlumpfert, the curvaceous beauty turned tell-all
memoirist from Drifter's Row (portrayed by Faith Prince).
</P>
<P>
   As those he works with know, Short is a master at appearing
spontaneous in a completely scripted situation and can keep an
audience wondering what will happen next. It is something he has
worked on, especially in theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the consistency,'' he says, about his early years on
stage. ``I loved almost the discipline of duplication and the grand
scheme of making it fresh, making it appear like I had just made it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Short has his work cut out for him: there is Noble
Eggleston, an overachieving blueblood who cannot marry Belle until
she improves her social position; Amos Pinchley, an 88-year-old
Scrooge; Val du Val, a famous French singer; Otto Schnitzler, an
autocratic Hollywood director, and assorted others, including one
of the Buchsbaum brothers, vaudeville bookers.
</P>
<P>
   At one point the actor winds up a scene by expiring, as the
octogenarian Pinchley; rolls backward while the cast moves in front
of him; is dressed on his hands and knees in a new wig, hat, cigar,
glasses, jacket and padding; then materializes, behind a newspaper,
as a Buchsbaum _ all in 25 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Buchsbaum brothers were designed to give this insane actor
who has chosen to do seven roles a break,'' said Short over dinner
in a Japanese restaurant near the midtown Manhattan studio where he
was rehearsing. Despite the fact that he chose to skip the break
and take on one of the brothers (Michael McGrath plays the other),
he came across as thoughtful and quite sane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' he said, ``the looks will be different and the
attitude and the vocal quality from character to character. I've
always been drawn to the kind of characterization that is very
three-dimensional. One of my idols is Peter Sellers in
`Strangelove,' where you literally saw him play three roles but it
could have been three different actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just putting in funny teeth. It was fully evolved,
three-dimensional in appearance and behavior and position of
shoulders and a way of walking and talking. It was a totally
different person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Me'' seems designed for Short, who made his name in the
early 1980s on ``SCTV'' and ``Saturday Night Live'' inventing an
entire cast of characters, like Jackie Rogers Jr., the albino
entertainer; Irving Cohen, the geriatric Tin Pan Alley songwriter,
and Ed Grimley, the endearing geek with the Dairy Queen-style coif.
</P>
<P>
   His humor capitalizes on the idiosyncrasies of character,
attitude and behavior. He is an admirer of the physicality of Dick
Van Dyke, the seamless realism of Lucille Ball. Actors describe him
as fearless and uninhibited. Christopher Guest, the actor and
director, calls him ``a clown in the best sense,'' unafraid to use
his physical talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we're doing `Little Me' is because of Martin
Short,'' said its director, Rob Marshall, who directed the actor
last year in the acclaimed Encores concert version of the 1968
``Promises, Promises,'' with its book by Simon and music by Burt
Bacharach. ``Marty is one of those rare individuals who is a true
musical-theater star, and he can cross over from film to television
to musical theater effortlessly.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Short has done relatively little musical theater in the last
20 years. He began performing in musicals in Toronto during the
1970s but spent most of the 80s and 90s working in television and
film, doing sitcoms, sketch comedy, specials, an animated series
and movies, some critically admired but commercial flops.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently has he resurfaced on stage. Before ``Promises,
Promises,'' he had starred in 1993 with Bernadette Peters in ``The
Goodbye Girl.'' The Broadway musical version of Simon's 1977 film
received mixed reviews, though Short was highly praised.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great strengths he has,'' said Simon, ``is that he
is extremely warm and likable, which one doesn't always find with
other comedians. The other thing that he has the ability to do and
that no one has been able to do who has played this part is to
sing, and to sing really well.''
</P>
<P>
   So why hasn't Short done more musical theater on Broadway?
</P>
<P>
   The reasons, he said, are both personal and professional. First,
he lives with his wife, Nancy Dolman, and their three children,
ages 14, 12 and 9, in Los Angeles, not New York, and he would
consider himself to have failed in life if he were ever to look
back and say: ``I have four Tonys. If only I'd been there for the
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But his career choices also reflect the state of musical theater
today. The increasing dominance of television and film, combined
with the evolution of popular taste and the enormous expense of
mounting Broadway shows, have helped dry up the supply of the kind
of larger-than-life roles that were written for comic actors like
Sid Caesar, Ethel Merman and Bert Lahr.
</P>
<P>
   Musical comedies used to be much more star-driven, said Bert
Fink, a vice president at the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we have lost, to a certain degree,'' Fink said, ``is
the star vehicle. One way the British invasion of the 1980s
transformed the landscape is that musicals like ``Cats,'' ``Les
Miserables'' and ``The Phantom of the Opera'' are not about the
stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the somewhat unexpected directions his career has
taken, Short talked over dinner about the freedom of theater, the
forgivingness of television, the frustrations of film. At 48, he
has the animated features, rubbery athleticism and eager
expressiveness of a small boy.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived at the restaurant wearing sneakers, jeans and an
oversized plaid shirt _ at 5 feet 8 inches tall, a puckish figure
with a large angular nose and humorous mouth. Though he is known as
an almost perfect talk-show guest, brimming with stories and
impressions, he spoke quite seriously about his family, his life
and his work.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Movies are a director's medium, not an actor's, Short said. A
film might take years and $40 million to make, and end up seeming
less funny than 15 minutes spent promoting it on the ``Late Show
With David Letterman.'' By contrast, he said, an actor can do
``Saturday Night Live,'' the sketch bombs and the next week he is
on the show again.
</P>
<P>
   ``To work in comedy, you have to accept that your percentage of
failure is going to be high,'' Short said, estimating that 60
percent to 70 percent of what a comic actor does will not be a
commercial success. ``You have to forget that part, or you would
never do insane things.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of five children, Short grew up in Hamilton,
Ontario. His father was an Irish immigrant who became a steel
company executive; his mother was the concertmistress of the
Hamilton Philharmonic Orchestra. Everyone in his family was funny,
Short said; he considers himself a beneficiary of ``trickle-down
comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, he became fascinated by show business. At 14, he was
recording ``The Martin Short Show'' on a tape recorder in his
bedroom in the attic of the family home. He would ``chat with''
celebrity guests like Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, dub in
applause, then air the show for his family at 8:30 p.m. every other
Monday. He was alternating with Andy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Taping was not uncommon in the Short household. Family members
regularly recorded funny interviews and instant musicals. At 16,
Short taped most of Christmas. Within four years, both of his
parents were dead; his oldest brother had died when Short was 12.
</P>
<P>
   He still plays the tapes around Christmas, the sound of his
childhood piped in through speakers in the ceiling of his home
office in Pacific Palisades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this philosophy about losing loved ones,'' Short said.
``If you start out with this idea that we're all going to die, the
next step is to say, `Hi, Mom,' every day and you put pictures all
over the place and you listen to tapes. I never felt that these
people, part of my childhood, ever went away. They never left.''
</P>
<P>
   Short studied social work at McMaster University in Hamilton and
acted constantly in campus productions. He says he had not
considered acting as a profession: ``To me, actors lived in the
United States.'' But during his senior year, a friend, Eugene Levy,
already an actor, encouraged him. His first audition was for the
original Toronto production of ``Godspell.''
</P>
<P>
   The auditions were held in a Masonic temple. Gilda Radner, yet
to be discovered, arrived in pigtails and sang
``Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah.'' Short sang ``My Funny Valentine.'' They were
both hired, along with Paul Shaffer, now David Letterman's
bandleader, who was there to play the piano for a girlfriend and
ended up being enlisted as musical director. Victor Garber played
Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The production was a hit and Short began a seven-year stint of
acting in Toronto _ everything from musical theater and Shakespeare
on radio to industrial films. He spent two of those years as a
member of the Second City comedy troupe, from which Ms. Radner and
Dan Aykroyd had recently moved to ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Short decided to expand his career _ ``As we Canadians
say, `Do the South' '' _ and went to New York, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``My real plan was to do theater,'' he recalled. But, he said,
when he looked at theater in New York in the late 70s and early
80s, ``I didn't really see a place for me there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had gone into the `Chorus Line'/`Cats' phase of Broadway,
which was a far cry from Ray Bolger, say, or Nathan Lane. I felt a
little bit like, `Gee, isn't it a drag that I wasn't born 15 years
earlier.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What did present itself was television. He was offered a major
role in ``The Associates,'' a sitcom produced by James L. Brooks,
the co-creator of ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show.'' When that was
canceled, more offers followed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Short joined ``SCTV,'' the show that is considered to
have launched the careers of everyone from John Candy and Harold
Ramis to Catherine O'Hara.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to ``Saturday Night Live'' in 1984, stayed one year and
has been credited with helping to save the show from possible
extinction. Then he quit, saying he was leaving to make movies and
perhaps a Broadway musical.
</P>
<P>
   The movies got made. So did the television specials. But by
1987, he and his family had settled in Los Angeles and by 1989,
with the children and numerous professional commitments, it was
becoming increasingly difficult to pick up and move to New York for
the commitment a Broadway show required.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had offered me `Forum' instead of Nathan Lane _ which
they didn't, but had they _ I probably would not have been able to
do it,'' Short said, about the 1996 Broadway revival of ``A Funny
Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.'' ``I would have been lined
up for movies, and also I would have said, `I can't move to New
York for a year.' '' As only one part of the Roundabout season,
``Little Me'' requires a commitment of four months, Short said.
</P>
<P>
   Simon has extensively reworked ``Little Me,'' which he adapted
from the novel of the same name by Patrick Dennis. It was Simon's
first musical book, which he wrote originally for Sid Caesar (with
Cy Coleman and Carolyn Leigh as the composer and lyricist).
</P>
<P>
   He remembered things that had not worked in the original
production and the short-lived 1982 revival on Broadway. ``When you
do a show again, you rewrite it,'' Simon said. ``You're getting
another chance at it.'' About specific changes, he said simply,
``There are 120 pages of things.'' But he stressed that he wanted
to capitalize on the talents of Short.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said of his friend: ``He's got more than his share of
life energy bursting out of his body. Where else except in person
and on stage would you want to see that? Why would you want to
record it on tape or flatten it out on celluloid when you can see
it in real life?''

 &HT;    texture? Either way, the kernel of the matter is that we love
popcorn
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   t was a classic first date. A movie. Some popcorn. But Diane
Pfeifer wanted to make something very clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my date that I wanted my own bucket of popcorn. I don't
share,'' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine,'' he retorted. ``Then I won't share my secret recipe for
Mexican popcorn.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfeifer, 48, now a married mother of two in Peachtree Hills,
never saw him again, and she didn't get the recipe. But because she
had a daily popcorn habit, she set out to create her own spicy
mixtures.
</P>
<P>
   When she was done, she had concocted more than 100 ways to
season and savor popcorn, which she compiled into a book she
self-published, called ``For Popcorn Lovers Only'' (Strawberry
Patch, $9.95). The book has sold more than 40,000 copies, proving
that there are more partners for this classic snack than butter and
salt.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that the way with popcorn? Once you get started, it's hard
to stop, which is probably why Americans eat 1.1 billion pounds of
it every year, according to the Popcorn Institute.
</P>
<P>
   And fall is the peak period for home popcorn consumption,
perhaps because we're prone to curling up on the couch with a big
bowl of it to watch the new TV shows or piling up the popcorn balls
for the kids' Halloween party.
</P>
<P>
   But popcorn isn't just for the movie theater or living room
anymore. It's a favorite office snack and is even showing up in
some upscale restaurants, such as dish in Virginia-Highland, where
popcorn with rosemary and pine nuts is a popular appetizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much the taste of popcorn, but the texture,''
declares Andy Smith, author of ``Popped Culture: A Social History
of Popcorn in America,'' to be released by the University of South
Carolina Press early next year. ``It's really just a vehicle for
carrying salt, butter and lots of other things we like.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say there are no differences among popcorns.
Inside each kernel is a bit of moisture, and when that moisture is
heated, it explodes, causing the kernel to pop. Moisture levels can
vary among popcorns, and so can the expansion rate. ``Normal
popcorn expands 30 to 40 times the original size of the kernal,
while gourmet popcorns expand to about 50 times,'' Smith explains.
</P>
<P>
   And the way it's cooked can also make a difference. In fact,
popcorn has probably been around for centuries, but it wasn't until
folks started figuring out a convenient way to pop it that it
became popular.
</P>
<P>
   Smith says the notion that Native Americans ate popcorn
regularly is false, largely because the only way they had to make
it was to throw cobs onto the embers of a dying fire and eat what
few popped kernels they could capture. The first wire popcorn
poppers came onto the scene in the 1830s, but they were often
loosely constructed and the handles would fly off in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Methods of popping corn continued to improve, but the snack was
popular mainly in rural areas until movie theaters, desperate for
profits during the Depression, began to offer it as a sideline.
(Popcorn remains a moneymaker for movie theaters today, with most
selling it for about 10 times what it costs them to make it, Smith
says.)
</P>
<P>
   Popcorn moved from theater to living room with the advent of
television and convenience packaging. But the real popcorn
revolution came with the microwave oven. In fact, popcorn was the
first food that researchers in the 1940s aimed microwaves at,
leading to the development of the microwave oven. Today, sales of
microwave-ready popcorn regularly top $240 million a year, the
Popcorn Institute reports.
</P>
<P>
   Corn popped on the stovetop heats from the outside of the kernel
inward; in the microwave oven, the reverse is true. Smith prefers
stovetop popcorn, because it's crustier. And he likes to use fresh
ingredients for seasoning rather than the shelf-stable and
sometimes fake popcorn flavorings.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeifer likes fresh ingredients too. Her favorite is a mixture
of crushed garlic and fresh, grated Parmesan cheese. Other quick
ways to jazz up popped corn are with a sprinkle of Old Bay
Seasoning mix or taco seasoning mix, adding a few drops of sesame
oil to the cooking oil, or adding a tablespoonful of sugar to the
pan just as the corn begins to pop.
</P>
<P>
   On page H6, we offer recipes for more elaborate seasonings,
including Santa Fe Trail Mix and Cranberry Popcorn. So come on _
there's no better time to get popping!

   GA-SCHOOLSAFETY _ ATLANTA _ School safety has been, or is, the
subject of a number of recent panels and summits, from a White
House summit Oct. 15 to a state Senate panel that brings its series
of statewide hearings to the Capitol tonight from 7-9 p.m. What
such studies are finding is that school violence, dramatized by a
series of sensational shootings, is relatively rare, but more
everyday problems of disruptive students made for a serious area of
disagreement. Teachers say younger, elementary-age students are
more of a problem than older students, but some parents say they
feel cut off by schools when their child is accused of being
disruptive, especially if race is involved. This experience of many
parents has been heard repeatedly by the panel meeting tonight,
according to convener Sen. Vincent Fort (D-Atlanta) and Suzanne
Dion, a Georgia PTA lobbyist who was also at the local downlink of
the White House summit. (Cumming, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 &HT;    Teenage bluesman awaits seasoning
 &HT;    By Russ Devault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jonny Lang traded normal teenhood for the touring musician life,
but no one's going to suggest that the 17-year-old
guitarist-vocalist sold his soul to the devil to be a bluesman.
Lang alludes to such deals on ``The Levee,'' one of the strong cuts
on his second album, but he needs seasoning. It would be
inappropriate to suggest that Lang's youth and lack of a
hardscrabble background preclude membership in the authentic blues
fraternity, although such greats as Muddy Waters and B.B. King were
paying their dues in down-and-dirty Delta clubs during their teen
years.
</P>
<P>
   Lang's strength, for now at least, is that he is a great
technician who shuns speed for ringing or wistful notes (``Breakin'
Me,'' ``Leaving to Stay''). His grown-up vocals often belie his
youth to such a degree that you'll look at the liner notes to see
who's singing. But what is readily apparent is that he needs less
production, more consistent songs and some play-for-myself
absorption next time out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wander This World''
</P>
<P>
   Jonny Lang. A&AMP;M. 12 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Teen blues star needs seasoning to match his
technique.

   Well, this is the thud everyone expected. But at least one
helpful thing can be gleaned: Now we have a pretty good idea of who
contributes to the Fugees and who seems to be along for the ride.
``But what about `Ghetto Supastar?''' ask those who couldn't escape
the Pras/ODB/Mya hit of the summer. Think about it: Can you
remember more than the hook? Exactly. Pras obviously has an ear for
a chorus or an unexpected sample (Weather Report's ``Birdland'' on
``Yeah 'Eh Yeah 'Eh'') that works. What doesn't is this dubious
rapper's one-dimensional delivery of very little that's memorable.

   British pop weirdo Robyn Hitchcock's upcoming concert film,
directed by Jonathan Demme (``Beloved,'' ``Stop Making Sense''),
finds its subject still indulging his career-long passion for
affixing surreal images to delicate, folk-based tunes. Live, the
stream of consciousness overflows into Hitchcock's stage routine,
as he chatters on about ``spleens a-go-go'' and churches full of
carcasses. In between these lengthy, sometimes tiresome spiels, we
get efficiently rendered versions of such ``hits'' as ``I'm Only
You,'' from his 1985 masterpiece, ``Fegmania!''

</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   One day Derek Trucks will make an album that both equals and
reflects his phenomenal talent as a guitarist. A true prodigy, the
Jacksonville native is part Southern rocker (uncle Butch is a
founding Allman Brother), part traditional blues aesthete _ and
wholly gifted at raw slide wizardry. Yet, at 19, he's still
learning how to forge a musical concept. This sophomore release
lacks the focus to properly show off Trucks' burning solo style.
It's a hodgepodge, needlessly saddled with guest vocals (ex-Allman
guitar pyro Warren Haynes is a decent blues growler, but it's pure
shivery steel strings I'd rather hear recount Son House's ``Death
Letter''). The selection of vintage blues and funk material, and
some jazz-tinged originals, speaks to Trucks' good taste. He just
needs to pare away the trappings.

 &HT;    Jazz it up or eat it plain: Popcorn can go from holiday table to
trail
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing quite satisfies like a bowl of piping hot popcorn. And
thankfully, it's also pretty healthy. Popped without oil it's about
27 calories a cup. Using a little oil will bring it up to about 41
calories a cup. And thankfully, there are a number of ways to spice
it up without adding calories and fat.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there are some awfully tasty ways to eat popcorn
that make it less healthful, but oh so delicious.
</P>
<P>
   Keep the basics in mind. If you are popping in the microwave,
simply follow instructions on the bag or the popper.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're enticed to return to the stove top, here's a
little refresher. Heat a 3-quart, covered saucepan over high heat
for 2 minutes; pour 2 tablespoons cooking oil into the pan, adding
more if needed to cover the bottom; lower heat to medium-high and
add 3 to 4 kernels of corn. When they pop, add a 1/2 cup popcorn,
cover and shake pan continuously. Just like with microwave popcorn,
listen. When you hear the popping slow or stop, it's ready. You
should have 9-11 cups.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best oils to use is canola, since it's lowest in
saturated fat and imparts no flavor. But you can also use olive oil
(not extra-virgin), corn, peanut, macadamia and some flavored oils.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the best ways to season popped corn is to put it in a
brown paper bag while still hot. Add the seasonings and shake.

<P>
   Cooking time: 10-12 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooling time: 10-15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Weren't caramel and popcorn just made for each other? We
borrowed this recipe from Atlantan Diane Pfeifer's ``For Popcorn
Lovers Only'' (Strawberry Patch, $9.95).
</P>
<P>
   8cups popcorn
</P>
<P>
   3/4cup packed brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup light corn syrup
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1/8teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1cup unsalted peanuts, optional
</P>
<P>
   Place popcorn in large greased bowl. Combine brown sugar, corn
syrup, butter and salt in 1-quart saucepan over medium heat. Bring
to boil, stirring constantly. Continue without stirring to
hard-ball stage: When it reaches 250 degrees or when a small amount
of boiling mixture dropped into very cold water forms a hard ball.
Stir in vanilla. Pour over popcorn. Stir to coat evenly. Toss in
peanuts, if desired. Cool and serve. (Hide a secret toy in the
bowl, if you must.)
</P>
<P>
   Microwave method: Combine brown sugar, corn syrup, butter and
salt in 2-quart glass casserole. Microwave on high 2 to 3 minutes
until mixture reaches hard-ball stage. Stir every minute. Continue
as above.
</P>
<P>
   Shortcut: Melt 1 pound caramels with 1/4 cup half-and-half. Pour
over popcorn.

<P>
   2tablespoons packed brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   4tablespoons peach preserves

bowl. Melt butter in small pan over low heat. Stir in sugar and
preserves until melted. Dribble over popcorn. Stir to coat evenly.
Spread popcorn mixture on greased roasting pan. Bake for 10
minutes, stirring every 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and cool before
serving.

   Popcorn balls are a classic for Halloween or other holiday
parties. This recipe is from ``James Beard's American Cookery''
(Little Brown &AMP; Co., 1996). One word of caution: while this may
seem a great activity to do with the kids, be very careful with the
hot syrup because it can burn. It's probably best to do with older
children.
</P>
<P>
   16cups lightly salted popped corn
</P>
<P>
   2cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup light corn syrup
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup water
</P>
<P>
   2teaspoons vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Place popped corn in a large buttered mixing bowl and put in a
warm oven (110 to 120 degrees.) Put wax paper or aluminum foil on a
countertop. Measure the sugar, corn syrup and water into a 3-quart
saucepan. Bring to a boil and wash down the sides of the pan with a
pastry brush dipped in water, to avoid sugar granules. Cook to
264-270 degrees. Remove from the heat and immediately stir in the
vanilla. Take the popcorn from the oven and slowly pour the syrup
over it while stirring thoroughly with a large, long-handled spoon.
Butter or oil your hands very well and as soon as the mixture can
be handled without burning your hands, take up enough popcorn into
the hands to be pressed into a ball. Space the balls on the wax
paper or aluminum foil until cool. Work rapidly so that the syrup
will not harden before the balls can be formed. Store in freezer
bags or in tightly covered airtight containers or the syrup will
draw moisture and make the popcorn soggy.

   Holiday party bowls will need filling soon, and we can't think
of a better way to bring a little color and flavor to popcorn than
with pretty red cranberries.
</P>
<P>
   4tablespoons ( 1/2 stick) unsalted butter

<P>
   1cup granulated sugar
</P>

   Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In a small saucepan, melt butter
over low heat. Stir in sugar, corn syrup and cranberry juice
concentrate. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower heat and
simmer until mixture reaches 240 degrees on a candy thermometer.
Place popcorn and dried cranberries in a large bowl. Pour syrup
over popcorn and stir until well coated. Spread popcorn evenly in a
large roasting pan. Bake for about 5 minutes, stirring once or
twice, until mixture just begins to lose red color. Remove from
oven and let cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes. Store in
an airtight container for up to 1 week. Recrisp in a preheated
350-degree oven for a few minutes, if necessary. _ Adapted from:

   There's hardly a better way to survive the wait for a table at
dish in Virginia-Highland than munching on a bowl of their yummy
rosemary-pine nut popcorn. Here's our adaptation of that treat.
Sometimes you can find rosemary-infused oil at gourmet food shops,
but we've included the instructions for making your own.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE ROSEMARY OIL:
</P>
<P>
   1cup canola or other vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   84-inch sprigs fresh rosemary
</P>
<P>
   1clove garlic, crushed
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE POPCORN:
</P>
<P>
   5tablespoons rosemary oil, divided
</P>
<P>
   1/3cup popcorn kernels
</P>
<P>
   1cup pine nuts
</P>
<P>
   1/4teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   For the rosemary oil: In a small saucepan over very low heat,
warm the canola oil, rosemary sprigs and crushed garlic for 20
minutes. If the oil begins to sizzle, remove the pan from the heat
for a moment to cool. Warm, don't brown, the rosemary and garlic.
Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, overnight. Strain the
oil. It will keep, refrigerated, for about one week.
</P>
<P>
   For the popcorn: In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons of rosemary
oil and 1 kernel of popcorn. When that kernel pops, add the rest of
the popcorn, cover, and pop, shaking the pot often to avoid
burning. In the meantime, in a small saucepan over low heat, stir
the pine nuts in the remaining 3 tablespoons of rosemary oil.
Remove from the heat when the nuts begin to turn light brown, about
5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the salt. Pour the nuts with their cooking
oil over the popcorn, stirring continuously to mix well. As soon as
the popcorn has cooled to room temperature, store in an airtight
container.

 &HT;    If Lewinsky testifies, all sweeps bets are off
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, what a sweeps this promises to be! Steamy sex all over the
place, dramatic tension, ongoing plot lines involving high stakes,
betrayals and dirty dealings.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just during the House impeachment hearings,
tentatively scheduled to start in mid-November. Although the
networks will pretend it's business as usual, grinding out movies
and ``very special'' series episodes, the real action will be on
Capitol Hill. Let's get real: There is nothing they'll do on ``Ally
McBeal'' or ``ER'' that could compare to Monica Lewinsky testifying
live.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, nothing resembling a schedule for the
hearings, and there is a schedule for sweeps month, when stations
in about half the country set their ad rates. (In Atlanta, we do it
year-round.) Here are some of the highlights for sweeps, which
start today.

star.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Frank Lloyd Wright.'' (PBS-check local listings). Ken Burns

Moira Kelly is the adult Helen Keller and Roma Downey is Annie
Sullivan in this new movie.
</P>

Night'') plays the gossip columnist.

 &HT;    COLUMN: 13 scarifying cinematic versions of `boo'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Probably the scariest thing at the movies these days is the
success of ``Scream'' and its ilk. Most of these splatter-spattered
goofs are derivative and not nearly as clever as they think they
are.
</P>
<P>
   For some real chills, check out these 13 reasons to be afraid of
the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freaks'' (1932): Tod Browning's legendary film about the
vengeance wreaked by some circus freaks on a selfish and
manipulative trapeze artist who harms one of their own is still one
of the most shocking pictures ever made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Exorcist'' (1973): The later scenes, with little Linda
Blair spewing obscenities and pea soup, are actually less chilling
than the early ones in which her actress-mother (Ellen Burstyn)
first notices that something's not the same about her little girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Night of the Living Dead'' (1968): It may have become too
familiar and its collection of very '60s flesh-eating zombies too
camp. But that opening in the cemetery still gives you shivers. And
talk about an image of America devouring itself ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Island of Lost Souls'' (1933): The recent remake, starring
Marlon Brando, is horrifying in a totally different way. This
adaptation of H.G. Wells' tale of a mad scientist (Charles
Laughton) turning animals into men will give you the real creeps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alien'' (1979): The sequel was more of an action-thriller.
This is like a haunted-house movie set on board a spooky spaceship
with the crew getting picked off one by one. The scene where
something disagrees with John Hurt at dinner remains one of the
most gruesome ever filmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry: Portrait of a Serial
</P>
<P>
   Killer'' (1990): Loosely based on a true story, this starkly
brutal little film helped make Michael Rooker something of a cult
star. The entire cast is quite good (read, squalidly believable),
and a videotape of a family massacre is pit-of-the-stomach
terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brood'' (1979): You could just as easily go with David
Cronenberg's better-known ``The Fly,'' but here's something more
obscure and equally nasty. Samantha Eggar plays a really sick woman
whose inner rage manifests itself in some really, really scary
ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vanishing'' (1988): Not the American remake, which is a
travesty, but the original Dutch version. Something terrible
happens to a young couple while they're on vacation. The
repercussions and ultimate outcome will shake you to your very
toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Silence of the Lambs'' (1991): The multiple Oscars make us
think of Jonathan Demme's thriller in a more upscale way, but
Hannibal Lecter _ incarcerated or on a rampage _ is a nightmare
made flesh. And the other killer isn't such a good guy, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alone in the Dark'' (1982): One of those movies that even the
``cult'' types typically don't know. Four vengeful lunatics _ among
them Jack Palance and Martin Landau _ escape from their mental
institution and head for the home of their new doctor. Worth it, at
the very least, for the final twist, which is worthy of EC Comics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evil Dead 2'' (1987): Along with ``Re-Animator'' and ``Dawn of
the Dead,'' this movie mixes horror and humor (of a sort) on a
Grand Guignol scale. It's the usual
young-people-on-their-own-and-in-peril plot, but Sam Raimi takes it
so over the top that you can hardly believe your own eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``M'' (1931): Never mind ``Lolita'' or ``Happiness,'' the
controversial Todd Solodnz movie opening here Nov. 6. Here's the
movie that makes pedophilia an unspeakable horror. Peter Lorre is
the child molester-murderer whose habit of whistling ``In the Hall
of the Mountain King'' as he stalks his young prey is one of the
most ominous sounds in movies. More ominous still is the silence
when the whistling stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dead of Night'' (1945): A horror-themed anthology, with some
segments more frightening than others. The last story _ about a
ventriloquist's (Michael Redgrave) twisted relationship with his
dummy _ remains a classic spine-tingler.

 &HT;    MINI VIEWS: Short reviews of the latest on video
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- ``The Butcher Boy'' (R) _ A dazzling, dark feat. Neil
Jordan's adaptation of Patrick McCabe's novel takes us inside the
mind of an Irish boy (Eamonn Owens) who uses his imagination first
as a shield against the world, then as a weapon. Owens, in his film
debut, is startlingly good, and he's backed by a strong supporting
cast, including Stephen Rea and Fiona Shaw. Watching the movie on
tape is a plus; you may need to rewind sometimes to penetrate the
thick Irish accents. Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Habit'' (R) _ In his insinuating Manhattan thriller,
writer-director-star Larry Fessenden plays an alcoholic wreck who
believes the hot new girl he's dating may be a vampire. Set mainly
in the East Village, the movie creates a creepy, compelling analogy
between vampire myths and substance abuse. And it keeps you
guessing till the very end.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Deep Impact'' (PG-13) _ Mimi Leder's end-of-the-world epic
is as somber as ``Armageddon'' is silly. If you don't think the
apocalypse should play like a video game, that's a good thing. The
movie focuses on a disparate bunch of people: TV reporter Tea
Leoni, a teenager (Elijah Wood) and his girlfriend, and the crew of
the space mission (including Robert Duvall and Blair Underwood)
sent to keep the comet from hitting Earth. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' (R) _ Johnny Depp and
Benicio Del Toro trash hotel rooms, ingest massive quantities of
alcohol and drugs, and mock poor Christina Ricci's portraits of
Barbra Streisand. Terry Gilliam's proudly insane adaptation of the
Hunter S. Thompson book isn't for all tastes, but it's the latest
fascinating choice in Depp's career. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Clockwatchers'' (R) _ Toni Colette, Lisa Kudrow, Parker
Posey and Alanna Ubach play temps working in the barren wastes of
corporate-land. This comedy-drama about bonding and squabbles among
the cabinet-file sisterhood has its deadpan moments, but it hangs
around too long and becomes a victim of its own stasis. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Cats'' (Unrated) _ Now and forever, God help us. Andrew
Lloyd Webber's deathless, deadly musical is now on video. If you
like the sight of men and women in fluffy leotards, licking their
wrists like big ol' puddytats, have at it. Priced to buy, $24.95.
Grade: C-

 &HT;    Celebrate Halloween with ghoulish delights
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cyberspace is haunted. If you are searching for Halloween
inspiration, you will find ghosties and goblins, monsters and
haunts lurking everywhere. List upon list of ghoulish recipes make
you wonder if bobbing for apples and little bags of candy corn are
a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you're looking for a viable alternative to kids'
trick-or-treating on darkened streets, you may want to search out
some of these _ let's face it _ disgusting concoctions and turn the
kitchen over to the generation whose vocabulary is heavy on the
words ``yuck'' and ``gross.'' They are bound to have a memorable
time.
</P>
<P>
   Be prepared to find recipes for such ghoulish delicacies as
chopped up finger pizza, frog's eye salad, dirt pie and on and on,
literally, ad nauseam. The grisly eats sound a lot worse than they
are, though. The recipes are humorously written, easy to follow and
geared to kids. And don't let the names of these deadly dishes
scare you off. You will find that most of the ingredients are as
innocuous as Jell-O, food coloring and Oreo cookies and just as
easy to come by.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Bloody Eyeballs on the Rocks consists of
pimiento-stuffed olives and radishes in tomato juice. The kids can
whip up some Boogers on a Stick using Cheese Whiz, green food
coloring and pretzel sticks; and the main ingredients for Dirt Cake
are crushed up Oreo cookies and gummy worms. In fact Witches Brew
Punch, a blend of juices with the added attraction of a hunk of dry
ice in the bowl, is positively appealing. None of this stuff is
lethal and it's a sure bet that the kids will have a hilarious
Halloween concocting it all in the kitchen _ supervised of course.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some sites to check. Keep in mind that kids can also
have a lot of fun just picking this stuff out before the cooking
party even begins.
</P>
<P>
   -- An all-round good Halloween site is
http://www.meijer.com/web/halloween98/intro.html. Not only will you
find most of the recipes already mentioned but there are costume
ideas, scary stories, decorating tips, pumpkin carving ideas and
more.
</P>
<P>
   -- Another fun site is http://www.excell.net/lily1013/samhain.
Along with instructions on how to whip up Swamp Slime, Caterpillar
Sandwiches, and Slug Guts, there is interesting information on the
origins of this ancient autumnal spookfest as well as safety tips,
haunted houses, games and lots of other stuff.

<P>
   -- For a huge list of just straight Halloween recipes, some
gory, some pretty appealing call up

   -- The old standbys have Halloween-decorated treats, too. Check
for chocolate (including Chocolate Spider Web Cake and Spider Web
Munch, below) at http://www.hersheys.com/new/spidercake.html and
www.tollhouse.com.
</P>
<P>
   -- Recipes lurking at

Frozen Hand (see below) to lend a nice punch to the punch bowl.

the recipes are almost too gross for a family newspaper.

   When Christian Harris of Atlanta asked for a repeat of Triple

Cider and apple butter go into the waffles, and they're served with
caramelized apples.

until well-blended. Pour the liquid ingredients over the dry
ingredients and stir well with the whisk. Mix in the apple butter
and fold in the melted butter.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not your iron's grids are well-seasoned or made of a
nonstick material, it is best to lightly butter or spray the grids
of your iron for these waffles; the batter is quite sticky. Spoon
out about 1/2 cup batter onto the hot grids. Spread the batter
evenly with a metal spatula or wooden spoon. Close the lid and bake
until browned and set.
</P>
<P>
   Keep the finished waffles on a cooling rack while you make the
rest of the batch. Right before serving, reheat them, putting them
in a single layer on a rack in the oven, for about 3 minutes. _

NASA, MEDIA AND WELL-WISHERS READY FOR CELEBRATED SPACE MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ The machines, the weather and John Glenn
himself were ``go'' for launching, as countdown preparations
progressed smoothly toward the liftoff of the space shuttle
Discovery, scheduled for 2 p.m. Thursday, on the most eagerly
awaited space mission in years.
</P>
<P>
   All because of Glenn, returning to space after 36 years, crowds
of well-wishers were already descending on the Kennedy Space Center
here and were expected to swell into the hundreds of thousands. The
expected turnout of 3,700 media people is thought to be the largest
since the Apollo lunar flights. All the major television networks
will show the liftoff live _ something else that has not happened
in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   And President Clinton is expected to fly in to celebrate the
comeback mission of the national hero who was the first American to
orbit the planet. Glenn's three-orbit, five-hour flight in a tiny
Mercury capsule occurred on Feb. 20, 1962, when Bill Clinton was
still in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, the retiring Democratic senator from Ohio, will join six
other astronauts on a planned nine-day mission devoted primarily to
astronomical observations, tests of new space hardware, experiments
in materials processing in weightlessness and biological and
medical studies, including monitoring Glenn's health as an
experiment in the physiology of aging.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Holloway, NASA's shuttle program manager, reported
Wednesday that all the preparations and tests on the Discovery were
``proceeding exceptionally well and all systems are go.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven crew members were ``in the best of spirits and more
than ready to go,'' said Col. Charles Precourt, chief of the
astronaut office at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, at a news
conference at Cape Canaveral. They had a barbecue with their
families on Tuesday night, paid a traditional visit to the
launching pad Wednesday morning and spent the rest of the day in
briefings and some late-afternoon flying.
</P>
<P>
   Precourt, an astronaut himself, said that Glenn was holding his
own and fitting in well with the rest of the crew, most of whom are
half his age. ``His attitude is infectious,'' Precourt said. ``He's
very eager to get the work done.''
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists flashed a green light on the weather. Their
forecast was for a 100 percent chance of favorable weather at
launching time: clear, dry and calm skies. It is rare for a weather
forecast here to be so unambiguous and optimistic, and much better
than Glenn had to contend with in 1962. His launching then was
postponed 10 times, 4 for bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like Mother Nature wants John Glenn to return to
space just like the rest of us,'' said Capt. Cliff Stargardt, an
Air Force meteorologist.
</P>
<P>
   The expected presence of Clinton and scores of congressional
leaders and celebrities has led to especially tight security
precautions, including requirements for visitors to pass through a
close inspection at three checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the ``heightened security precautions,'' Robert B.
Sieck, director of shuttle operations here, said, ``It's a
common-sense thing to do, considering the environment today, the
attention this is getting and what's going on in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   After several years of pressing his case for a second chance to
fly in space, Glenn was added to the Discovery crew in January. The
decision was made by NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin after
consulting with medical experts on the scientific merit of aging
tests on Glenn and receiving assurances that Glenn was physically
fit to fly. Physicians said he passed all the tests required of any
non-pilot crew member.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Glenn conceded that his ``body
flexibility is not as good as it used to be, and that becomes
apparent every day.'' He noticed especially he tries to enter the
shuttle hatch. ``I don't bend quite like the others in the crew
do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is not expected to stop him when he suits up Thursday
morning and climbs into the Discovery and takes his place below the
flight deck. With him will be Lt. Col. Curtis Brown and Lt. Col.
Steven Lindsey, the Air Force officers who are the commander and
pilot, respectively. Others on the crew are Dr. Stephen Robinson,
an engineer; Dr. Scott Parazynski, a physician; Pedro Duque, a
Spanish aeronautical engineer representing the European Space
Agency, and Dr. Chiaki Mukai, a physician and medical researcher
from Japan.

CLINTON BATTLES $10 MILLION GOP CAMPAIGN BLITZ FROM ROSE GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``p'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton launched a Rose Garden counter
offensive Wednesday against a surprise $10 million Republican
campaign blitz designed to cast the mid-term congressional
elections as a referendum on his embattled presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Republicans' ad campaign in 33 states and 56
congressional districts is merely designed to shift voters'
attention away from their day-to-day concerns and instead focus on
the scandal clouding his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he hoped his actions in recent weeks have shown ``a
real commitment'' to dealing with issues afflicting ordinary
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to sugar coat the fact that I made a mistake
and that I didn't want anybody to know about it,'' Clinton said.
``I hope very much that they have seen that I'm doing my best to
atone for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they can sense the rededication and the intensified
efforts I am making for the cause of peace around the world, for
the cause of prosperity at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton commented during a Rose Garden news conference with
Colombian President Andres Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of contested House and Senate elections next Tuesday
will influence the pace and scope of the looming congressional
impeachment inquiry into the White House sex scandal involving
Clinton and former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are working to expand their 11-seat majority in the
435-seat House and their 55 to 45 seat edge in the Senate.
Democrats are hoping to hold down traditional losses in off-year
elections for the party holding the White House in an effort to
stem the GOP-led effort to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) began airing
the new campaign ads Tuesday evening. The commercials in 22
congressional districts included direct or indirect references to
the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The voice in one ad says that ``for seven months, he lied to
us,'' adding: ``Should we reward not telling the truth? That is the
question of this election: Reward Bill Clinton. Or vote
Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   A second commercial asks: ``What do you tell your kids?''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the advertising campaign appeared designed in part
to rally the GOP faithful to turn out next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., the leader of the Republican campaign
committee working to elect Republicans to the House, said the
commercials were an attempt to make Clinton the issue in the fall
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the leader of the party with the wrong ideas,'' Linder
said.
</P>
<P>
   GOP Chairman Jim Nicholson said the advertisements raised the
``unspoken question for voters in 1998... `After all we've learned,
do we trust Bill Clinton's judgment so much that we want to reward
him with a Democrat Congress and complete control of our
government?''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Crawford, spokeswoman for the NRCC, said the ads ``spell
out very clearly for the public what the differences are between
Republicans and Democrats in terms of what direction we want to
lead the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivia Morgan, the spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, said the Republican effort was merely a ``$10
million excuse for their failure to address issues that people
actually care about.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sought to rebut the GOP ads during his Rose Garden news
conference. He challenged Republican questions about whether he had
been ``trustworthy'' by claiming he had kept a higher percentage of
his campaign promises than the last five presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the GOP offensive was intended to persuade
Americans to turn their backs on efforts by Democrats to address
problems that citizens face in their everyday lives.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are ``basically saying to the American people... we
don't want you to think about yourself,'' Clinton declared. ``We
want you to give up everything that could help you. And if we can
distract you and divert your attention, that will enable us to hold
onto our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what people ought to say to their children is that,
`When someone makes a mistake, they should admit it and try to
rectify it,''' Clinton said. The president said his admission of
his 18-month sexual relationship with Lewinsky in a nationally
televised White House address on Aug. 17 illustrates that if people
admit their mistakes, ``they can be stronger in their personal
lives, in their family lives and in their work lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his admission and efforts to atone for his mistake
ought to serve as an example of how people become stronger through
adversity and reassessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that in that sense the lesson is a good one that it
should apply to everyone, from the president on down,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that Democrats would do well next Tuesday if the
election were fought on Democratic and Republican differences over
Social Security reform, medical patients' rights, school
modernization, boosting the minimum wage, restrictions on tobacco
sales to teenagers and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appealed for a large turnout in the off-year election,
saying the contest was ``not an ordinary election because of the
challenges facing our country and we don't need an ordinary
mid-term turnout.''

GAZA GIVES ARAFAT A WELCOME THAT IS LESS THAN OVERWHELMING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ISRAEL-POLITICS, ISRAEL-LIKUD) 
(bl) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip _ Cheered by throngs of schoolchildren but
ignored by most Gazans who went about their daily routines,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat returned here Wednesday to promote
his accord with Israel to a wary public.
</P>
<P>
   The reception for Arafat was orchestrated by his Al Fatah
movement and the Palestinian Authority, and had none of the
euphoric spontaneity of the mass celebrations that followed
previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Wearied by 19 months of bitter stalemate with Israel and by
steadily worsening economic hardship, most people in Gaza seemed
indifferent to Arafat's return, unwilling yet to set aside deep
suspicions that the promise of the latest accord may also go
unrealized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accord is good, but the important thing is
implementation,'' said Nasser Qassas, a truck driver, as he sat on
a street corner far away from the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after signing the accord Arafat toured some of the
region's Arab capitals to drum up support for it. Wednesday, as
Arafat arrived at his beachfront office, there were marching bands,
hundreds of flag-waving pupils, and the obligatory red carpet,
honor guard and a long line of officials from the Palestinian
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Banners strung over the road greeted Arafat as the ``Maker of
Victory and Peace,'' the ``Faithful Guardian of the Palestinian
Dream'' who had brought ``New Hope for the Masses of Our People.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepping out of his car and flashing his trademark V-sign _ for
victory _ Arafat confidently predicted that the accord signed with
the Israelis in Washington last Friday would proceed according to
plan, despite a decision by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
postpone ratification of the accord by the Israeli Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has been signed will be implemented accurately,'' Arafat
told reporters. To his people, he repeated what has become a
familiar mantra: ``Onward together until we pray together in
Jerusalem, the capital of the Palestinian state.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat has a difficult road ahead. He must persuade a deeply
skeptical public that this time the agreement with Israel will
yield tangible benefits. The campaign has already begun, with the
Palestinian radio and press trumpeting gains of the accord: an
airport, travel between the West Bank and Gaza, and prisoner
releases.
</P>
<P>
   Nabil Shaath, the irrepressibly optimistic minister of planning
in the Palestinian cabinet, spoke glowingly of the prospects ahead
in a recent interview on the Voice of Palestine radio. He described
trips from the West Bank to eat fish by the Gaza sea, and travel
from a Palestinian international airport where there is no visible
Israeli presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patience, and slowly everything will fall into place,'' he
assured his listeners.
</P>

   On the security front, Arafat will have to move decisively
against armed elements without provoking civil strife. Trouble is
already brewing in the West Bank town of Ramallah, where Arafat's
police officers killed a local youth this week during a
demonstration against a weapons search in the local Al Fatah
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Angry Fatah leaders held demonstrations and strikes in several
West Bank towns, prompting Arafat to move swiftly to defuse the
crisis. The four officers who conducted the search were jailed
after quick trials, an investigation of the shooting was begun, and
the victim was given a state funeral Wednesday, attended by top
officials and police officers.
</P>
<P>
   In Gaza, where Palestinians are bottled up in an impoverished
strip of land surrounded by an Israeli security fence and border
checkpoints, there is great yearning for a measure of freedom that
could result from the latest accord.
</P>
<P>
   Qassas, the truck driver, said he was most eager for the opening
of safe passage routes between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll provide emotional relief, and material benefits, because
I'll be able to make delivery runs to the West Bank,'' he said.
``I'll get a breath of fresh air and see the mountains, relax and
meet other people. I'll feel freer.''
</P>
<P>
   Khaled Shaghub, a laborer, said he had not seen relatives in the
West Bank for five years because of Israeli border closures that
have prevented him from leaving the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a big prison now,'' he said. ``If the agreement is
carried out it will change people's mentality. We will feel the
beginnings of a real peace.''

CLINTON BATTLES $10 MILLION GOP CAMPAIGN BLITZ FROM ROSE GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton launched a Rose Garden counter
offensive Wednesday against a surprise $10 million Republican
campaign blitz designed to cast the mid-term congressional
elections as a referendum on his embattled presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Republicans' ad campaign in 33 states and 56
congressional districts is merely designed to shift voters'
attention away from their day-to-day concerns and instead focus on
the scandal clouding his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he hoped his actions in recent weeks have shown ``a
real commitment'' to dealing with issues afflicting ordinary
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to sugar coat the fact that I made a mistake
and that I didn't want anybody to know about it,'' Clinton said.
``I hope very much that they have seen that I'm doing my best to
atone for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they can sense the rededication and the intensified
efforts I am making for the cause of peace around the world, for
the cause of prosperity at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton commented during a Rose Garden news conference with
Colombian President Andres Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of contested House and Senate elections next Tuesday
will influence the pace and scope of the looming congressional
impeachment inquiry into the White House sex scandal involving
Clinton and former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are working to expand their 11-seat majority in the
435-seat House and their 55 to 45 seat edge in the Senate.
Democrats are hoping to hold down traditional losses in off-year
elections for the party holding the White House in an effort to
stem the GOP-led effort to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) began airing
the new campaign ads Tuesday evening. The commercials in 22
congressional districts included direct or indirect references to
the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The voice in one ad says that ``for seven months, he lied to
us,'' adding: ``Should we reward not telling the truth? That is the
question of this election: Reward Bill Clinton. Or vote
Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   A second commercial asks: ``What do you tell your kids?''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the advertising campaign appeared designed in part
to rally the GOP faithful to turn out next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., the leader of the Republican campaign
committee working to elect Republicans to the House, said the
commercials were an attempt to make Clinton the issue in the fall
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the leader of the party with the wrong ideas,'' Linder
said.
</P>
<P>
   GOP Chairman Jim Nicholson said the advertisements raised the
``unspoken question for voters in 1998... `After all we've learned,
do we trust Bill Clinton's judgment so much that we want to reward
him with a Democrat Congress and complete control of our
government?''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Crawford, spokeswoman for the NRCC, said the ads ``spell
out very clearly for the public what the differences are between
Republicans and Democrats in terms of what direction we want to
lead the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivia Morgan, the spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, said the Republican effort was merely a ``$10
million excuse for their failure to address issues that people
actually care about.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sought to rebut the GOP ads during his Rose Garden news
conference. He challenged Republican questions about whether he had
been ``trustworthy'' by claiming he had kept a higher percentage of
his campaign promises than the last five presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the GOP offensive was intended to persuade
Americans to turn their backs on efforts by Democrats to address
problems that citizens face in their everyday lives.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are ``basically saying to the American people... we
don't want you to think about yourself,'' Clinton declared. ``We
want you to give up everything that could help you. And if we can
distract you and divert your attention, that will enable us to hold
onto our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what people ought to say to their children is that,
`When someone makes a mistake, they should admit it and try to
rectify it,''' Clinton said. The president said his admission of
his 18-month sexual relationship with Lewinsky in a nationally
televised White House address on Aug. 17 illustrates that if people
admit their mistakes, ``they can be stronger in their personal
lives, in their family lives and in their work lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his admission and efforts to atone for his mistake
ought to serve as an example of how people become stronger through
adversity and reassessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that in that sense the lesson is a good one that it
should apply to everyone, from the president on down,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that Democrats would do well next Tuesday if the
election were fought on Democratic and Republican differences over
Social Security reform, medical patients' rights, school
modernization, boosting the minimum wage, restrictions on tobacco
sales to teenagers and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appealed for a large turnout in the off-year election,
saying the contest was ``not an ordinary election because of the
challenges facing our country and we don't need an ordinary
mid-term turnout.''

 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Little girls, especially those inclined to kill
people, should learn to keep their footwear clean. It was, after
all, a pair of bloodstained Mary Janes that got Rhoda, the
piano-playing, angel-faced murderess, into such trouble in ``The
Bad Seed,'' the popular 1950s melodrama by Maxwell Anderson. Now
Lizzie Gael, the 9-year-old in Hilary Bell's ``Wolf Lullaby'' at
the Atlantic Theater Company, is arousing suspicions by wearing a
pair of sneakers spattered in red. What IS a mother to do?
</P>
<P>
   The chilling fascination with children who kill obviously hasn't
waned in the four decades since Patty McCormack, as Rhoda, became a
star playing ``Clair de Lune'' over the screams of a man burning to
death offstage. The differences that separate Rhoda and Lizzie,
however, are more than a matter of shoe styles.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will about Rhoda, she was clearheaded: she knew
what she wanted and how to get it, even if it involved homicide.
Things aren't so easy for Lizzie, whose sense of self and reality
are on the slippery side. Similarly, the play in which she figures
is far more reluctant to categorize its anti-heroine than
Anderson's was. Rhoda was simply a monster, the bad seed of the
title; no one in ``Wolf Lullaby'' is quite sure what to make of
Lizzie.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bell's 75-minute play, set in a town in Tasmania, is more
intriguing for questions it raises than for how it embodies them
dramatically. Although performed with the care and conviction that
is the hallmark of the Atlantic, which gave us ``Mojo'' and ``The
Beauty Queen of Leenane,'' ``Wolf Lullaby'' never quite catches
fire.
</P>
<P>
   The production, directed in a terse, elliptical style by Neil
Pepe, does have its genuinely disturbing moments, more effective
for the quietness with which they are executed. Yet there's an
overall feeling of dispassion and self-consciousness that keeps you
at a distance, letting you pick at the holes in the work's
narrative logic.
</P>
<P>
   Lizzie (played by Kate Blumberg, an adult) is the daughter of
parents who live apart. She is by no means the suave pretender that
Rhoda was. She has troubled dreams, a dark fantasy life and a
slightly hysterical manner. Her mother, Angela (Mary McCann), and
father, Warren (Jordan Lage), see her behavior as part of the usual
growing pains, even when she is picked up for shoplifting by a
policeman (Larry Bryggman), who points out that she has also
strangled a classmate's canary. Their dismissive attitude changes
after a local 2-year-old is strangled to death.
</P>
<P>
   The questions the parents ask of themselves in the murder's
aftermath (Why me? What did I do?) are standard in dramas of kids
gone bad. The play's more provocative elements come from Ms. Bell's
suggestions that mother love has its limits and, even more
daringly, that what Lizzie did (if she did it) falls within the
realm of a bullying and sadism common among children.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCann and Bryggman are especially good at tracing their
characters' respective paths away from and toward affection for the
child. And Ms. Blumberg really does seem to inhabit the tortured
little girl she plays, rather than talking down to her. The actors
do not, however, disguise the structural limpness of ``Wolf
Lullaby,'' which includes a climactic scene in which Angela is
asked to betray her daughter in a way that has occurred already.
It's as if the deliberate fuzziness of the work's moral stance had
somehow seeped into its technique.
</P>
<P>
   The production's most sensational (and effective) touches are
its sound effects, created by Donald DiNicola, which include
macabre rhymes chanted by a chorus of children. That juxtaposition
of ghoulishness and guilelessness is perfect for the Halloween
season, which somehow seems scarier than it used to. As ``Wolf
Lullaby'' and the increasing number of reports of homicides by
children remind us, there's a slender line between innocence and
amorality.

NEW GOP AD PORTRAYS SCHUMER AS FLIP-FLOPPING ON VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ First they called Rep. Charles E. Schumer a
bleeding-heart liberal, then they attacked his congressional
attendance record. Now, in a new advertisement released Wednesday,
the Republicans claim the man who wants Sen. Alfonse D'Amato's seat
can't make up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement says the Brooklyn Democrat repeatedly
flip-flops on his congressional votes, changing his vote from yes
to no, or no to yes, sometimes in the span of 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   State Republican Chairman William Powers said the latest
advertisement, which cost $750,000, will air in all major media
markets around the state for the duration of the campaign. The
chairman said the ad would probably be the last commissioned by the
state party for D'Amato in this election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what we've seen time and time again with Chuck Schumer.
He puts his finger up to the wind and sees what's the right way to
go, casts a vote ... runs back to switch his vote to be correct,
politically correct,'' Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if D'Amato ever switched a vote, Powers replied:
``Don't know. Don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   The Schumer campaign had not seen the ad as of Wednesday
afternoon and was unable to comment on the substance.
</P>
<P>
   However, spokesman Howard Wolfson suggested the Republicans were
simply trying to recover from Tuesday's revelation that D'Amato,
who has made Schumer's voting record the focus of his campaign for
the last few weeks, skipped hundreds of votes while serving on the
Nassau County board of supervisors in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``His entire campaign was exposed as a fraud,'' Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   On another matter, Powers said that in a race in which Schumer
has made trust an issue, the Democrat ``needs to explain why''
federal authorities in 1983 investigated him for allegedly using
government workers to staff his political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, which focused on Schumer's conduct while he
was in the New York Assembly and running for Congress in 1980, came
to an end when the federal government decided not to pursue
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charges were raised 18 years ago,'' Wolfson said. ``Chuck
cooperated fully. They were completely investigated and they were
dropped.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Powers said that since Schumer brought up the fact
that D'Amato skipped hundreds of votes while serving as a local
elected official on Long Island in 1980, ancient history is fair
game in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if somebody raises an issue of things 18 years ago,
well I guess things then become fair game,'' Powers said. ``If you
are talking about things 18-20 years ago, you ought to be prepared
to talk about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Powers later acknowledged that recalling the past is a
double-edged sword, and ``absolutely'' opens the door to a
discussion of D'Amato's ethics history.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has been investigated repeatedly throughout his public
career. He was implicated in or connected to the 1 percent Nassau
County kickback scandal of the 1970s and the Abscam congressional
bribery sting. A 1991 Senate Ethics Committee investigation
resulted in a rebuke of D'Amato for the ``improper and
inappropriate'' use of his office to solicit illegal campaign
contributions. And D'Amato still refuses to release transcripts of
his four-day hearing before the Ethics Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al D'Amato is the most investigated senator in New York
history,'' Wolfson said.

NEW GOP AD PORTRAYS SCHUMER AS FLIP-FLOPPING ON VOTES 
</HEADLINE>

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ First they called Rep. Charles E. Schumer a
bleeding-heart liberal, then they attacked his congressional
attendance record. Now, in a new advertisement released Wednesday,
the Republicans claim the man who wants Sen. Alfonse D'Amato's seat
can't make up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement says the Brooklyn Democrat repeatedly
flip-flops on his congressional votes, changing his vote from yes
to no, or no to yes, sometimes in the span of 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   State Republican Chairman William Powers said the latest
advertisement, which cost $750,000, will air in all major media
markets around the state for the duration of the campaign. The
chairman said the ad would probably be the last commissioned by the
state party for D'Amato in this election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what we've seen time and time again with Chuck Schumer.
He puts his finger up to the wind and sees what's the right way to
go, casts a vote ... runs back to switch his vote to be correct,
politically correct,'' Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if D'Amato ever switched a vote, Powers replied:
``Don't know. Don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   The Schumer campaign had not seen the ad as of Wednesday
afternoon and was unable to comment on the substance.
</P>
<P>
   However, spokesman Howard Wolfson suggested the Republicans were
simply trying to recover from Tuesday's revelation that D'Amato,
who has made Schumer's voting record the focus of his campaign for
the last few weeks, skipped hundreds of votes while serving on the
Nassau County board of supervisors in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``His entire campaign was exposed as a fraud,'' Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   On another matter, Powers said that in a race in which Schumer
has made trust an issue, the Democrat ``needs to explain why''
federal authorities in 1983 investigated him for allegedly using
government workers to staff his political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, which focused on Schumer's conduct while he
was in the New York Assembly and running for Congress in 1980, came
to an end when the federal government decided not to pursue
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charges were raised 18 years ago,'' Wolfson said. ``Chuck
cooperated fully. They were completely investigated and they were
dropped.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Powers said that since Schumer brought up the fact
that D'Amato skipped hundreds of votes while serving as a local
elected official on Long Island in 1980, ancient history is fair
game in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if somebody raises an issue of things 18 years ago,
well I guess things then become fair game,'' Powers said. ``If you
are talking about things 18-20 years ago, you ought to be prepared
to talk about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Powers later acknowledged that recalling the past is a
double-edged sword, and ``absolutely'' opens the door to a
discussion of D'Amato's ethics history.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has been investigated repeatedly throughout his public
career. He was implicated in or connected to the 1 percent Nassau
County kickback scandal of the 1970s and the Abscam congressional
bribery sting. A 1991 Senate Ethics Committee investigation
resulted in a rebuke of D'Amato for the ``improper and
inappropriate'' use of his office to solicit illegal campaign
contributions. And D'Amato still refuses to release transcripts of
his four-day hearing before the Ethics Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al D'Amato is the most investigated senator in New York
history,'' Wolfson said.

UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS TOWER, SITE OF SHOOTING AND SUICIDES, COULD BE
REOPENED AS EARLY AS MAY 1999 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ The University of Texas tower's 28th-floor observation
deck, off-limits to the public since the mid-1970s after it was
used in a deadly sniper attack and numerous student suicide leaps,
could be reopened by May 1999, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Admission will be $5 or $6 for non-students. Remodeling costs
could approach $500,000, and operating expenses, including
security, are estimated to be $86,000 a year, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The deck has been closed since late 1974 after a series of nine
suicide jumps that spanned several decades, but also in reaction to
the 1966 sniper attack by Charles Whitman, which left 16 people
dead and 31 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, the slaughter ranked as the nation's
worst mass murder _ a crime made easier by unfettered public access
to the deck. After killing his wife and mother, Whitman took three
weapons and 700 rounds of ammunition onto the deck and opened fire
on campus, a rain of bullets that lasted more than 90 minutes
before he was slain by police.
</P>
<P>
   Pending final approval by the UT board of regents at a meeting
in Houston Nov. 11-12, the observation deck will be modified to
preclude the kinds of tragedies that led to its closure, officials
said. The open-air deck will be encased in an ironwork barrier
consistent with the ``historic context'' of the 61-year-old tower,
said UT President Larry Faulkner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my opinion we should use this icon of higher education
in positive ways,'' said Faulkner as he formally asked regents to
reopen the tower deck.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the deck sealed to the public would leave Texans ``with
nothing but the history of unfortunate experiences,'' he said.
Reopened access will serve ``to invite the people of Texas to view
their campus and to renew their sense of ownership in the state's
leading academic enterprise,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner's recommendation came in response to six months of
study prompted by student requests to reopen the observation deck.
The tower itself, known as the Main Building, has remained open,
housing administrative offices and archives.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner's plan to reopen the tower includes a variety of steps
to ensure safety, as well as make the tower accessible to the
disabled. The proposal calls for initially allowing access on
weekends only and limiting tours to escorted groups of 12 people,
who would be allowed about 20 minutes on the deck to take in the
view. Visitors would be allowed to carry only small personal items,
including cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The plan presumes there will be ``extraordinary interest'' when
the deck reopens, possibly in time for the spring commencement in
May, which might result in access times being reserved for
graduating seniors and other students.
</P>
<P>
   UT Student Government President Annie Holand praised Faulkner
for responding to the student body's desire, saying the tower
provides students a ``real connection'' to the university.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner described the tower as ``the most important symbol for
academic aspiration and achievement in Texas. It also is the
strongest image uniting members of the university community.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some former students who attended the university during
Whitman's shooting spree and when suicides were common have
expressed their discomfort with the proposal. One of them, Richard
Kelly of Austin, said he can't go near the tower without re-living
the terror of the sniper attack he witnessed on Aug. 1, 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always looking over my shoulder,'' he said. ``I'll never
forget the swath of blood I saw running down the sidewalk.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, those who have stated such concerns acknowledge there are
ways to make the tower a safe vantage point _ and there will always
be other options for those bent on human destruction. &QL;

STEVE MARTIN'S CAREER SKIPS DOWN ANOTHER NEW PATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Steve Martin, the actor, comedian and screenwriter,
began his fourth career _ or was it his fifth? _ with an essay
about a birdbath. He had read a newspaper article about the
discovery at a house on Fifth Avenue of a fountain that may have
been sculptured by Michelangelo, and he conjectured that he had a
birdbath by Raphael in his own backyard in California, the Martin
Birdbath, ``as some scholars are now calling it.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, it was a leap to ruminations about the
ubiquitousness of Monica Lewinsky and to an essay about a drug
whose side effects completely overwhelm the effects and may include
shortening of the intestines by 21 feet, and death. His pieces,
published in The New Yorker (and occasionally in The New York
Times) are a cross between S.J. Perelman and Dave Barry, but with a
fanciful Martinesque twist.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three of Martin's comic musings are collected in ``Pure
Drivel'' (Hyperion), a slim volume of sharp-witted essays. On the
occasion of the recent publication of that book, Martin agreed to
an interview, with the understanding that the talk would be
authorial. But, as might be expected, there was a sense of
improvisation in the air.
</P>
<P>
   At the Union Square Cafe, amid the editors and writers, there
were two stars that day, Martin and Mikhail Baryshnikov. Despite
his own eminence, Martin was in awe of the dancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had a history like his,'' he said. ``I'd be a more
interesting interview.'' Then he tried out a swift comic jete: ``I
escaped from Russia. They didn't appreciate my stand-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Martin escaped from comedy clubs (where they did
appreciate his stand-up). Following up an interest in old-time
vaudeville, carnival sideshows, con games and magic, he created a
comedy act, realizing he was funnier when the tricks didn't work,
and even funnier when there were no tricks at all.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, comedians would polish 15 minutes and do the same
routine forever. With the advent of television, they could, in
Martin's words, ``blow it all'' in one appearance. But with Martin
there was one odd outcome. The audience wanted to see him repeat
himself, especially on ``Saturday Night Live,'' and it looked as if
he was going to be pigeonholed perpetually as a ``wild and crazy
guy'' with an arrow piercing his head.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, he ``changed trains,'' and moved into the
movies as an actor and often as a writer of screenplays tailored to
his own humorous persona. His most recently released film was ``The
Spanish Prisoner,'' in which he played a con man under the
direction of David Mamet. His next film is ``The Out-of-Towners,''
with Goldie Hawn, a remake of the 1970 movie to be released in
March.
</P>
<P>
   He just completed writing and acting in ``Bowfinger's Big
Thing,'' which also stars Eddie Murphy, due next summer. He said he
had been carrying the idea for the screenplay (about a failed film
producer) in his head for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The essays come much more quickly. He gets an idea (from a
newspaper, as Perelman did, or from the ether), thinks about it for
a week and then writes it in half a day. To his surprise, some of
the pieces have had a wide currency. ``Mars Probe Finds Kittens,''
which offers evidence that 27 kittens were living on the red
planet, was posted on a bulletin board at NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Several have been personal, like ``Dear Amanda,'' a variation on
a series of desperate love letters that he once wrote. In another
essay, he contemplates the consequences of memory loss after age
50, such as sitting in your garden and trying to remember your
dog's name while calling pet names at random.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has often faced new challenges, it is his conviction
that ``the one thing almost guaranteed about a career move is that
it almost never is.'' Instead, he specializes in what might be
called career dares. The film ``Roxanne,'' his updating of ``Cyrano
de Bergerac,'' is an example, as is his first play, ``Picasso at
the Lapin Agile.''
</P>
<P>
   As an art collector and connoisseur, he was inspired by the
Picasso painting ``Au Lapin Agile'' at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art. It made him recall that when he was in his 20s, he hung out
with his friends at a favorite bar in Los Angeles. Although there
was no Picasso in the crowd, ``we thought we were geniuses.''
</P>
<P>
   The play was tried out in a workshop in Australia (his former
wife, the actress Victoria Tennant, is Australian), and to his
amazement it has gone around the world, from off-Broadway to Norway
to Japan and back to Australia. Recently, he saw a tape of that
last production, and the actor playing Picasso was in whiteface,
like a mime. But Martin said he didn't mind the divergence from his
script.
</P>
<P>
   Told that Beckett would have withdrawn the rights for such a
re-interpretation, Martin said, ``That proves I'm not Beckett.''
</P>
<P>
   His playwriting career began on a whim. He asked himself what he
was good at and answered, ``Ad-libbing on the set, and after the
thing is made, listening to the audience and fixing it.'' That, he
decided, is what a play is. Shakespeare, of course, would have
disagreed, which proves Steve Martin is not Shakespeare. But he
does have another play in his head, waiting to come out.

 NEW YORK: come out.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He does much of his writing at home in Santa Barbara, Calif.
When he is not working, and sometimes when he is working, he
travels. On his trips, he looks at art and buys paintings to add to
his collection. As an art appreciator, he is self-taught, although
he has learned a great deal from dealers. Two years ago, he was the
voice on the Acoustiguide for the ``Picasso and Portraiture'' show
at the Metropolitan Museum, doing it straight except to suggest
that people should not follow his commentary blindly, and collide
with the pictures.
</P>
<P>
   His taste has grown, he said, but there is still a place in his
heart for really terrible paintings, like California landscapes.
``I was talking to a very big collector who has very sophisticated
paintings,'' he said. ``We were in a museum, and he took me aside
and confessed, `You know what I really like, the way moonlight is
reflected on water.''' Martin agrees.
</P>
<P>
   In his collection, along with Picassos, he has Edward Hopper's
``Captain Upton's House,'' a view of the Two Lights Lighthouse in
Cape Elizabeth, Maine This summer there was a controversy about the
planned demolition of the keeper's cottage next to the lighthouse.
If that happens, said Martin, deadpan, ``I would have to have the
picture repainted.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Pure Drivel,'' there is a piece called ``Hissy Fit,'' about
a New York writer's sense of dislocation in Los Angeles. As a Los
Angeles writer in New York, he pondered the local reaction: ``Am I
perceived as an interloper or as a comedian who dabbles in
something that's not his business? That's my paranoia.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the variety of his accomplishments in the movies and his
appearance with Robin Williams at Lincoln Center in Mike Nichols'
1988 production of ``Waiting for Godot,'' he still regards himself
as a comedian, not as an actor. ``My pride is in being funny and
writing funny and in doing things I've written,'' he said. Asked if
he felt a need to direct, he answered, ``No, I feel a need not to
direct,'' and added, ``I'm doing exactly what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   During a recent sabbatical from the movies, he was flooded with
ideas for comic essays. Since he has described them as
``after-dinner mints to the big meal of literature,'' it seemed
logical to ask when he would do a big meal, a novel.
</P>
<P>
   Although he seemed tantalized by the possibility, he had to
admit, ``I ate my dessert first.''

   GOPADS _ Washington _ It what is clearly a gamble, the
Republican Party is pumping $10 million into campaign ads that
blantantly refer to the Lewinsky saga. There are several variations
of the ads, but one of the most controversial is now running in
Georgia Democrat Sanford Bishop's district. Bishop says he is not
concerned because the public will ``see right through the
Republican antics.'' His opponenet Joseph McCormick had no idea
that the ads were going to run and he's a bit surprised since
impeachment has not been an issue in that campaign. Rep. John
Linder, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional
Campaign Committee, which is footing the bill for the ads, said the
the motivation behind the ads is to help the GOP ``ride the wave''
and pick up a dozen more seats. Just last week, Linder said they
would not be running such ads as focus groups told them the public
has had enough on the impeachment front. Political scientists say
the latest batch of ads are a gamble, given the public's disdain
for the impeachment inquiry,but they are also smart as there is no
mention of Monica, rather a focus on honesty and trustworthiness
and balance. But Republican strategist and columnist Arianna
Huffington says the GOP leadership should think twice about running
ads swiping at Clinton's honesty when Gingrich and the GOP deceived
the public last week by caving into the White House budget. ``Let
the best liar win,'' Huffington said. (Carr, Atlanta

USWEST (Washington) - When a federal audit of USWest and other Baby
Bells is completed in a few weeks, it's expected to show that some
telephone equipment is missing, according to congressional
regulators and US West itself. In fact, a lot of equipment - $5
billion dollars' worth. That means customers in Arizona and around
the rest of the country may have been overcharged by millions of
dollars for telephone service. When he found out about the
discrepancies between inventory and claims, Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va.,
chairman of the House Commerce Committee, fired off a letter to FCC
Chairman William Kennard ordering him to determine whether there
had been ``negligent management or willful misrepresentation'' by
the Bell companies. Meanwhile Sen. John McCain, chairman of the
Senate Commerce Committee, hung back, saying he'd wait for the
results of the full audit. The difference between their reactions
is being blamed on one big thing: money, specifically, campaign
contributions, and even more specifically, donations from USWest,
an aggressive player of the election money game. By ADRIANNE FLYNN.

SOUTH AFRICAN PANEL TO WITHHOLD DATA IMPLICATING DE KLERK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Facing a court challenge, the Truth
and Reconciliation Commission said Wednesday that it would
withhold, at least temporarily, the parts of its final report that
implicate South Africa's last apartheid-era president, F.W. de
Klerk, in illegal acts.
</P>
<P>
   De Klerk, 62, who helped negotiate the end of South Africa's
white supremacist government and shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize
with President Nelson Mandela for that work, had objected to a
finding by the commission that he was ``an accessory after the
fact'' in the bombings of the headquarters of a church group and of
a labor federation in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the 17-member panel, Archbishop Desmond Tutu,
said that although he took such action with ``great reluctance,''
the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal challenge.
He said it would take de Klerk's name out of 3,500-page report to
avoid delaying its release Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It upsets me deeply,'' he said in a statement. ``We have been
scrupulously fair to de Klerk, and we reject the contention that we
have been engaged in a vendetta against him.''
</P>
<P>
   De Klerk's challenge was only part of the storm of criticism
prompted by leaks about the report in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the commission decision to withdraw its findings
on de Klerk, it was facing the possibility of a new suit _ this
time from the ruling African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The ANC also wants to block the commission findings about its
conduct during the liberation struggle. A spokesman for the party,
Thabo Masebe, said the party would seek an injunction in the
morning before the report is officially handed over to Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   While the commission's report is expected to lay overwhelming
blame on the former white government for atrocities, it has also
found the ANC responsible for human-rights violations, including
the torture and killing of spying suspects, bombings in civilian
areas and the killing of political enemies, including members of
the rival Zulu-based Inkhata Freedom Party.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The decision on de Klerk seems certain to damage the
commission's credibility. The panel, created as a way of putting
South Africa's brutal past to rest without the expense and
political divisiveness of trials, has caused controversy from the
start. It has held more than 160 hearings throughout the country,
listening to both victims and to perpetrators seeking amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   But many whites say the commission is on a witch hunt aiming to
humiliate former government officials and Afrikaners in general. De
Klerk has once before forced the commission officials to court and
won an apology from them for calling him a liar. Some political
analysts said Wednesday's events would only further the belief that
the panel lacks impartiality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The withdrawal of the findings can't help but be seen as a
lack of certainty on their side,'' said Sampie Terreblanche, an
economist and political analyst at the University of Stellenbosch,
who has supported the commission. ``Whether we like it or not, the
whole report gets a knock from this.''
</P>
<P>
   De Klerk's spokesman, David Steward, said the former president
``was very confident'' that he would win when the case goes to
trial in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very happy to be in the courts now rather than dealing
with the Truth Commission,'' Steward said. ``The fact that they
agreed to withdraw creates the definite impression that they
specifically concocted a case to involve Mr. de Klerk in a negative
finding.''
</P>
<P>
   The ANC has accused the commission of trying to ``criminalize''
the liberation struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the efforts to besmirch our struggle by denouncing it
as a gross violation of human rights,'' the congress said in a
statement. ``The ANC and the millions of people who were part of
this struggle will always be proud of what they did to insure that,
in the process of the destruction of a vile system, they did not
themselves resort to vile methods of struggle on the basis that the
means justified the end.''
</P>
<P>
   There are probably few subjects that get South Africans more
excited than the issue of the Truth Commission and whether it is a
worthy cause or a waste of money. The events of the last few days
have only added to the debate.
</P>
<P>
   For some, like Pal Martins, 34, a former member of the ANC's
armed wing, the fact all sides of the political spectrum are in an
uproar is a good thing. ``The mere fact that everyone is
complaining means that the Truth Commission has done its work,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But others say that too many questions are being raised about
the panel's competence. ``The whole affair is beyond the pale, a
mockery of justice,'' said Roboy Vonholdt, a 56-year-old sheep and
ostrich farmer who believes that the commission has been a
theatrical act. ``We should all turn our backs on the past and move
forward. We need them and they need us. Let's all make money and
let good economic conditions prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's report is supposed to be a broad and detailed
summary of South Africa's human rights history, from 1960 to 1994,
when elections open to all races ended white minority rule. It will
parcel out moral condemnations and recommend individual
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   While de Klerk was alone in court Wednesday challenging the
commission, Tutu said Wednesday that other threatened legal
challenges had led to fewer individuals being named as rights
violators than originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu said that more than 400 people had been notified that they
would be implicated to give them a chance to respond. Some 15
successfully argued themselves out of the report or could not be
reached and were therefore deleted from the report, he said. The
commission is required by law to give advance notification to
anyone it intends to implicate in its report.
</P>
<P>
   The commission had been expected to say that although de Klerk
did not order the bombings, he subsequently came to know that
former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police Commissioner
Johan van der Merwe had been involved, but failed to report his
knowledge to the police.
</P>
<P>
   This could open him up to a criminal prosecution. De Klerk has
not applied for amnesty in this matter or any other.
</P>
<P>
   de Klerk has said that when he learned about the bombings, Vlok
and Van der Merwe were already in the process of applying for
amnesty, and he did not think it was necessary to report the
matter.

JAPAN MAY USE GIFT CERTIFICATES TO SPUR CONSUMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also JAPAN-LUXURY, moving in ``f'' category)) 
(mk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A senior adviser to Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said in
an interview Wednesday that the government was highly likely to
adopt a plan to issue gift certificates in an effort to spur
consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   Although widely regarded here as little more than a gimmick, the
plan is being closely watched as a measure of the Obuchi
administration's political desperation. Despite opposition from the
Finance Ministry, corporate executives and economists, the
government may well agree to it as the price for bolstering its
shaky support in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party lacks a majority in the Upper
House, a deficit that the opposition used skillfully to shape major
sections of banking legislation to its liking and otherwise make
trouble for the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   The gift certificates are a brainchild of Komeito and Heiwa
Keikaku, opposition parties heavily influenced by a lay Buddhist
organization, Soka Gakkai. The parties have been flirting with an
alliance with the Liberal Democrats for a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Komeito has 24 members in the Upper House, which would give
Obuchi the minimum number of votes, 127, needed to secure a
majority there.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been urgently seeking a way to beef up its
parliamentary power before the beginning of the next session, which
could start at the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
   The governing party, riven with dissension after its
embarrassing failure to secure a majority in the Upper House
elections in July, is concerned that it might be unable to derail a
motion of no-confidence in the next session.
</P>
<P>
   Komeito and Heiwa Keikaku, effectively the Upper and Lower House
branches of the same party, contend that the gift certificates
would be more effective than tax cuts in having consumers spend,
because they could not tuck the vouchers into savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think probably the government will have to do it as a matter
of political agreement, although I'm not really for the idea,''
Obuchi's chief adviser on taxes, Hiroshi Kato, said.
</P>
<P>
   Kato said he had advised Obuchi against the plan, but did not
give his opinion much chance of swaying the prime minister. ``In
order to pass legislation, if they ally with the parties that have
proposed this plan, then it will be easier to pass bills,'' he
said. ``So in order to gain an ally in the Upper House it's
possible the party will do this.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the prime minister, Akitaka Saiki, said any
speculation about a deal between the Liberal Democrats and Komeito
was premature, although he conceded that the plan was under ``very
serious consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Saiki said that there were numerous logistical and practical
question marks hanging over the gift-certificate plan and that
although a political agreement to support the plan might be
reached, it might prove to be impossible to put into effect.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``making nice'' to Komeito, the Liberal Democrats
have been seeking to repair relations with Ichiro Ozawa, a former
party member who leads the opposition Liberal Party. Ozawa's career
seemed over last year, when the opposition party he had previously
led disbanded in a flurry of name-calling and acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   But he now finds himself in the catbird seat, being wooed most
assiduously by senior Liberal Democrats, including the powerful
chief cabinet secretary, Hiromi Nonaka. Nonaka recently met with
senior Liberal Party members and announced that he had ``started to
feel that we have the same hometown and the same viewpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   The gift certificates would be part of a $169 billion package,
the second this fiscal year. Komeito says that the previous plan
proved useless in provoking increased spending despite $34 billion
in tax cuts because taxpayers merely put away the additional money.
</P>
<P>
   Komeito has suggested that each certificate have a value of
$254. Economists have estimated that if the consumers spent the
certificates as they are supposed to, it would give an increase to
the economy of less than 1 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Finance Ministry, which strongly opposes the Komeito
proposal, contends that consumers can also pocket the value of the
gift certificates by using them to buy things like food and putting
the cash that they would have otherwise spent into savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot measure or foresee the effect of this voucher,'' an
official in the ministry's budget bureau said Wednesday. ``People
will use this voucher. But it's not at all clear whether it will
lead to more spending.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministry has also raised questions about the potential for
forgery, who will receive the certificates, where they can be spent
and how much the program would cost. The government would have to
pay for printing, distribution and redemption at the very least,
the budget official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it can only be used in a limited number or category of
shops, then it raises constitutional issues of the violation of
equality,'' he said. ``But if it can be used for anything any
place, then it becomes just like money and has no significance.''

 &HT;    OLD GROWTH FOREST PROTESTS AN OLD STORY FOR CANADIAN LOGGERS
 &HT;    680&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Timber companies in Canada, source of much of the
``old growth'' wood allegedly sold in Home Depot stores and other
building material outlets in the United States, are scrambling for
ways to give their products an environmentally friendlier image.
</P>
<P>
   A largely successful boycott campaign in Europe already has cut
sales of wood products from British Columbia's huge central coast
forests, David Haley, professor of forestry economics at the
University of British Columbia in Vancouver, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The forests, owned primarily by the province of British
Columbia, contain the largest areas of undisturbed temperate rain
forest left on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The threat that demonstrations and boycotts at Home Depot, now
America's largest forest products retailer, could have the same
effect in this country at a time when Asian sales are depressed
because of the economic downturn in Japan has had a seismic impact
in timber company offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``These activities in the United States are viewed very, very
seriously indeed,'' Haley said Wednesday in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our larger companies are making major changes in
their land use policies'' in order to blunt environmental concerns,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Most dramatic was the announcement in June by MacMillan Bloedel
Ltd., the province's largest in British Columbia, that it would
stop clear-cutting and come up with plans to increase the
conservation of old-growth, or virgin, forests.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Greenpeace, the environmental group in the
forefront of many of the protests over use of products from
old-growth forests in Canada, South America and Asia, shared a
bottle of champagne with company officials at a press conference
announcing the new policies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, MacMillan Bloedel also agreed to seek
``certification'' for its products by a new environmental group
that audits forest management practices and issues a ``green seal''
of approval if it concludes that a company is following
environmentally sound practices.
</P>
<P>
   Although they haven't reached agreements with organizations like
Greenpeace or the Rainforest Action Network, which staged
demonstrations against Home Depot on Wednesday in Atlanta, other
companies have applied for certification in the hope of giving
their products a greener image with retailers and perhaps blunting
any future boycotts.
</P>
<P>
   The certification plan, in which companies that meet a set of
conservation standards would be allowed to display a green seal of
approval on the door frames, plywood or other products they market,
is being pushed by a Mexico-based group called the Forest
Stewardship Council.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups including the World Wildlife Fund,
Greenpeace, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the
Rainforest Action Network are members of the stewardship council.
</P>
<P>
   So are some industry groups. The council ``audits'' forests to
make sure they are being managed in environmentally sound ways
before issuing its seal of approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studies show that people are not willing to pay more for
their forest products if they have the green seal,'' said Haley,
``but it becomes a question of market share. If the prices are
roughly equal, they will opt for the certified product.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Greenpeace has started opposing efforts by Canadian
forest product companies to obtain environmental certification for
any timber removed from the coastal forest, which environmentalists
have taken to calling the Great Bear Rainforest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also oppose that,'' said Liz Barrat-Brown, a senior
attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a group that
avoids ``direct action'' tactics such as those carried out in
Atlanta on Wednesday in favor of issuing scientific reports and
filing legal actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think no logging is appropriate in the Great Bear
Rainforest until they set aside a much more of the area for
preservation,'' Barrat-Brown added. ``So far only about 6 percent
of that forest has been preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Companies whose products have been targeted by the
demonstrations include West Frazer Timber Co., Western Forest
Products Ltd. and International Forest Products.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth, smaller company, Sawder Industries Ltd., the private
company of the chairman of International Forest Products, also has
been targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Fitzgerald, a spokesman for MacMillan Bloedel, said his
company settled with Greenpeace after years of protests. He said
that the demand that all logging in the old-growth forests cease in
favor of ``second-growth'' trees is not reasonable, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a relatively new industry, mostly having grown up
after World War II,'' he said by telephone, ``so there will be no
mature second-growth trees for another two or three decades.''

   ALANIS-MORISSETTE-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ The woman who sings
Alanis Morissette's new album sounds like a mess. In the 17 songs
on ``Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie'' (Maverick), which is to
be released on Tuesday, she has been attached to abusive men, she's
been stuffing and starving herself, she has taken too many
antibiotics, and she's been working herself to the point of
collapse. She has felt jealous, misunderstood, worthless; nothing,
from shopping to sex to wealth and worldwide popularity, has made
her happy. And every bit of trauma and frustration comes out in her
voice: in its harried vibrato and sudden yelping breaks, in its
banshee wails and caustic nasal turns. While her litany of
self-doubt is set in the past tense, the wounds still sound raw. By

   ROCKERS-PARENTHOOD (Undated) _ In 1998, though, rock and its

MTV Music Video Awards, the rapper and actor Will Smith accepted
his awards accompanied by his 5-year-old son, Justin; Smith's
current single, ``Just the Two of Us,'' is an ebullient ode to the
boy. Billie Joe, of the punk band Green Day, focused his awards
speech on his wife, at home awaiting the birth of their second
child. Performers included two cutting-edge mother figures:
Courtney Love of Hole and the evening's big winner, Madonna, whose
latest album, ``Ray of Light'' describes her spiritual awakening
after the birth of her daughter, Lourdes. Rock-and-roll, the
cultural home of perpetual adolescence, was clearly engaging the

terrorists, hijackers, kidnappers and Islamic militants. ``Usually
I play the bad guy role, a terrorist or someone,'' Badreya said by
telephone from Egypt, where he is on a film shoot with Al Pacino,
playing the head of the military wing of Hezbollah. After years of
virtual invisibility, Arab-Americans are finally finding prominence
in Hollywood movies _ as terrorists and villains. They are only the
latest in a long line of ethnic groups and nationalities cast in
sterotypical bad-guy roles, from American Indians to Germans to
Japanese to African Americans to Russians. By Laurie Goodstein.

   HANGING-ROCK-VIDEO (Undated) _ A sweetly knowing look crosses
the face of the lovely young Miranda. ``You must learn to love
someone else apart from me, Sara,'' she says to a schoolmate. ``I
won't be here much longer.'' It never becomes clear how Miranda
knows that, but in Peter Weir's ``Picnic at Hanging Rock,'' as
mysterious as ever in two new video editions, just about everything
keeps us guessing. What we do know is that the year is 1900, that
the location is central Australia and that by sundown on Saint
Valentine's Day, Miranda (Anne Lambert) and two other students at

   CATS-VIDEO (Undated) _ Is it a vaudeville show? An oratorio? A
singing and dancing storybook? A live-action cartoon? An
environmental theater piece? A pretentious pop allegory (with
Christian symbolism) that compares the feline condition to the
human one? At various times, ``Cats,'' the indestructible Andrew
Lloyd Webber megahit, is all of the above. Restaged for home video
by David Mallet, does ``Cats,'' which will be shown Monday night at
8 o'clock on PBS, work on the small screen? Yes and no. By Stephen
Holden. (Moved).

   SCORSESE-SCHRADER-FILM (New York) _ P ERCHED on a director's
chair at Eighth Avenue and 44th Street one recent midnight, Martin
Scorsese is somewhere he never expected to be: directing a movie
again on his native city's mean streets. Nor did he ever expect to
be working again from a script by Paul Schrader, with whom he
collaborated on cinematic landmarks like ``Taxi Driver'' and
``Raging Bull,'' and with whom he believed he would never work
again. How Mr. Scorsese came to be here, shooting ``Bringing Out
the Dead,'' which Mr. Schrader adapted from a recently published
first novel by Joe Connelly, is in part a typical movie-business
tale of switching gears because of logistical delays in the filming
of ``Dino,'' based on the life of Dean Martin. By Jean Nathan.

   SWAN-LAKE-DANCE (Undated) _ Matthew Bourne'S production of
``Swan Lake'' opened on Broadway as something of an anomaly. Word
from Los Angeles, where the production played last year, was that
the show was touching but campy. Earlier reviews in England, where
the show originated, tended to dwell on what this ``Swan Lake'' was
not, particularly among the older dance critics. By Jennifer
Dunning. (Moved).

<P>
   ADAM-COOPER-DANCE (Undated) _ Adam Cooper looks more like a
young club hipster than an elegantly refined ballet prince, despite
his shining pedigree as a principal dancer who played such regal
roles at England's Royal Ballet. He is dancing a lead in ``Swan
Lake'' these days once more, but not as the ballet's lovesick
prince. Instead, Cooper plays a powerful male swan and his
counterpart, a sneering piece of rough trade, in Matthew Bourne's
exuberantly irreverent adaptation of ``Swan Lake,'' now playing on
Broadway at the Neil Simon Theater. By Jennifer Dunning. (Moved).

   LITTLE-ME-THEATER (Undated) _ In the early fall of 1962, a group
of New York theater artists ventured down to Philadelphia to try
out a new musical comedy, ``Little Me,'' based on a racy novel by
Patrick Dennis. In terms of comedy and drama, they found, offstage
events sometimes rivaled those in the show: a bathroom sink
untimely ripped from a wall, a police officer commandeered to
arrest the creative team, and a world teetering on the brink of
nuclear annihilation. In recent interviews, Sic Caesar, Cy Coleman,
Cy Feuer and Neil Simon _ who has written about the show in his
1996 memoir, ``Rewrites'' _ remembered the days they spent together
36 years ago in a Manhattan rehearsal hall, at the Erlanger Theater
in Philadelphia and at the Lunt-Fontanne on Broadway. By Mervyn

   MARTIN-SHORT-THEATER (Undated) _ On Broadway, Martin Short has
been lifting off every night in previews of the Roundabout Theater
Company revival of ``Little Me,'' the 1962 musical comedy for which
Neil Simon wrote the book. In the show, which opens on Nov. 12, he
plays not one but seven men in the life of Belle Poitrine, nee
Schlumpfert, the curvaceous beauty turned tell-all memoirist from
Drifter's Row (portrayed by Faith Prince). As those he works with
know, Short is a master at appearing spontaneous in a completely
scripted situation, creating a sense of suspense during a
performance that keeps an audience wondering what will happen next.

   SUSANNAH-OPERA (Undated) _ Quick, name the most often performed
full-length American opera. It's not ``Porgy and Bess,'' which was
banished from the opera house for decades and branded a highbrow
musical. It's not ``West Side Story,'' which was intended for
Broadway despite the fact that Bernstein, late in life, gave it
some operatic trappings. And it's not ``Amahl and the Night
Visitors,'' which, since it was commissioned by a television

<P>
   OPERA-WORDS (Undated) _ Words, words, words: opera finds it hard
to do without them. In the 1950s, the German composer Boris Blacher
wrote a wordless ``abstract opera,'' to which he gave the imposing
title ``Abstract Opera No. 1,'' though he never repeated the
experiment. He left that to Gyorgy Ligeti, who in the next decade
wrote ``Adventures,'' followed by ``New Adventures,'' for three
singers who communicate with one another and with their audience by
nonverbal means: muttering, cajoling, shrieking in surprise. And in
the decade after that, Philip Glass, in ``Einstein on the Beach,''
and Karlheinz Stockhausen, in ``Thursday,'' dispensed for long
stretches not only with words but also with onstage singers, to
create opera as mime. But these will probably remain special cases.
Opera in general needs singers, and singers need words. The
problems start when we come to what the audience needs. By Paul
Griffiths. (Moved).

will remain nameless for obvious reasons told me she was worried
about her forthcoming show, not because the work was causing her
more than the usual anxiety but because her gallery happens not to
be in Chelsea. Unfortunately, I knew what she meant. At last count,
around 60 galleries had colonized the area roughly between 17th
Street and 27th Street on the far West Side of Manhattan. I spent a
couple of days recently making the rounds of the neighborhood. I

from the 1930s and 1940s were displayed in quaint, old-fashioned

 &HT;    CLINTON ANNOUNCES AIDS HELP FOR MINORITIES
 &HT;    Eds: Inserts 2nd graf with Clinton quote.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Warning of a ``severe and ongoing'' AIDS crisis in
minority communities, President Clinton announced a $156 million
program Wednesday to combat the spread of the disease among African
Americans and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is picking on the most vulnerable among us,'' Clinton said
at a news conference. ``The fact is, HIV infection is one of the
most deadly health disparities between African Americans, Hispanics
and White Americans, and just as we have committed to help build
one America by ending the racial and ethnic disparities and infant
mortality and cancer and other diseases, we must use all our power
to end the growing disparities in HIV and AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   The new initiative includes a prevention campaign, improved
access to drug treatments, training for health professionals who
treat the disease and federal ``crisis response teams'' that the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will dispatch to
areas highly affected by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   While overall AIDS deaths have declined for two years in a row,
AIDS remains the leading killer of African-American men age 25-44
and the second leading killer of African-American women in the same
age group. African Americans account for more than 40 percent of
all new HIV/AIDS cases, and Hispanics represent over 20 percent of
new cases of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In many minority communities, ``there's still a misconception
that this is a gay disease and that other people aren't at risk,''
said Sandy Thurman, director of the White House Office of AIDS
Policy. For that reason, she said, part of the new program will be
to explain the wider dangers of infection to people in these
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be targeted prevention efforts'' to ``raise
awareness and erase the stigma'' sometimes associated with the
disease, Thurman said. ``We be making sure the messages are in
language in that people use and understand and that is culturally
sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, for instance, the program will look ``to the
leadership in the African American church community'' to ``talk
openly to congregations about AIDS,'' explained Thurman, 44, a
Georgia native who headed AIDS Atlanta before joining the 1992
Clinton presidential campaign. The program might enlist volunteers
from the sororities and fraternities at the city's historically
black colleges to help get out its message, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The program will also increase access to new drug therapies at
the city's neighborhood health centers and train the health care
providers there in AIDS prevention and treatment, Thurman said. The
most effective response is community based or ``home-grown,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Personifying this community-based activism, perhaps, is Denise
Stokes, an AIDS educational consultant from Atlanta who introduced
Clinton at Wednesday's announcement. Diagnosed with AIDS 12 years
ago, Stokes ``is one of the first people to put a face on
heterosexual HIV infection,'' said organizers of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the funding for the minority AIDS program was
provided in the Omnibus Appropriations Act that Congress passed and
Clinton signed into law last week. The remainder will come from the
HHS budget.

CLINTON FIRES BACK AT REPUBLICANS TRYING TO TURN ELECTIONS INTO
SCANDAL REFERENDUM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton fired back Wednesday at
Republicans who are trying to turn the Nov. 3 elections into a
referendum on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, saying that he believes
most Americans accept the fact that he made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the American people have seen in me over the last few
weeks a real commitment to doing what I told them I would do from
the beginning, to try to atone to them for what happened and to try
to redouble my efforts to be a good president,'' Clinton said.
``And I hope they have sensed the inner changes that have been
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the comments during a joint news conference with
visiting Colombian President Andres Pastrana where he was asked to
respond to a $10 million ad campaign launched by Republicans last
night in an attempt to make the Lewinsky scandal an issues in
congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican ads ask Americans whether they're willing to
``reward'' Clinton for lying about his relationship with Lewinsky
by helping to elect more Democrats to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The president said Republicans are ``free to make the election
about whatever they want to make the election about'' to attract
votes. But he said he thinks Americans will be turned off by the
ads and will end up voting based on ``what's best for them and
their families.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to sugarcoat the fact that I made a mistake and
that I didn't want anybody to know about it,'' the president said.
``I think I've talked about that. The American people have had
quite a decent amount of exposure to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope very much that they have seen that I'm doing my best to
atone for it. I hope they can sense the rededication and the
intensified efforts I am making for the cause of peace around the
world, for the cause of prosperity at home,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP ads also ask Americans to think about what they should
tell their children about Clinton's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The president offered an answer to that one himself, saying the
lesson from his handling of the Lewinsky matters is that ``when
someone makes a mistake they should admit it and try to rectify
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are hoping the ads will raise questions in
voters minds about whether Clinton can be trusted to carry on in
the job that he has held for nearly six years.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said he believes the verdict is already in on that
question too. That's why he charges that Republicans are trying to
``divert'' attention from important issues like saving Social
Security, modernizing schools and giving patients more rights in
making decisions about their own health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair for a person to be judged on his whole
record,'' Clinton said. ``If you look at what I said I'd do when I
presented myself to the American people in 1991 and 1992, at the
long list of things we've done ... the American people I think
agree with us and not them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the real issue here. Are we right or are they
right?'' Clinton continued, calling the election ``a clear choice''
for voters on issues that really make a difference in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used his appearance with Pastrana to announce that the
budget surplus for the 1998 fiscal year amounted to $70 billion.
The surplus is the first since 1969, and the Democrats are hopeful
that they can use it to their advantage in the elections next
Tuesday by arguing that Republicans are ready to spend it on tax
cuts rather than shoring up Social Security as Clinton has
advocated.
</P>
<P>
   While most Republicans also favor using the surplus to help save
the Social Security program, many conservative members believe that
can be done while a tax cut. &QL;

 &HT;    AOL A PRISONER IN INTERNET BROWSER WARS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON ``How much do we need to pay you to screw Netscape?''
Microsoft chairman Bill Gates asked key executives of America
OnLine, which has grown into the nation's largest doorway into the
Internet. ``This is your lucky day.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Microsoft paid AOL nothing in January 1996,
when the question was raised. But it gave AOL a highly valued icon
on its Windows 95 desktop and got in return a bargain that vaulted
its then largely untested Internet Explorer into a primary slot for
AOL customers, at the expense of Netscape, which had also sought to
make a deal with AOL.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made us an offer we couldn't refuse,'' George Vradenburg,
AOL's general counsel, said on Wednesday. He spoke to a reporter on
the steps of the federal courthouse here, where Microsoft is on
trial, charged by the Justice Department and the attorney generals
of 20 states with having broken the antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Gates' query to AOL, as quoted in court documents, reflects the
bitter battles in the high technology arena which have led the
government to file its most significant antitrust case in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Within the courtroom itself, the browser wars between Microsoft
and Netscape were vented all day long through sheaf upon sheaf of
hitherto secret documents, unearthed for the landmark trial.
</P>
<P>
   And AOL was being cast in the testimony as the swing vote first
having thrown in with Netscape and then in March 1996 switching its
allegiance to Microsoft as it sought to leverage itself against a
threat from the software giant's then new online service.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Microsoft lawyers put into the trial record a
draft e-mail written in October 1995 by AOL chief executive Stephen
Case that quoted approvingly from Netscape co-founder Marc
Andreesen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with just about everything Marc said,'' the Case
message read, ``including his concluding paragraph: 'we can either
be both defeatist and give up the battle now, or we can use our
unique respective strengths to go kick the out of the Beast from
Redmond that wants to see us both dead ... I think it's clear that
we have enough respective strength to give it a hell of a try.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you still trying to do that with the 'Beast from
Redmond?'' boomed Microsoft lawyer John Warden, refusing to repeat
the obscenity that he had read into the record moments earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what AOL was trying to do from our perspective was to
compete,'' the witness, AOL senior vice president David Colburn,
replied evenly. Colburn had been charged with handling the
competitive negotiations with Microsoft and Netscape that
eventually led to Microsoft's victory.
</P>
<P>
   Under fire from Warden, Colburn repeatedly backed the
government's charge that Microsoft won the important 1996 deal as a
result of its Windows monopoly and not, as Warden sought to show,
by virtue of Microsoft's superior browser technology.
</P>
<P>
   Warden also accused AOL of doing precisely what the government
has accused Microsoft of doing: seeking to divide markets. As he
laced into Colburn, the Microsoft attorney put into the record the
terms of a draft agreement calling for AOL and Netscape not to
compete against each other in their respective main lines of
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think there ought to be two sets of rules,''
Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray said into microphones arrayed on
the courthouse steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The antitrust rules make a big distinction between what a
monopolist may do and what a non-monopolist may do,'' David Boies,
the government's lead trustbuster said in the same forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``They only had a tiny fraction of the business each was willing
to stay away from,'' Boies added. ``What Microsoft wanted Netscape
to do was quite a different matter. (Microsoft) would then have had
a browser monopoly on top of its Windows monopoly.''

   BRAZIL-ECON (Sao Paulo) _ Brazil's finance minister, Pedro
Malan, announces details of Brazil's austerity measures, including
tax increases and spending cuts. A central feature is a tax on all
financial transactions, from checks to bank withdrawals to stock
market investments. The plan would raise the tax paid on those
transactions to 0.38 percent from 0.2 percent now. A tax on
corporate earnings will rise to 3 percent from 2 percent. The most
sensitive measure would raise the social security tax paid by
government employees and _ for the first time _ collect the tax
from retired civil servants. The extra revenue is expected to come
to $2.2 billion. The actions are expected to slow the economy and
increase unemployment. By Diana Jean Schemo.

   CHILE-PINOCHET (London) _ The London High Court rules in favor
of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's claim against his arrest in England and
possible extradition to Spain on charges of genocide and torture.
But the justices order him detained pending appeals, expected next
week. By Warren Hoge.

   SCI-AIDS-COCKTAIL (Undated) _ Two attempts to simplify the
burdensome schedule of medications prescribed to suppress HIV
infection have failed, allowing resurgence of the virus,
researchers are reporting in studies involving nearly 600 patients.
The two studies were designed to test an idea on which many
scientists and patients had pinned their hopes: that therapy
combining three powerful antiviral drugs, the ``cocktail,'' might
diminish HIV infection to such a low level that the virus could
then be kept in check by fewer drugs and the body's own immune
system. That way, instead of having to take the triple combination
for life, as some experts had predicted would be necessary,
patients might be able to back off and escape some of the side
effects, inconvenience and expense. By Denise Grady. 1,200 words.

   NY-PATAKI-PROFILE (Undated) _ Gov. George Pataki has made a

   SAFRANBOLU, Turkey _ Festive banners fluttered from lampposts
and windows as a troupe of young folk dancers prepared to mount a
makeshift stage here on Saturday morning. Like tens of millions of
Turks across the country this week, they were joining in
celebrations of their country's 75th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   One dancer, Gulcan Eran, 16, seemed a symbol of Turkey itself.
She is thoroughly modern and Western-oriented, vibrant,
self-confident and ambitious for a career as an engineer. But as
Ms. Eran adjusted her resplendent costume, two young women wearing
traditional headscarfs walked across the plaza nearby. She turned
serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't object if the scarf was just about religion, but it
isn't anymore,'' she said. ``It's a political uniform. It's a way
of saying that you want to get rid of the secular republic. I think
it's very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Turks who are gathering this week for festivities ranging from
poetry recitals to kick-boxing matches have much reason for
self-congratulation. Their country has made a giant leap from
backwardness to modernity in 75 years, and the nearly two dozen
foreign leaders who are due at the central commemoration in Ankara
on Thursday reflect its role as a regional power.
</P>
<P>
   But as Turkey seeks to establish a stable democracy for its 65
million people, it also confronts several persistent problems.
Defining the role of religion in public life is only the most
visible.
</P>
<P>
   Both Turkey's achievements and its looming challenges are
clearly visible here in Safranbolu, a pleasant town of 20,000
nestled in the rocky Anatolian plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Safranbolu is known for its 19th-century Ottoman buildings, and
attracts a modest stream of tourists. Some residents till small
farms on outlying hills. Others work at a steel mill in nearby
Karabuk that offers employment to thousands but also casts a rancid
cloud over the town.
</P>
<P>
   The streets here are tree-shaded, houses are sturdy and well
kept, schools are full and clinics modern. Shops offer all manner
of domestic and imported goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a lot of progress in 75 years,'' said Ozcan Cakir,
45, manager of a small candy factory in Safranbolu. ``This will
never be a backward or Middle East-type country again. But I worry
about the future. There's hunger in Turkey. I can afford to send my
kids to college, but people who work for me can't. That produces
resentment, and in 10 or 15 years that resentment could bring
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Several portraits of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who proclaimed the
Turkish Republic on Oct. 29, 1923, decorate Cakir's salesroom. They
mark him as a dedicated supporter of the secular order. But at the
jewelry store next door, there is no Ataturk portrait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-five percent of our people don't support this kind of
secularism,'' said the jeweler, Ahmet Pulcu, suggesting that he is
among them. ``The rest have no idea what religion is. They don't
want our women to wear headscarfs. But why shouldn't they? Isn't
that democracy?''
</P>
<P>
   In Safranbolu, as in many Turkish cities and towns, measurably
more women wear headscarfs than wore them only a couple of years
ago. It is a sign of growing religiosity that the Islamic movement
welcomes and encourages. But it disturbs some secularists, among
them military officers.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish universities have imposed a ban on the wearing of
headscarfs by female students. The ban has given Islamic
politicians a vivid political issue, and they have seized on it.
They are crisscrossing the country telling voters that their
daughters are being excluded from tax-supported universities simply
because they are devout Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The air force commander, Gen. Ilhan Kilic, vowed in a recent
speech that the military would fight every effort aimed at
``undermining this system and turning the country into an
anachronism.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Turks say that this uncompromising attitude guarantees the
survival of the secular republic. But others fear that it is
polarizing the nation and perhaps setting the stage for
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the issues of social justice and religious
fundamentalism, Turkey also confronts the question of how to deal
with its large Kurdish minority. That issue, like the others, is
palpable here in Safranbolu.
</P>
<P>
   On a hillside just a few minutes' walk from the town center is
Safranbolu's Kurdish quarter. To enter it is to pass from the
developed world into poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The town's 700 Kurds live in ramshackle cabins without running
water. Many are dirty, poorly dressed and have open sores on their
faces or arms. Almost all are unemployed. They live on what little
they can grow in gardens, and on cow intestines and other cuts of
meat that the town butcher can't sell anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're Turks, but second-class,'' said Bilal Cetinceviz, 65, a
community leader. ``People don't like us or don't trust us. When we
apply for jobs, we don't get hired. Our kids don't go to school
because we can't afford to buy them books and clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have no work, you have nothing to lose,'' Cetinceviz
continued. ``Every once in a while some radical Kurd shows up here
and tries to turn us into militants. We throw them out, but if we
didn't, in six months everyone here would be a militant.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The divide between Kurds and non-Kurds in Safranbolu reflects
the gap in Turkey as a whole. Many Kurds have risen to leading
positions in every walk of life, but many others have been left
behind by Turkey's economic boom. While coastal regions thrive, the
mainly Kurdish southeast is impoverished and unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   Kurdish guerrillas have been fighting a separatist war in
southeastern provinces for 14 years. Thirty thousand people have
been killed in the conflict. It costs an estimated $8 billion a
year to wage, and ties down more than 200,000 Turkish soldiers.
Urging the army to try negotiating a peace settlement is considered
close to treasonous.
</P>
<P>
   The questions of poverty, fundamentalism and Kurdish identity
hang over Safranbolu just as they do over the rest of Turkey. Over
the last two years, however, a new topic has emerged at cafes and
teahouses.
</P>
<P>
   Spectacular disclosures about ties between gangsters and the
government have shaken public faith in the political system.
Phrases like ``black money'' and ``state gangs'' are now part of
everyday conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The spreading scandal has produced grave allegations against
several of the country's past and present leaders, but
investigations have been limited. Turkey's judiciary is not fully
independent, and magistrates do not have unfettered freedom to
pursue cases against political figures. Cynicism is growing, even
among many who until recently refused to believe that agencies of
their government could ever have sponsored death squads or
tolerated drug smuggling or other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you read every day is mafia, crime and gangs,'' said Aybar
Toker, the local soft drink bottler. ``People think all the
established parties are involved, so they vote for the Islamic
party as a protest.''
</P>
<P>
   If Turkey's greatest challenge in the years ahead is to forge a
national consensus over how to establish full democracy here, it
must have political leaders who can lead the way. Yet many Turks
believe that the political system is closed to them. Parties are
run by bosses who tolerate little dissent, and as a result many
talented men and women shun politics in favor of business, academia
or journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that our political system is very closed, but
business people are beginning to take a much greater role in
society, and they aren't bound by all these taboos,'' said Yuksel
Oktay, 61, an American-educated engineer who grew up in Safranbolu
and visits periodically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also see a great potential in our youth. They understand
what is at stake here, and they won't let Turkey slip backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have problems, but I think most Turks would be optimistic
about our chances of solving them,'' Oktay said. ``I certainly
am.''

DALLAS' PRIVATE SCHOOL FOR GAYS LETS TEENS BE THEMSELVES
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Michael Raines didn't know he was gay in high school,
but his classmates sensed something different about him, and they
made him pay.
</P>
<P>
   At band camp during ninth grade, they tied his wrists to a post
and passed a sentence on him ``for being homosexual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was literally held up for ridicule,'' Raines says, sitting
behind a table at Dallas' Walt Whitman Community School, where he
teaches British and American literature. ``I wish I had had the
opportunity to go to a gay and lesbian high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Raines now teaches at one and wants to give his
students what he never felt as a teen-ager: a sense of self-worth.
</P>
<P>
   Now in its second year, the country's first private school
explicitly dedicated to that goal finds itself comfortably treading
academic waters _ even taking a few tentative strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Whitman has more than doubled its enrollment, moved into
its own space and, according to co-founder Becky Thompson, forced
the local community to confront the existence of gay and lesbian
teens.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 students registered this year, most identify
themselves as gay or lesbian, but heterosexual students are
welcome. The common denominator is the understanding that tolerance
comes first.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, the students gather in the 1-story office
building's central space, which functions as a classroom, lunchroom
and pseudo-auditorium. The staff members look more like camp
counselors than teachers. Classes are tiny, no more than five or
six students.
</P>
<P>
   A bookcase in a central classroom offers titles most public
school libraries wouldn't dare stock: ``The Penguin Book of
Homosexual Verse,'' ``Contemporary Gay &AMP; Lesbian Plays,'' ``Loving
Someone Gay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very open'' about sexuality, Thompson says. Discussions
of HIV and AIDS and frank talk about sex are part of the Life
Skills course all students take.
</P>
<P>
   DROPOUTS RETURN
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Martinez dropped out of W.T. White High School in Dallas
after several years of abuse by other students. ``I was too scared
to go to class, and I was too scared to tell my teachers,'' says
Martinez, at 21 the oldest Walt Whitman student.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez scrapped the idea of getting a GED because what he
really wants is the high-school experience _ a prom, a graduation
ceremony _ and Walt Whitman can provide that in a safe, supportive
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``In public school, you get harassed if you're out,'' says Amy
McKenna, 16, who attends Walt Whitman with her girlfriend,
Courtney, 18. ``People don't understand it, you don't make real
friends and it lowers your self-esteem. Here, you don't have to
hide it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Amy nor Courtney was officially ``out'' in public
school. Courtney always had boyfriends ``just to cover the fact
that I was gay.'' Amy says teachers complained that she spent too
much time playing sports.
</P>
<P>
   By last spring, Courtney had dropped out of school and was
living with friends. Amy, whose parents are divorced, was averaging
one or two days a week at school when she moved in with her father.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and Pamala Stone created Walt Whitman as a safety net
for teens like Amy and Courtney. A great many fall through the
cracks, according to statistics from the Hetrick-Martin Institute
and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of gay, lesbian and bisexual teens say they feel
isolated _ from family, peers and information about their
sexuality; half are rejected by their parents; drug and alcohol use
are two to three times more prevalent among them; and their suicide
rates are nearly triple the national figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying we want all gay and lesbian kids down here,''
says Thompson. ``That was the first misunderstanding people had
about us. Most of the kids, especially the upperclassmen, who are
here now are saying, `It's either you or nothing. I'm not finishing
school.' ''
</P>
<P>
   OVERCOMING HURDLES
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and Stone met at Walden Preparatory School, an
alternative school in Addison where both were teachers and
administrators. In 1997, they decided to pursue a high school for
gay and lesbian teens and presented the idea to several gay youth
groups. Thompson, who is a lesbian, was not completely out at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   The Cathedral of Hope, a gay-friendly Metropolitan Community
Church, offered space in its children's center, and school
directors decided to charge $7,000 tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We opened with seven kids who couldn't afford it,'' Thompson
says. The school managed to keep its doors open with a fund-raiser,
some budget finagling and the virtual elimination of teacher
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   This year, a development director and board have assumed
responsibility for finding donors. A financial aid committee
estimates how much of the $7,000 each Walt Whitman student will pay
and how much he or she must raise. The remainder is considered a
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson emphasizes that Walt Whitman's priority is to graduate
students and prepare them for the next step, be that college or a
job. (The school is not accredited; it must be open three years
first.)
</P>
<P>
   Students must complete a standard number of credits in math,
English, history, health and science. Each is required to perform
80 hours of community service work per semester with a local
nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers at Walt Whitman also want to give gay teens role
models, and allow them to talk openly about homosexuality in the
context of classes.
</P>
<P>
   Raines' literature lesson plans, for instance, include the
contemporary Tony Kushner play ``Angels in America,'' which focuses
on AIDS, and the documentary film ``The Celluloid Closet,'' about
homosexuality and Hollywood. He opened class by quoting gay
American poet Walt Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish teacher John Lever asks his students to sign a
``Learning Agreement,'' which emphasizes respect for themselves and
others. The unspoken lesson is that you're smart, you're strong and
you're terrific just the way you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish this school didn't exist to some degree,'' Lever adds.
``I wish these kids could go to school with everybody else and be
treated the same way. But that's not a reality right now.''

hide it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Amy nor Courtney was officially ``out'' in public
school. Courtney always had boyfriends ``just to cover the fact
that I was gay.'' Amy says teachers complained that she spent too
much time playing sports.
</P>
<P>
   By last spring, Courtney had dropped out of school and was
living with friends. Amy, whose parents are divorced, was averaging
one or two days a week at school when she moved in with her father.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and Pamala Stone created Walt Whitman as a safety net
for teens like Amy and Courtney. A great many fall through the
cracks, according to statistics from the Hetrick-Martin Institute
and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of gay, lesbian and bisexual teens say they feel
isolated _ from family, peers and information about their
sexuality; half are rejected by their parents; drug and alcohol use
are two to three times more prevalent among them; and their suicide
rates are nearly triple the national figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying we want all gay and lesbian kids down here,''
says Thompson. ``That was the first misunderstanding people had
about us. Most of the kids, especially the upperclassmen, who are
here now are saying, `It's either you or nothing. I'm not finishing
school.' ''
</P>
<P>
   OVERCOMING HURDLES
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and Stone met at Walden Preparatory School, an
alternative school in Addison where both were teachers and
administrators. In 1997, they decided to pursue a high school for
gay and lesbian teens and presented the idea to several gay youth
groups. Thompson, who is a lesbian, was not completely out at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   The Cathedral of Hope, a gay-friendly Metropolitan Community
Church, offered space in its children's center, and school
directors decided to charge $7,000 tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We opened with seven kids who couldn't afford it,'' Thompson
says. The school managed to keep its doors open with a fund-raiser,
some budget finagling and the virtual elimination of teacher
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   This year, a development director and board have assumed
responsibility for finding donors. A financial aid committee
estimates how much of the $7,000 each Walt Whitman student will pay
and how much he or she must raise. The remainder is considered a
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson emphasizes that Walt Whitman's priority is to graduate
students and prepare them for the next step, be that college or a
job. (The school is not accredited; it must be open three years
first.)
</P>
<P>
   Students must complete a standard number of credits in math,
English, history, health and science. Each is required to perform
80 hours of community service work per semester with a local
nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers at Walt Whitman also want to give gay teens role
models, and allow them to talk openly about homosexuality in the
context of classes.
</P>
<P>
   Raines' literature lesson plans, for instance, include the
contemporary Tony Kushner play ``Angels in America,'' which focuses
on AIDS, and the documentary film ``The Celluloid Closet,'' about
homosexuality and Hollywood. He opened class by quoting gay
American poet Walt Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish teacher John Lever asks his students to sign a
``Learning Agreement,'' which emphasizes respect for themselves and
others. The unspoken lesson is that you're smart, you're strong and
you're terrific just the way you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish this school didn't exist to some degree,'' Lever adds.
``I wish these kids could go to school with everybody else and be
treated the same way. But that's not a reality right now.''

OUTBURSTS AND CHOLESTEROL LINKED

<P>
   It's not the anger, it's how you express it.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics and neurotics _ hostile types who feel angry but seldom
take it out on others _ are less at risk for high cholesterol than
their upfront-and-in-your-face counterparts, researchers report in
the current issue of ``Annals of Behavioral Medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Hostility has long been linked with cardiovascular disease, but
researchers at Duke University Medical Center recently studied
different types of hostility and found that people who express
their anger verbally and physically are much more likely to have
high cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Antagonistic hostility is a strong predictor of heart disease,
but neurotic hostility is not at all associated with cardiovascular
risks, researchers conclude. In other words, the expression of
anger matters much more than the anger itself.
</P>
<P>
   COPING WITH ADD
</P>
<P>
   Extensive online resources to help parents and teachers identify
attention deficit disorder are available this school year. The new
Web site www.mediconsult.com//add// also provides tools for coping
at home and at school, as well as an online support group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of kids are labeled by teachers, parents and school
administrators as difficult, troublesome and disruptive students,''
says Dr. Ned Hallowell, a Harvard University specialist in
identifying and treating ADD. ``In reality, most classrooms have at
least one student with ADD, and probably several. Providing the
proper diagnosis and treatment can make a world of difference for
these kids, their families, their peers and their teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site includes 50 tips on managing ADD without medicine,
as well as the latest thinking on medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   BREATH HINT
</P>
<P>
   Lick your hand and take a sniff if you want to check the status
of your breath. Licking is much more reliable than blowing into
your hand because most bacteria in the mouth live on the tongue.
Dentists recommend brushing your tongue as well as your teeth to
protect against bad breath.

 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The dark-haired man in the slate-gray turtleneck
sounded as if he were trying to explain the dynamics of the Middle
East peace process, which was nearing a crescendo as he spoke on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a society that is outlined or completely
established,'' said Amos Gitai.``It's volcanic, abrupt, with a
reality that's constantly destabilized. It's a place where the
great events of history crawl into the bedroom and don't leave you
a moment of silence, where you are constantly called to give an
opinion, even if you just want to enjoy a moment of quiet.
Everything you do is a testament to memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than talking about the complications of making peace,
Gitai, perhaps Israel's best-known film director, was talking about
the challenge of creating cinema, a process that for Israeli
filmmakers has often been as taxing, contentious and flawed as the
currents of diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Gitai was in New York as part of the Film Society of Lincoln
Center's series ``Creating a Nation: The Cinema of Israel,'' which
opened on Saturday and runs through Nov. 11. The festival traces
the evolution from the first films of the Zionist movement, like
the two rare silents that are to be shown on Sunday, or Helmar
Lurski's ``Avoda,'' a 1930s chronicle of early Jewish settlers in
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   But while paying tribute to Israeli films during the 50th
anniversary of the nation's birth, the series also reflects the
limitations of a body of work that is surprisingly obscure, with no
director widely known outside Israel's borders (and not too many
known within them). Since its beginning in 1963, the New York Film
Festival has never included an Israeli work.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis have produced many thoughtful and challenging films,
and there is enough interest in the United States to support an
annual Israeli Film Festival, which has been showing new Israeli
work in New York and Los Angeles for 15 years. But like the nation
itself, Israeli films began as a statement of faith, as
self-consciously propagandistic exemplars of the Zionist dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beginning of Israeli cinema is intertwined with the
beginnings of Zionism,'' said Ella Shohat, a professor of film at
the City University of New York and the author of ``Israeli Cinema:
East/West and the Politics of Representation'' (University of Texas
Press, 1989). ``Zionists quite consciously used the cinema to
promote their cause. Cinema from its earliest days was about trying
to lure people to come to Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of film as a single idealized vision of Israel began
to crack in the 1960s as a new generation of Israelis began to
question the orthodoxy of the original Jewish settlers and was more
or less discredited by the 1970s. But building a cinematic
tradition as rich as the contentious babble of voices that is
Israel has been a slow process, as becomes evident in comparing the
long list of familiar Israeli writers with the obscurity of Israeli
filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, cinema needs two things at the same time, an
industrial base and financial base on the one hand, and individual
freedom of expression on the other,'' Gitai said. ``Since both are
rather missing in the early stages, it's taken a long time to
develop Israeli film.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a very opinionated, pluralistic society. But in
film, there's still an attitude that wants to hide the differences
and produce, pathetically, a unified vision instead of exposing our
internal debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gitai, who began his career as an architect and started making
documentaries for Israeli television in 1977, reflects how far
Israeli films have come. His works cover a broad range from
documentaries to fiction, many of them richly textured evocations
of the interconnections between Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The series' opening night featured his newest film, ``Yom Yom''
(``Day After Day''), a comedy about the divided life of the son of
a Jewish mother and Palestinian father living in Haifa. It is part
of a trilogy based in Israel's three main cities, Haifa, Jerusalem
and Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   His other films include a trilogy of documentaries on Jews and
Palestinians; ``Esther,'' a bold retelling of the biblical story;
``Berlin Jerusalem,'' a drama about two women, an Expressionist
poet from Berlin and a Russian revolutionary, whose paths bring
them to Jerusalem; ``Give Peace a Chance,'' a documentary about the
peace effort; and ``Kippur,'' in which Gitai brings together the
people who were with him when his helicopter was shot down during
the Yom Kippur war of 1973.
</P>
<P>
   But he also had two films censored by the television authorities
and has found life as a skeptical filmmaker in Israel so difficult
that he lived in Paris from 1982 to 1993. Even now, he raises much
of the money for his work abroad and says a lack of financial
support, both the private and public, has made it difficult for
other filmmakers to create a body of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, filmmakers invest a lot of energy producing one
feature film, and the consequences are they have to sell their
house or take major economic risks,'' he said. ``There is not the
institutional support you find in France, in Australia, in many
other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli filmmakers face other obstacles as well.
</P>
<P>
   With perhaps 6 million people in the world who speak Hebrew, the
language barrier is enormous. And Jewish culture, from the biblical
injunction against worshiping graven images, has always been more
geared toward the word than the picture, so there is less of a
visual memory bank for filmmakers to work from. Perhaps most
important, Israeli films face the problems confronting all
independent artists in an international film market that has almost
no place for anything but Hollywood blockbusters. It takes some
institutional heft to get films seen or directors known, the kind
of attention that has put Australian films, and even those from
places as unlikely as Iran, on the map.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some terrific films, but there's very little support
for them,'' said Richard Pena, director of the Film Society of
Lincoln Center. ``If we get a film from Iran, there will always be
someone calling, `When's the last deadline?' They're very active in
promoting their films. My impression is that Israel has done less
of that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   That said, Israeli films have some enormous advantages as well.
They cover perhaps the most resonant and familiar turf on the globe
and subject matter having to do with borders, conflict, memory and
reconciliation: a world of blood feuds between people so close they
could be brothers, that is at once intensely local and blindingly
universal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cinema is a very strange medium,'' Gitai said. ``With one
powerful image, you can break through the barriers and stupidity
and oversimplifications that are all around you. So we're still
defining what the face of Israel will be at the beginning of the
century. There's a reality to life in the Middle East that's so
much more complex than the images you see on CNN. It's something we
shouldn't be afraid to look for, and it's why this is one of the
few places in the world where cinema still matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts, like Ms. Shohat, argue that if there is a failing
in Israeli films, it has been more of a constricted esthetic vision
than a political one. The current festival includes two offbeat
classics, ``Hor Balevana'' (``Hole in the Moon'') and ``Ha-Banana
Hashehora'' (``The Black Banana''), both of them wildly fanciful
re-creations of Israeli culture and mythology. But such films
remain rare. And Ms. Shohat says that genuinely opening up the
Israeli film culture means getting more resources to artists who
are not Ashkenazic men, those of Middle and Northern European
descent, a group that includes Gitai.
</P>
<P>
   Gitai, who said he found it odd to be cast suddenly as a poster
boy for Israeli films after years of feeling like a pariah, noted
that providing resources for an art form as expensive as film has
always been an issue in a land fighting for survival. But he said
the nature of Israeli society demanded finding a way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say you live in a battle zone, which the Middle East
is,'' he said. ``You have to confront two questions. One is you
have to survive. Second, you have to ask yourself what you survive
for. And the second question is no less important than the first
one. The positive thing about Israel is that it's not a Spartan
society. Israelis need to justify for themselves the sense of their
collective existence.''

   SAFRANBOLU, Turkey _ Festive banners fluttered from lampposts
and windows as a troupe of young folk dancers prepared to mount a
makeshift stage here on Saturday morning. Like tens of millions of
Turks across the country this week, they were joining in
celebrations of their country's 75th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   One dancer, Gulcan Eran, 16, seemed a symbol of Turkey itself.
She is thoroughly modern and Western-oriented, vibrant,
self-confident and ambitious for a career as an engineer. But as
Ms. Eran adjusted her resplendent costume, two young women wearing
traditional headscarfs walked across the plaza nearby. She turned
serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't object if the scarf was just about religion, but it
isn't anymore,'' she said. ``It's a political uniform. It's a way
of saying that you want to get rid of the secular republic. I think
it's very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Turks who are gathering this week for festivities ranging from
poetry recitals to kick-boxing matches have much reason for
self-congratulation. Their country has made a giant leap from
backwardness to modernity in 75 years, and the nearly two dozen
foreign leaders who are due at the central commemoration in Ankara
on Thursday reflect its role as a regional power.
</P>
<P>
   But as Turkey seeks to establish a stable democracy for its 65
million people, it also confronts several persistent problems.
Defining the role of religion in public life is only the most
visible.
</P>
<P>
   Both Turkey's achievements and its looming challenges are
clearly visible here in Safranbolu, a pleasant town of 20,000
nestled in the rocky Anatolian plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Safranbolu is known for its 19th-century Ottoman buildings, and
attracts a modest stream of tourists. Some residents till small
farms on outlying hills. Others work at a steel mill in nearby
Karabuk that offers employment to thousands but also casts a rancid
cloud over the town.
</P>
<P>
   The streets here are tree-shaded, houses are sturdy and well
kept, schools are full and clinics modern. Shops offer all manner
of domestic and imported goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a lot of progress in 75 years,'' said Ozcan Cakir,
45, manager of a small candy factory in Safranbolu. ``This will
never be a backward or Middle East-type country again. But I worry
about the future. There's hunger in Turkey. I can afford to send my
kids to college, but people who work for me can't. That produces
resentment, and in 10 or 15 years that resentment could bring
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Several portraits of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who proclaimed the
Turkish Republic on Oct. 29, 1923, decorate Cakir's salesroom. They
mark him as a dedicated supporter of the secular order. But at the
jewelry store next door, there is no Ataturk portrait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-five percent of our people don't support this kind of
secularism,'' said the jeweler, Ahmet Pulcu, suggesting that he is
among them. ``The rest have no idea what religion is. They don't
want our women to wear headscarfs. But why shouldn't they? Isn't
that democracy?''
</P>
<P>
   In Safranbolu, as in many Turkish cities and towns, measurably
more women wear headscarfs than wore them only a couple of years
ago. It is a sign of growing religiosity that the Islamic movement
welcomes and encourages. But it disturbs some secularists, among
them military officers.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish universities have imposed a ban on the wearing of
headscarfs by female students. The ban has given Islamic
politicians a vivid political issue, and they have seized on it.
They are crisscrossing the country telling voters that their
daughters are being excluded from tax-supported universities simply
because they are devout Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The air force commander, Gen. Ilhan Kilic, vowed in a recent
speech that the military would fight every effort aimed at
``undermining this system and turning the country into an
anachronism.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Turks say that this uncompromising attitude guarantees the
survival of the secular republic. But others fear that it is
polarizing the nation and perhaps setting the stage for
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the issues of social justice and religious
fundamentalism, Turkey also confronts the question of how to deal
with its large Kurdish minority. That issue, like the others, is
palpable here in Safranbolu.
</P>
<P>
   On a hillside just a few minutes' walk from the town center is
Safranbolu's Kurdish quarter. To enter it is to pass from the
developed world into poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The town's 700 Kurds live in ramshackle cabins without running
water. Many are dirty, poorly dressed and have open sores on their
faces or arms. Almost all are unemployed. They live on what little
they can grow in gardens, and on cow intestines and other cuts of
meat that the town butcher can't sell anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're Turks, but second-class,'' said Bilal Cetinceviz, 65, a
community leader. ``People don't like us or don't trust us. When we
apply for jobs, we don't get hired. Our kids don't go to school
because we can't afford to buy them books and clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have no work, you have nothing to lose,'' Cetinceviz
continued. ``Every once in a while some radical Kurd shows up here
and tries to turn us into militants. We throw them out, but if we
didn't, in six months everyone here would be a militant.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The divide between Kurds and non-Kurds in Safranbolu reflects
the gap in Turkey as a whole. Many Kurds have risen to leading
positions in every walk of life, but many others have been left
behind by Turkey's economic boom. While coastal regions thrive, the
mainly Kurdish southeast is impoverished and unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   Kurdish guerrillas have been fighting a separatist war in
southeastern provinces for 14 years. Thirty thousand people have
been killed in the conflict. It costs an estimated $8 billion a
year to wage, and ties down more than 200,000 Turkish soldiers.
Urging the army to try negotiating a peace settlement is considered
close to treasonous.
</P>
<P>
   The questions of poverty, fundamentalism and Kurdish identity
hang over Safranbolu just as they do over the rest of Turkey. Over
the last two years, however, a new topic has emerged at cafes and
teahouses.
</P>
<P>
   Spectacular disclosures about ties between gangsters and the
government have shaken public faith in the political system.
Phrases like ``black money'' and ``state gangs'' are now part of
everyday conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The spreading scandal has produced grave allegations against
several of the country's past and present leaders, but
investigations have been limited. Turkey's judiciary is not fully
independent, and magistrates do not have unfettered freedom to
pursue cases against political figures. Cynicism is growing, even
among many who until recently refused to believe that agencies of
their government could ever have sponsored death squads or
tolerated drug smuggling or other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you read every day is mafia, crime and gangs,'' said Aybar
Toker, the local soft drink bottler. ``People think all the
established parties are involved, so they vote for the Islamic
party as a protest.''
</P>
<P>
   If Turkey's greatest challenge in the years ahead is to forge a
national consensus over how to establish full democracy here, it
must have political leaders who can lead the way. Yet many Turks
believe that the political system is closed to them. Parties are
run by bosses who tolerate little dissent, and as a result many
talented men and women shun politics in favor of business, academia
or journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that our political system is very closed, but
business people are beginning to take a much greater role in
society, and they aren't bound by all these taboos,'' said Yuksel
Oktay, 61, an American-educated engineer who grew up in Safranbolu
and visits periodically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also see a great potential in our youth. They understand
what is at stake here, and they won't let Turkey slip backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have problems, but I think most Turks would be optimistic
about our chances of solving them,'' Oktay said. ``I certainly
am.''

   TOKYO _ Perhaps nothing epitomizes the Wonderland-like quality
of the Japanese recession like the giant orange Hermes box in the
heart of Ginza, Tokyo's most exclusive shopping district.
</P>
<P>
   For Hermes International, the building-sized box, complete with
signature orange packaging and brown ``ribbon,'' is not merely a
marketing tool but a reflection of the company's confidence that
even in bad times, there will be plenty of Japanese willing to pay
hundreds of thousand of yen for one of its handbags. Such
confidence is hardly misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, unemployment is at record levels, corporate earnings are
sinking, bankruptcies are at a record high, investment is down and
the banking system is at the brink of disaster. But luxury-goods
retailers in Japan are thriving, even as overall consumer spending
has continued to fall.
</P>
<P>
   And while luxury sales in Hong Kong, Singapore and other Asian
markets that were once promising engines of growth have stalled _
partly because of their own economic traumas and partly because of
a decline in Japanese tourism _ many luxury-goods companies
continue to post solid gains in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is not so good, but still people want to buy nice
things,'' said Hideko Isono, a 30-year-old manicurist who lives
with her parents in a suburb north of Tokyo and runs her own
business.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is young working women like Miss Isono, and even high
school students, who live at home and have a penchant for expensive
brand names, who are chiefly fueling the growth of luxury-goods
sales here. Sales have also been helped by lower prices, made
possible by a slowing economy that has reduced business costs like
rent and real estate. And, of course, a lot of the wealthy are
immune to hard times.
</P>
<P>
   Even in recession, Japan continues to be the most important
market in Asia for luxury goods companies.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at sales figures for Tiffany &AMP; Co. Sales in Japan rose
21 percent in the first half of the year in yen terms from a year
earlier, while sales in the rest of Asia fell 16 percent in local
currencies for the same period. And earlier this month, Tiffany
said it expected to meet earnings estimates for the third quarter,
in large part because robust sales in Japan would offset weak sales
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There are other measures of the staying power of luxury goods
here. Gucci Group NV, for instance, has opened seven stores in
Japan since the beginning of the year and will open a flagship
store in the chic Aoyama neighborhood next spring. ``Japanese
consumers are continuing to perceive great value in luxury
brands,'' said Domenico De Sole, president of Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   Hermes has a three-year backlog of orders in Japan for Kelly
bags, made famous by the actress Grace Kelly. The least expensive
model sells for 430,000 yen, or about $3,645 at current exchange
rates. The Hermes box in Ginza sits on property reportedly bought
for $84 million. The company plans to open a flagship store on the
site in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Vuitton, a unit of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA,
expects a 7 percent to 8 percent increase in sales this year.
</P>
<P>
   Prada, however, is the luxury brand for Miss Isono, whose most
recent purchase was a leather wallet. She carries the wallet in a
nylon Prada handbag, which she bought at a ``brand store'' in
Roppongi, a neighborhood popular with foreign residents and for its
night life. ``I like Prada because of its good quality and because
it is attractive,'' she said, adding that she found the same
characteristics in Gucci and Hermes _ although Hermes was a bit too
expensive for her.
</P>
<P>
   Brand stores specialize in selling luxury goods obtained outside
authorized channels of distribution that are sold for prices
similar to prices charged in luxury-goods boutiques in the United
States. That is a bargain here compared with Japanese department
stores and the official branches of those same boutiques. The
merchandise may not be the latest design, but in handbags, wallets
and scarves, that hardly matters. As deregulation has eroded the
rigid distribution system here, more and more brand-name goods have
found their way to such shops, which are proliferating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, everything was really expensive: food, housing,
clothes,'' Miss Isono said, providing a firsthand account of a
deflationary cycle that many economists, rather than celebrating,
actually fear is harming Japan. But consumers seem pleased. ``Now
everything is a very good price,'' Miss Isono added, ``so it's
easier to buy nice things even if people don't get a bonus or have
a lower salary.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Miss Isono lives at home, she incurs none of the
standard living expenses _ rent, food, utilities _ that eat into
the incomes of most women like her in Europe or the United States.
That is why Gucci's average customer in Japan is between 24 and 35,
compared with 35 and 55 in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury-goods executives estimate that these young women's
incomes range from 4 million yen to 6 million yen annually, or
$33,900 to $50,800. At the low end of the range, that income would
not go far enough to cover a Vuitton bag or Gucci loafers in the
United States and pay for rent and groceries, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key difference between our business here and in other
countries are these young women and the way they live,'' said
Kyojiro Hata, the president of Louis Vuitton Japan KK.
</P>
<P>
   There are some signs that even those free-spending young women
are becoming more cautious, however. A poll of consumers in August
by the Nippon Research Institute showed that consumer confidence
had wilted most among 20-to-29-year- olds, the group that has thus
far buoyed overall spending statistics.
</P>
<P>
   But Hata sees women in their 20s as fairly impervious to the
recession, at least in the short term. ``Restructuring is taking
place here, but at higher levels than these women work at,'' he
said. ``Current cuts are aimed at higher income, older workers.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is not just young women, though, who are helping luxury-goods
makers weather the economic fallout here. The cost of business is
also declining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rents are lower and floor space is easier to obtain than ever
before,'' said Michiko Shimizu, president of SAI, a marketing
consulting firm. ``Their cost performance is much better, so why
not open a few more shops?''
</P>
<P>
   Hata, of Louis Vuitton, is interested in a parking lot in
Aoyama. It is one of the holdings of Japan Leasing, a financing
company that recently went bankrupt, and Hata has visions of a new
store on the site.
</P>
<P>
   He figures the parking lot, which has remained undeveloped
despite its prime location because Japan Leasing was seeking an
unrealistically high price, will soon come up for sale at a more
reasonable price. ``Real estate prices are still high, but they're
being forced down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lower real estate prices and distribution costs have enabled
sellers of luxury goods to push prices lower in their Japanese
outposts so that they are more in line with what Japanese shoppers
find in Hawaii or Hong Kong. Prices that were once 50 percent
higher here than in Hong Kong are now only 20 percent higher and
falling.
</P>
<P>
   As distribution has become more deregulated here, some
brand-name merchandise is now showing up in mass merchandising
stores like Ito-Yokado and Daiei, as well as the smaller brand
stores, where they can sell for 60 percent of department store
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Prices may also be driven lower if a 16 percent import tax on
luxury goods is reduced, which is expected as deregulation
increases.
</P>
<P>
   And over the last decade, luxury goods companies have developed
strategies for coping with economic downturns, offering expanded
product lines that include lower-priced products like key chains,
scarves and wallets and the use of cheaper materials like vinyl and
fabric instead of leather.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean they are ignoring the wealthy, of course.
These bedrock customers for luxury-goods makers usually are
affected far less by an economic downturn than the aspiring
upper-middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably benefit less from a boom than some of the other
luxury companies, but we also don't feel the recession,'' said
Mineaki Saito, president of Hermes Japon Co., which gets less of a
boost from younger women because its prices are somewhat higher
than those of other luxury-goods companies. ``Recession, no
recession, our sales have been going up every year since we
opened.''
</P>
<P>
   Junko Kosuge is one of those customers who keeps Hermes'
business growing whatever the economic climate. The wife of a
doctor, she has a passion for expensive scarves, which she keeps in
a glass-fronted antique chest so that she can look at them.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kosuge is awaiting the arrival of a pale pink crocodile
skin bag from Italy to add to her collection of Chanel, Gucci and
Hermes handbags. She said that she did not expect the bag to cost
more than 500,000 yen, or about $4,237 at current exchange rates.
(She likes Louis Vuitton bags as well but, she says, ``many, many
young women carry them, and at my age, I don't want to bump into
them on the train with the same bag.'')
</P>
<P>
   She insists that she does feel the recession, although she could
not really supply an example of its effect on her family. ``People
aren't spending money on things they think are wasteful,'' Mrs.
Kosuge said. ``I myself feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't a pale pink crocodile bag wasteful? ``No, I don't think so
because I was overwhelmed by its attractiveness,'' she said. ``So
even if I can only buy one thing like it instead of several, I do
because it makes my life fun.''

COMMENTARY: THAT WAGGING FINGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ That 800-pound gorilla beckoning to you to join him
in the voting booth is The Impeachment Issue.
</P>
<P>
   I am alone in this view (though not in the anything-goes Clinton
interpretation of ``alone''). The best political reporters assure
us that the American voter cares not a whit about where candidates
stand on what to do about a president who is _ no matter how you
extenuate it _ an unconfessed serial perjurer.
</P>
<P>
   Even John Zogby, the only pollster who called the last election
on the button, finds that by more than 2 to 1, respondents say
impending impeachment will not be a factor in their vote.
</P>
<P>
   How, in the face of all this objective reporting, and aware of
the personalities that affect each local election, can I cling to
the iconoclastic belief that impeachment is the gut issue in the
1998 campaign?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that normal, forthright people, not under oath,
will happily mislead pollsters and journalists with the same
equanimity that Clinton will half-truth grand jurors. Beyond that,
even Zogby admits that ``the nasty secret of this business'' is
that more than half the people approached by pollsters tell them to
get lost.
</P>
<P>
   These silent majoritarians who assert their privacy are my kind
of guys. Many are afflicted with ``pluralistic ignorance'' _ that
is, they do not realize that most other people feel the way they do
_ and so refuse to tell strangers what they mistakenly think is a
minority view, disapproved of by the elites.
</P>
<P>
   The other reason that impeachment stalks this campaign so
stealthily is that Republican politicians _ fooled by folks who
fancy focus-groupies _ have been afraid to take too stern a
position about repeated lying under oath by a federal official
sworn to uphold the law. The GOP has been spooked by its fear of
``energizing'' the wrong ``core.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, throughout this campaign the Republican leaders
have been playing not to lose. Such a cautious, run-out-the-clock
game plan is unworthy of the contest. The way to win is to play to
win.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Gingrich and Senator Lott decided this summer that good
ends (electing more Republicans) justified the worst means: they
abandoned the tax cuts needed to avert recession, and blew off
spending caps with phony emergencies to accommodate liberal
handouts.
</P>
<P>
   These neo-Quiddist savants figured if they went along with the
Clinton pandering to the teachers' lobby, and caved in to his
doubletalk on ``saving the surplus,'' the boat would not rock;
voter lethargy and media boredom would carry them to veto-proof
majorities. Then they could fix what they helped foul up.
</P>
<P>
   But playing not to lose was a loser. The Gingrich-Lott
``pree-vent dee-fense'' led to legislating in the darkness to
appease the liberals, and Clinton took them to the cleaners. Their
Faustian budget deal broke faith with the voters who brung 'em and
made GOP incumbents seem lazy incompetents. Their campaign strategy
looked shyly away from Topic A.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the final week, Gingrich and Lott realize that the focus
is on infidelity, all right _ their infidelity to conservative
principle.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The consensus forecast has dropped to a GOP single-digit seat
gain in the House, two or three in the Senate. That's because
Republicans have failed to join the paramount issue in this
campaign:
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, a Democratic vote this year helps protect Clinton
no matter what new evidence an impeachment inquiry finds, thereby
placing this and future presidents high above the rule of law.
Contrariwise, a Republican vote builds strength in Congress to show
that a pattern of deceit and other abuses not limited to ``lying
about sex'' should have the most serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Even the claim to a sex exception from the oath is troubling:
What about perjury to protect your child? Your lifelong business
partner? A handicapped person? Where do exceptions end?
</P>
<P>
   Belatedly, ever so tastefully, GOP spots will touch on the
scandal in the final days. We can at last see the impeachment issue
raised in the slow-motion showing of the film clip that will dog
Bill Clinton to the end of his days: looking us right in the eye
and wagging his finger in our faces to make us listen to him lie in
his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Watch for it. Then Americans can ask one another the question:
Is it right for this country to let any president, of either party,
get away with that?
</P>

 &HT;    CLINTON URGES VOTERS TO FOCUS ON ISSUES
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton fired back Wednesday at a blitz
of election-season ads that target his character, casting his
Republican opponents as captives of big business and special
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with polls suggesting that low voter turnout could hurt
Democratic chances next Tuesday, Clinton used the presidential
lectern to make a plea to the nation's civic conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ''Folks should show up and vote,'' Clinton said at a joint White
House news conference with visiting President Andres Pastrana of
Colombia. ''And they should know that the decision not to vote is
also a decision that will affect their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the remarks the day after Republicans launched a
$10 million television ad campaign focused on Clinton's character,
even as impeachment proceedings loom in the House based on the
president's relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton assailed the ad campaign as an attempt to ''distract''
voters with scandal and ''divert'' their attention away from
bread-and-butter issues such as tobacco legislation, a increase in
the minimum wage and reforms of health insurance and campaign
finance _ all initiatives that Clinton fought but were defeated by
the Republican-led Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are basically saying to the American people ... 'We want
you to, in effect, ratify the decisions we made for the tobacco
companies, the health-insurance companies, the special interests
that didn't want campaign finance reform, all the people that gave
us the money to put this ad on the air,' '' Clinton said. ''It
wouldn't be a very persuasive argument to me if I were a citizen
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he lambasted Republicans, Clinton asked the nation not
to judge him solely on his belated admission of an intimate
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's fair for a person to be judged on his whole
record,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not trying to sugar-coat the fact that I made a mistake
and that I didn't want anybody to know about it. I'm doing my best
to atone for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his job performance should be weighed as he works
to regain the confidence of the American people.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope they can sense the rededication and the intensified
efforts I am making for the cause of peace around the world, for
the cause of prosperity at home,'' he said. ''I'm doing my best to
be a good president.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared in the Rose Garden with Pastrana, who was here
for his first state visit since taking office last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders signed an Alliance Against Drugs accord committing
both nations to step up efforts to combat the illicit trade, and
Clinton said the pact would be backed up in large part by a $280
million U.S. aid package to the South American nation next year.
The money would be spent on a combination of economic development
and anti-crime measures.
</P>
<P>
   Newt week's voting, though, dominated the nationally televised
news conference. Clinton repeatedly tried to rebut GOP efforts to
turn the elections _ certain to bear heavily on the prospects of
looming impeachment proceedings _ into a referendum on his fitness
to serve.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the 50-minute press conference, Clinton
responded directly to one Republican TV ad now airing in a handful
of closely contested districts. In the ad, two women portray young
mothers troubled over how to discuss the Lewinsky matter with their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what people ought to say to their children is that
when someone
</P>
<P>
   makes a mistake, they should admit it and try to rectify it,''
Clinton said in response to a reporter's question about the ad.
''And this is an illustration of the fact that those rules should
apply to everyone, but that when people do that, if they do it
properly, they can be stronger in their personal lives, in their
family lives and in their work lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said voters concerned about his credibility should
ask whether he has delivered on his promises to help revitalize the
economy and improve educational and job opportunities for the
nation's poor.
</P>
<P>
   ''On whether I've been trustworthy, I think you can look at the
record,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And the consequences are good,'' he added. ''We have an
economic boom, we
</P>
<P>
   have declining social problems, we are a force for peace in the
world.''
</P>

COMMENTARY: JUSTICE AT LONG LAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This summer I wrote two columns about a man named
Jeffrey Blake, who was serving a term of 36 years to life in prison
for the murder of two men in Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   It was a spectacular and brazen crime, an execution in broad
daylight. The victims were in a car. They were killed by a gunman
who ran beside the car and riddled them with bullets from an Uzi as
they tried to get away by backing down the street. The car crashed
into a building and the gunman fled.
</P>
<P>
   A man who claimed to be an eyewitness told authorities that
Blake was the gunman. On the basis of his testimony, and his
testimony alone, Blake was convicted.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that it was almost physically impossible for Blake
to have committed the murders. He was at work that day in the
Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, about 4.5 miles away. And
while the murders took place about 1:45 p.m., during his 45-minute
lunch break, it is highly unlikely that he could have traveled the
requisite distance through busy Brooklyn neighborhoods, ambushed
and executed the two men, disposed of the murder weapon and
returned to work as if nothing had happened by 2 p.m., which is
when his boss and co-workers said he came back from lunch.
</P>
<P>
   It also turned out that the ``eyewitness,'' a flake and chronic
liar named Dana Garner, had witnessed nothing. His girlfriend,
Margaret Allen, who was supposed to have witnessed the murders with
him, said in a sworn affidavit in July that she hadn't seen those
murders ``nor any other murder.'' She added, ``I would remember a
murder if I had seen one.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake recanted several months ago and when he was hooked up to a
polygraph machine, he passed.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote in August that the case against Jeffrey Blake ``was
virtually nonexistent'' and that it was unlikely that Dana Garner
was even in New York when the murders were committed.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday the district attorney for Brooklyn, Charles Hynes,
said he agreed. He directed his office to join in a motion, filed
by Blake's attorney, Michele Fox of the Legal Aid Society, to set
aside the guilty verdict. He said Blake should be released from
prison. That could happen as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Blake's appeals had been exhausted, and Hynes was under no
obligation to reopen the case. But Ms. Fox continued her diligent
efforts to prove her client innocent. After the columns ran, the
DA's office conducted a new investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are convinced,'' said Deputy District Attorney Dennis
Hawkins, ``that the evidence that Legal Aid has found and that
we've discovered in our own independent investigation _ if it had
been revealed at the time of the trial, Jeffrey Blake probably
would not have been convicted.''
</P>
<P>
   What usually happens in such cases, he said, is that the judge _
in this instance Supreme Court Justice Robert Kreindler _ would
vacate the guilty verdict and order a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   But the DA's office will not pursue another trial. Hawkins said,
``Since we do not think that would be the fair thing to do, we
would at that point dismiss the indictment against Blake.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake learned of the new developments on Tuesday night, when he
called his attorney from the maximum-security Green Haven prison in
upstate New York. Ms. Fox said: ``It was so wonderful to be able to
tell him, `Jeffrey, you're coming home.' He was so happy. He said,
`Yes-s-s.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fox's feelings are mixed. She had spent several years
working on appeals, convinced that her client was not only innocent
but a decent person.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gratifying that things finally worked out,'' she said.
``I'm grateful to the DA's office for finally looking at the case
again and reinvestigating. But it saddens me that my guy had to
give up eight years of his life before this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Hynes said he was ``relieved that this thing has been uncovered
and this guy is going to walk out of jail after serving eight
unnecessary years.''
</P>
<P>
   He reflected for a moment on the time when he had been a defense
lawyer, and said: ``The thing that scares the hell out of the
better lawyers _ and I like to think I was one of them _ is
representing someone who is innocent. In this case, not only was
there an alibi that was rejected by the jury, but Garner's cousin,
who was described to me as a spit-and-polish young Marine who was
very believable, testified that Garner was not even in town, and
the jury rejected that. I'm relieved that we were able to find
other witnesses to confirm what the cousin said.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there remains the problem of who committed the
murders. Hawkins, the deputy district attorney, said he and others
were now faced with the task of finding the real killers.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAINTSVILLE, Ky. _ Here in the hills of eastern Kentucky, where
Loretta Lynn grew up as a coal miner's daughter, the politicians
are talking this fall about ``a turnout election.''
</P>
<P>
   You hear the same phrase in Louisville and Paducah, and in
Wisconsin, New York and North Carolina _ everywhere there is a
close race for state or federal office.
</P>
<P>
   It is the cliche of the year, like ``Year of the Woman'' in
1992. ``Tell me who's going to show up at the polls next Tuesday,''
said Rep. Jim Bunning, the Republican nominee in this state's
nasty, down-to-the-wire Senate contest, ``and I'll tell you who's
going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Predicting the turnout in midterm elections is never easy, but
the professionals find it harder than ever this time. The
impeachment proceedings against President Clinton provide the added
imponderable. Will Democrats stay home, or will they turn out to
register their anger against Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel, and the Republicans in Congress?
</P>
<P>
   The importance of those questions was vividly illustrated in a
poll published in Wednesday's Louisville Courier-Journal. It showed
Bunning trailing his Democratic rival, Rep. Scotty Baesler, by 1
percentage point, 44 percent to 43 percent, a statistically
insignificant margin, among registered voters who said they were
likely to go to the polls, but leading him once the sample was
corrected to reflect turnout patterns of recent years.

   Kentucky's Senate race is one of the half-dozen or so close
contests across the country that will collectively determine
whether the Republicans have the 60 votes they will need in the
next two years to cut off debate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the House seats Bunning and Baesler are giving up
are among the most hotly disputed in the nation. Ken Lucas, a
Democrat, leads in the race for Bunning's seat, although Bunning's
name at the head of the ticket may help the Republican nominee, Gex
Williams, to pull through. Ernest Fletcher, a Republican, is
favored in the contest for Baesler's seat, but turnout is a major
question in that race, too.
</P>
<P>
   At a get-out-the-vote rally Tuesday night in Louisville's old
Union Station, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., accused the Republicans
of plotting to keep people at home on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're running a negative campaign,'' Biden said, ``because
the more negative, the more visceral the campaign, the more people
turn off, especially women. If only the most motivated voters show
up, the Republicans win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, of course, deny any attempt to suppress
turnout. Indeed, they blame Baesler for slinging the first mud in a
campaign that has more than lived up to this state's long tradition
of political brawling. But when Bunning's campaign coordinator,
Kyle Simmons, heard the results of the Courier poll, he reacted by
commenting, ``hope it rains.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a Democratic House candidate in the Louisville area has
begun running advertisements criticizing Republicans for
authorizing an open-ended investigation of Clinton, neither of the
Senate candidates has tackled the impeachment issue on television.
One top strategist said it was ``too hot, too volatile and too
unpredictable to touch with a 50-foot pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron McCloud, the state Democratic chairman, said he thought
``the way the Republicans in Washington beat up on Clinton has
energized some of my people, got them stirred up to work and vote,
which is often a problem for us.'' Overwhelmingly Democratic in
registration, Kentucky regularly elects Republicans to top offices
because Democrats break ranks or stay home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's turnout, it's turnout, it's turnout,'' McCloud said. ``I
hope we've learned from 1994. If a few more Democrats in key places
had voted, we might have had Dick Gephardt instead of Newt Gingrich
as speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mellman, a pollster for Baesler and other Democrats, said
he expected a continuation of the steady decline in turnout across
the country this year, ``with more than likely an equal decline for
both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Gans, who heads a committee that studies voter
participation, said he expected fewer than four registered voters
in 10 to cast ballots, a new low.
</P>
<P>
   Why? One big reason, Mellman said, is that ``this is not an
issue election, not a referendum on Clinton or the economy or
anything else.''

   As befits a border state, Kentucky developed a two-party system
earlier than states in the Deep South like Georgia and Mississippi.
John Sherman Cooper and Thruston B. Morton held Senate seats here
as early as the 1950s, taking their places alongside Democratic
icons like A.B. ``Happy'' Chandler and Alben W. Barkley, who was
Harry S. Truman's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the one-party days, the state had a reputation for
particularly quarrelsome politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bunning and Baesler are both fiercely competitive people, with
backgrounds in sports. Bunning, still lean and fit at 67, spent 17
seasons as a right-handed fireballer in the big leagues. He wears a
Hall of Fame ring on his left hand.
</P>
<P>
   Baesler was captain in 1962 and 1963 of one of Adolph Rupp's
legendary University of Kentucky basketball teams. Given
basketball's status in this state as a kind of secular religion, he
is even better known than his rival.
</P>
<P>
   Their personalities could hardly be more different. Baesler is
soft-spoken and seemingly reluctant to work a crowd. Bunning is an
in-your-face sort of campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get along well enough,'' Baesler said in an interview. ``We
see each other on the Hill almost every day and we don't growl at
each other. But he's always been a little strident. In his playing
days, I guess, you knock the other guy down with a baseball if you
didn't like him. In basketball, you can't do that; you have to find
a way to work around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the campaign, Bunning ran a commercial showing Baesler
making an uncharacteristically vehement speech, accompanied by
Wagner's ``Ride of the Valkyries.'' The Democrats denounced the
spot as an attempt to suggest subliminally that their man was a
Nazi, and newspapers and civic leaders joined them in issuing
statements of condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd used that music, and people think
it's funny,'' Bunning replied.
</P>
<P>
   Bunning ran a commercial with actors ``thanking'' Baesler in
comically accented English for having voted for the North American
Free Trade Agreement and preferential trade status for China.
Baesler said it was a ``despicable'' effort to stir prejudice and
xenophobic feelings in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   A hand bill circulated by Bunning attempts to suggest that
Baesler is insufficiently firm in his support of tobacco because he
``accepts campaign help from America's No. 1 Tobacco-Basher'' _
Clinton. Baesler, himself a tobacco farmer, has long championed his
fellow growers.
</P>
<P>
   The two men have spent weeks accusing each other of lying on
subjects like Social Security, health care and education, often
seizing upon narrow differences and magnifying them. Baesler for
example wanted to save 100 percent of the federal surplus for
Social Security, while Bunning settled for saving only 90 percent.
The 10 percent difference is a big issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bunning has played down issues he has used in the past such as
abortion and flag-burning, leaving the Democrats to accuse him of
stealing their issues. But his slide toward the center has been
uneven.
</P>
<P>
   While he was portraying himself this week as the defender of
Social Security and Medicare, his campaign brought Oliver North, a
symbol of the far right, to Paintsville to campaign for him amid
the Technicolor hillsides of autumn.

AVOID BARE FACTS ABOUT DR. LAURA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - I'm trying not to picture Dr. Laura Schlessinger
naked. I'm tempted, but I believe I can resist with the help of Dr.
Laura herself and, of course, the Holy Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura has been described as ``America's `Mommy' and the
conscience of talk radio.'' She also has a new book out called
``The TenCommandments.'' The last of the ten, she points out, is
``You shall not covet.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord, I'm trying.
</P>
<P>
   There are nude photographs of Dr. Laura posted on the Internet.
They were made available by a fellow who knew Dr. Laura before she
was rich, famous and nationally syndicated, and says the two of
them used ``to thrash around like a couple of crazed weasels.''
Before she was divorced from her first husband.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Laura's Web site, she ``preaches, teaches and
nags about morals, values and ethics.'' Among these is Commandment
No. 7: ``You shall not commit adultery.''
</P>
<P>
   In her new book, the chapter on No. 7 goes from page 207 to page
234, ending with the declaration:
</P>
<P>
   ``The keeping of our faith with each other and with God is what
separates us from the rest of the animal world.''
</P>
<P>
   Including weasels, I'd guess.
</P>
<P>
   I'd love to steal a look at the photos of the good doctor (begin
ital) au naturel, (end ital) but, as Dr. Laura points out,
Commandment No. 8 says theft of any kind is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Respecting the property and reputation of others provides
mutual safety, peace and prosperity,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure she's correct.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I haven't looked and urge you not to look. Think of
what your mother would say.
</P>
<P>
   Think of what Dr. Laura's mother would say if she saw the
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Commandment No. 5 orders you to ``Honor your father and your
mother.'' Although a recent ``Vanity Fair'' magazine article
reported that Dr. Laura ``hasn't seen her own mother in 14 years''
and has been estranged from her sister ``since the 1970s.''
</P>
<P>
   Is mentioning that wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura didn't dispute the claims so technically they don't
fall under Commandment No. 9's order not to bear false witness.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does looking at the photographs, unless they were faked
or altered.
</P>
<P>
   Or unless they were taken by a peeping Tom instead of a smiling
Bill (the name of the man who claims to be her former lover).
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura got a restraining order against the man who
distributed the pictures. Others copied them, however, and posted
them on their own. Her lawyers will probably try to stop those
people, too.
</P>
<P>
   This is possible when you sell your radio show, as Dr. Laura
did, for a reported $71.5 million, and expect to make millions more
explaining the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   Including No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   That one urges us not to worship false gods, like money and
possessions, which Dr. Laura, who lives a life of luxury, says
``are not the ultimate purpose of life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it's not the Commandments that will keep me from
picturing Dr. Laura naked, however.
</P>
<P>
   It's Dr. Laura's most famous slogan:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm my kid's mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger and her husband have a son, Deryk.
</P>
<P>
   As tempting as it is to expose the bare facts about Dr. Laura,
to discover if full frontal nudity would reveal, once and for all,
her two faces _ there is this boy to consider.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough enough on him knowing the pictures exist and have
become public.
</P>
<P>
   It's nothing he asked for. It's nothing he did. It's nothing he
can escape.
</P>
<P>
   Even if she deserves what she gets, he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask a well-known Stanford co-ed whose mom and dad live in a
mansion in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I'm shying away from the naughty pictures. Not
because Dr. Laura is her kid's mom, but because Deryk is his mom's
kid. &QL;

<P>
   PAINTSVILLE, Ky. _ Here in the hills of eastern Kentucky, where
Loretta Lynn grew up as a coal miner's daughter, the politicians
are talking this fall about ``a turnout election.''
</P>
<P>
   You hear the same phrase in Louisville and Paducah, and in
Wisconsin, New York and North Carolina _ everywhere there is a
close race for state or federal office.
</P>
<P>
   It is the cliche of the year, like ``Year of the Woman'' in
1992. ``Tell me who's going to show up at the polls next Tuesday,''
said Rep. Jim Bunning, the Republican nominee in this state's
nasty, down-to-the-wire Senate contest, ``and I'll tell you who's
going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Predicting the turnout in midterm elections is never easy, but
the professionals find it harder than ever this time. The
impeachment proceedings against President Clinton provide the added
imponderable. Will Democrats stay home, or will they turn out to
register their anger against Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel, and the Republicans in Congress?
</P>
<P>
   The importance of those questions was vividly illustrated in a
poll published in Wednesday's Louisville Courier-Journal. It showed
Bunning trailing his Democratic rival, Rep. Scotty Baesler, by 1
percentage point, 44 percent to 43 percent, a statistically
insignificant margin, among registered voters who said they were
likely to go to the polls, but leading him once the sample was
corrected to reflect turnout patterns of recent years.

GOVERNOR'S RACE DRAWS LITTLE INTEREST IN CHICAGO, BOOSTING
REPUBLICAN

   CHICAGO _ In the vast megalopolis known here as Chicagoland,
which stretches 50 miles from the high-rises along Lake Michigan to
suburban cul-de-sacs, it has often been difficult to get voters
interested in the political action in the Illinois Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The capital, Springfield, in the view of many Chicagoans and
suburbanites, is a place to visit Lincoln's tomb or to milk cows at
the state fair.
</P>
<P>
   The lopsided race for governor this year has done little to
change that. George Ryan, Illinois' secretary of state and the
Republican nominee, and Rep. Glenn Poshard, the Democrat _ men who
have never been accused of skating on charisma _ have not managed
to fan the political passions.
</P>
<P>
   Lethargy bodes well for Ryan, whose Republican Party has held
the governor's office for 22 years. Most surveys of likely voters
give Ryan a double-digit lead, except for an anomalous poll
published by The Chicago Sun-Times last week that showed the race
nearly a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   Poshard, socially conservative and from Southern Illinois, has
often been at odds with liberals in his party. But his problems, at
least among residents of Northern Illinois, run much deeper than
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people had never heard of him,'' said Peter Nardulli,
head of the political science department at the University of
Illinois in Champaign. ``Even now, he has very little visibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, 64, a former pharmacist from Kankakee, an old railroad
town about 45 miles south of Chicago, could walk down most Illinois
streets without being widely recognized.
</P>
<P>
   But his name is known everywhere. One of the perquisites of the
secretary of state's office, it seems, is the right to have your
signature on everything from driver's licenses to mailings on organ
donation.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan has also used his office to call for stricter laws on
drunken driving. He takes much of the credit for the state's
reducing the maximum blood-alcohol content for drivers to 0.08
percent, from 0.10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists have said they expect the race to
tighten. But John Torre, a spokesman for Ryan, said the voter
surveys ``reflect the contentment and satisfaction that people in
Illinois have with Republican leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials note that polls did not predict Poshard's
victory in the primary. ``The polls don't capture the talk in the
fields, the coffee shops and around kitchen tables,'' said Dave
Stricklin, a spokesman for Poshard.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's job has long been regarded here as political
second banana to that of the mayor of Chicago, where City Hall
looms as the real locus of power. (Roman Pucinski left Congress in
the 70s to run for alderman in Chicago.)
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the city has lost plenty of its influence to the
suburbs, which now cast 40 percent of the state's vote. And Ryan
has been able to portray himself as the sort of moderate who plays
well in the suburbs, running television advertisements that
emphasize his support for gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who have been out of the governor's office since
1976, had high hopes coming into this political season. They saw
Ryan, who won the Republican primary without serious opposition, as
a much weaker opponent than Gov. Jim Edgar, a popular moderate who
is retiring from politics, partly for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan was seen as vulnerable for his opposition to abortion, as
well as his crucial role as speaker of the Illinois House in 1976
in defeating the Equal Rights Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   But when Democrats nominated Poshard, who has a more
conservative record on social issues than Ryan, the Republican was
able to cast himself as the more enlightened candidate. Ryan, for
example, sent representatives of his campaign to appear at the gay
pride parade in Chicago, while Poshard skipped the event.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of Poshard, who has said he will not accept money
from political action committees, has appeared star-crossed at
every turn. Even a scandal tied to Ryan's state office, involving
workers accused of taking bribes to sell commercial truck-driver
licenses, has failed to help him.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Scott Lassar has said that workers in a driver
license office took $150,000 in bribes to give trucker licenses.
Federal agents also say that some of that money ended up in a
campaign fund for Ryan. The prosecutor has said that Ryan is not a
target of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A television advertisement run by Democrats links the scandal to
an accident involving a van and a truck that killed six children in
1994. But the commercial has provoked widespread criticism as being
unfair, including harsh words from some prominent Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Poshard, a former teacher, also has changed some of his
positions during the campaign, now supporting some gun-control
measures, and justifying his earlier positions as a reflection of
the views in Southern Illinois.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even among blacks, the most loyal part of the traditional
Democratic constituency, the view of Poshard has often been
lukewarm. Some hard feelings might remain among blacks who
supported Roland Burris, a former state attorney general, who is
black, in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   In that race, many black political leaders said Burris, who had
won statewide office by large margins, would probably have faced
little opposition in the primary if he were white. Nardulli, the
University of Illinois professor, said Burris might have given the
Democrats a better chance, since he could have been expected to
rally the black vote.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's big lead in the polls, together with the apparent lead of
the Republican candidate for the Senate, Peter Fitzgerald, over
Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, has caused Democrats to worry that
trouble may be in store for Democrats running for the state
Legislature.

MUSEUMS HELP SEPARATE FAMILY TRASH AND TREASURES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It could be a Qing Dynasty jade Buddha, worth thousands of
dollars. Or it might be a soapstone replica worth little more than
the memories it evokes.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Casler can't tell from the photograph, although the
accompanying letter contains more information than usual about the
object in question: A woman's uncle found it on a bombed-out street
in China during World War II. It was one of several lying amidst
the rubble. He brought it back to the United States in a diplomatic
pouch.
</P>
<P>
   Casler, the Kimbell Art Museum's curator of Asian and
non-Western art hears countless, similar stories and often doesn't
even have a murky photograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``More often than not, when it's Asian material, it's something
a father or grandfather brought back from Japan or China or
Thailand after World War II,'' she says. ``Or maybe it's from a
missionary in the family, who was in Asia during the early part of
the century, and it has been around the house for three
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer wants to know, is it white jade? Does she have a
legal right to it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally,'' Casler continues, ``someone realizes there's an
Asian curator at the Kimbell who might be willing to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's only one curator at one museum in North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the popular PBS series ``Antiques Road Show'' urged
viewers to cast appraising eyes on their possessions, museums were
helping people learn about the stuff they lived with or picked up
at garage sales.
</P>
<P>
   They still do.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to learn more about the historic and aesthetic
importance of an object or work of art, ``the museum should be one
of the first places you turn,'' says Jane Myers, chief curator of
the Amon Carter Museum and an authority on American prints.
``Museum exhibitions help train the eye and sharpen anyone's
connoisseurship skills. They're a resource. The people are a
resource. The library is a resource, and so is all of the material
we have in the bookstore.''
</P>
<P>
   People phone, FAX and e-mail queries to Carter staff members
daily, Myers says. And, although people sometimes simply walk in
the door, Myers says she and her colleagues would rather first
receive a letter and picture of the item in question.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, you want to learn about how much an object is
worth, don't go to a curator; turn to an appraiser, dealer or
auction house specialist.
</P>
<P>
   What generates real flurries of queries are the special
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Dallas Museum of Art's exhaustive 1994
exhibition on American silver brought ``an avalanche'' of people
calling and asking about grandma's Gorham candlesticks and Towle
bowls, says DMA Acting Director Charles Venable, who also is the
museum's curator of decorative arts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A few pieces entered the collection,'' he adds, not
surprisingly noting that the museum's favorite way of acquiring
works is in the form of a gift. Still, once a work's dollar value
is ascertained, combination gift-purchases or outright purchases
can be negotiated. All, of course, assuming that the curator is
sufficiently interested in the work to get it approved by an
acquisitions committee.
</P>
<P>
   Another DMA show _ its current presentation of ``The Jewels of
Lalique'' _ has stirred up inquiries. Most of its focus is on
unique jewelry, something that few people would have lying around.
But it also features several examples of glass vases, bowls,
perfume bottles and other decorative or functional objects that are
much more common.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Venable says, his decorative arts department fields
the greatest number of questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more liable to call about a class of object, like
silver or glass, because they don't know what they have,'' Venable
says. ``But if someone has, say, a Brice Marden painting, they're
going to know they've got a Brice Marden painting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kimbell's recent display of early modern furnishings brought
in more calls than any other show she knows of, says Patricia Loud,
who was in-house curator for that exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had everything from a doctor's wife who had an Arts and
Crafts basin and ewer similar to one in the show, to a little,
round object someone brought in that was obviously of the Arts and
Crafts period,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Loud told the doctor's wife to contact Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the other piece was of copper and brass, and
featured other characteristics of Arts and Crafts, neither Loud nor
its owner could figure out what it might be.
</P>
<P>
   Myers mentions a couple who approached her in the galleries
during the Carter's ``Inner Spirit'' exhibition of early modern
paintings, prints and sculpture a couple years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pointed to a beautiful color woodcut by B.J.O. Nordfeldt
and said, `You know, we own a print like this. Is it worth
anything?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It had been rolled up in a Japanese scroll they bought at a
garage sale,'' Myers says. ``They thought more highly of the scroll
and were amazed to see this other thing, which they hardly valued
at all, in a museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Queries about personal belongings have brought at least two
important folk-art works to the Carter's collection _ one due to a
lecture, the other to an exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The former piece is a portrait, dated circa 1853, by an
itinerant painter named Jacob Maentel. It had been in the sitter's
family for almost 150 years. When its present owner heard Carter
Director Rick Stewart lecture on Maentel she decided, having no
heirs, to give it to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Curators at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth regularly field
questions about early modern artworks, including pictures by Fort
Worth School artists. Museum policy doesn't permit them to look at
things, though, so they immediately refer callers to appraisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would be thrilled to hear they have a Picasso,'' says
Modern curatorial assistant Christine Berry, adding that the
possibility of a windfall seems to motivate most of their callers.
</P>
<P>
   Loud, at the Kimbell, sees things somewhat differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a bit of the hidden treasure impulse at
work,'' she says. ``But it's not solely that. For a lot of people,
it just reinforces the sense of value they attach to things at home
_ not just sentimental or monetary, but also artistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very powerful thing for people to open their eyes and
realize that something they own has aesthetic value.''

 &HT;    AOL a prisoner in Internet browser wars
 &HT;    EDs: Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By Andrew J. Glass
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``How much do we need to pay you to screw
Netscape?'' Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates asked key executives of
America OnLine, which has grown into the nation's largest doorway
into the Internet. ``This is your lucky day.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Microsoft paid AOL nothing in January 1996,
when the question was raised. But it gave AOL a highly valued icon
on its Windows 95 desktop and got in return a bargain that vaulted
its then largely untested Internet Explorer into a primary slot for
AOL customers, at the expense of Netscape, which had also sought to
make a deal with AOL.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made us an offer we couldn't refuse,'' George Vradenburg,
AOL's general counsel, said on Wednesday. He spoke to a reporter on
the steps of the federal courthouse here, where Microsoft is on
trial, charged by the Justice Department and the attorney generals
of 20 states with having broken the antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Gates' query to AOL, as quoted in court documents, reflects the
bitter battles in the high technology arena which have led the
government to file its most significant antitrust case in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Within the courtroom itself, the browser wars between Microsoft
and Netscape were vented all day long through sheaf upon sheaf of
hitherto secret documents, unearthed for the landmark trial.
</P>
<P>
   And AOL was being cast in the testimony as the swing vote _
first having thrown in with Netscape and then in March 1996
switching its allegiance to Microsoft as it sought to leverage
itself against a threat from the software giant's then-new online
service.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Microsoft lawyers put into the trial record a
draft e-mail written in October 1995 by AOL chief executive Stephen
Case that quoted approvingly from Netscape co-founder Marc
Andreesen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with ju `` the witness, AOL senior vice president
David Colburn, replied evenly. Colburn had been charged with
handling the competitive negotiations with Microsoft and Netscape
that eventually led to Microsoft's victory.
</P>
<P>
   Under fire from Warden, Colburn repeatedly backed the
government's charge that Microsoft won the important 1996 deal as a
result of its Windows monopoly and not, as Warden sought to show,
by virtue of Microsoft's superior browser technology.
</P>
<P>
   Warden also accused AOL of doing precisely what the government
has accused Microsoft of doing: seeking to divide markets. As he
laced into Colburn, the Microsoft attorney put into the record the
terms of a draft agreement calling for AOL and Netscape not to
compete against each other in their respective main lines of
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think there ought to be two sets of rules,''
Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray said into microphones arrayed on
the courthouse steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The antitrust rules make a big distinction between what a
monopolist may do and what a non-monopolist may do,'' David Boies,
the government's lead trustbuster said in the same forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``They only had a tiny fraction of the business each was willing
to stay away from,'' Boies added. ``What Microsoft wanted Netscape
to do was quite a different matter. (Microsoft) would then have had
a browser monopoly on top of its Windows monopoly.''

PASTORS SAYING NO TO CHRISTIAN COALITION'S VOTER GUIDES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the conservative Christian Coalition prepares to distribute
45 million voter guides in churches this Sunday _ its most
ambitious election-year effort ever _ it is hitting more resistance
than ever before from liberal advocacy groups and even from
conservative and moderate ministers who believe the guides are
biased in favor of Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition maintains that its voter guides are nonpartisan,
educational materials that compare the voting records of
candidates, usually on issues central to the beliefs of
conservative Christians, like abortion, homosexuality and vouchers
for religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   Distributing 45 million voter guides means that the Christian
Coalition would have to put a guide in the hands of nearly one of
every three Americans registered to vote. To reach its goal, the
coalition depends on the cooperation of church pastors, the
gatekeepers to the pews.
</P>
<P>
   But even ministers aligned with the coalition on the issues said
in interviews that they were refusing to distribute its voter
guides this year. Many ministers said the coalition and its guides
were tainted by a perceived affiliation with the Republican Party.
Some said they did not want to appear partisan before their large
and diverse congregations, while others said they did not want to
risk jeopardizing their churches' tax-exempt status by handing out
partisan campaign materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly have nothing against the Christian Coalition,''
said the Rev. Rusty Russell, associate minister of Southeast
Christian Church, a conservative nondenominational ``megachurch''
with 14,000 members in Louisville, Ky. But a committee at his
church decided not to use the coalition's voter guides because,
Russell said, ``We felt like we wanted to stick with something
intended to be a little more unbiased.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it will distribute a candidate survey put out by the
Family Foundation, a statewide group affiliated with Focus on the
Family, a ministry led by James Dobson, the religious broadcaster.

   In September, at the coalition's convention in Washington,
several coalition volunteers and church liaisons said in interviews
that they had had a difficult time persuading pastors to accept the
guides. Nelida Kuhlman, a volunteer in New Jersey, said none of the
Roman Catholic priests and only half of the Protestant ministers
she contacted in Hackensack and Bergenfield agreed to accept them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really afraid of losing their tax exemption,'' Ms.
Kuhlman said. ``A lot of them don't want to become controversial.
The Christian Coalition also has a connotation of being a political
lobbying group in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   No church has ever lost its tax-exempt status for distributing
coalition voter guides. The coalition itself, however, has been
sued by the Federal Election Commission. The lawsuit contends that
in previous elections the coalition coordinated the use of its
voter guides, telephone banks and mass mailings to promote
Republican candidates, including former President George Bush,
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina and
Oliver North in 1994, when he ran unsuccessfully for a U.S. Senate
seat in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in 1996 and still pending, contends that even if
the voter guides do not explicitly favor one candidate, they still
violate the law if they are part of a coordinated effort to
mobilize specific voters in a contested district.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that the lawsuit has made the Christian Coalition
vulnerable to accusations of partisanship, two advocacy groups
opposed to the coalition have recently sent ``Dear Pastor'' letters
to tens of thousands of ministers across the country, warning them
away from the coalition's voter guides.
</P>
<P>
   The Interfaith Alliance, a network of Christian, Jewish and
Muslim clergy, most of whom are liberal but some moderate and
conservative, has sent 20,000 letters to fellow clergy members in
25 states, accusing the Christian Coalition of ``seeking to
transform houses of worship into precinct halls for espousing
partisan politics.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans
United for Separation of Church and State, has written letters to
80,000 pastors alerting them to a memorandum written by two
Washington tax lawyers warning churches against distributing
slanted voters' guides.
</P>
<P>
   The tax lawyers point to several aspects of the Christian
Coalition's guides that potentially violate Federal Election
Commission regulations: They list the candidates' stands on only a
few, select issues of concern to coalition members (in contrast to
the extensive guides issued by the League of Women Voters, for
example); they distort the candidates' voting records, saying, for
example, that the Democrat supports ``special rights for
homosexuals''; and they distribute most of the guides the Sunday
before the election, giving candidates no time to respond to
inaccuracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never seen a guide in all of these years that is
slanted in such a way as to suggest you vote for a Democrat,'' Lynn
said in an interview. ``They are blatantly partisan appendages of
Republican campaign material.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition has responded by directing its field
directors and local chapter leaders to give pastors a letter from
Randy Tate, executive director of the coalition, calling Lynn ``the
ACLU's hand-picked mouthpiece'' and telling pastors not to be
``scared off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, there is no risk, because Christian Coalition takes
great care to see that its voter guides are absolutely correct in
accordance with the law,'' Tate wrote to the pastors.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Jay Sekulow, head of the American Center for Law
and Justice, a Virginia-based organization founded by evangelist
Pat Robertson, had offered ``to defend without charge any church
that is sued or threatened because of distributing Christian
Coalition voter guides.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of course, many pastors, especially those in conservative
evangelical, Pentecostal and Southern Baptist churches, say they
are glad to distribute the guides. The coalition says its network
is especially strong in Maine, where 900 churches will take the
guides, and in Dade County, Fla., where 800 churches have accepted
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. James Merritt, pastor of First Baptist Church in
Snellville, Ga., said his church inserted the coalition's voter
guides in its bulletins and would make them available at Sunday
services. ``There are a lot of folks out there that don't read,
don't keep up, and they really rely on those guides,'' Merritt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, distributing 45 million of anything is an
extremely ambitious goal. In previous election years, when, the
coalition said, it distributed half that number of voter guides,
pastors hostile to the coalition reported receiving boxes with
hundreds of voter guides dropped on their church doorsteps the
Sunday before the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true,'' Tate, the coalition's executive director, said
in an interview in September. ``In some instances they didn't get
into the right hands. In many instances they didn't get
distributed.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Tate said, the coalition is working to establish 100,000
church liaisons who can calm the fears of the increasing number of
pastors who express concern about involvement with the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have misconceptions,'' Tate said of the pastors. ``The
most common is that somehow it's a violation of church and state to
distribute a voter guide, and that anything that talks about
candidates is illegal.''

COOK BOOKS: A CULINARY FANTASY LIFE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, in an empire now long gone, Marcus Gabius
Apicius spent his last denarius on a feast. Realizing he had
neither the desire nor the discipline to economize in his dining,
he committed suicide. But before he did, this epicure of the first
century A.D. wrote the oldest known cookbook, ``De Re Coquinaria.''
It was still selling about 900 years later. Which certainly made it
a backlist champion. So what Apicius started, no one in book
publishing will put asunder. Along with serious religious texts,
there's hardly a genre as popular as the cookbook, and a celebrated
one sells for years and years and years. In hardcover.
</P>
<P>
   There is something sensual, almost savory, about a good
cookbook, just as there is about good food. Many people who don't
cook buy cookbooks simply to read. Harriett Bell, executive editor
in charge of cookbooks at Broadway Books, explains that ``a great
cookbook takes you somewhere you've never been, like a great novel
takes you to a world you never knew about.'' Of course she would
see the mystical in the culinary. Her latest, ``Jean-Georges:
Cooking at Home With a Four-Star Chef,'' written by Jean-Georges
Vongerichten with Mark Bittman (who writes The Minimalist food
column for The New York Times), was published last month with a
first printing of 45,000 copies and a second of 10,000. The book
retails for $40.
</P>
<P>
   What makes it different from the older famous-chef cookbooks,
Ms. Bell says, is that the buyer can actually go home and cook from
its recipes. What makes today's cookbooks generally different from
many predecessors is that you don't need to be a chemist with a
restaurant kitchen to use them. The genre hooks so many people that
last year Ms. Bell published Deborah Madison's ``Vegetarian Cooking
for Everyone'' at a retail price of $35 and then, when sales took
off, had the audacity to increase the price to $40. Try that with a
novel, no matter how popular.
</P>
<P>
   Cookbooks, like fashion, seem to appease wishfulness and the
need for fantasy, that ``one-day-I'll-buy-an-Armani'' daydream.
Which doesn't mean that all books go unused. But Judith Jones,
senior editor at Knopf, who edits both novels and cookbooks, says
that ``a huge percentage of people who buy cookbooks don't cook _
they dream that maybe they'll want to do this someday; they want to
get a book to know about foods for that day; and the books now have
lots of interesting stories about food, as well as recipes.''
</P>
<P>
   She has been the editor of ``Mastering the Art of French
Cooking,'' among other cookbooks, since it was conceived by Simone
Beck, Louisette Bertholle and Julia Child in 1961, and has stayed
with it through endless printings, now in two volumes. Coming from
her next spring is ``A Spoonful of Ginger'' by Nina Simond, which
will combine recipes with traditional Chinese medicine, enabling
one to cook a tasty dish that will cure a headache.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the potential for food books has not yet been fully
explored, but for whatever reason they have become so popular that
the larger Barnes &AMP; Noble bookstores carry nearly 4,000
food-related titles, according to Lee Stern, the chain's cook and
wine book buyer. He attributes a great deal of their popularity to
television cooking shows, particularly those on cable. He does
believe most buyers actually cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go into a cookbook section to buy something they want
to eat tonight; the cookbook buyer is very thoughtful,'' he says,
adding that the coffee-table cookbook _ contrived as a mere
decoration _ is mostly a thing of the past. The Italian cookbook,
he said, is still ``at the top of the pyramid but not the way it
was; two or three years ago, the vegetarian seemed played out, but
some strong ones are coming again.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Dystel, a literary agent who has a number of cookbook
writers for clients, also attributes the genre's success largely to
the television cooking shows, and to the fact that often the books
``talk more and more about people and the places of food, about the
chef's family, as well as about the food and the recipes.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the most fabled of all American cookbooks, although not
always the most fashionable, is ``Joy of Cooking,'' first
introduced in 1931 by Irma S. Rombauer. It has gone through
countless editions, like a dynasty, with Ms. Rombauer being
assisted by her daughter, Marion Rombauer Becker. More than 15
million copies have sold, making its backlist a literary oil well.
The latest edition (Scribner), the first since 1975, was a year
ago, revised partly by the founder's grandson, Ethan Becker, with
the publisher fearlessly shipping more than a million copies in the
first six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The book's editor, Maria Guarnaschelli , said this edition took
three years to produce at a cost of $5 million, including the
seven-figure advance, and that the expertise of about 120 food
consultants was used to update the work and make it a bit more
sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   The effort paid off. The book flew out of the publishing house
``performing like a megahit novel,'' Ms. Guarnaschelli said, with
joy, adding, ``It's a reference book as well as a recipe book. You
can learn about braising and how to bake custards in a water
bath.'' Which, of course, is the only way to really manage the heat
when cooking a simple custard or a creme brulee.
</P>
<P>
   Nach Waxman, owner of a Kitchen Arts and Letters, a bookstore in
Manhattan specializing in food and wine, said that two-thirds of
his customers were food professionals ``buying professional tools.
Knives are one tool; books are another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The general public heats up and cools off about cooking, but
it's still becoming a favorite recreational activity,'' he
continued. ``In this country we have the luxury to cook as we wish,
not for basic nutrition.''
</P>
<P>
   So, between the professional and the amateur, he sells
everything from the latest cookbooks to scholarly works on
agriculture to practical books, such as how one can start up an
ice-cream factory.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who want to plunge into deep culinary esoterica,
there's ``Tarte a la Creme: Comedy and Gastronomy in Moliere's
Theater'' (Ohio State University Press) by Ronald W. Tobin. It only
costs $42.50, but it's on back order.

ISRAEL'S LABOR PARTY HAS AN IDENTITY CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also ISRAEL-LIKUD, ISRAEL-ARAFAT) 
(mk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ As the conservative Likud government takes up the
mantle of peace, Labor, Israel's historically dovish party, finds
itself with a conundrum.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-year-old coalition government of Benjamin Netanyahu, the
Likud prime minister who has long been Labor's political enemy, is
wobbly. But to topple it now might threaten the peace effort that
Labor politicians hold so dear _ and even then to risk failure at
recapturing the reins of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a daily dilemma,'' said Yossi Beilin, a Labor member of
Parliament. ``How far are we going to go to support this government
because we don't want it to be toppled against the background of
the Washington agreement? We can't give him a blank check.''
</P>
<P>
   The predicament was crystallized Wednesday morning when
Netanyahu sent a draft of the national budget to Parliament. Labor
strongly opposes the budget, but the vote was turning into a
referendum on the peace agreement negotiated at Wye Plantation in
Maryland and signed last week at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The right wanted to attach a vote of no confidence in the
government to the budget. Netanyahu, in return, wanted a confidence
vote. Labor had promised the prime minister to protect him, but it
was unwilling to go so far as to endorse him or his budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the ultimate trickery and abuse of the good intentions
in our gentlemen's agreement with the prime minister,'' said Ehud
Barak, the Labor Party's leader.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Netanyahu backed down, postponing the budget's
presentation, but the episode made clear to many members of Labor
just how awkward their current role is.
</P>
<P>
   When Netanyahu took a step toward the center by signing the Wye
agreement, he knocked Labor, which has been split by internal
fighting, off its feet. Suddenly the distinctions between the two
major parties _ Labor, the peaceniks, and Likud, the defenders of
Greater Israel _ had blurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Labor has won historically, but what does it mean for
their own future?'' said David Makovsky, diplomatic correspondent
for the newspaper Haaretz. ``Are they rebels without a cause?''
</P>
<P>
   As the only party that could defeat Likud in a national
election, Labor theoretically stands to gain by joining the right's
call for a new vote. But the shakiness of Netanyahu's current
government is no guarantee that he could not maintain power in new
elections by cutting into Labor's centrist constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Also, holding a typically volatile Israeli election campaign
during the 12-week fulfillment period of the fragile peace accord
could create an unstable dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   Even if actual campaigning were delayed, the knowledge that new
elections were on the horizon _ mid-March is the proposed date _
could create a contentious backdrop for the withdrawal of Israeli
troops from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank. And
Netanyahu has threatened to freeze the fulfillment of the agreement
if Labor does force Parliament to dissolve and call new elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an absolutely complicated situation that gives us all a
big headache,'' said Avraham Shochat, a member of Parliament and
influential strategist for Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Labor's identity crisis comes at a critical time for the party,
which held power for most of the 50 years since the state of Israel
was founded. Netanyahu is the third prime minister of Likud, which
was created as a rightist opposition party specifically to stand
against the idea of territorial compromise, the turning over of
land to the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   First, the institutions that sustained Labor, most critically
the labor federation Histadrut and the kibbutzim, are losing their
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Labor has had difficulty reaching down from its elite,
Ashkenazic constituency into the working-class and Orthodox
communities that have been tapped by Likud and by Shas, the growing
third party with a Sephardic, ultra-Orthodox base.
</P>
<P>
   In an embarrassing moment for Labor, its distance from the new
grass-roots Israelis was pointed up this summer when a top party
official, Ori Orr, made disparaging remarks about Moroccan Jews,
questioning their intelligence and terming them a ``problematic
ethnic group.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there have been public tensions between Ehud Barak, the
party leader, and Shimon Peres, the former prime minister who has
been seen to be undercutting him. After one incident, Barak
referred to Peres as ``a saboteur and subversive.''
</P>
<P>
   And epitomizing the party's problems, in the coming municipal
elections, Labor has failed to field a strong candidate to
recapture the mayoralty of Jerusalem from Ehud Olmert, a right-wing
Likudnik, at a time when the future of Jerusalem will move front
and center in the next phase of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oy, is the Labor Party in trouble,'' Hirsh Goodman, a
columnist, wrote this week in the newsmagazine Jerusalem Report.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Party is not of one mind, and its present dilemma
highlights that. Some politicians believe that they need Netanyahu
to have access to power and Netanyahu needs them during the final
peace talks that lie ahead. But others do not want to collaborate
at any price with a leader toward whom they feel deep personal
animosity.
</P>
<P>
   Peres has favored a national unity government almost since he
lost the last election to Netanyahu in 1996, because he wants Labor
to have a seat at the negotiating table during the critical and
thorny final talks with the Palestinians. Many say that Peres, who
declined to be interviewed, personally wants that seat.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, on the other hand, rebuffed an offer to join a unity
government that Netanyahu extended this week, Aryeh Deri, the Shas
leader, said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Chaim Ramon, the Labor Party's deputy leader,
caused a stir Wednesday by announcing that he thought Labor should
accept the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after Ramon made his comments, three other Labor
members of Parliament called a press conference to denounce the
suggestion, saying it would co-opt the party entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't trust Netanyahu,'' Beilin said. ``It would be very
artificial to enter government and serve as ministers under him.
From the outside we can exert pressure if he tries to do something
like expropriate Palestinian land. But once we're inside, we've
lost the lever.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last week, Netanyahu called his coalition chairman, Meir
Shitrit, from the negotiating table in Maryland and asked him to
negotiate with the Labor Party for a two-week safety net for his
government. Beyond that, Labor has promised not to touch him during
the three-month fulfillment period, provided that he makes no
aggressive moves counter to the spirit of the accord _ like
expanding settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But Labor members said they would be sitting on their hands with
difficulty, especially when the prime minister spews hostile
rhetoric at them, as he did Wednesday night in a fiery meeting of
Likud's central committee in Tel Aviv, when he railed against
Barak. That, they said, is why they are moving forward to dissolve
Parliament, despite Netanyahu's threat to freeze the agreement with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't mortgage all our political philosophy to this one
issue,'' said Shlomo Ben Ami, a Labor member of Parliament. ``If he
freezes the process, he will cause himself more harm than us. He
will never win back the extreme right, and he will not gain the
support of the center he is courting.''

 &HT;    Hearing to focus on discipline at schools
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A hearing on student discipline at 7 p.m. at the State
Capitol will wrap up a series of five statewide hearings by a
Senate panel that has found that parents often have a different
perspective on discipline in schools than do teachers and
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents have told the state Senate study committee in
earlier hearings that schools have deliberately shut them out of
efforts by the school to address their children's behavior
problems, according to Suzanne Dion, the Georgia PTA's legislative
chairwoman, who attended the packed hearings in Macon, Ga., and
Athens, Ga., in the past four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When parents come to a school to talk about a discipline
problem, the school makes them feel ``there's no room for
discussion,'' Dion said, summarizing the testimony of many parents.
While some parents and advocacy groups have argued for stronger
due-process protection of accused students and disproportional
administration of punishment against black students, many parents
were more interested in added alternatives for when their children
misbehave and more early notification before suspension or
expulsion becomes necessary.
</P>
<P>
   This is only one of many viewpoints that have been expressed as
various panels, in Georgia and nationally, study the related issues
of school safety and student discipline. A White House summit on
school safety Oct. 15 was linked by satellite to a hearing at North
Atlanta High; two state representatives are also holding hearings
on the issue; the state Board of Education is studying the uneven
state funding of alternative schools and a Department of Education
school safety panel is working on implementing a school-safety
survey that was among its recommendations last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who complained about feeling shut off by the schools
contradicts a common refrain from educators and even some parents
who blame the parents of disruptive students for not being
involved, Dion said. ``The majority of schools do not know what
parent involvement means,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Vincent Fort (D-Atlanta), chairman of the study committee,
said that ``from the testimony we have heard, there seems to be a
genuine concern that there is a need for more teacher training and
focus on class management.'' Additionally, he said, ``And our
minority students are disparately impacted when it comes to
excessive disciplinary actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is 7-9 p.m. in Room 450 of the Capitol.

 &HT;    Countdown for Glenn mission `up there with the best of them'
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. _ After a 36-year hiatus, space
pioneer John Glenn on Thursday was set to return to orbit as the
countdown clicked flawlessly toward today's space shuttle launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our countdown is progressing smoothly. This is a pretty good
countdown. It's right up there with the best of them,'' NASA test
director Steve Altemus said.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch no longer posed a threat to the launch, weather
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at a zero percent chance of weather prohibiting
launch,'' said Capt. Clif Stargardt, a meteorologist with the Air
Force's 45th weather squadron, which supports space shuttle
launches.
</P>
<P>
   Stargardt said this is a refreshing difference from Glenn's 1962
Mercury flight, when weather caused four of the 10 delays in his
launch. He finally lifted off on Feb. 20 for a four hour, 55-minute
flight that made him the first American to orbit the earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like Mother Nature wants to see John Glenn return to
space just as much as the rest of us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If all continues to go well, space shuttle Discovery will blast
off at 2 p.m. today with nearly 7 million pounds of thrust, sending
the 77-year-old Glenn on an eight day, 22-hour orbital mission that
has drawn worldwide attention. The shuttle is scheduled to land
back here at 11:50 a.m. Saturday, Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   At Pad 34-B, the massive Rotating Service Structure was swung
away from the shuttle at sunset, revealing the white, winged
orbiter Discovery for the first time since it was put on the launch
pad for this mission.
</P>
<P>
   Its seven crew members gathered later in the evening at the foot
of the towering, 184-foot-tall rocket to see their families for the
last time before launch. There were no hugs and kisses. Restricted
by their traditional pre-launch quarantine, astronauts and family
members could only stand apart from each other and wave, Altemus
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling of the shuttle's rust-colored external tank was to begin
at 5:40 a.m. today. Once the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen
propellants are loaded, the entire shuttle will weigh in at about
4.5 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Glenn's Mercury-Atlas vehicle weighed just under
260,000 pounds at the start of his first space flight.
</P>
<P>
   The launch team's biggest challenge appeared to be guessing what
President Clinton will do. Clinton plans to watch the launch, but
Altemus said his specific plans were ``constantly changing.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton decides to call the crew, the launch team will have
to figure out how to fit it into the countdown without upsetting
the tightly scheduled sequence of events, launch managers said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Clinton, about 200 politicians are expected to be in a
VIP viewing crowd. That and the high-profile nature of this mission
have prompted NASA support contractor Space Gateway Services Inc.
to boost security at the sprawling space center.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agencies and the Brevard County Sheriff's Office have
loaned extra bomb-sniffing dogs, SWAT teams and law-enforcement
officers for the mission, said Pete Colangel, SGS manager of
protective services.
</P>
<P>
   At the main gate to the launch complex, an electronic ``speed
bump'' takes a digital picture of the underside of each vehicle; a
security guard in a van inspects the image before allowing the
vehicle to pass, Colangel said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's possible presence in the launch control center or the
VIP viewing area has made a favorite photo point off-limits to the
news media for this mission _ the 525-foot-high Vehicle Assembly, a
mammoth sugar-cube shaped structure that looms over the launch
complex.
</P>
<P>
   Insulated from the swirl of reporters and politicians,
Discovery's crew was said to be in high spirits _ especially Glenn,
whose ``attitude is infectious,'' said Charles Precourt, a veteran
space shuttle astronaut who has been keeping close tabs on the crew
as chief of NASA's astronaut office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very eager, very willing to do the work, and fun to be
around,'' Precourt said.

 &HT;    Reed doesn't shy from controversy
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Behind some of the more controversial Republican
campaigns in the Southeast is Ralph Reed, the former Christian
Coalition leader who is trying his hand at political consulting.
</P>
<P>
   His first round of candidates since opening Century Strategies
Inc. in Gwinnett County this year includes Mitch Skandalakis, the
GOP nominee for lieutenant governor in Georgia; John Frank Collins,
who is running for labor commissioner; Alabama Gov. Fob James; and
Kentucky state Sen. Gex Williams, running for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The group is a mix of religious conservatives (James and
Williams), a perennial candidate (Collins) and an ambitious
suburbanite who revels in bare-knuckles politics (Skandalakis).
</P>
<P>
   They share an ability to attract controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I'm rapidly discovering about this business
is that you rarely have a guy who doesn't have any problems. I'm
still looking for Mr. Clean Jeans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Georgia graduate who came to national
prominence as the Christian Coalition's executive director also has
another dozen or so candidates in less competitive races, including
Sen. Paul Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   Reed's work for the freshman senator follows the key role the
Christian Coalition played in his election six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell was not the first choice of religious conservatives in
the Republican primary that year, primarily because of his support
for abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than sit out the primary, Reed made sure that the
coalition distributed voter guides that portrayed Coverdell as
acceptable to conservatives, figuring Coverdell would be a strong
general election candidate against Democratic Sen. Wyche Fowler Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky congressional election features Williams, who is a
perfect match for the Christian Coalition, but who has stumbled
through the campaign over ethical issues and the reluctance of more
moderate Republicans to back him.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, James also faces an uphill fight in an election that
has turned into a referendum on a state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, the labor commissioner's election is an oddity,
pitting Collins, who has run in the past in both parties, against
Michael Thurmond, an African-American former chief of the
Department of Family and Children Services who is making his first
statewide race.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the lieutenant governor's race that has set the
standard for ugliness this campaign season.
</P>
<P>
   Skandalakis has run a TV ad that suggests opponent Mark Taylor
continues to use drugs (which Taylor vehemently denies) and, in the
view of critics, has sought to make race an issue in order to draw
the votes of conservative whites away from Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, citing an association with Skandalakis that goes back to
college, has a matter-of-fact view of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see either one of those guys winning a lot of Boy
Scout awards,'' he said.

<P>
   DRAGOBILJE, Yugoslavia _ Hoping that NATO's demand that the
Yugoslav government reduce its forces in Kosovo province would help
keep their village safe, the family returned after three months of
hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday they buried Ali Paqarizi, 19. He was killed Tuesday,
three blocks from home, by a booby trap that police left behind.
</P>
<P>
   There is a cease-fire in Kosovo, but there is still killing and
the likelihood of peace may not be high.
</P>
<P>
   Poking around the edges of a truce demanded and enforced by the
West, both sides in the war seem to be looking for ways to continue
fighting because the mistrust that started the conflict has become,
for some, the deepest hatred.
</P>
<P>
   As people were digging a grave for Ali Paqarizi here, villagers
nearby were digging four graves for elderly men who did not flee
quickly enough when the government attacked their homes this
summer. Their bodies were found by the first of their neighbors to
return Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Though U.S. and European diplomats Wednesday repeated their
strong warnings that peace and negotiations were in great jeopardy
if ethnic Albanian guerrillas reoccupied territory left by
government forces, the guerrillas were doing exactly that
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Fighters of the rebel group, the Kosovo Liberation Army, bore
Ali Paqarizi's body from his home. Then, his mother followed, held
upright by friends and praying.
</P>
<P>
   In twos, holding hands or arm in arm, a long line of women came
out and turned toward the village square, scarves on their heads,
their long simple dresses reaching to the mud and stones of the
pathway.
</P>
<P>
   Then the men. First, those with the status that comes from age,
each one wearing the brimless white felt cap of Albanian tradition.
Along the way to the military ceremony in the square, other men
waited in groups at the street corners to fall in with the
procession. At the end came three Muslim clerics.
</P>
<P>
   Represented on the streets here were the parts of traditional
rural Albanian society in Kosovo: the family, the clan, the village
and religion.
</P>
<P>
   But the guerrilla army, more of a citizens' militia, these days
is often the part of society that has the most authority. Here,
Wednesday, it was in charge.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla army had essentially been in hiding since the
government began a military offensive in late July. But when the
government bowed to NATO threats this week and drastically cut the
number of police and soldiers in Kosovo, the guerrillas came back
as the civilians began to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Some 80 rebel fighters were Ali Paqarizi's pallbearers and honor
guard.
</P>
<P>
   A commander known as Steel, from the rebel headquarters, gave
the eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   He said the death had broken the cease-fire and would be
avenged. ``It is our obligation to those who have fallen to
continue on our sacred road until we have our freedom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The few people returning to Dragobilje on Tuesday and Wednesday
found three booby traps. In other villages, many more have been
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a good count yet,'' an international aid worker
said. ``But, mines and booby traps seem to be strewn everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened both by the fact that the government had left and the
rebels could come back, several families left their camps in the
forests and returned here Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Muhament Paqarizi, 48, drove the tractor and wagon with his
family's household goods up to the gate of the family compound and
flung it open. In the courtyard, by the well, there was the hole in
the flagstones left by the artillery round that had sent them
fleeing. On the walls of the buildings were the holes from the
molten metal chunks let loose when the shell exploded.
</P>
<P>
   His family is back, but is very nervous about it, he said. ``We
saw others start back. The last 10 days have been very cold and
wet, so we thought we might take a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   His brother, who said he was a civilian, was killed in his house
by government forces during the offensive. He is now raising his
brother's 10 children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kosovo Liberation Army is here to protect us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the question now is whether the forced retreat of the
government and the very fast advance of the guerrillas will make
renewed combat unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   One set of short hills away from where rebel fighters conducted
the funeral, there are government forces in the town of Malisevo.
With the threats for revenge from the rebel commander Steel fresh
in the air, people in Dragobilje were saying the government
detachment there should be attacked, partly in retribution and
partly because it was impossible for people to return there if the
police were not forced out.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said they have told rebel leaders that more
fighting would be a mistake because it would destroy their chances
for a reasonable political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been told not to start trouble because we are not
going to bail them out,'' a diplomat said, implying that the West
would not restrain government counter attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such warnings, on the hills around Malisevo, rebel
fighters were occupying not only the land and villages just
abandoned by government forces, but many of the trenches,
observation posts and bunkers as well.

NATO ALMOST DECIDED TO BOMB YUGOSLAV FORCES, HOLBROOKE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Richard Holbrooke, the American architect of the
agreement on Kosovo, said Wednesday that NATO had come perilously
close in recent days to a decision to bomb Yugoslav forces to force
them out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us thought that bombing almost certainly was going to
happen,'' he said at a news conference at the State Department to
discuss the situation in the Balkans. ``I judged the chances of
military action _ that is, an aerial war _ at well over 60 percent
when we started. This was not a bluff.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat of NATO air strikes on Yugoslav targets was lifted,
at least for now, when NATO officials announced Tuesday that
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was in ``substantial
compliance'' with Western demands that he withdraw his forces from
Kosovo and end Yugoslav attacks on ethnic Albanians who make up
most of the population there.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement worked out between Milosevic and Holbrooke,
unarmed Western monitors will now be sent to Kosovo to verify that
the Serbs do not try to resume their crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said the team of monitors would total at least 2,000.
``Two thousand is a floor, not a ceiling,'' Holbrooke said.

 &HT;    5 environmental protesters arrested
 &HT;    By Chris Reinolds
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service ATLANTA _ Five environmental protesters
<TEXT>
who made a pre-dawn climb up a 200-foot construction crane
Wednesday at Home Depot's headquarters in Cobb County were arrested
on charges of criminal trespass, a misdemeanor.
<P>
   Facing charges are John Johnson, 28, of Chattanooga, Tenn.;
Kimba Wolff, 22, of Athens, Ga.; Erin McCulley, 22, of Boone, N.C.;
Anthony Caldetra, 21, of Albany, Ga.; and Matthew Willford, 26, of
Bakersville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Another protester, David Jennings, 46 of Decatur, was arrested
on a charge of simple battery after he pushed a police
photographer, said Cobb County police spokesman Robert Quigley.
</P>
<P>
   The Rainforest Action Network protesters' activity drew looks
from morning rush hour commuters and caused two wrecks on nearby
roads, according to police. The protest ended about 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot said the disruption cost the company about half a day
in construction time.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The woman who sings Alanis Morissette's new album
sounds like a mess. In the 17 songs on ``Supposed Former
Infatuation Junkie'' (Maverick), which is to be released on
Tuesday, she has been attached to abusive men, she has been
stuffing and starving herself, she has taken too many antibiotics,
and she has been working herself to the point of collapse. She has
felt jealous, misunderstood, worthless; nothing, from shopping to
sex to wealth and worldwide popularity, has made her happy. And
every bit of trauma and frustration comes out in her voice: in its
harried vibrato and sudden yelping breaks, in its banshee wails and
caustic nasal turns. While her litany of self-doubt is set in the
past tense, the wounds still sound raw.
</P>
<P>
   But in a long talk at the beach house she has rented outside Los
Angeles, the 24-year-old woman who wrote the songs is serene and
cheerful, with an easy laugh that sometimes makes her blush.
``Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie'' is the follow-up to ``Jagged
Little Pill,'' released in 1995, which sold 28 million copies
worldwide with its mixture of fury and resilience. After keeping a
low profile for more than a year, Ms. Morissette is about to face
the public again.
</P>
<P>
   Back from a business meeting, she's wearing a gray pullover and
a black skirt, and she has peach nail polish on her fingers and
toes. Her place is austerely furnished, with an oversize white
couch, a few chairs and a mattress on the floor by the terrace that
overlooks the Pacific. The only obvious personal touches are a pair
of large candles and an amber-colored 1930s Bakelite radio, a
birthday present.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morissette pulls shut a sliding glass door so that the roar
of the waves won't drown her out on an interviewer's tape, curls up
on the couch and explains that, yes, the scenarios she sang are all
pretty much true, with names changed. Writing and performing them,
she says, is a way of resolving things. Maybe it should be called
song therapy; songwriter and audience are determined to master
their problems by naming them aloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more vulnerable and the more confused the song is, the
equal and opposite effect is how I feel after having written it,''
she said. ``Admitting I was bouncing off the walls made it so I
could be calm in my own skin, because I could say it and dissolve
it. And the deeper I go admitting fear, admitting the confusion,
the clearer I usually feel. I don't really feel vulnerable; I feel
empowered by it.''
</P>
<P>
   The therapeutic model has a long rock pedigree. John Lennon made
it official with his primal-scream songs in 1970, but songwriters
from time immemorial have displaced their conflicts, sublimated
their lusts, sought revenge and admitted their upsets within the
confines of verse-chorus-verse.
</P>
<P>
   Few, however, have been as blunt about their therapeutic intent
as Ms. Morissette is on ``Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie.'' The
album includes one song, ``The Couch,'' about convincing her father
to try therapy, and another in which she tells a friend, ``I was
hoping we could heal each other.'' In conversation as well as
lyrics, Ms. Morissette doesn't shy away from psychobabble. ``You've
been nothing but open-hearted and emotionally available and
supportive and nurturing,'' she sings in ``Unsent,'' a series of
affectionate messages to ex-boyfriends. (She says that she called
each one, including men she hadn't spoken to in years, and asked
for permission to sing about him.)
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, not the first time that Ms. Morissette has
wailed her troubles. ``Jagged Little Pill,'' was full of emotional
whiplashes: the furious accusations and sexual bravado of ``You
Oughtta Know,'' the cheerful contradictions in ``Hand in My
Pocket,'' the lapsed-Catholic backlash of ``Forgiven.'' At the
time, Ms. Morissette was unknown outside Canada, where she had been
a child actress and a dance-pop singer and songwriter. But ``Jagged
Little Pill'' reached young women (and some men) around the world,
and Ms. Morissette's concerts almost immediately became fervent
sing-alongs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morissette emerged behind a pack of daring female rockers in
the mid-1990s, among them P.J. Harvey, Liz Phair and Ani DiFranco,
who didn't flinch from sexual candor or extreme emotions. But their
audiences were primarily collegiate-cult followings. Ms. Morissette
was only 21 years old when ``Jagged Little Pill'' came out, and the
songs, some of them written while she was still a teen-ager,
grabbed a mass audience directly by its adolescent angst.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Glen Ballard, who had produced Michael Jackson, Ms.
Morissette came up with clear-cut rock tunes and studded them with
guitar feedback and cutting vocals, a potent commercial combination
of hooks and barbs. She toured like a trouper through 1996,
circling the globe, and ``Jagged Little Pill'' became the
best-selling American debut album ever.
</P>
<P>
   Then she withdrew, exhausted. Recording companies were already
seeking the next Morissette, cultivating the yelps of singers like
Natalie Imbruglia, Chantal Kreviazuk and Tracy Bonham. Meanwhile,
Ms. Morissette stepped away from the music business. ``I had been
overwhelmed with the vast amount of stimuli that is catapulted your
way when you're in the public eye and on tour,'' she said.
``Everything snowballing as it did was a lot to digest, and I
really didn't have the energy or the clarity or the understanding
or the handbook to do that. Now, my handbook would say, `Cry when
you need to cry, talk when you need to talk and stop when you need
to stop.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morissette went through bouts of depression as the tour
stretched on. ``Schedule-wise, my health and my peace of mind
wasn't a priority,'' she said. ``There had been this dissonance in
the midst of all the external success. Because on the one hand, I
was expected to be overjoyed by it, and at the same time I was
disillusioned by it. I wasn't ungrateful, I was just confused and
overwhelmed. So I stopped for what felt like the first time in my
life.''

ETHNIC ALBANIANS RETURN TO KOSOVO, BUT TROUBLE FOLLOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Braving booby traps and sometimes under
the gaze of Yugoslav police, a cautious but steady flow of ethnic
Albanians returned to their abandoned villages in Kosovo, a day
after a Serb pullout led NATO to cancel air raids.
</P>
<P>
   While humanitarian aid groups and Western diplomats took heart
from the returning ethnic Albanians, who had fled into the woods
and hills to escape Serb forces, the US diplomat responsible for
the Serbian province of Kosovo expressed concern that ethnic
Albanian rebels might exploit the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking here late Wednesday afternoon, Christopher Hill, the US
envoy to Kosovo, said he was encouraged by the ``changes on the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hill said he worried that the rebels of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, would reestablish checkpoints and posture
provocatively with rifles as they return to the villages from which
they were driven by Serbs over the last nine months. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased that returns are taking place,'' Hill said. But,
he added, ``It is our strong view the KLA should not take advantage
of this reconfiguration, the withdrawal.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill and his European Union counterpart, Wolfgang Petritsch, the
Austrian ambassador in Belgrade, spoke to reporters outside the US
headquarters here after meeting with the ethnic Albanian delegation
that is supposed to take part in talks with Serbian negotiators,
part of the deal reached two weeks ago by US special envoy Richard
Holbrooke and Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia is the larger of the two republics that make up
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, Hill met with Adem Demaci, a political
representative of the guerrilla group that says it will only stop
fighting when Kosovo is given its independence, to emphasize that
the Kosovo Liberation Army should not taunt Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States does not support Kosovo's independence,''
said Hill. ``It would not be a stabilizing factor in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, US officials were giving the rebels credit for
disarming some of the crude mines and booby traps left behind by
Serb forces. Some of the tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians
displaced by the Serb offensive have refused to return home, citing
fears about booby traps. An ethnic Albanian man who returned to his
home in Dragobilj was killed Tuesday when he tripped a mine.
</P>
<P>
   Hill urged the ethnic Albanians to take advantage of the
breathing space created by the rebel cease-fire and the Serb
withdrawal to begin negotiations on returning Kosovo to the
autonomy it had before Milosevic unilaterally ended it in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Checkpoints are not going to solve this thing,'' said Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Preparations are being made to accommodate an international
force of 2,000 observers to verify that Milosevic and the rebels
are each keeping their part of the bargain. An equal number of
soldiers from European armies will be deployed to protect the
observers.
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian groups, meanwhile, were trying to figure out how to
get those who fled the Serb forces to return to their homes, and to
repair many of the homes that were damaged or ruined by Serb troops
and shells.
</P>
<P>
   Of Kosovo's 2 million people, up to 300,000 have fled their
homes in the last nine months, according to humanitarian groups.
The Serbian government puts that figure at closer to 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 700 people, most of them ethnic Albanian civilians,
have been killed since last February, when Serb forces launched a
counter-offensive against the Kosovo Liberation Army after the
separatist group began killing members of the Serb security forces
and publicly asserting control over villages.

 LOS ANGELES: my life.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She traveled to India and Cuba; she resumed friendships and
reconnected with her family. She got in shape to run, bicycle and
swim in triathlons. She read fiction and psychology books. And for
a while, she contemplated letting ``Jagged Little Pill'' be her
last album.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very thought of my creating another record and having that
sort of craziness that came along with it just didn't seem worth it
to me,'' she said. ``I needed to enter into what I saw as this
terrorizing abyss of letting go of everything that I had been
taught. A lot of preconceived notions that I had about fame and
status and money and joy and pain, and all of these things that I
thought I knew, I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet almost as soon as she decided that she could step away from
her career, she found herself writing songs again. And as 1998
began, she returned to the place where she made ``Jagged Little
Pill,'' Ballard's Aerowave Studio in Encino, Calif. The main studio
is a control room on the second floor of a large house. It's the
size of a master bedroom, with tidy racks of equipment, a small
glassed-in vocal booth and a view of olive trees out the window.
</P>
<P>
   Using guitars, keyboards and computers, Ballard and Ms.
Morissette would work on music together, and then Ms. Morissette
would winnow lyrics from her journals while Ballard built the
backing track. ``She would have this duffel bag full of her
thoughts, poems, ruminations,'' Ballard said. ``Those were all raw
materials. She likes to get a flow going with the music. I'll get a
seed of something, and once she hears it the way she wants to hear
it, she'll go to this computer around the corner and finish the
lyrics.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballard added: ``Every word for her is like giving blood. As she
writes, she eliminates all the things that don't work for her
emotionally. But once she's satisfied that she's said what she had
to say, at that moment, all the lights turn green and she just goes
in and burns it down. She sings it once, maybe twice, and she walks
away from it and says, `That's it.' I don't know anybody else who
can do it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Ballard said they frequently wrote and recorded a song a
day. Ms. Morissette insisted on spontaneity. One song, ``That I
Would Be Good,'' had a buzz in Ballard's guitar part; he
re-recorded it with cleaner sound, but Ms. Morissette insisted that
he keep the original.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morissette shrugs off questions about commercial
expectations. ``I don't think about that,'' she said. ``That wasn't
my mind-set when I wrote `Jagged Little Pill,' or anything before
that, either. I've been surrounded by a lot of people who felt that
external success would result in them feeling good about
themselves. But it just seems extremely unfulfilling to me. You're
almost guaranteed to be disappointed. For me, a life without
expectation results in a life with inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Madonna, the co-chief executive officer of Maverick Records,
said in a telephone interview, ``There's nothing predictable about
this record at all, and a lot of it is more experimental than I
expected. She definitely pushes the envelope on this record as well
as delivering some well-written songs. And she uses a lot of
50-cent words on the record. I don't even know what half of those
words mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Does the company anticipate another blockbuster? ``She has a
huge following, and everyone's waiting for this record,'' Madonna
said. ``But 28 million, that's a horrible standard to try to live
up to. She's already proven herself. I won't be disappointed if it
doesn't sell 28 million. I'd be disappointed if it didn't sell 5
million, but I know that won't happen. But for those huge numbers,
it means you're drawing the long straw with the guardian angel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie'' doesn't set out to
re-create ``Jagged Little Pill'' in sound or attitude. Some of Ms.
Morissette's new songs, like the single ``Thank U,'' have clear-cut
choruses; some don't. And rhymes have virtually disappeared from
the lyrics, which can read like unfiltered diary entries. Words,
not melodies, take precedence on most songs, and Ms. Morissette
often delivers them in recitatives, akin to Joni Mitchell and Ani
DiFranco at their most loquacious, and in repeated, incantatory
lines that hint at non-Western music. (Ms. Morissette is to appear
on an album of studio-concocted posthumous duets with the great
Pakistani singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan along with Perry Farrell of
Jane's Addiction and the Israeli singer Ofra Haza.)
</P>
<P>
   The tone is different, too. Where ``Jagged Little Pill'' often
lashed out, much of ``Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie'' is about
reconciliation: with parents, with lovers, with the fears and
weaknesses that Ms. Morissette saw in herself. ``I just equated
relationships with pain, and now I don't,'' she said. ``I think of
a lot of those songs on `Jagged Little Pill' as being reactionary.
And they resulted in release but not closure. My rage, in and of
itself, alone and without a level of consciousness and
understanding, wasn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In the harrowing ``Sympathetic Character,'' enclosed by a stark,
percussive drone and layers of distorted guitar, Ms. Morissette
recalls an abusive relationship, shifting between memories of
terror _ ``I was afraid you'd hit me if I'd spoken up/I was afraid
of your physical strength'' _ and of dependency: ``You were my best
friend/you were my lover/you were my mentor.'' The song, Ms.
Morissette said, is based on ``a composite of a bunch of people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never abused as such, in the conventional view,'' she
said. ``But I don't think we have to have been beaten up to fear
being beaten up. It's simply being around someone who you don't
trust to be able to deal with their rage. You get used to it, and
that which is familiar is often what we equate with love. I used to
think heart palpitations were love, and really it was fear.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ When the federal government deregulated the
airline industry in 1978, it changed forever the way people travel,
spurring competition, lowering prices and giving upstart
discounters such as Southwest Airlines a chance to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   When a federal judge approved the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T,
telephone users for the first time were able to choose their
long-distance company.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the state government is considering what could be one of
its most sweeping deregulation actions ever, one that would affect
every consumer and business every time they flick on a light
switch, wash a load of laundry or fire up a factory.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three months from now, the Legislature will begin
debating whether to consider letting Texans shop for their
electricity, just as they can for long-distance telephone service
or the best air fares.
</P>
<P>
   It's a topic so controversial that it has led to protests and
political referendums in other states. It's an issue so big that
the federal government may consider intervening on a national level
next year. And it's so complex that even the legislators who will
decide whether Texas should go through with it are still trying to
understand it.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, both a major producer and a major consumer of energy,
the stakes are enormous.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of deregulation say consumers could save 15 percent
to 30 percent on their monthly electric bills. Given that Texans
pay an average of $88 a month for electricity, that means every
household could have an extra $300 a year to spend on something
else. Moreover, they say, if the state doesn't open up the
electricity business to competition that could bring down prices,
big energy-using employers could move their operations to other
states where they have more choice. Even if they didn't leave, they
might want to expand elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of deregulation point out that Texans already have rates
that are below the national average and the Public Utility
Commission lately has even trimmed rates at some utilities. They
point to other states _ 18 others have begun deregulating their
electric industries _ where competition hasn't worked, at least not
yet. And, they say, deregulation could lead to higher rates, and
will almost undoubtedly lead to more hassles for consumers already
weary of long-distance telephone company pitches and problems.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think such a highly charged issue would be a hot topic
among political candidates and voters.
</P>
<P>
   Think again.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, who is running for re-election and favors
competition, said no one asks him about it on the campaign trail:
``It's hard for people to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   His Democratic opponent, Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, said he
considered including electric competition in his announcement
speech, but took it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too complicated for people to understand in an election
year format and it made my speech way too long,'' Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   Enormous impact
</P>
<P>
   Complicated, yes, but incredibly important.
</P>
<P>
   On its surface, the issue of deregulating the electricity
business is simple. Right now, government bodies generally set
electric rates. The Austin City Council sets the rates for the
city-owned utility, Austin Energy. Pedernales Electric Cooperative
Inc., based in Johnson City, sets its own rates, subject to review
by the Public Utility Commission. Rates of big investor-owned
utilities, such as Texas Utilities Electric Co., are set by the
PUC.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, each utility has a monopoly over its service area;
with a few exceptions, no other company can serve its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation would do two things. It would end regulation of the
price charged for generating electricity (but not transporting it),
and it would allow customers to buy it from anyone willing to sell
it to them.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that if sellers are forced to compete, that will
keep a lid on prices and spur innovative services.
</P>
<P>
   But then the issue of deregulation gets more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Investor-owned utilities typically favor competition_ but only
if it includes a guarantee that they still could bill customers to
recover the billions of dollars they invested in nuclear power
plants _ so called ``stranded costs.'' Right now, those costs are
passed along to consumers in their monthly bills.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that those nuclear plants aren't worth as much
today as the utilities paid to build them. The most recent PUC
report pegged the lost value at $4.5 billion, but its estimates for
individual utilities are generally less than what the utilities
claim.
</P>
<P>
   Also, while Texans have low electric rates, they use a lot of
electricity to cope with the heat by running their air
conditioners.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates, pointing to the fact that Texans have the
third-highest electric bills on average _ only Hawaii and Florida
are higher, according to trade group Edison Electric Institute _
say that Texas needs to do more to encourage conservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the highest bills in the nation for average
consumers,'' said Tom Smith, director of Public Citizen in Texas, a
group founded by consumer crusader Ralph Nader. ``Our power plants
are the largest industrial source of pollution. And we're not
developing new resources we're going to need for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer and environmental groups are not necessarily opposed to
competition in principle, but they want to make sure that programs
to promote energy conservation don't get junked and that air
pollution isn't worsened by competitors making heavier use of
older, less-clean plants.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer groups also warn against potential ``cost
shifting'' that could occur with deregulation, in which utilities
would cut prices for big customers by trying to collect more money
from residential and small business customers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, city-owned utilities, such as Austin's, and electric
cooperatives, like Pedernales, remain skeptical. The cooperatives,
which serve mostly rural areas and small towns, fear that big power
suppliers could take away their biggest, most profitable customers,
forcing them to raise the rates of the remaining residential and
small business customers. And the co-ops are in a position to
negotiate, as they showed in the last legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   Last session, Bush got behind a bill to allow competition in the
industry, but tripped over the state's electric cooperatives, which
decided at the eleventh hour they were opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The bill didn't even get out of committee.
</P>
<P>
   Big push is on
</P>
<P>
   The issue, however, didn't go away.
</P>
<P>
   Big industrial and commercial customers are convinced that
competition would save them millions of dollars. In Texas, they are
organized as the Texas Coalition for Competitive Electricity, whose
members cover a wide spectrum of businesses, from the Texas
Chemical Council to the Texas Restaurant Association.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Kroger, an attorney for the coalition, said all
customers would save 15 percent to 30 percent on their electric
bills in a fully competitive system. And she said business needs
lawmakers to act in 1999 so that everyone can plot their futures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want to know what the landscape's going to look like,''
Kroger said.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's biggest energy companies _ many of which are based
in Texas _ have been plotting strategy for years and are
combat-savvy veterans from deregulation battles in other states.
</P>
<P>
   While the politicians have been silent, the Association of
Electric Companies of Texas has launched a $1.1 million statewide
television ad campaign trumpeting the advantages of competition.
</P>
<P>
   The association's president, John Fainter, argues that if the
Legislature doesn't act, Congress will, and ``Texans may suffer
unpleasant consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Fainter says he isn't trying to scare the Legislature into
passing a bill. But such decisions should be made in Austin, not
Washington, he said, adding that utilities need certainty before
Wall Street and others will invest in new power plants in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities have put their money behind the push for
competition in another way, too.
</P>
<P>
   Since June 1997, campaign contribution reports filed with the
state show, Texas' investor-owned utilities have contributed more
than $652,000 to federal, state and local candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Of that, about $380,000 went to candidates, mostly incumbents,
for state offices, including $58,000 to Bush. At the state Capitol,
the debate over electricity deregulation has already been going on
quietly for months.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Interim Committee on Electric Restructuring and the
House State Affairs Committee have been considering whether the
state should deregulate and give up much of its control over the
rates charged by the utilities.
</P>
<P>
   But the more they learn, the more reluctant lawmakers seem to
tamper with an electric utility system that, they believe, works
well here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pro-competitors have launched a campaign to get into the mind
of consumers that deregulation of electricity means cheaper
electricity,'' complained a member of the House committee, Rep.
Delwin Jones, R-Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' Jones said. ``It means that certain people
may get a bargain discount if they are a big (industrial or
commercial) consumer. But we've got to be extremely careful, or
anything we do will cause the residential and small business owner
an increase in his cost for electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   Also cautious is Sen. Troy Fraser, R-Horseshoe Bay, a member of
the special Senate panel: ``If we're not totally assured rates will
go down for residential users, we can't vote for a bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest figures from the federal Energy Information
Administration show why legislators sound so cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Texas residential customers, on average, paid 7.8
cents per kilowatt hour for electricity. The national average was
8.5 cents. California residential customers paid 11.4 cents, while
Pennsylvanians paid 9.8 cents.
</P>
<P>
   In pennies, those differences don't sound like much. But they
add up quickly: a monthly electric bill that would be $100 in Texas
would be $126 in Pennsylvania and $146 in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we have medium-range rates, we still have the
highest electric bills in the United States,'' said Rep. Debra
Danburg, D-Houston, who favors competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not lower those electric bills if we can do so?'' she
said. ``And we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Push for action
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how the battle lines will be drawn will become more
clear over the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   While politicians may be skirting the complex issue now, they'll
be forced to get an education quickly _ if not by consumers, then
by the utilities and others who are trying to force them to make a
stand when the Legislature convenes in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's imminent,'' said Dick Brooks, chairman of Central and
South West Corp., a Dallas-based holding company that owns four
electric utilities, including three operating in Texas. ``It's
about to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Central and South West is merging with a bigger utility,
American Electric Power Inc. of Columbus, Ohio, because of a
conviction that it must get bigger to navigate the coming age of
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Still others see no reason to act: ``I want Texas to wait at
least four years to see what is happening in those pilot programs
in the East and the West,'' said state Rep. Leo Alvarado, D-San
Antonio, a member of the House State Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But like some big utilities, some Wall Street analysts say Texas
cannot afford to wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big customers, if they have choice and if the rates are low,
they'll continue to expand in that area,'' said Edward Tierello, an
investment analyst with Bankers Trust in New York. ``If they don't
have choice, and even if rates are low, they may choose to go
somewhere else where they think there's a possibility of getting a
better deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're jeopardizing the economic future of the state if you
don't put something in place'' to allow competition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have watched deregulation in other states _ places
where energy isn't as important as it is in Texas _ agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe you can continue to be the energy center of
the country and not open up your market to retail electric
competition,'' said John Hanger, a former member of the
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, whose years as a consumer
advocate convinced him regulation didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Texas continues to protect its local monopolies by not
passing pro-competition legislation, Texas will resign its energy
leadership to other states.''

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ No one can predict how the Texas Legislature
could phase out regulation of electric utilities _ or even if it
will. But if Texas follows other states that have deregulated the
power industry, here's what could happen.
</P>
<P>
   What's likely to happen:
</P>
<P>
   _ Consumers and businesses could pick their own power providers
_ much like they do their long-distance telephone service providers
_ within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Electricity prices may come down. In other industries that
went through deregulation, such as the airline industry, prices
dropped dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   _ The government would stop setting the price of power itself.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rules prohibiting practices such as slamming (changing
consumers' power suppliers when they don't want to switch) and
cramming (charging for services consumers don't want).
</P>
<P>
   What's not likely to happen:
</P>
<P>
   _ Choice in power providers probably wouldn't happen soon.
Legislators might well put off consumer choice until 2001, to let
utilities pay down debt on nuclear power plants and develop the
procedures necessary to let consumers switch.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consumers and businesses probably wouldn't rush out to change
electricity providers. In many states that have already started to
deregulate their power industry, change has been slow.
</P>
<P>
   _ Utilities will not build new power lines or poles. Companies
would likely deliver electricity using existing lines and poles.
</P>
<P>
   _ State and local taxes would still be levied.

   PHILADELPHIA _ Paul and Marie Curran didn't think their monthly
electric bills from PECO Energy Co. were all that bad, although one
infamously hot summer four years ago they got one for $350.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with three college-age daughters to support, the Currans
_ he's a planner for the Philadelphia Planning Commission, she's a
school nurse _ welcome any opportunity to trim expenses in their
North Philadelphia home, a Dutch colonial with four bedrooms and
about 2,200 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   So when they were offered an opportunity a year ago to join
Pennsylvania's pilot project for opening electric utility
monopolies to competition, the Currans took it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was interested in the guaranteed savings that was being
offered by all the companies that were in the program _ 8 to 12
percent,'' said Paul Curran.
</P>
<P>
   After considering numerous offers, they decided to stay with
PECO Energy. But because their power started coming from a new PECO
subsidiary established just to compete with other electricity
providers, their monthly bills nevertheless fell by about 10
percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Currans paid $198.23 for their electricity in July; had they
not been in the program they would have paid $221.08.
</P>
<P>
   The Currans were among 230,000 Pennsylvanians who were in the
pilot project. They will soon be among a much larger group of
Pennsylvania residents who, starting Jan. 1, will be able to choose
their electric company.
</P>
<P>
   Local electric utilities will continue to deliver power to
Pennsylvania customers and take care of such problems as power
outages. Rates for those services are still regulated.
</P>
<P>
   But customers will be charged separately for the electricity
itself. Their bills will state the ``price to beat'' on power so
that they'll know exactly what a competitor must offer to save them
money.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania is not the first state to adopt a plan to allow
competition in the electric utility industry, but observers in
Texas and elsewhere say it appears to have done the best job yet.
</P>
<P>
   So far, almost 2 million of Pennsylvania's 5.2 million
electricity customers have signed up to shop for a power supplier.
About 70 companies have signed up as suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania Legislature enacted pro-competition legislation
in December 1996. It phased in competition so that all customers
are expected to have a choice by January 2000. It also provided for
the pilot project to test the new system.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvanians first began hearing a call for competition in the
mid-1990s, when John Hanger, a member of the state's Public Utility
Commission, decided that competition would be the best way to force
down high electric rates.
</P>
<P>
   Hanger had served for a number of years as a consumer advocate
in utility rate cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating,'' Hanger said. ``We were always arguing
how much rates should go up. We didn't argue about much they should
go down.''
</P>
<P>
   So in 1993, as a new member of the Public Utility Commission, he
began advocating competition as the best way to keep rates down.
</P>
<P>
   Big industrial and commercial customers began to note that while
they were paying rates as high as 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour,
wholesale power was selling for around 3 cents, said David
Kleppinger, an attorney for the Industrial Energy Consumers of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   If utilities could buy power for 3 cents per kilowatt hour, he
said, ``Why not us?''
</P>
<P>
   A Republican governor elected in 1994, Tom Ridge, got
competition rolling.
</P>
<P>
   He saw it as another way to advance his program for countering
what many saw as an anti-business climate in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   With the chairman of the Public Utility Commission, John Quain,
as his ramrod, Ridge got a bill passed in December 1996. But the
bill did not resolve the question of billions of dollars of
``stranded costs'' _ money the utilities say they will lose from
past investments, especially in nuclear power plants, that will not
be economic in a competitive market for electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The size of stranded costs is important because it determines
how much rates can be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, that problem was turned over to the Pennsylvania
Public Utility Commission, which has been ruling, one utility at a
time, how much each can collect for stranded costs from all
customers over the next decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   The utility usually then sues, other parties intervene and then
talks are held for an out-of-court settlement.
</P>
<P>
   A good example is PECO Energy.
</P>
<P>
   It asked the utility commission for $7.5 billion in stranded
costs; the commission approved $4.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   PECO sued, and in the settlement talks that followed the
compromise was $5.26 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Popowski, Pennsylvania's state consumer advocate, endorsed
the competition plan. But he said the utilities should have been
required to either sell their plants _ and thereby determine their
real market value _ or keep them without recovering stranded costs.
As it is, he said, the utilities want compensation for plants they
say are uneconomical but don't want to have to give them up.
</P>
<P>
   The plants may prove more valuable than initially thought.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Cunningham, president of the Pennsylvania Electric
Association, said big industrial customers want to ensure a
reliable source of power by buying it from a company that has its
own power plant.
</P>
<P>
   And utilities, of course, have power plants.

 LOS ANGELES: was fear.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the gentle ``Are You Still Mad,'' Ms. Morissette itemizes the
ways she sabotaged a romance _ ``Are you still mad I had a tendency
to mother you?/Are you still mad that I had one foot out the door''
_ and concludes, ``Of course you are.'' In ``Would Not Come,''
which meshes a modal, Middle Eastern-flavored melody with a
plunging syncopated bass line, Ms. Morissette catalogs misgivings
and chronic dissatisfactions. ``If I take a break it would make me
irresponsible,'' she sings. ``I'd be filthy rich and still it would
not come/I would seduce them and still it would not come.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the songs on ``Jagged Little Pill'' offered a personalized
take on Everygirl's growing pains, ``Supposed Former Infatuation
Junkie'' is more narrowly focused on Ms. Morissette's own situation
as a singular kind of career woman. The songs grapple with
contradictory drives toward success and self-effacement and with
the hollowness of wealth and fame; they wind up, in songs like
``Thank U'' and ``Joining You,'' with a nondenominational
spirituality that insists that people are important for their
essences, not their achievements. The point is not in the
specifics, but in the sound of torment giving way to consolation,
again and again. The volatile strength of Ms. Morissette's voice
promises that candor, no matter what it reveals, will set her free.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morissette came through New York in late October on a tour
of small halls and theaters before the album's release. At the
Hammerstein Ballroom, her band made the songs pound and seethe,
while Ms. Morissette paced the stage and hurled phrases skyward.
Young women were already singing along on ``Thank U,'' and cheering
its verses of self-help as if they were a pop plebiscite. ``How
'bout no longer being masochistic?,'' Ms. Morissette sang to a wave
of happy shouts. ``How 'bout remembering your divinity?'' got a
more subdued response. But when she sang, ``How 'bout unabashedly
bawling your eyes out?'' the whole room erupted in affirmative
squeals. The therapy was still in progress.

CLINTON ASKS THAT ELECTION NOT BE REFERENDUM ON HIS PERSONAL
BEHAVIOR  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton asserted Wednesday that he had
undergone ``inner changes'' as a result of the Monica Lewinsky
scandal and said that Tuesday's elections should not be a
referendum on his personal behavior but on his conduct in office.
</P>
<P>
   Answering Republican campaign advertisements that because of his
lies about the Lewinsky scandal he cannot be trusted with the
public's business, Clinton said that he had kept the majority of
his policy promises to the American people and that he should be
held accountable for his public integrity, not his private acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I think that it's fair for a person to be judged on his
whole record,'' the president said in a Rose Garden news conference
with Andres Pastrana, the president of Colombia, who is in
Washington for a state visit. ``I'm not trying to sugarcoat the
fact that I made a mistake and that I didn't want anybody to know
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point in the 50-minute news conference, Clinton
added: ``I hope the American people have seen in me over these last
few weeks a real commitment to doing what I told them I would do
from the beginning _ to try to atone to them for what happened and
to try to redouble my efforts to be a good president. And I hope
they have sensed the inner changes that are going on and the
manifestations and the efforts I've made to help the education of
our children in the budget, to achieve peace in the Middle East
talks.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been the essence of the White House defense in the
Lewinsky affair from the beginning: Clinton's personal behavior
with Ms. Lewinsky was indefensible, but it was private and has no
bearing on how he does his job as president. His actions were
wrong, Clinton's lawyers and political defenders concede, but not
impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   That line of argument has now become a significant part of the
Democrats' strategy in the midterm election. They are happy to
allow Republicans to focus on Clinton's private conduct because
they believe _ and polls tend to support that belief _ that the
American public has rendered a judgment on the president and, by a
large margin, does not favor removing him from office for his
private actions.
</P>
<P>
   In the joint appearance with Pastrana, Clinton returned again
and again to the message he said he believes will benefit
Democratic candidates across the country. He said Republicans are
intent on making the election a referendum on his conduct, while he
is accusing Republicans of squandering the nation's future by
trying to use budget surpluses to finance tax cuts, by refusing to
pass health care and tobacco legislation, and by failing to act on
legislation to revamp campaign financing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that he had redeemed his promises to the American
people, while Republicans had knuckled under to well-financed
special interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at what I said I'd do when I presented myself to
the American people in 1991 and 1992, at the long list of things
we've done we said we'd do, and at the good results that the
American people have enjoyed, and at the fact that the American
people, I think, agree with us and not them _ I think that's the
real issue here,'' the president said. ``Are we right or are they
right?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's robust defense of his record came in response to
several questions about a new series of Republican television
advertisements questioning his integrity and his trustworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   One portrays two middle-class housewives discussing how to
explain the Lewinsky scandal to their children.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was asked how he would answer that advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what people ought to say to their children is that,
`When someone makes a mistake, they should admit it and try to
rectify it,' and that this is an illustration of the fact that
those rules should apply to everyone,'' Clinton said. ``But that
when people do that, if they do it properly, they can be stronger
in their personal lives, in their family lives and in their work
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said that he had gone through a period of
self-examination and had grown stronger as a result. ``With a
humble spirit, with the grace of God and with a lot of
determination,'' Clinton said, ``I think that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton received a vote of confidence from Pastrana, who was
inaugurated as president of Colombia three months ago to replace
President Ernesto Samper, whom the administration considered
corrupted by drug money.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana welcomed the U.S. commitment to his anti-drug efforts
and his attempt to make peace with insurgents. He noted that the
United States had pledged $280 million in new economic assistance
to Colombia, in part to help compensate coca farmers who switch to
less lethal but also less lucrative crops.
</P>
<P>
   And like many other foreign leaders with whom Clinton has
appeared during this year of scandal and investigation, he offered
warm words of support for the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allow me to say,'' Pastrana said, ``that my country and my
compatriots feel deep respect for President Clinton and for his
role as a world leader and as a rarity in history.''

 &HT;    Texas braces for another deregulation battle

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When the federal government deregulated the
airline industry in 1978, it changed forever the way people travel,
spurring competition, lowering prices and giving upstart
discounters such as Southwest Airlines a chance to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   When a federal judge approved the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T,
telephone users for the first time were able to choose their
long-distance company.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the state government is considering what could be one of
its most sweeping deregulation actions ever, one that would affect
every consumer and business every time they flick on a light
switch, wash a load of laundry or fire up a factory.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three months from now, the Legislature will begin
debating whether to consider letting Texans shop for their
electricity, just as they can for long-distance telephone service
or the best air fares.
</P>
<P>
   It's a topic so controversial that it has led to protests and
political referendums in other states. It's an issue so big that
the federal government may consider intervening on a national level
next year. And it's so complex that even the legislators who will
decide whether Texas should go through with it are still trying to
understand it.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, both a major producer and a major consumer of energy,
the stakes are enormous.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of deregulation say consumers could save 15 percent
to 30 percent on their monthly electric bills. Given that Texans
pay an average of $88 a month for electricity, that means every
household could have an extra $300 a year to spend on something
else. Moreover, they say, if the state doesn't open up the
electricity business to competition that could bring down prices,
big energy-using employers could move their operations to other
states where they have more choice. Even if they didn't leave, they
might want to expand elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of deregulation point out that Texans already have rates
that are below the national average and the Public Utility
Commission lately has even trimmed rates at some utilities. They
point to other states _ 18 others have begun deregulating their
electric industries _ where competition hasn't worked, at least not
yet. And, they say, deregulation could lead to higher rates, and
will almost undoubtedly lead to more hassles for consumers already
weary of long-distance telephone company pitches and problems.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think such a highly charged issue would be a hot topic
among political candidates and voters.
</P>
<P>
   Think again.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, who is running for re-election and favors
competition, said no one asks him about it on the campaign trail:
``It's hard for people to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   His Democratic opponent, Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, said he
considered including electric competition in his announcement
speech, but took it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too complicated for people to understand in an election
year format and it made my speech way too long,'' Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   Enormous impact
</P>
<P>
   Complicated, yes, but incredibly important.
</P>
<P>
   On its surface, the issue of deregulating the electricity
business is simple. Right now, government bodies generally set
electric rates. The Austin City Council sets the rates for the
city-owned utility, Austin Energy. Pedernales Electric Cooperative
Inc., based in Johnson City, sets its own rates, subject to review
by the Public Utility Commission. Rates of big investor-owned
utilities, such as Texas Utilities Electric Co., are set by the
PUC.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, each utility has a monopoly over its service area;
with a few exceptions, no other company can serve its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation would do two things. It would end regulation of the
price charged for generating electricity (but not transporting it),
and it would allow customers to buy it from anyone willing to sell
it to them.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that if sellers are forced to compete, that will
keep a lid on prices and spur innovative services.
</P>
<P>
   But then the issue of deregulation gets more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Investor-owned utilities typically favor competition_ but only
if it includes a guarantee that they still could bill customers to
recover the billions of dollars they invested in nuclear power
plants _ so called ``stranded costs.'' Right now, those costs are
passed along to consumers in their monthly bills.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that those nuclear plants aren't worth as much
today as the utilities paid to build them. The most recent PUC
report pegged the lost value at $4.5 billion, but its estimates for
individual utilities are generally less than what the utilities
claim.
</P>
<P>
   Also, while Texans have low electric rates, they use a lot of
electricity to cope with the heat by running their air
conditioners.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates, pointing to the fact that Texans have the
third-highest electric bills on average _ only Hawaii and Florida
are higher, according to trade group Edison Electric Institute _
say that Texas needs to do more to encourage conservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the highest bills in the nation for average
consumers,'' said Tom Smith, director of Public Citizen in Texas, a
group founded by consumer crusader Ralph Nader. ``Our power plants
are the largest industrial source of pollution. And we're not
developing new resources we're going to need for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer and environmental groups are not necessarily opposed to
competition in principle, but they want to make sure that programs
to promote energy conservation don't get junked and that air
pollution isn't worsened by competitors making heavier use of
older, less-clean plants.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer groups also warn against potential ``cost
shifting'' that could occur with deregulation, in which utilities
would cut prices for big customers by trying to collect more money
from residential and small business customers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, city-owned utilities, such as Austin's, and electric
cooperatives, like Pedernales, remain skeptical. The cooperatives,
which serve mostly rural areas and small towns, fear that big power
suppliers could take away their biggest, most profitable customers,
forcing them to raise the rates of the remaining residential and
small business customers. And the co-ops are in a position to
negotiate, as they showed in the last legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   Last session, Bush got behind a bill to allow competition in the
industry, but tripped over the state's electric cooperatives, which
decided at the eleventh hour they were opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The bill didn't even get out of committee.
</P>
<P>
   Big push is on
</P>
<P>
   The issue, however, didn't go away.
</P>
<P>
   Big industrial and commercial customers are convinced that
competition would save them millions of dollars. In Texas, they are
organized as the Texas Coalition for Competitive Electricity, whose
members cover a wide spectrum of businesses, from the Texas
Chemical Council to the Texas Restaurant Association.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Kroger, an attorney for the coalition, said all
customers would save 15 percent to 30 percent on their electric
bills in a fully competitive system. And she said business needs
lawmakers to act in 1999 so that everyone can plot their futures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want to know what the landscape's going to look like,''
Kroger said.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's biggest energy companies _ many of which are based
in Texas _ have been plotting strategy for years and are
combat-savvy veterans from deregulation battles in other states.
</P>
<P>
   While the politicians have been silent, the Association of
Electric Companies of Texas has launched a $1.1 million statewide
television ad campaign trumpeting the advantages of competition.
</P>
<P>
   The association's president, John Fainter, argues that if the
Legislature doesn't act, Congress will, and ``Texans may suffer
unpleasant consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Fainter says he isn't trying to scare the Legislature into
passing a bill. But such decisions should be made in Austin, not
Washington, he said, adding that utilities need certainty before
Wall Street and others will invest in new power plants in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities have put their money behind the push for
competition in another way, too.
</P>
<P>
   Since June 1997, campaign contribution reports filed with the
state show, Texas' investor-owned utilities have contributed more
than $652,000 to federal, state and local candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Of that, about $380,000 went to candidates, mostly incumbents,
for state offices, including $58,000 to Bush. At the state Capitol,
the debate over electricity deregulation has already been going on
quietly for months.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Interim Committee on Electric Restructuring and the
House State Affairs Committee have been considering whether the
state should deregulate and give up much of its control over the
rates charged by the utilities.
</P>
<P>
   But the more they learn, the more reluctant lawmakers seem to
tamper with an electric utility system that, they believe, works
well here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pro-competitors have launched a campaign to get into the mind
of consumers that deregulation of electricity means cheaper
electricity,'' complained a member of the House committee, Rep.
Delwin Jones, R-Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' Jones said. ``It means that certain people
may get a bargain discount if they are a big (industrial or
commercial) consumer. But we've got to be extremely careful, or
anything we do will cause the residential and small business owner
an increase in his cost for electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   Also cautious is Sen. Troy Fraser, R-Horseshoe Bay, a member of
the special Senate panel: ``If we're not totally assured rates will
go down for residential users, we can't vote for a bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest figures from the federal Energy Information
Administration show why legislators sound so cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Texas residential customers, on average, paid 7.8
cents per kilowatt hour for electricity. The national average was
8.5 cents. California residential customers paid 11.4 cents, while
Pennsylvanians paid 9.8 cents.
</P>
<P>
   In pennies, those differences don't sound like much. But they
add up quickly: a monthly electric bill that would be $100 in Texas
would be $126 in Pennsylvania and $146 in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we have medium-range rates, we still have the
highest electric bills in the United States,'' said Rep. Debra
Danburg, D-Houston, who favors competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not lower those electric bills if we can do so?'' she
said. ``And we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Push for action
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how the battle lines will be drawn will become more
clear over the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   While politicians may be skirting the complex issue now, they'll
be forced to get an education quickly _ if not by consumers, then
by the utilities and others who are trying to force them to make a
stand when the Legislature convenes in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's imminent,'' said Dick Brooks, chairman of Central and
South West Corp., a Dallas-based holding company that owns four
electric utilities, including three operating in Texas. ``It's
about to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Central and South West is merging with a bigger utility,
American Electric Power Inc. of Columbus, Ohio, because of a
conviction that it must get bigger to navigate the coming age of
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Still others see no reason to act: ``I want Texas to wait at
least four years to see what is happening in those pilot programs
in the East and the West,'' said state Rep. Leo Alvarado, D-San
Antonio, a member of the House State Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But like some big utilities, some Wall Street analysts say Texas
cannot afford to wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big customers, if they have choice and if the rates are low,
they'll continue to expand in that area,'' said Edward Tierello, an
investment analyst with Bankers Trust in New York. ``If they don't
have choice, and even if rates are low, they may choose to go
somewhere else where they think there's a possibility of getting a
better deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're jeopardizing the economic future of the state if you
don't put something in place'' to allow competition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have watched deregulation in other states _ places
where energy isn't as important as it is in Texas _ agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe you can continue to be the energy center of
the country and not open up your market to retail electric
competition,'' said John Hanger, a former member of the
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, whose years as a consumer
advocate convinced him regulation didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Texas continues to protect its local monopolies by not
passing pro-competition legislation, Texas will resign its energy
leadership to other states.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California consumers' reaction to getting the
right to shop for electricity can be summed up in the word that
perhaps best expresses Californians' laid-back image: ``Whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they have been able to shop for their own power company
since March 31, fewer than 68,000 residential customers _ less than
1 percent _ in California have switched to other electricity
suppliers, according to the California Public Utilities Commission.
Only about 30,000 commercial and industrial customers had made the
switch. That's out of almost 10 million eligible customers.
</P>
<P>
   That indifference in a state where power costs 50 percent more
than the national average perhaps reflects a feeling of comfort
dealing with a well-known local utility and unpleasant experiences
with competition elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   James Forrest, a retired local government official on a recent
visit to the Hillsdale Shopping Center in San Mateo, just south of
San Francisco, said he had not even considered buying power from
someone other than the big local utility, Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric,
``primarily because we're satisfied with the service.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Nadine Forrest, a retired teacher, said she got fed up
with telephone companies calling her for long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't she like to have a choice for an electricity supplier?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a nuisance!'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some call California's deregulation plan a flop. Others call it
an outrage. Still others say it just needs more time because, like
the breakup of AT&AMP;T in 1984, real competition will evolve slowly,
not explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not try to prejudge what's happened in California,''
said Richard Bilas, president of the California Public Utilities
Commission. ``We didn't start until March 31 ... (but) it is true
that if one were to look at the early results on the residential
side, you would say, `Uh-oh, this is a tremendous failure.'''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, big industrial customers are taking
advantage of their new freedom to shop around.
</P>
<P>
   Bilas said he thinks more vigorous competition for residential
and small business customers will begin after 2002, when the
state's power consumers finish paying off about $28 billion in old
utility investments through a ``competition transition charge'' now
included in every monthly bill.
</P>
<P>
   The transition charge is supposed to compensate utilities for
their investments in nuclear power plants and other long-term
contracts that, in an open market, won't be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates have attacked the transition charge as a
utility bail-out strongly enough that they were able to get a
proposition on the November ballot that could cancel it. If voters
approve it, the issue is likely to end up in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The transition charge is among the factors cited by California
utility experts on why competition has gotten off to such a slow
start. Other reasons include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Under the California plan, the residential and small business
customers of the state's three biggest investor-owned utilities,
which have most of the market, got 10 percent rate cuts without
doing a thing. Not only did that give customers incentive to stay
with their utility, it made it harder for new competitors to
compete.
</P>
<P>
   _ Not long after competition began, there were a number of media
reports about shady electricity dealers and questionable marketing
practices. That scared a lot of people away.
</P>
<P>
   _ The transition charge can vary from month to month, making it
difficult for a would-be competitor to figure out just what rate to
set for a customer, said Steve Kean, senior vice president for
government affairs at Enron Corp., a Houston-based power marketer.
Enron made national news this spring when it stopped marketing to
residential customers in California. However, it continues to sell
to industrial and commercial customers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The California commission, according to critics, was all too
generous in deciding that the three utilities were entitled to
recover up to $28 billion from the transition charge to make up for
what the industry calls ``stranded costs.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the leading critics of the utilities is Nettie Hoge,
executive director of The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group
that participates in electric rate cases.
</P>
<P>
   TURN officially took a neutral stand in 1996 when the California
General Assembly adopted the pro-competition legislation that, Hoge
says, heavily favored the utilities. Neutrality was a mistake, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have laid down on the track,'' Hoge said.
</P>
<P>
   Other states, including Texas, should not enact similar
legislation just because many say competition is inevitable, Hoge
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does the train have to leave the station?'' she said.
``Especially if your rates are average?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are those who welcome the opportunity to choose _
even, in some cases, choosing to pay more if it means helping the
environment. It's one face of competition that consumer advocates
like.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Baumrucker, of nearby Castro Valley, a city in the San
Francisco Bay area south of Oakland, is one such customer ready to
pay more. He signed up to buy his power from Green Mountain Energy
Resources, a Vermont-based partnership that markets electricity
produced from renewable resources, such as wind turbines, dams,
biomass and geothermal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember what it was,'' Baumrucker said, when asked
how much more he expected to pay. ``I'm willing to pay it.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost ``is not the crucial thing,'' he said. ``The crucial
thing is getting in step with the way I think things ought to be.''

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Paul and Marie Curran didn't think their monthly
electric bills from PECO Energy Co. were all that bad, although one
infamously hot summer four years ago they got one for $350.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with three college-age daughters to support, the Currans
_ he's a planner for the Philadelphia Planning Commission, she's a
school nurse _ welcome any opportunity to trim expenses in their
North Philadelphia home, a Dutch colonial with four bedrooms and
about 2,200 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   So when they were offered an opportunity a year ago to join
Pennsylvania's pilot project for opening electric utility
monopolies to competition, the Currans took it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was interested in the guaranteed savings that was being
offered by all the companies that were in the program _ 8 to 12
percent,'' said Paul Curran.
</P>
<P>
   After considering numerous offers, they decided to stay with
PECO Energy. But because their power started coming from a new PECO
subsidiary established just to compete with other electricity
providers, their monthly bills nevertheless fell by about 10
percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Currans paid $198.23 for their electricity in July; had they
not been in the program they would have paid $221.08.
</P>
<P>
   The Currans were among 230,000 Pennsylvanians who were in the
pilot project. They will soon be among a much larger group of
Pennsylvania residents who, starting Jan. 1, will be able to choose
their electric company.
</P>
<P>
   Local electric utilities will continue to deliver power to
Pennsylvania customers and take care of such problems as power
outages. Rates for those services are still regulated.
</P>
<P>
   But customers will be charged separately for the electricity
itself. Their bills will state the ``price to beat'' on power so
that they'll know exactly what a competitor must offer to save them
money.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania is not the first state to adopt a plan to allow
competition in the electric utility industry, but observers in
Texas and elsewhere say it appears to have done the best job yet.
</P>
<P>
   So far, almost 2 million of Pennsylvania's 5.2 million
electricity customers have signed up to shop for a power supplier.
About 70 companies have signed up as suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania Legislature enacted pro-competition legislation
in December 1996. It phased in competition so that all customers
are expected to have a choice by January 2000. It also provided for
the pilot project to test the new system.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvanians first began hearing a call for competition in the
mid-1990s, when John Hanger, a member of the state's Public Utility
Commission, decided that competition would be the best way to force
down high electric rates.
</P>
<P>
   Hanger had served for a number of years as a consumer advocate
in utility rate cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating,'' Hanger said. ``We were always arguing
how much rates should go up. We didn't argue about much they should
go down.''
</P>
<P>
   So in 1993, as a new member of the Public Utility Commission, he
began advocating competition as the best way to keep rates down.
</P>
<P>
   Big industrial and commercial customers began to note that while
they were paying rates as high as 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour,
wholesale power was selling for around 3 cents, said David
Kleppinger, an attorney for the Industrial Energy Consumers of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   If utilities could buy power for 3 cents per kilowatt hour, he
said, ``Why not us?''
</P>
<P>
   A Republican governor elected in 1994, Tom Ridge, got
competition rolling.
</P>
<P>
   He saw it as another way to advance his program for countering
what many saw as an anti-business climate in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   With the chairman of the Public Utility Commission, John Quain,
as his ramrod, Ridge got a bill passed in December 1996. But the
bill did not resolve the question of billions of dollars of
``stranded costs'' _ money the utilities say they will lose from
past investments, especially in nuclear power plants, that will not
be economic in a competitive market for electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The size of stranded costs is important because it determines
how much rates can be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, that problem was turned over to the Pennsylvania
Public Utility Commission, which has been ruling, one utility at a
time, how much each can collect for stranded costs from all
customers over the next decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   The utility usually then sues, other parties intervene and then
talks are held for an out-of-court settlement.
</P>
<P>
   A good example is PECO Energy.
</P>
<P>
   It asked the utility commission for $7.5 billion in stranded
costs; the commission approved $4.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   PECO sued, and in the settlement talks that followed the
compromise was $5.26 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Popowski, Pennsylvania's state consumer advocate, endorsed
the competition plan. But he said the utilities should have been
required to either sell their plants _ and thereby determine their
real market value _ or keep them without recovering stranded costs.
As it is, he said, the utilities want compensation for plants they
say are uneconomical but don't want to have to give them up.
</P>
<P>
   The plants may prove more valuable than initially thought.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Cunningham, president of the Pennsylvania Electric
Association, said big industrial customers want to ensure a
reliable source of power by buying it from a company that has its
own power plant.
</P>
<P>
   And utilities, of course, have power plants.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California consumers' reaction to getting the
right to shop for electricity can be summed up in the word that
perhaps best expresses Californians' laid-back image: ``Whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they have been able to shop for their own power company
since March 31, fewer than 68,000 residential customers _ less than
1 percent _ in California have switched to other electricity
suppliers, according to the California Public Utilities Commission.
Only about 30,000 commercial and industrial customers had made the
switch. That's out of almost 10 million eligible customers.
</P>
<P>
   That indifference in a state where power costs 50 percent more
than the national average perhaps reflects a feeling of comfort
dealing with a well-known local utility and unpleasant experiences
with competition elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   James Forrest, a retired local government official on a recent
visit to the Hillsdale Shopping Center in San Mateo, just south of
San Francisco, said he had not even considered buying power from
someone other than the big local utility, Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric,
``primarily because we're satisfied with the service.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Nadine Forrest, a retired teacher, said she got fed up
with telephone companies calling her for long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't she like to have a choice for an electricity supplier?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a nuisance!'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some call California's deregulation plan a flop. Others call it
an outrage. Still others say it just needs more time because, like
the breakup of AT&AMP;T in 1984, real competition will evolve slowly,
not explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not try to prejudge what's happened in California,''
said Richard Bilas, president of the California Public Utilities
Commission. ``We didn't start until March 31 ... (but) it is true
that if one were to look at the early results on the residential
side, you would say, `Uh-oh, this is a tremendous failure.'''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, big industrial customers are taking
advantage of their new freedom to shop around.
</P>
<P>
   Bilas said he thinks more vigorous competition for residential
and small business customers will begin after 2002, when the
state's power consumers finish paying off about $28 billion in old
utility investments through a ``competition transition charge'' now
included in every monthly bill.
</P>
<P>
   The transition charge is supposed to compensate utilities for
their investments in nuclear power plants and other long-term
contracts that, in an open market, won't be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates have attacked the transition charge as a
utility bail-out strongly enough that they were able to get a
proposition on the November ballot that could cancel it. If voters
approve it, the issue is likely to end up in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The transition charge is among the factors cited by California
utility experts on why competition has gotten off to such a slow
start. Other reasons include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Under the California plan, the residential and small business
customers of the state's three biggest investor-owned utilities,
which have most of the market, got 10 percent rate cuts without
doing a thing. Not only did that give customers incentive to stay
with their utility, it made it harder for new competitors to
compete.
</P>
<P>
   _ Not long after competition began, there were a number of media
reports about shady electricity dealers and questionable marketing
practices. That scared a lot of people away.
</P>
<P>
   _ The transition charge can vary from month to month, making it
difficult for a would-be competitor to figure out just what rate to
set for a customer, said Steve Kean, senior vice president for
government affairs at Enron Corp., a Houston-based power marketer.
Enron made national news this spring when it stopped marketing to
residential customers in California. However, it continues to sell
to industrial and commercial customers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The California commission, according to critics, was all too
generous in deciding that the three utilities were entitled to
recover up to $28 billion from the transition charge to make up for
what the industry calls ``stranded costs.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the leading critics of the utilities is Nettie Hoge,
executive director of The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group
that participates in electric rate cases.
</P>
<P>
   TURN officially took a neutral stand in 1996 when the California
General Assembly adopted the pro-competition legislation that, Hoge
says, heavily favored the utilities. Neutrality was a mistake, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have laid down on the track,'' Hoge said.
</P>
<P>
   Other states, including Texas, should not enact similar
legislation just because many say competition is inevitable, Hoge
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does the train have to leave the station?'' she said.
``Especially if your rates are average?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are those who welcome the opportunity to choose _
even, in some cases, choosing to pay more if it means helping the
environment. It's one face of competition that consumer advocates
like.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Baumrucker, of nearby Castro Valley, a city in the San
Francisco Bay area south of Oakland, is one such customer ready to
pay more. He signed up to buy his power from Green Mountain Energy
Resources, a Vermont-based partnership that markets electricity
produced from renewable resources, such as wind turbines, dams,
biomass and geothermal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember what it was,'' Baumrucker said, when asked
how much more he expected to pay. ``I'm willing to pay it.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost ``is not the crucial thing,'' he said. ``The crucial
thing is getting in step with the way I think things ought to be.''

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ No one can predict how the Texas Legislature
could phase out regulation of electric utilities _ or even if it
will. But if Texas follows other states that have deregulated the
power industry, here's what could happen.
</P>
<P>
   What's likely to happen:
</P>
<P>
   _ Consumers and businesses could pick their own power providers
_ much like they do their long-distance telephone service providers
_ within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Electricity prices may come down. In other industries that
went through deregulation, such as the airline industry, prices
dropped dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   _ The government would stop setting the price of power itself.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rules prohibiting practices such as slamming (changing
consumers' power suppliers when they don't want to switch) and
cramming (charging for services consumers don't want).
</P>
<P>
   What's not likely to happen:
</P>
<P>
   _ Choice in power providers probably wouldn't happen soon.
Legislators might well put off consumer choice until 2001, to let
utilities pay down debt on nuclear power plants and develop the
procedures necessary to let consumers switch.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consumers and businesses probably wouldn't rush out to change
electricity providers. In many states that have already started to
deregulate their power industry, change has been slow.
</P>
<P>
   _ Utilities will not build new power lines or poles. Companies
would likely deliver electricity using existing lines and poles.
</P>
<P>
   _ State and local taxes would still be levied.

ALL PIECES SLIP INTO PLACE FOR GLENN'S TRIUMPHANT RETURN TO SPACE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Almost like magic, all of the ingredients
slipped into place Wednesday for the spectacle of John Glenn's
return to space Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds of enthusiastic spectators, soon to be joined by
President Clinton, poured into the normally sedate communities of
aerospace workers next to NASA's sprawling Kennedy Space Center and
into the tourist enclaves that line Central Florida's sun-drenched
beaches.
</P>
<P>
   News media jammed into the press facilities, not so taxed since
America launched its first astronauts to the moon in 1969 and in
1988 rebounded from the Challenger tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to an unlikely encore flight aboard the shuttle Discovery
by the man who became the first American to orbit the Earth nearly
37 years ago, spaceflight has achieved at least a temporary new
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn,77, is among an otherwise young, international crew of
seven set to blast off from Kennedy aboard the shuttle Discovery at
2 p.m., EST, although the unusually generous launch period spans 2
{ hours.
</P>
<P>
   NASA seemed eager to embrace the spectacle and to spotlight the
nine-day mission of varied experiments it has been patiently
brewing since Glenn was added to the flight crew last January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome the opportunity to showcase this program on the
space shuttle,'' said Bob Sieck, NASA's director of shuttle
operations at Kennedy. ``It's a natural resource, both the hardware
and the people. We're privileged to have the opportunity to
demonstrate these capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn circled the Earth three times in a Mercury capsule on Feb.
20, 1962, after four weather postponements and 11 different launch
dates.
</P>
<P>
   Better luck this time seemed his due.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we couldn't ask for better weather,'' meteorologist
Clif Stargardt said of the sunny skies, light winds and warm
temperatures. ``It looks like mother nature wants to see John Glenn
return to space just as much as the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``rest of us'' include 21,000 family, friends and assorted
VIPS as well as Clinton and his entourage and at least 70 members
of Congress and their staffs and families, who will watch from
space center grounds. Area tourist agencies expected thousands more
to watch from the roadways, beaches and parks.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's wife, Annie, daughter, Lyn, son, David, and David's two
teen-age sons were to gather in the exclusive realm of the Launch
Control Center for the launch.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dignitaries are some of Glenn's former Mercury
colleagues, Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper and Wally Shirra as well
as Apollo 11 moonwalkers Buzz Aldrin, Peter Gordon and Alan Bean
and Baseball Hall of Famer Ted Williams, who served with Glenn as a
Marine Corps aviator during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Would the unusually intense scrutiny tempt NASA's launch and
mission control teams to act rashly? Top agency officials assured
it would not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I firmly believe that when crunch time comes, people in the
launch control center will not know there are 200 politicians, the
president and 3,700 news media people on the site,'' said Tommy
Holloway, NASA's shuttle program manager. ``They will do the same
job they do every day and make the same decisions they make every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring sign of the flight's significance has been
heightened security. Security officers armed with semi-automatic
weapons checked the credentials of unfamiliar faces once, twice and
three times as they came through the gates with the workforce.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the news media have access to NASA's VIP sites during
the launch. For Glenn's mission they won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due obviously to what is going on in the world you have to be
more heightened with your security precautions,'' said Sieck.
``It's a common sense thing to do considering the environment, the
attention this is getting and what is going on in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Discovery commander Curt Brown and his crew, pilot Steve
Lindsey, flight engineer Scott Parazynski, payload commander Steve
Robinson, European Space Agency astronaut Pedro Duque, Japanese
astronaut Chiaki Mukai and Glenn met family and friends at their
launch pad on Wednesday and reviewed the procedures for boarding
the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Well before sunrise, shuttle managers were to convene to review
countdown preparations. If pleased with the progress and the
weather forecast, they will direct shuttle engineers to load
Discovery's huge fuel tank with a half million gallons of explosive
hydrogen and oxygen propellants.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle astronauts will be awakened shortly before sunrise,
dine and don their bright orange flight suits.
</P>
<P>
   When the fueling operation is complete, the astronauts will be
whisked to the launch pad in a gleaming silver motor home. They
should begin crawling aboard Discovery by midmorning.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect had Glenn and his colleagues in fine fettle on the
eve of lift off. ``They are in very, very good spirits,'' said
NASA's chief astronaut Charles Precourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, they are very relaxed when they get into the
vehicle,'' said Precourt. ``There won't be much in the way of
butterflies until they get within a few minutes of lift off.'' &QL;

<P>
   It is not just young women, though, who are helping luxury-goods
makers weather the economic fallout here. The cost of business is
also declining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rents are lower and floor space is easier to obtain than ever
before,'' said Michiko Shimizu, president of SAI, a marketing
consulting firm. ``Their cost performance is much better, so why
not open a few more shops?''
</P>
<P>
   Hata, of Louis Vuitton, is interested in a parking lot in
Aoyama. It is one of the holdings of Japan Leasing, a financing
company that recently went bankrupt, and Hata has visions of a new
store on the site.
</P>
<P>
   He figures the parking lot, which has remained undeveloped
despite its prime location because Japan Leasing was seeking an
unrealistically high price, will soon come up for sale at a more
reasonable price. ``Real estate prices are still high, but they're
being forced down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lower real estate prices and distribution costs have enabled
sellers of luxury goods to push prices lower in their Japanese
outposts so that they are more in line with what Japanese shoppers
find in Hawaii or Hong Kong. Prices that were once 50 percent
higher here than in Hong Kong are now only 20 percent higher and
falling.
</P>
<P>
   As distribution has become more deregulated here, some
brand-name merchandise is now showing up in mass merchandising
stores like Ito-Yokado and Daiei, as well as the smaller brand
stores, where they can sell for 60 percent of department store
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Prices may also be driven lower if a 16 percent import tax on
luxury goods is reduced, which is expected as deregulation
increases.
</P>
<P>
   And over the last decade, luxury goods companies have developed
strategies for coping with economic downturns, offering expanded
product lines that include lower-priced products like key chains,
scarves and wallets and the use of cheaper materials like vinyl and
fabric instead of leather.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean they are ignoring the wealthy, of course.
These bedrock customers for luxury-goods makers usually are
affected far less by an economic downturn than the aspiring
upper-middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably benefit less from a boom than some of the other
luxury companies, but we also don't feel the recession,'' said
Mineaki Saito, president of Hermes Japon Co., which gets less of a
boost from younger women because its prices are somewhat higher
than those of other luxury-goods companies. ``Recession, no
recession, our sales have been going up every year since we
opened.''
</P>
<P>
   Junko Kosuge is one of those customers who keeps Hermes'
business growing whatever the economic climate. The wife of a
doctor, she has a passion for expensive scarves, which she keeps in
a glass-fronted antique chest so that she can look at them.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kosuge is awaiting the arrival of a pale pink crocodile
skin bag from Italy to add to her collection of Chanel, Gucci and
Hermes handbags. She said that she did not expect the bag to cost
more than 500,000 yen, or about $4,237 at current exchange rates.
(She likes Louis Vuitton bags as well but, she says, ``many, many
young women carry them, and at my age, I don't want to bump into
them on the train with the same bag.'')
</P>
<P>
   She insists that she does feel the recession, although she could
not really supply an example of its effect on her family. ``People
aren't spending money on things they think are wasteful,'' Mrs.
Kosuge said. ``I myself feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't a pale pink crocodile bag wasteful? ``No, I don't think so
because I was overwhelmed by its attractiveness,'' she said. ``So
even if I can only buy one thing like it instead of several, I do
because it makes my life fun.''

WITH RAIDS AND ARRESTS, IRAN SIGNALS NEW EFFORT TO SUPPRESS
BAHAIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Mass., Calif.)  (bl) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day in late September, Iranian security officials fanned out
across their country and raided some 500 homes and several office
buildings owned or rented by members of the Bahai faith,
confiscating material and arresting dozens of people.
</P>
<P>
   This was hardly the first time that Bahais, Iran's largest
religious minority, felt the sting of attention from the Shiite
Muslim government. As in the past, the United States condemned the
action.
</P>
<P>
   But what happened Sept. 29 was remarkable because it brought to
an abrupt end an elaborate act of communal self-preservation. The
materials confiscated were neither political nor religious, and the
people arrested were not fighters or organizers. They were
lecturers in subjects like accounting and dentistry; the materials
seized were textbooks and laboratory equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The enterprise that was shut down was a stealth university, with
nearly 1,000 students, scores of volunteer faculty members,
basements converted to biology and language laboratories and a
network of couriers, foreign advisers and sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   Started in 1987 in reaction to the virtual banning of Bahais
from Iranian universities after the Islamic revolution of 1979, the
Bahai Institute of Higher Education operated so quietly over the
years that many Bahai officials abroad and many Iranian
intellectuals within were unaware of it.
</P>
<P>
   Professors at Indiana University provided course materials and
curriculum advice, and American Bahais on visits to Iran would
carry suitcases stuffed with textbooks bought at the Harvard Coop.
</P>
<P>
   Begun on a tiny scale, the institute grew to include 10 areas of
major, including civil engineering, computer science, psychology
and English. Courses were by correspondence but included sessions
with lecturers in private homes.
</P>
<P>
   Some 145 students graduated with bachelors' degrees. Some work
in Iran and others have continued their studies abroad, their
degrees sometimes accepted despite the university's lack of
official recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did everything with our own empty hands,'' reflected one
former faculty member, who like virtually everyone interviewed
requested anonymity out of fear for his safety and that of
relatives in Iran. ``It was like a miracle that brought hope to the
Bahai youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of the university's activities and closing come from
two dozen interviews with former faculty members and students, some
of them still in Iran, others in North America.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian government has said nothing about the operation and
has not responded to requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Bahai faith, whose adherents number 300,000 in Iran and 5
million worldwide, began a century and a half ago in Iran. Among
its central principles are full equality between the sexes,
universal education and the establishment of a world federal
system.
</P>
<P>
   Bahai representatives say that while the university was begun in
secret, the government became aware of it in the early 1990s and
permitted it to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Bahai community and among political scientists who
watch Iran, there has been speculation about why the university was
closed now, given the more liberal approach advocated by Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami since his election in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has always been very active discrimination against
Bahais,'' said Shaul Bakhash, a professor of history at George
Mason University who is a specialist in Iran. ``It would be very
difficult for even the most well-meaning leader to deal with such a
university openly and tolerantly.''
</P>
<P>
   In July a Bahai was hanged on charges of having converted a
Muslim, the first execution of a Bahai in Iran since 1992. Two
other Bahais have been condemned to death.
</P>
<P>
   Bakhash noted that the Iranian security forces are not
controlled by Khatami but by the country's supreme spiritual
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is far more conservative.
</P>
<P>
   One possible explanation for the university's closing is that
Khamenei and his followers want to discredit or defy Khatami.

<P>
   A second theory is that Khatami is permitting the crackdown as a
gesture to the traditionalists as he tries to improve relations
with the West. A third possibility is that Khatami, who comes from
a clerical background, has no disagreement with tightening up on
the Bahais.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whatever the explanation, for the Bahais, the closing is
ominous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as a reactivation of general pressure on the Bahai
community,'' said Dr. Firuz Kazemzadeh, a retired professor of
history at Yale University and secretary for external affairs of
the Bahais in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 the Bahais revealed a 1991 Iranian government document
signed by Ayatollah Khamenei on containing the community by barring
adherents from universities and treating them so ``that their
progress and development shall be blocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Baharak Norouziani, 23, an Iranian Bahai now living in Santa
Monica, Calif., and one of the few interviewed for this article
willing to have her name printed, said that before she graduated
from high school in Tehran in 1993, she had to state her religion
to apply to a university. She wrote ``Bahai.''
</P>
<P>
   The principal of her school told her that unless she changed her
stated religion, she could not take the exam. So she signed up for
the Bahai university and studied pre-dentistry by correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a week we would get together in someone's house to get
materials and books and sometimes listen to a lecture,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the university remains shut, its 17,000-book library
confiscated, its computers and equipment gone, its administrators
freed on bail. But Bahais say it will not be long before they begin
the process of setting up the university again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is such a central goal for us,'' said one, ``that we
must rebuild. It is like a light at the end of a tunnel.''

FBN-NFL (Kansas City, Mo) _ Several NFL owners said Wednesday the
L.A. groups, on the strength of their presentations, had made up
considerable ground on Houston, which has had an airtight proposal
in place for months. It might have been simple posturing to fuel
competition _ a favorite hobby of NFL owners _ but the L.A. groups
can probably draw encouragement from it.

between players and coaches. It is the only such setup at UCLA and
is credited for bringing the team closer together. 
By Jon Wilner. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file.)

   CHICAGO _ It was an old hard-nosed politician, Paddy Bauler, who
crowed defiantly, and accurately, in 1955, ``Chicago ain't ready
for reform.''
</P>
<P>
   But the good-government crowd, not-so-affectionately called
``goo-goos'' in some precincts here, has finally prevailed. One of
the staples of the Democratic machine _ one-punch, straight-ticket
voting _ will be absent on Election Day, after more than a century
of use.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when television advertisements have much more
political power than any precinct captain, the end of
straight-ticket voting illustrates the weakening grip of parties on
the political process.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans here had quite a bit to do with this, as well.
When they briefly controlled the state Legislature, the Republicans
in 1997 pushed through a bill that banned the one-punch system in
Illinois. But now Republicans are wondering whether it might
backfire downstate and in the suburbs, where voters have become
adept at punching the Republican straight-ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The single, straight-ticket punch was perfected by Democratic
Party organizations in big cities, where loyalty to the machine
meant jobs and other favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sold as a way for immigrants to make their votes
count,'' said Paul Green, a political science professor at
Governor's State University in Chicago and the author of several
books on Chicago politics. Nearly 20 states still allow voting a
straight-ticket with a single stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Under Mayor Anton Cermak, who brought the fabled Chicago machine
to power in the 1930s, the straight-ticket fostered loyalty among
party workers and voters. Cermak, who adopted a one-for-all
philosophy, would analyze the voter turnout in Chicago
neighborhoods and rank his top ward committeemen _ a rating system
not unlike the Top 20 for college football. A familiar battle cry
of Cermak went: ``Only lazy precinct captains steal.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of single-punch voting saw it as a way to keep voters in
the dark about candidates. David Starrett, a spokesman for the
Independent Voters of Illinois, a nonpartisan group that calls for
election reforms, said voters ``ought to think about individual
candidates and do their homework,'' rather than simply depend on
the party label.
</P>
<P>
   He said the single-punch system made it much easier for party
bosses to punish people who did not tow the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take very long to make a single punch, and if a
voter was in the booth taking his time, the precinct captain would
make note of it,'' Starrett said. ``Questions got asked. Sometimes
garbage didn't get picked up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was part of the tight-fisted control that extended even to
campaign volunteers. Milton Rakove, the late political science
professor at the University of Illinois in Chicago, once used a
familiar political slogan for a book title, ``We Don't Want Nobody
Nobody Sent.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, the rules went, people looking for jobs in city
government or campaigns had to come with an endorsement from
someone on the inside. That power is largely gone.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard M. Daley, son of the legendary boss of the
Democratic machine, ``has not addressed a ward organization in
years,'' said Green, the political science professor.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of straight-ticket voting could mean longer lines at
the polls in Chicago, where voters will encounter a ballot with
more than 100 questions, including 33 political offices, 72 judges
up for retention, a state constitutional issue and, in some
precincts, a referendum on whether to ban alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody has a longer ballot than we do,'' said
Tom Leach, a spokesman for the Board of Elections in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois law requires that voters spend no more than 10 minutes
in the booth, no more than 5 minutes if there is a line. With more
than 100 decisions, voters would need to hurry. But the state
elections board has issued an advisory, Leach said, not to enforce
the time limit, unless someone is intentionally trying to keep
others from voting.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Andrea Moore, a sponsor of the bill to end the
one-punch system, said the old style gave too much power to party
bosses. The change could help some Republicans in strongly
Democratic Cook County, which includes Chicago, but she
acknowledged that some Republicans in other places are not so eager
to see the system changed.
</P>
<P>
   In some suburban counties, she noted, perhaps one-third of
voters have cast a straight-Republican ballot. ``Not all
Republicans thought this was such a good idea,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Brunner, the head of the Better Government Association in
Chicago, said precinct captains years ago sometimes went into the
booth with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``A precinct captain would say, `Hey, Mrs. Jones, remember how I
took care of that ticket?''' Brunner said. ``And then he'd say,
`You're a good Democrat, right? Do you know how to operate this
machine? Let me help you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Brunner, who has long been a champion of election reforms in
Chicago, said the old system, for all its warts, was not without
its merits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, the machines were kind of confusing,'' Brunner
said, ``and somebody like Mrs. Jones really did want to vote for
the Democrats.'' &QL;

SPACE PIONEERS WISH ONE OF THEIR OWN GOOD LUCK

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Three men who taught American
schoolchildren how to count backward gave a confident but
cautionary sendoff to John Glenn, the fourth survivor of their
dwindling band of space legends, as NASA and the astronaut-senator
made final preparatons for Thursday's historic launch.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneering spacemen Scott Carpenter, Walter Schirra, and L.
Gordon Cooper gathered Wednesday at the Astronaut Hall of Fame just
outside John F. Kennedy Space Center to cheer their Project Mercury
colleague and to offer their hard-won perspective on sitting atop
towers of explosive force.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a lot of people don't realize is that those of us who fly
these machines, and this applies also to John Glenn ... feel that
we are expendable in pursuit of a higher purpose,'' said Carpenter,
who in 1962 coined the phrase, ``Godspeed, John Glenn,'' just
before his friend became the first American to orbit Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he or anyone else perishes in this pursuit, we will recover
from that,'' Carpenter added, silencing a crowd of reporters and
tourists. ``We always have, and we always will.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the gates of the space center, NASA officials kept up
their ``all systems go'' optimism and described a nearly flawless
prelaunch regimen, accompanied by calm, clear skies. NASA
meteorologists said there was a ``0 percent'' chance the 2 p.m.
flight would be scrubbed because of weather.
</P>
<P>
   Now and again, though, cracks appeared in the sang-froid of the
men and women who routinely thrust themselves and their colleagues
into space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel an awesome responsibility and apprehension that
everything goes well. This is special,'' NASA Associate
Administrator Joe Rothenberg said after eating lunch with Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg compared the pressure and attention to the 1986
Challenger flight that ended with the deaths of New Hampshire
teacher Christa McAuliffe and six other crew members. Though NASA
officials are loath to say so publicly, looming in the background
is the knowledge that another catastrophe on such a high-profile
effort could threaten future space missions, most notably the
International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   It was impossible to escape the anticipation here on the Space
Coast, with President Clinton, three-score members of Congress, and
numerous celebrities expected to join an estimated 250,000 other
observers on hand here _ and millions more watching live on
television. Parks were already beginning to fill Wednesday, as
space watchers jockeyed for the best viewing spots.
</P>
<P>
   As preparations reached a fevered pitch, Payload Specialist No.
2, also known as John Glenn, had permission to sleep late this
morning, at least when compared with the last time he blasted into
space.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn and the six other crew members were to be awakened at 7:50
a.m. to begin final preparations. Joining him in space will be
commander Curtis L. Brown; pilot Steven W. Lindsey; mission
specialists Stephen K. Robinson, Pedro Duque of Spain, and Scott E.
Parazynski, the medical officer; and Payload Specialist No. 1,
Chiaki Mukai of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The 77-year-old Glenn's return to space has overshadowed the
mission _ intended to carry out a broad range of scientific
experiments and to release and recapture a satellite _ and has sent
commentators into paroxysms of nostalgia as they try to convey the
uncertainty, excitement, and national pride that accompanied
Glenn's historic first flight, on Feb. 20, 1962.
</P>
<P>
   That day, Glenn awoke at 2:20 a.m., ate a breakfast of steak and
eggs washed down by orange juice and coffee, then proceeded to
board the Mercury capsule Friendship 7 for his brief but momentous
ride.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Glenn and his crewmates were on ``teenagers'
hours,'' said astronaut Charles Precourt, who flew Discovery's last
mission in June and is acting as liaison between Glenn and the news
media. Precourt said the shuttle crew began L-1, space parlance for
launch minus one day, by eating breakfast around 9 a.m., before yet
another preflight briefing session.
</P>
<P>
   They then visited the launch pad, where Glenn and the others
waved, smiled, and gave thumbs-up signals to family members and
busloads of tourists and NASA guests wishing them farewell. The
astronauts stayed some 20 feet from the crowd, in keeping with a
quarantine designed to keep them free of colds and flu.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch, they underwent a training session on donning their
space suits and finding their places in the shuttle, Precourt said.
Glenn has the worst seat for sightseeing, between Robinson and
Mukai in the back row.
</P>
<P>
   Precourt said the crew members were in ``top-notch shape, right
on top of it'' and were joking about the crush of publicity, all of
it focused on their lowest-ranking crew member. Lindsey kidded
Glenn that he would be the next one honored, with a NASA trash bin
named the Lindsey Dumpster, Precourt said.
</P>
<P>
   Prelaunch breakfast was scheduled to be a ``crew's choice''
affair, though Precourt said some or all might skip the meal
because of one of the countless pieces of knowledge gained since
Glenn's first flight: more than half of all space travelers suffer
nausea after blastoff.
</P>
<P>
   After breakfast and a weather briefing, the crew will suit up
and walk out to a van that will take them to the launch pad. They
will be guided to their positions, and then the shuttle's hatch
will be closed behind them. They will then have at least 1 1/2
hours to reflect on their missions and their mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Both those subjects were on the minds of Carpenter, Cooper, and
Schirra Wednesday, in part because three other members of the
original Mercury Seven did not live to see their erstwhile leader
return to space.
</P>
<P>
   Virgil ``Gus'' Grissom died in 1967 aboard an Apollo rocket that
caught fire on a NASA launch pad; Donald ``Deke'' Slayton died of
cancer in 1993; and Alan Shepard died of leukemia earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's surviving colleagues said cooly that they had no
particular interest in joining Glenn, but when asked what they
would be feeling during the nine-day mission, the three said almost
simultaneously, ``envy.'' Cooper also offered himself up as a
volunteer for an eventual Mars mission.
</P>
<P>
   In the four decades before his first space flight, as well as
the nearly four decades until Thursday, Glenn has continually
burnished his reputation as an American hero.
</P>
<P>
   A stoic son of Cambridge, Ohio, who married his grammar school
sweetheart, Glenn took his first steps toward glory as a Marine
pilot during World War II, winning three Distinguished Flying
Crosses. He also served in Korea, flying 90 missions and downing
three enemy fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's first taste of celebrity came in 1957, when he became
the first man to fly coast to coast faster than the speed of sound.
He parlayed that triumph into an appearance on a television game
show, during which the guitar-playing pilot won $10,000 by
displaying an uncanny knowledge of pop music.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief flirtation with anonymity, spent designing fighter
jets, Glenn returned to the public eye when the United States began
its full-scale space competition with the Soviet Union. After his
1962 orbits and the ticker-tape parades that followed, it became
clear that his dream of further missions and a moon trip would
never be realized. So he resigned from the astronaut corps. Among
the Mercury Seven, only he and Carpenter were denied a return trip
to space.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn then became a top executive with cola-maker Royal Crown
International before winning election to the US Senate as a
Democrat in 1974. Once there, he worked doggedly to reduce nuclear
proliferation, which he considered the biggest threat to the watery
globe he gazed upon from space.
</P>
<P>
   Never poetically inclined, Glenn has tried countless times to
describe his brief earlier trip to space. The best he could muster
immediately afterward was to call it ``a real fireball of a ride.''
But he may have described his mission best in an interview he gave
before that day in 1962:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are placed here with certain talents and capabilities,''
Glenn said. ``It is up to each one of us to use those talents and
capabilities as best we can. If we do that, I think there is a
power greater than any of us that will place the opportunities in
our way, a power greater than I am that will certainly see that I
am taken care of if I do my part of the bargain.''

   The New York Times' computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a fairly large
difference between Denver (no. 1) and Minnesota (2), but a much
larger difference between San Francisco (3) and Miami (4).

<P>
   MARIETTA, Ga. _ The humorlessness of Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., the
scowling conservative who started the drive to impeach President
Clinton, was being celebrated by hometown supporters in a political
roast, and Barr agreed that they had a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am smiling,'' he declared in a poker-faced joke on himself
even as he was stoking fresh scorn for an unlikely target: his
Republican colleagues in the Senate who he fears lack the
``backbone'' for an impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``How little interest, how little backbone they have to really
take on tough issues,'' Barr complained in an interview, offering a
concession of sorts from atop the impeachment ramparts that the
campaign might ultimately founder as a one-house effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the Senate, with the current makeup, really
has the stomach for it,'' said Barr, the impeachment stalwart on
the House Judiciary Committee, offering a stark assessment of the
difficulty Republicans anticipate when they resume their effort
after Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton will declare victory no matter what happens,'' Barr
said, finally smiling at what strikes him as the absurdity of the
president's apparent invincibility in opinion polls and the
proclivity of Republicans to ``cave'' and play into his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Clinton magic mystery tour,'' Barr conceded, sounding
as frustrated as Wile E. Coyote in pursuit of the presidential
Roadrunner. ``It's a wonder to behold what this guy can do with
Republicans. We knock him down and then we pull him up and say,
`Sorry, may we dust off your coat?' ''
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday night's fund-raising roast, Barr was celebrated as a
vital patriot by actor Charlton Heston and a host of other
right-wing celebrities who proclaimed the nation's right to ``keep
and bear Bob Barr'' _ a play on Barr's serving as congressional
point man for the National Rifle Association, which Heston heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congressman Barr has promised me that I'll get to arrest
Hillary,'' exulted another roaster, Gary Aldrich, the former White
House FBI agent who has been disparaging the Clintons as a book
writer and speaker on the conservative circuit. Dinner guests
guffawed as he brandished handcuffs before Barr, a former federal
prosecutor who first made his anti-corruption reputation here by
bringing down politicians in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   The 49-year-old Barr faces the world with a dark mustache and
steady glare that Clintonites rate villainous but supporters hail
as vigilance personified. He first sampled the intrigues of
Washington as a lobbyist for the Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton has abused the office entrusted to him,'' said Barr,
who made the president a target for impeachment well before the
Lewinsky sex scandal, accusing him of abusing campaign finance laws
and the justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the dinner laughter, Barr signaled serious concern that
House Republicans might go through the struggle of impeaching the
president only to see the effort fail because of what he said was
indifference in the GOP-controlled Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we fulfill our duty in the House and the Senate fails to
fulfill theirs, shame on them,'' Barr said, adding that the
Senate's recent rejection of a House-approved tax cut was evidence
of timidity toward contentious issues like impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not to say the votes could not be there if Trent Lott
really worked the issue,'' Barr said of the Senate majority leader,
although he calculated that it would take noticeable Republican
gains in the election on Tuesday to prod greater Senate interest in
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about alternatives to impeachment, like a reprimand of the
president, Barr scoffed at such compromises as ``constitutional
nonsense.'' He dismissed as ``half-baked'' former President Gerald
Ford's proposal that the president stand before the Congress and be
verbally rebuked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Clinton could even keep a straight face,'' Barr
said, grinning at the notion of trying to scold a man who has
lately been gladly embracing every chance at atonement.
</P>
<P>
   As the roasters performed, the difficulty of skewering Clinton _
after all the months of late-night television humor and his
considerable display of resiliency _ became clear. An old chestnut
of a joke, not another risque Lewinsky one-liner, drew one of the
bigger Republican laughs: ``None of this would have happened if Al
Gore were still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating,'' Barr said of his goal to topple the
president, before taking the dais to be teased by sympathetic
partisans. These included a Bill Clinton imitator who fecklessly
grinned upon the pro-impeachment audience and serenaded Barr with
this advice: ``Smile, though you're heart is breaking.''

     THE OPRAH BACKLASH
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Oprah Winfrey &LR; 's the most powerful person in show business,
says Entertainment Weekly, with a top-rated talk show, a widely
acclaimed movie and her picture on the cover of Vogue magazine. Now
watch the tables turn:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so over Oprah,'' wrote New York Post film critic
 &UR; Thelma Adams &LR; , who was quoted in the Times of London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winfrey should have chosen another theme song this year,
`You're So Vain,''' wrote  &UR; Hal Boedeker &LR;  of the Orlando Sentinel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the way she's promoting herself that's discouraging,''
wrote  &UR; Richard Roeper &LR;  in a  &LR; Winfrey's hometown paper, the Chicago
Sun-Times. ``Can a person do good while constantly drawing
attention to her efforts?''
</P>
<P>
   Under particular fire is Winfrey's revamped talk show, ``Change
Your Life TV,'' described by TV writer  &UR; Jeff MacGregor &LR;  as
``devoted to the mind-numbing cliches of personal improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am defined by the world as a talk-show host,'' she said on
one show. ``But I am spirit, connected to the greater spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   She referred to ``Beloved,'' the movie in which she stars, as
``my `Schindler's List.' I know they're all applauding somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's worrisome about the '99-model Oprah is this,'' wrote
MacGregor: ``She's begun to take herself seriously. Self-reference
is one thing. Self-reverence is another.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; VISUALIZE LETTUCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The secret of  &UR; Alice Waters &LR; ' newfound ease at public
appearances, writes  &UR; Lee Glickstein &LR;  in ``Be Heard Now! Tap Into
Your Inner Speaker and Communicate With Ease'' (Broadway; $20), is
that she imagines her listeners to be heads of lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   The author says he told the restaurateur to treat her audience
the way she treats food she is about to prepare. When facing a head
of lettuce, he said to her, ``I'll bet you place it gently on the
board and honor it with respect and love before you cut into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickstein told her that she should ``look at the faceless mass
in the audience as she would regard a roomful of heads of lettuce.
... To take at least 15 seconds of silence'' before speaking ``to
honor those fresh faces, appreciate their beauty and breathe with
them. Then speak to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The technique worked, writes the coach. ``Eventually, any device
that helps you get there, whether it is seeing your audience as
heads of lettuce, hearts of artichoke or souls of sweetness, will
dissolve out when you get comfortable with opening every talk with
just you and them and the silence.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - NASA is so determined to capture the imagination of the public
with the Discovery launch that  &UR; Garth Brooks &LR; ,  &UR; Leonardo &LR; 
 &UR; DiCaprio &LR;  and the members of Aerosmith were invited to a prelaunch
VIP party. ``We're really psyched about this,'' said Aerosmith's
 &UR; Joe Perry  &LR; to the Boston Herald.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Nancy Reagan &LR; 's Secret Service men occupied two cubicles, on
either side of her, when she had a facial in New York the other
day. The New York Daily News said they passed the time ``reading
magazines and talking to each other on their hand radios.''
</P>
<P>
   - In answer to Esquire's annual Women We Love feature, the
lesbian magazine Girlfriends is out with ``The Purely Platonic
Lesbian Men We Love'' issue. Among the honorees: ``The San
Francisco 49ers National Football League team. Currently run by ...
 &UR; Denise DeBartolo York &LR;  (who has proven, much to her brother
 &UR; Eddie &LR; 's dismay, that she's more than his corporate puppet), the
49ers are the first -- and only -- National Football League team to
offer domestic-partner benefits to gay employees.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Woody Allen  &LR; didn't let sentiment get in the way when he
talked with Marie- &LR;  Claire magazine about his ex,  &UR; Mia Farrow &LR; . ``I
would challenge Mia's view of herself as a supermother,'' he said.
``She compulsively goes through these manic adoptions even though
she doesn't know where her next job is coming from. ... There are
many horrible things I could say if I wanted to go into detail, but
I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   - Newly former White House spokesman  &UR; Mike McCurry &LR;  will do
election-night analysis for CNN. His counterpart will be  &UR; Tony &LR; 
 &UR; Blankley &LR; , who used to be spokesman for  &UR; Newt Gingrich &LR; .

</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Al Gore has been 50 for at least 30 years. He's someone who &LR; 
 &UR; early on abandoned any pretense of being cool.'' &LR;

BRAZIL ANNOUNCES ECONOMIC PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Brazilian officials said Wednesday that they will
slash government spending and raise taxes in preparation for a
US-orchestrated rescue package aimed at stopping the financial
turmoil that has engulfed Asia and Russia from spreading to Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   Officials conceded that the measures, worth about $23.5 billion,
will almost certainly push the country into recession, but said
that the plan will pave the way for about $30 billion in aid from
the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and, potentially,
from the United States directly.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil needs the aid to bolster foreign exchange reserves, which
have dropped precipitously in recent months as investors fled the
country in fear that the global turmoil would spread there.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials asserted that they will take whatever steps
are necessary to protect their country, a sentiment that is widely
shared by global policy makers who fear that failure to stop the
turmoil in Brazil could presage a much deeper crisis for the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fully capable of facing up to financial turbulence
through actions on the domestic front,'' Brazilian Finance Minister
Pedro Malan told a press conference in Brasilia, the nation's
capital. ``The challenge is set: (without these steps), we're on
the road to fiscal insolvency.''
</P>
<P>
   US officials were quick to praise the Brazilian plan and call on
the country's legislature to approve it. US Treasury Secretary
Robert E. Rubin said in a late afternoon statement that
``confidence and stability in Brazil is very important to American
economic interests and to the economy of the hemisphere and the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin and his chief aide, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers, have been scrambling behind the scenes to assemble a
financial aid package for Brazil and to lay the political
groundwork for using some US funds as part of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury officials were the targets of bitter Republican
attacks in 1995 when they used $20 billion in American funds to
help bail out Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Investors appeared to take news of the new Brazilian plan well
Wednesday. Although the US stock market ended the day little
changed, with the Dow Jones industrial average up only 5.93 points
at 8371.97, several stocks that have been battered by worries over
Brazil stabilized. Citigroup Inc., which lost almost $3 a share
Tuesday, closed up 3/4 at 44 5/16. J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., which lost
almost 4 Tuesday, regained 1 1/2 to close at 91 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   But if investors were comparatively happy with the Brazilian
plan and the expected aid package, a number of influential
economists and policy analysts were decidedly not. Most complained
that the rescue effort either does not go far enough or attacks the
wrong problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil presents the opportunity to do a full package or a
half-baked one, and it sounds to me as if they're going for the
half-baked one,'' said Morris Goldstein, a former senior IMF
official who is now with the Institute for International Economics,
a Washinton think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot less to these rescue packags than meets the
eye,'' added Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economist and director of the
university's Institute for Internatonal Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's missing is a realistic approach to an
overvalued currency,'' Sachs said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein and Sachs said that in addition to reducing its
government budget deficit through spending cuts and tax hikes, and
besides bolstering its foreign exchange reserves through
international aid packages, Brazil must take two other steps: It
must devalue its currency by perhaps 20 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   And it must restructure billions of dollars in short-term debt
coming due in the next few months so that it can stretch out its
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to take both steps ``is going to make it a lot harder
for them to succeed,'' said Goldstein. ``I guess they're going to
try to muddle through.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Brazilians concede that the real should be devalued, but
say that to do so now would be disastrous. Investors panicked in
the wake of devaluations in Thailand, Russia and elsewhere and
pushed the countries' currencies into free-fall as they rushed to
pull their money out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances of losing control of the process are very
significant. The chances of losing control are huge,'' Jose Antonio
Pena, BankBoston's chief Brazilian economist, said in a phone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   US and IMF officials are expected to unveil details of the
intrnational rescue package for Brazil later this week or next
while Brazilian political leaders begin debating the spending cuts
and tax hikes proposed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the country's interest rates are being held at
punishingly high levels to keep investors from withdrawing any more
of their money, a move that virtually guarantees that Brazil will
slip into recession by the beginning of next year.

ANALYSIS: AN EXPENSIVE FIX THAT WON'T CURE BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (mk) 
(Eds: See also BRAZIL-ECON) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The austerity plan spelled out Wednesday by Brazil will not
solve its financial crisis. Nor will a $30 billion to $35 billion
bailout package, including several billion from American taxpayers,
that the International Monetary Fund is expected to offer to
sustain Brazil's commitment to a fixed exchange rate to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The economic masterminds of the Brazilian bailout, Lawrence
Summers at the Treasury Department and Stanley Fischer at the IMF,
will argue that their plan will prevent devaluation and shelter
Latin America from the financial turmoil that has wrecked parts of
Asia and Russia. But their optimism will almost certainly be
short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, their plan tosses a few billion dollars into a
bailout fund in exchange for fiscal tightening, it might smother
financial crisis for two months or even two years. But, most
economists predict, crisis will return because the plan leaves
Brazil's irreconcilable financial policies largely in place. And in
the meantime, the IMF's piecemeal approach will almost certainly
throw Brazil's economy into a recession that may improve the
current-account imbalance but will certainly further brutalize the
poor and dampen the aspirations of the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   The plan relies on spending cuts and tax increases to cut the
deficit and on high interest rates to preserve a bloated
currency-exchange rate. The prospect that this will work, says
Morris Goldstein of the Institute for International Economics,
``rests on little more than a wing and a prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's financial predicament flows from an incendiary
combination of policies. It fixes its currency, the real, at a rate
that is at least 15 percent, and perhaps 40 percent, too high. That
makes exports expensive, imports cheap and encourages more dollars
to flow out than in.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Brazil, in part because of its budget deficit, has
racked up huge short-term foreign debts _ more than $50 billion,
according to Lawrence Krohn of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
Securities. Total short-term debt is widely believed to exceed $150
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the real is convertible, meaning that investors can force
the government to exchange it for dollars any time they want. The
combination of an overvalued currency, high debt and convertibility
creates a financial environment in which calamity is always one
crisis of confidence away.
</P>
<P>
   Policy-makers, so far, seem paralyzed by the prospect of
devaluation. Citing chilling evidence from Asia last year and
Russia this year, they fear that devaluation will overshoot,
sending the real much lower than needed in calmer times and causing
needless price increases for imports. The chance of devaluation
would also threaten foreign investors, who might grab their dollars
and run, rather than wait for the dollar value of their investments
to sink.
</P>
<P>
   That could send the economy reeling. So, the Treasury and the
fund have decided to settle for an attack on Brazil's budget
deficit and the creation of the multibillion-dollar reserve fund to
reassure investors that the nation has plenty to spare.
</P>
<P>
   But critics stress the huge short-term debt. Beside it, a $30
billion bailout looks puny.
</P>
<P>
   There are two prominent alternatives to the expected
Treasury-IMF plan. Jeffrey Sachs of the Harvard Institute for
International Development pushes for Brazil to drop its fixed rate,
allowing the real to float on currency markets. That way, Brazil
would no longer need to drive up interest rates to preserve the
exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   In answer to Summers and Fischer, he argues that countries
cannot save overvalued currencies. In Brazil, as in Asia, an
attempt to defend a currency will only serve to deplete dollar
reserves. ``Once reserves are gone,'' Sachs says, ``investors
panic. The worst mistake is for countries to wait too long to float
their currencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudiger Dornbusch of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
offers a nearly opposite solution. He calls on Brazil to adopt a
currency board like that in Argentina. Brazil would tie the real to
the dollar at a fixed rate. But under this system, devaluation
would no longer be an option. Brazil would be legally bound to keep
enough dollars on hand to redeem all its currency in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Dornbusch points to Argentina as proof that a currency board can
reassure foreign investors and bring down interest rates close to
levels in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein argues that for any rescue plan to work, it ``must be
comprehensive _ convince Brazil's creditors to convert short-term
loans to long-term loans, reset the real at a lower rate,
substantially cut the fiscal deficit _ and only then include modest
aid from outside.'' Some economists predict that if dollars are
thrown into Brazil, they will wind up in the Swiss bank accounts of
foreign investors, much like the dollars the IMF put into Russia
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The only enthusiastic embrace of the expected Treasury-IMF plan
comes from Wall Street. Under the plan, foreign investors could
continue to collect interest rates of 20 percent or more with a
pledge backed by the fund that Brazil will not devalue soon. No
wonder they love it.

     THE OPRAH BACKLASH
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Oprah Winfrey &LR; 's the most powerful person in show business,
says Entertainment Weekly, with a top-rated talk show, a widely
acclaimed movie and her picture on the cover of Vogue magazine. Now
watch the tables turn:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so over Oprah,'' wrote New York Post film critic
 &UR; Thelma Adams &LR; , who was quoted in the Times of London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winfrey should have chosen another theme song this year,
`You're So Vain,''' wrote  &UR; Hal Boedeker &LR;  of the Orlando Sentinel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the way she's promoting herself that's discouraging,''
wrote  &UR; Richard Roeper &LR;  in a  &LR; Winfrey's hometown paper, the Chicago
Sun-Times. ``Can a person do good while constantly drawing
attention to her efforts?''
</P>
<P>
   Under particular fire is Winfrey's revamped talk show, ``Change
Your Life TV,'' described by TV writer  &UR; Jeff MacGregor &LR;  as
``devoted to the mind-numbing cliches of personal improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am defined by the world as a talk-show host,'' she said on
one show. ``But I am spirit, connected to the greater spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   She referred to ``Beloved,'' the movie in which she stars, as
``my `Schindler's List.' I know they're all applauding somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's worrisome about the '99-model Oprah is this,'' wrote
MacGregor: ``She's begun to take herself seriously. Self-reference
is one thing. Self-reverence is another.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; VISUALIZE LETTUCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The secret of  &UR; Alice Waters &LR; ' newfound ease at public
appearances, writes  &UR; Lee Glickstein &LR;  in ``Be Heard Now! Tap Into
Your Inner Speaker and Communicate With Ease'' (Broadway; $20), is
that she imagines her listeners to be heads of lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   The author says he told the restaurateur to treat her audience
the way she treats food she is about to prepare. When facing a head
of lettuce, he said to her, ``I'll bet you place it gently on the
board and honor it with respect and love before you cut into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickstein told her that she should ``look at the faceless mass
in the audience as she would regard a roomful of heads of lettuce.
... To take at least 15 seconds of silence'' before speaking ``to
honor those fresh faces, appreciate their beauty and breathe with
them. Then speak to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The technique worked, writes the coach. ``Eventually, any device
that helps you get there, whether it is seeing your audience as
heads of lettuce, hearts of artichoke or souls of sweetness, will
dissolve out when you get comfortable with opening every talk with
just you and them and the silence.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - NASA is so determined to capture the imagination of the public
with the Discovery launch that  &UR; Garth Brooks &LR; ,  &UR; Leonardo &LR; 
 &UR; DiCaprio &LR;  and the members of Aerosmith were invited to a prelaunch
VIP party. ``We're really psyched about this,'' said Aerosmith's
 &UR; Joe Perry  &LR; to the Boston Herald.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Nancy Reagan &LR; 's Secret Service men occupied two cubicles, on
either side of her, when she had a facial in New York the other
day. The New York Daily News said they passed the time ``reading
magazines and talking to each other on their hand radios.''
</P>
<P>
   - In answer to Esquire's annual Women We Love feature, the
lesbian magazine Girlfriends is out with ``The Purely Platonic
Lesbian Men We Love'' issue. Among the honorees: ``The San
Francisco 49ers National Football League team. Currently run by ...
 &UR; Denise DeBartolo York &LR;  (who has proven, much to her brother
 &UR; Eddie &LR; 's dismay, that she's more than his corporate puppet), the
49ers are the first -- and only -- National Football League team to
offer domestic-partner benefits to gay employees.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Woody Allen  &LR; didn't let sentiment get in the way when he
talked with Marie- &LR;  Claire magazine about his ex,  &UR; Mia Farrow &LR; . ``I
would challenge Mia's view of herself as a supermother,'' he said.
``She compulsively goes through these manic adoptions even though
she doesn't know where her next job is coming from. ... There are
many horrible things I could say if I wanted to go into detail, but
I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   - Newly former White House spokesman  &UR; Mike McCurry &LR;  will do
election-night analysis for CNN. His counterpart will be  &UR; Tony &LR; 
 &UR; Blankley &LR; , who used to be spokesman for  &UR; Newt Gingrich &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Al Gore has been 50 for at least 30 years. He's someone who &LR; 
 &UR; early on abandoned any pretense of being cool.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Dave Barry &LR; , &LR;  whose new book is ``Dave Barry Turns 50,'' in
New Choices magazine.

`CATS': MORE INTIMATE `CATS'  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 1)
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Video release notes at end of review.) 
(af) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it a vaudeville show? An oratorio? A singing and dancing
storybook? A live-action cartoon? An environmental theater piece? A
pretentious pop allegory (with Christian symbolism) that compares
the feline condition to the human one?
</P>
<P>
   At various times, ``Cats,'' the indestructible Andrew Lloyd
Webber megahit, is all of the above. With its silly cat costumes
that make the actors look like singing and dancing carnival
trophies, striped makeup that suggests a 1976 Kiss concert, and
lumbering burlesque-show choreography, ``Cats'' is also the epitome
of a garish kitsch pageant.
</P>
<P>
   Restaged for home video by David Mallet, does ``Cats,'' which
will be shown Monday night at 8 o'clock on PBS, work on the small
screen? Yes and no. Theater, especially when it involves elaborate
musical staging, is awfully hard to bring to life in another medium
unless the work is totally reconceived. And ``Cats'' has not been.
It is a more athletically directed and staged elaboration of the
show that opened on Broadway 16 years ago (minus the Siamese cat
pirate sequence).
</P>
<P>
   Scenic effects that you accept in a theater _ especially
Grizabella's ascent to heaven _ look mechanically contrived and
ungainly on video. In long shots of the production numbers, the
dancers blur into unkinetic blobs of motion bathed in bright blue
light. The spontaneity of live performance is compromised by the
obvious overdubbing of most if not all of the singing.
</P>
<P>
   Where the home video has the advantage is in creating intimate
portraits of the felines who prowl around the junkyard set and in
magnifying the acrobatics. Grizabella, the faded Glamour Cat played
by Elaine Paige, has more pathos here than on the stage because the
camera can gaze close up into her sad, ruined face.
</P>
<P>
   You want to crawl onto the lap of wise, bearish Old Deuteronomy
(Ken Page). With his shaking paws and frightened eyes, Gus the
Theater Cat (John Mills) is a plaintive ruin of a once-elegant
figure.
</P>
<P>
   But the sentimentality of ``Cats'' can become strained. There
are moments when the actors staring soulfully out of those
cartoonish cat faces suggest the pleading gazes of the lost
children in Edward Keane paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Musically, ``Cats'' is a one-hit show. Although that hit,
``Memory,'' has been maligned as ersatz Puccini, it still beats
every other Lloyd Webber ballad in sheer melodic clout.
</P>
<P>
   To her credit, Ms. Paige, who originated the role in London,
stays within her character and doesn't use the song to flaunt her
technique.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest of the songs, based mostly on the 14 poems from
T.S. Eliot's ``Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats,'' the music is
overwhelmingly clangy, but at least you can discern the words of
Eliot's verses. If the gentle whimsy of Eliot's poetry has been
trampled, the characters in the feline portrait gallery come
through.
</P>
<P>
   They are pop stars on parade.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After long deploring political commercials that hit
below the belt, a good-government group decided this fall to fight
back, and not by Marquess of Queensberry rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are your candidates more concerned with attacking the issues
or attacking each other?'' asked an off-screen voice in the group's
30-second commercial that appeared repeatedly last week on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement, which is the work of the Annenberg Public
Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, featured two
middle-aged politicians turned ``boxers,'' hilariously out of shape
and out of place in trunks and gloves. What they lacked in skills
they made up for in dirty tricks: punches below the belt and a knee
to the groin.
</P>
<P>
   The audience in the commercial reacted with shock and disbelief.
Even the political consultants in the wings _ the type who brought
Willie Horton commercials into the living room _ seem stunned.
``This is not what we're voting for,'' said an on-screen text.
</P>
<P>
   But after viewing the commercial a few times, a viewer is left
with the inescapable impression that it is rather like those very
advertisements it purports to condemn, a fact that is not lost on
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an attack ad against dirty campaigning,'' Jamieson said
in a recent telephone interview. She said such spots had their
place.
</P>
<P>
   Jamieson said it was impossible to gauge whether the commercial
has had any effect on what candidates are putting on television as
the election nears. At least, she said, it may raise voters'
consciousness about the kind of political combat they are watching.
</P>
<P>
   Based on studies of races for governor, House and Senate in 30
states, Jamieson noted what political pundits and journalists have
been saying in recent days: As October draws to a close, the number
of pure attack advertisements is on the rise, outnumbering advocacy
commercials, which make a case for the sponsor. But attacks ads
still trail contrast spots, which make a case for the sponsor and
against the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The center's Washington director, Douglas Rivlin, is not naive
enough to believe candidates will refrain from attack spots if they
seem to be working. But he said he found them troubling because he
thought they caused some people to stay home on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of embarrassing, frankly, to talk to Germans or
Brits or others where the turnout is so much higher than ours,''
Rivlin said. ``It's always better when more people are
deliberating, debating, casting their votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Jamieson and Rivlin conceded that political spots do not
always fit neatly into the pigeonholes of attack, advocacy or
contrast. Jamieson said journalists often thought political
advertisements were more negative than they actually were, then
wrongly reported about an epidemic of ``negative campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the center has been running another commercial on
CNN. Like the first, the new spot was financed by the Pew
Charitable Trusts, a Philadelphia foundation that supports
activities in public education and public policy.
</P>
<P>
   In the second commercial, each candidate is asked a question.
One nods sagely, the other takes off his glasses and looks deeply
thoughtful. Neither says a word.
</P>
<P>
   The message: What a candidate does not say is as important as
what he does say.

   The center's Washington director, Douglas Rivlin, is not naive
enough to believe candidates will refrain from attack spots if they
seem to be working. But he said he found them troubling because he
thought they caused some people to stay home on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of embarrassing, frankly, to talk to Germans or
Brits or others where the turnout is so much higher than ours,''
Rivlin said. ``It's always better when more people are
deliberating, debating, casting their votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Jamieson and Rivlin conceded that political spots do not
always fit neatly into the pigeonholes of attack, advocacy or
contrast. Jamieson said journalists often thought political
advertisements were more negative than they actually were, then
wrongly reported about an epidemic of ``negative campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the center has been running another commercial on
CNN. Like the first, the new spot was financed by the Pew
Charitable Trusts, a Philadelphia foundation that supports
activities in public education and public policy.
</P>
<P>
   In the second commercial, each candidate is asked a question.
One nods sagely, the other takes off his glasses and looks deeply
thoughtful. Neither says a word.
</P>
<P>
   The message: What a candidate does not say is as important as
what he does say.

ALTERNATIVE SCHOOL TAILORS STUDY TO THE STUDENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Sporting a shaved head, wire-rim glasses,
faded jeans, T-shirt and feet that would be completely bare if not
for the toe ring, instructor Keven Holt sits at the end of a table,
patiently waiting. The five students seated around him are
pondering ways to prevent terrorists from hunting endangered marine
animals within a mile of their countries' coastline, which has been
designated a no-hunting zone by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Holland Purcell, 13, suggests everything from employing netting
made from plastic six-pack holders to using papier-mache decoys.
Erin Clay, 16, suggests that Navy SEALS handle the situation. Ben
Willeng, 16, takes a more level-headed approach. ``We could just
try to talk with them,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This search for peaceful solutions to worldwide problems may be
atypical at public schools, but it is characteristic of The Tree of
Knowledge, a new Arlington school billed as ``a holistic and
alternative educational approach.'' It's a concept born from the
core of Arlington's holistic community, a group of folks who
believe in soundness of body and mind achieved through
spirituality, herbs, healthful foods and other alternative methods.
Among the community are parents who believe that public schools are
not offering the things they think are vital to education: an
environment of free expression and small classes.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Holt and Mindy Purcell, 38, mother of Holland and
owner of the holistic shop Deep Woods Apothecary, tossed around the
idea of a holistic school for junior high and high school students.
``We thought it would be good to have a school with a more holistic
approach to education, where maybe kids feel good about learning
and good about themselves,'' Purcell says.
</P>
<P>
   Holt, 32, has bachelor's and master's degrees in anthropology
from the University of Texas at Arlington and has taught at UTA and
at Amarillo College in Amarillo, where he grew up. He believes
public schools use a memorize-and-regurgitate method of teaching.
``Thinking is not a part of the curriculum,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Also involved was Jim Koch, 43, Purcell's partner of
four-and-a-half years. The three became the school's board and
began researching ways to bring it to life. They designed
brochures, held fund-raisers and rented space, a small
three-bedroom house in central Arlington that also serves as a
community center for the United Assembly of Unbeaten Paths, a group
that offers spiritual guidance, services and events, such as Friday
night drumming circles.
</P>
<P>
   Spirituality figures prominently in the school's mission. Holt,
whose parents were organic farmers, wants the school to be open to
any religion, but it has so far attracted primarily families with
alternative beliefs. The students ``should have a right to practice
their religions freely. By allowing them that freedom, it will
teach the kids religious tolerance,'' he says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Holt describes his beliefs as ``a nature-based spirituality of
European origins. ... I guess you could probably call me a pagan.''
Purcell, who also grew up in a holistic home and once lived a
peripatetic life with the ``rainbow people,'' describes herself as
``following a path of spiritual light and love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I FELT LIKE A LAB RAT''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Home Education Research Institute,
approximately 1.5 million children in the United States are
home-schooled _ taught by their mothers or fathers. That's five
times the estimated number in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   And although The Tree of Knowledge is technically a private
school, the children aren't taught exclusively at home by their
parents. This type of small, alternative schooling is catching on
in much the same way as home-schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Nagel, National Office Manager for the National Coalition of
Alernative Community Schools, a group that formed in the mid-'70s
to support any type of education that is not publicy funded and now
has 300 member schools, says that thousands of alternative schools
operate in this country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFFORDING ALTERNATIVES
</P>
<P>
   The curriculum is based on a philosophy of ``unschooling,''
which allows students to build their education based on their
interests and curiosities. ``Once you fuel that curiosity and find
out how each student works, we start with an accredited college
prep program, which is more of a classical education system,'' Holt
says.
</P>
<P>
   Students fill out learning objective sheets at the beginning of
the semester, and then their basic skills are evaluated with tests.
Next, textbooks and core curriculum are plotted.
</P>
<P>
   According to the state of Texas, home-schooling has to cover the
three R's, plus civics, or good citizenship. Students at The Tree
of Knowledge are expected to fulfill 100 hours of
volunteer/community work a semester. During the week, the seven
students work on group projects or in workbooks. On Fridays, they
usually have a field trip or activity, such as a trip to the
Arlington Museum of Art, mask making or watching ``Amistad'' and
holding a mock trial based on what they have observed in the movie.
After this particular activity, student Erin Clay became interested
in civil law and said she plans to pursue that course of study.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of families who want to home-school their kids,
but the parents have to work. This will provide that option,'' Holt
says.
</P>
<P>
   Parents pay $100 per month tuition, which pays for rent and
utilities. Holt, who is not paid, supplements his income by waiting
tables at night. At the school, he is counselor, mentor and friend
to his students.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Willeng, a tarot-card reader and owner of Fort Worth's
Timberwolf Construction Co., enrolled her son Issac in The Tree of
Knowledge after three years of home-schooling. ``He couldn't read
or write until I started home-schooling,'' she says. Willeng has
two other children, a son who was salutatorian at Lady Margaret
Roper School at St. Thomas Moore Institute, and a daughter, Lisha,
14, who attends Paschal High School, where she is on the
second-team volleyball squad and was a conscientious objector in
biology class when it came to dissecting a cat. ``Social
interaction was very important to her. She doesn't need'' The Tree
of Knowledge,'' Willeng says.
</P>
<P>
   Issac does need the school, she says. ``Everybody has different
needs, and sometimes alternatives need to be met.''

DEMOCRATS LAUNCH ASSAULT ON REPUBLICANS ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Also moving in `p' category) 
(sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A parade of prominent Democrats on Wednesday
pounced gleefully on what they called a Republican blunder in
waging a last-minute, multimillion-dollar advertising offensive
that exploits President Clinton's sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of desperation that we can expect from
Republicans as we get close to Election Day,'' said Vice President
Al Gore. ``Attacking the president and investigating the president
has apparently become an obsession with the Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, general chairman of the Democratic
Party, said: ``This is a desperate attempt from a Republican Party
completely devoid of an agenda. The American people will see right
through it and this cynical Republican ploy will backfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton joined in the assault, declaring that while
Republicans were free to say whatever they wanted in their
commercials, ``it's fair for a person to be judged on his whole
record.''
</P>
<P>
   By late Wednesday, the Democratic Party had hastily begun
assembling a commercial of its own in response to the Republicans'
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   In the commercial, a narrator says: ``This no ordinary time.
Republicans have made removing the president from office their top
priority. They want to waste millions of our tax dollars on endless
investigations. Democrats believe this is about solving our real
problems _ protecting Social Security, patients' rights, smaller
class sizes, more teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   The narrator closes: ``Next Tuesday, vote Democratic. And tell
Congress we're ready to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   While some Republican consultants agreed with Democrats that the
advertisements were a mistake, or at least risky, officials of the
National Republican Congressional Committee dismissed the notion
that their commercials would spur any backlash. They said they were
convinced that the advertisements would energize loyal Republican
voters _ as well as people who were undecided but leaning toward
Republican candidates. House Speaker Newt Gingrich personally
approved the campaign, a top party official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Democrats really believed that our message was the
wrong message for us and that it was not going to work,'' said Mary
Crawford, communications director of the congressional committee,
``why would they be squealing like stuck pigs?''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party officials said three scandal-related
commercials were being broadcast in about 30 congressional
districts. Of the three, the toughest is appearing in Southern and
rural areas where the president is particularly unpopular. The
others are being broadcast in more suburban and coastal districts
where party polls found that people were still fuming over
Clinton's misleading the public about his affair with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials, they said, were part of a $10 million
advertising barrage in the final week of the campaign that includes
spots on specific issues tailored to individual congressional
districts; party officials would not say what proportion of the $10
million were for the scandal-related advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to emphasize the scandal marked an abrupt shift of
strategy for the Republicans, who for weeks have stayed clear of
the Lewinsky matter and advised many of the party's candidates not
to raise the affair in their own advertisements. Party officials
said that they had been moving toward the change of approach in
recent days, and that a final decision was made on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who has publicly counseled House members not to
politicize the scandal, signed off on the decision, party officials
said. ``He knew in general'' about the plans, said a top party
official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``As we got more
specific, he knew that as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertising blitz stirred intense debate among Republicans,
with some expressing fears that it could alter the dynamic _ to the
detriment of Republicans _ in the closing days of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took their bait _ this is exactly what the Democrats
wanted,'' said Tom Edmonds, a Republican media consultant. ``It
makes Republicans look unnecessarily mean spirited. They look like
opportunists. There was absolutely no need to do this. This is the
stupidest thing I've ever seen. It's a self-inflicted wound.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the chairman of the committee that sponsored the
advertisements, Rep. John Linder of Georgia, the head of the
National Republican Campaign Committee, said commercials focusing
on the scandal could be perilous. ``If our candidates all pick up
the cudgel to beat up on the president,'' he told reporters at a
lunch on Tuesday, hours before the first advertisements were
broadcast, ``it could be overkill. And it could backfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Marsh, a Republican consultant who created one of the
advertisements, said: ``Obviously, there's risk associated with
everything. But it's an important message.''
</P>
<P>
   While the commercials unmistakably bring up the scandal, they
are careful not to appear too brazen. Marsh's commercial opens with
one woman saying to another, ``What did you tell your kids?'' But
after that suggestive beginning, the conversation turns to subjects
of infrequent juvenile fascination _ big government and Social
Security,
</P>
<P>
   The two other advertisements were produced by Michael Murphy, a
veteran media consultant. In one, the narrator asks, ``Should we
reward not telling the truth?'' The other does not cite the scandal
in the text, but ends with the perhaps more powerful image of
Clinton wagging his finger at the camera when he denied his affair
with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader in the
House, said that in its advertisement responding to the attacks,
the Democrats could not afford to match spending of the
Republicans. He said the spot would make the point that ``if you
want to spend another two years investigating the president's sex
life, vote for Republicans.''

TURN ON DA BUBBLE MACHINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY BINGHAM 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are kids who blow bubbles, and then there are kids who
blow bubbles _ bubbles huge enough to score them a free trip to New
York and tickets to the World Series and a telephone call from Jay
Leno's people.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Justin Dunaway. Thirteen year-old Justin, who lives in
the Dallas suburb of Coppell, finished fifth in the Bubble Yum
World Series Blowout. Some kid from Cleveland won, but who cares?
</P>
<P>
   So, Justin, how long have you been blowing bubbles?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think since I was about 7 or 8.''
</P>
<P>
   What's your favorite?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bubble Yum.''
</P>
<P>
   Favorite flavor?
</P>
<P>
   ``Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   What do you recommend for the biggest bubbles?
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably just a little cheap brand, because I had some the
other night, at this parade I was at, and I was blowing like
humongous bubbles ... I might have a piece right here. Hold on. On
the wrapper it says Swell Bubble Gum, so Swell works good.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes it good for big bubbles?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. I was just like blowing a few bubbles with it
and they were all really, really big, like bigger than any ones
I've blown before.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you experiment with gum?
</P>
<P>
   ``In science, I did a science experiment on gum. I said, `Which
can blow bigger bubbles _ sugar or sugarless gum?' And I used
Bubble Yum, Bubblicious and umm, Bazooka as the sugar gum, and I
used Carefree, Trident and Wintergreen for the sugarless gum, and
it turned out that sugarless blows bigger bubbles.''
</P>
<P>
   Sugarless?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, because in sugar gum, you have to chew it to get the
sugar out of it, and sugarless gum, the sugar is already out, so
you go straight to blowing bubbles.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there a correlation between number of pieces and bubble size?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah. Like if you have a ton, like eight or nine pieces of
gum, the wad of gum is too big so it won't blow a bubble, or it's
really hard to chew. If you have five or six, you can blow really
good bubbles.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything else we should do to blow bubbles like you?
</P>
<P>
   ``Umm, just work hard and don't give up.''

waging a last-minute, multimillion-dollar advertising offensive

   Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, general chairman of the Democratic
Party, said: ``This is a desperate attempt from a Republican Party
completely devoid of an agenda. The American people will see right
through it and this cynical Republican ploy will backfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton joined in the assault, declaring that while
Republicans were free to say whatever they wanted in their
commercials, ``it's fair for a person to be judged on his whole
record.''
</P>
<P>
   By late Wednesday, the Democratic Party had hastily begun
assembling a commercial of its own in response to the Republicans'
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   In the commercial, a narrator says: ``This no ordinary time.
Republicans have made removing the president from office their top
priority. They want to waste millions of our tax dollars on endless
investigations. Democrats believe this is about solving our real
problems _ protecting Social Security, patients' rights, smaller
class sizes, more teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   The narrator closes: ``Next Tuesday, vote Democratic. And tell
Congress we're ready to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   While some Republican consultants agreed with Democrats that the
advertisements were a mistake, or at least risky, officials of the
National Republican Congressional Committee dismissed the notion
that their commercials would spur any backlash. They said they were
convinced that the advertisements would energize loyal Republican
voters _ as well as people who were undecided but leaning toward
Republican candidates. House Speaker Newt Gingrich personally
approved the campaign, a top party official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Democrats really believed that our message was the
wrong message for us and that it was not going to work,'' said Mary
Crawford, communications director of the congressional committee,
``why would they be squealing like stuck pigs?''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party officials said three scandal-related
commercials were being broadcast in about 30 congressional
districts. Of the three, the toughest is appearing in Southern and
rural areas where the president is particularly unpopular. The
others are being broadcast in more suburban and coastal districts
where party polls found that people were still fuming over
Clinton's misleading the public about his affair with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials, they said, were part of a $10 million
advertising barrage in the final week of the campaign that includes
spots on specific issues tailored to individual congressional
districts; party officials would not say what proportion of the $10
million were for the scandal-related advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to emphasize the scandal marked an abrupt shift of
strategy for the Republicans, who for weeks have stayed clear of
the Lewinsky matter and advised many of the party's candidates not
to raise the affair in their own advertisements. Party officials
said that they had been moving toward the change of approach in
recent days, and that a final decision was made on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who has publicly counseled House members not to
politicize the scandal, signed off on the decision, party officials
said. ``He knew in general'' about the plans, said a top party
official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``As we got more
specific, he knew that as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertising blitz stirred intense debate among Republicans,
with some expressing fears that it could alter the dynamic _ to the
detriment of Republicans _ in the closing days of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took their bait _ this is exactly what the Democrats
wanted,'' said Tom Edmonds, a Republican media consultant. ``It
makes Republicans look unnecessarily mean spirited. They look like
opportunists. There was absolutely no need to do this. This is the
stupidest thing I've ever seen. It's a self-inflicted wound.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the chairman of the committee that sponsored the
advertisements, Rep. John Linder of Georgia, the head of the
National Republican Campaign Committee, said commercials focusing
on the scandal could be perilous. ``If our candidates all pick up
the cudgel to beat up on the president,'' he told reporters at a
lunch on Tuesday, hours before the first advertisements were
broadcast, ``it could be overkill. And it could backfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Marsh, a Republican consultant who created one of the
advertisements, said: ``Obviously, there's risk associated with
everything. But it's an important message.''
</P>
<P>
   While the commercials unmistakably bring up the scandal, they
are careful not to appear too brazen. Marsh's commercial opens with
one woman saying to another, ``What did you tell your kids?'' But
after that suggestive beginning, the conversation turns to subjects
of infrequent juvenile fascination _ big government and Social
Security,
</P>
<P>
   The two other advertisements were produced by Michael Murphy, a
veteran media consultant. In one, the narrator asks, ``Should we
reward not telling the truth?'' The other does not cite the scandal
in the text, but ends with the perhaps more powerful image of
Clinton wagging his finger at the camera when he denied his affair
with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader in the
House, said that in its advertisement responding to the attacks,
the Democrats could not afford to match spending of the
Republicans. He said the spot would make the point that ``if you
want to spend another two years investigating the president's sex
life, vote for Republicans.''

BRUSHWORK WITH A CERTAIN FINE MADNESS  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 1)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (af) 
Ann Wilson Lloyd is an art critic and independent curator. 
 By ANN WILSON LLOYD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Carol Rama's remarkable paintings were last seen here
in 1996, in ``Inside the Visible,'' a sprawling group show of 36
female artists. Featuring such subject matter as masturbation and
bestiality, Ms. Rama's small, delicate watercolors from the 1930s
and 1940s were displayed in quaint, old-fashioned frames.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a comprehensive retrospective called ``Carolrama'' (she
prefers the conjoined version of her name) is on view here through
Jan. 3 at the Institute of Contemporary Art. Of the nearly 100
works from 1936 to 1997 in the show, roughly half are the early
watercolors.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rama, self-taught and a cult figure in Italy, has lived
nearly all her 80 years in the northern city of Turin. This
rootedness did not keep her from encountering major avant-garde
artists.
</P>
<P>
   She was photographed by Man Ray, who became her close,
much-admired friend. Andy Warhol wanted to put her in one of his
films when she was briefly in New York in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ms. Rama has explored many styles, often switching off
neatly at each decade mark, she has remained true to her
psychosexual sources and to an unusual sensibility toward certain
objects and materials. A group of large minimal abstractions from
the 1970s of patched, varicolored inner tubes collaged onto black
canvas are particularly beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Sensual yet formal, and very much in step with the decade's Arte
Povera movement, they remain, to Ms. Rama, a simple homage to her
father who owned a tire company.
</P>
<P>
   The early erotic watercolors continue to fascinate everyone,
even the artist. In a recent interview, Ms. Rama spoke of them
(through a translator) as if they had just left her studio. A sort
of visual diary of erotic fantasies overlaid by vivid memories, the
watercolors are done in a blithely innocent style.
</P>
<P>
   Colorful, translucent imagery shows naked women and men doing
outrageous things to themselves, each other and animals (dogs and
snakes) and clearly enjoying it. It's not surprising that in 1945
the Fascist Christian Democratic Party shut down the gallery show
in Turin, where these works were first exhibited.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, there has been a tendency to see the works as
pointed political statements meant to rile the right wing. But Ms.
Rama is not a political artist. The images come from intense
sadness and exquisite passions, all potently mixed together. She
says these are ``extraordinary sensations I've experienced all my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a kind of madness,'' she continues, calling herself a
``premeditated lunatic'' and her art-making a ``trained folly.'' In
spirit if not in subject matter, these watercolors bring to mind
the delicacy, intimate quirkiness and intuitive probings of Paul
Klee.
</P>
<P>
   An even closer parallel is the life and work of Louise
Bourgeois, who, making no claims to feminist causes, has
nonetheless become a feminist archetype.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Bourgeois,'' says Christoph Grunenberg, the curator at
ICA, ``Rama doesn't really care about feminism, but on the other
hand both women are precursors to today's feminist art. They are
incredibly independent women who have long been dealing with
subjects and issues _ the body, sexuality, gender, disease and
questions of power _ that artists like Nancy Spero, Nicole
Eisenman, Kara Walker, Ellen Gallagher or Sue Williams are now
articulating in formal and conceptually thematic ways.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Rama's early watercolors, the figures are cheerful, rosy
fleshed and often crowned with flower wreathes. The women wear
nothing but attractive makeup and high heels; even nudes confined
to wheelchairs, or strapped in iron beds, sport a nice pair of
pumps.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent feature of most figures _ human or animal _ is a red
pointy tongue, indicating, perhaps, how little they care what
people think. Some paintings are floating arrangements of
fetishized objects: more women's shoes, dentures, shaving brushes,
shovels, artificial limbs and crescent-shaped things that turn out
to be urinals.
</P>
<P>
   The shoes often have crimson, fleshy interiors that shift their
shape slyly from negative space into florid phalluses. In these,
Ms. Rama plays with sexuality, just as she plays with her alleged
insanity and exploits her self-professed lack of education and
social class.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition's organizer, Cristina Mundici, an independent
Italian curator, says that the artist is in fact remarkably
intelligent, sophisticated and insightful. The critic Ingrid
Schaffner compares Ms. Rama's highly eccentric life, art-making and
brush with mental illness to those of the Swiss artist Meret
Oppenheim and the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, both of whom also
enjoyed career re-evaluations late in life.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rama herself says: ``I've always felt extraordinary,
different. I could never be with normal people, was never at home
with the middle classes.'' She sees this as a blessing. ``I am so
lucky to declare this kind of madness. It means I can shift my
moods. I have been tortured because I had always painted subjects
or things, like naked women, or my father with shaving blades, or
flower crowns, like the kind my mother used to make picking up the
leaves from the garden of the psychiatric clinic. I don't come from
educated painting, I come from feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rama's industrialist father committed suicide when she was a
child, plunging her family into poverty. Her mother had to go to
work as a milliner, and later entered a psychiatric clinic for two
years. These experiences imparted to Ms. Rama a direct,
unmitigated, visceral connection to everyday happenings, objects,
gestures, even smells.
</P>
<P>
   They also account for certain objects, like shoes and urinals,
that she uses repeatedly in her early work and that remain, like
Proust's madeleine, highly evocative to her.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of a 1941 painting titled ``Appassionata,'' in which an
armless, legless woman lies on a metal bed, Ms. Rama recounts: ``I
was in Paris and there was this girl found in the Seine, a
prostitute, with no arms or legs. She was very beautiful and the
portrait of her face was posted all over Paris. I have always put
together this story with the story of my mother, and moreover, I
overlay these two stories with my personal experience, so that I am
these stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to a red pair of heels under the bed of a legless
woman, she says: ``And this is me. I have always loved shoes; I do
not have beautiful legs, but I can have beautiful shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   As for urinals, they're not about Duchamp, though she knew his
work. Instead, she tells of visiting her mother at work soon after
her father's death: ``There was a courtyard where there were some
urinals. I remember very well the smell of urine, and that smell
was happiness. But at the same time it was sadness, because it
reminded me of that very sad time.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between suffering and beauty, pleasure and
pain, is key to understanding Ms. Rama's work. It links the
earliest painting, ``Nonna Carolina,'' 1936, to the latest series,
``La Mucca Pazza'' (``The Mad Cow'') 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   The former is a faint watercolor of a supine woman surrounded by
wooden shoe lasts. She wears a fringed, black necklace _ actually
leeches. ``I went to see my beautiful grandmother,'' Ms. Rama
recalls. ``She was ill, in bed, with these leeches on her neck. The
shoe lasts were around her because a relative was a cobbler and
used these beautiful things. I put together the beauty and the
torture.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Mad Cow'' painting-collages are semi-abstractions done on
pieces of canvas mailbags, with bits of rubber, lead and painted
imagery conjuring bulging udders and dentures _ now fragmented and
looking long in the tooth. Inspired by the recent mad cow epidemic
in Europe _ specifically a television news clip of a convulsive
animal _ these are yet another version of Ms. Rama's composite
self-portrait, integrating aging, disease and madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The death shudder has become an echo of the orgiastic one,''
she explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a wonderful life because I do not have common
feelings,'' she concludes. ``If everyone could have these feelings
toward objects, toward events, where things could talk directly to
them without ideology, maybe they would be happier.''

   SAN FRANCISCO (6-1) AT GREEN BAY (5-2) Time: 3:15 p.m., Sunday
Site: Lambeau Field, Green Bay, Wis. (60,790) Series: 49ers lead
25-22-1 Last season: At Packers 23, 49ers 10, NFC Championship Game
Line: Green Bay by 3
</P>
<P>
   49ers update: A little history is in order here. In each of the
past three seasons, the 49ers have faced Green Bay in the playoffs,
and each time the 49ers' season ended right then. Think there might
be a little motivation in the San Francisco locker room? Not that
league's most dominating offensive team needs it. QB Steve Young's
20 TD passes are by far the most in the NFL, and WRs Jerry Rice,
Terrell Owens and J.J. Stokes all have more than 30 catches _ Rice
and Owens have already broken the 500-yard mark. And don't forget
the running game, led by Garrison Hearst's 4.7 yards per carry.
Defense was a problem early, but that's changed. DT Bryant Young
leads a unit that has recorded a league-best 31 sacks and allows
opposing passer a skimpy .523 completion percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Packers update: Is the slump over? Hard to tell after last
week's less-than-dominating performance in a 28-10 victory against
Baltimore. QB Brett Favre accounted for three TDs, but he also
threw two more interceptions, giving him 11 in his past four games.
Favre always has been something of a feast-or-famine sort, but for
a guy who threw 16 picks all last year, that's an ugly stretch. One
thing that has hurt the three-time MVP is the Pack's lack of a
running game, which puts the entire offensive load on the shoulders
of Favre and his marvelous WRs, led by Antonio Freeman, the league
leader in receiving yards. On the other side, nobody runs on Green
Bay (except maybe Barry Sanders), but the secondary showed some
vulnerability in shocking back-to-back losses to Minnesota and
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Key matchup: Green Bay's offensive line, led by T Ross Verba and
G Adam Timmerman, will be under the gun against sack artists Roy
Barker, Chris Doleman and Young, who have combined to drop QBs 22
times this year. Given Favre's recent struggles, keeping him
upright and giving him time to scan the field is essential. And
opening up some holes for RB Travis Jervey would be nice, too.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: 49ers 37, Packers 31 ARIZONA (3-4) AT DETROIT (2-5) Time:
Noon, Sunday Site: Pontiac Silverdome, Pontiac, Mich. (80,368)
Series: Lions lead 27-17-5 The line: Detroit by 6
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals update: Take a team nearly devoid of offense and take
away its best defensive players and you've got a mess. You also
have the Cardinals, who are still waiting for QB Jake Plummer to
become the star all the experts said he would be and now have to
play without Pro Bowl DT Eric Swann, who is out indefinitely
following arthroscopic knee surgery. Plummer, who has been sacked
25 times and has thrown 11 interceptions, isn't going to outscore
anyone working behind Arizona's tissue-paper line, and without
Swann, the Cards aren't likely to stop anyone, either.
</P>
<P>
   Lions update: Sure, Barry Sanders leads the NFC in rushing, WR
Herman Moore is the conference's No. 1 receiver and QB Charlie
Batch in rising quickly in the rankings. But the Lions are 2-5 in
large part because they've been penalized 60 times for 542 yards
this year. That's tough to take for coach Bobby Ross, who hasn't
finished a season below .500 since leaving The Citadel in 1977. If
they fall that far this year, it would be a waste of another
spectacular season for Sanders, who last week posted his 72nd
career 100-yard game, five behind all-time leader Walter Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Lions 21, Cardinals 13
DENVER (7-0) AT CINCINNATI (2-5) Time: Noon, Sunday Site: Cinergy
Field, Cincinnati (60,389) Series: Broncos lead 13-6 Line: Denver
by 11
</P>
<P>
   Broncos update: As if they weren't unstoppable enough, the
Broncos last week unveiled another weapon: Howitzer-range field
goals from K Jason Elam. So who needs those Elway and Davis guys,
anyway? OK, so they're pretty good, too, what with Terrell Davis
joining Jim Brown and O.J. Simpson as the only RBs to break 1,000
yards in seven games and QB John Elway cruising along with a sweet
99.6 passer rating. Still, when the Hall of Fame called this week,
it was to request the shoe Elam used to boot his record-tying
63-yarder. Sorry guys. Call back in February. He's still using it
right now.
</P>
<P>
   Bengals update: Time to put a few things in perspective. The
Bengals haven't had a winning season since 1990 and are 38-81 in
that span. Of the 29 October games they've played since '91, they
have won just three, part of a ghastly 11-52 record before the
season's midpoint. They've allowed league-worst 401.9 yards a game,
and their next three opponents _ Denver, Jacksonville and Minnesota
_ are a combined 19-2. Any questions?
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Broncos 49, Bengals 17
</P>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE (5-2) AT BALTIMORE (2-5) Time: Noon, Sunday Site:
Ravens Stadium at Camden Yards, Baltimore (68,400) Series: Jaguars
lead 5-0 Line: Jacksonville by 31/2
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars update: The road is getting long for the Jags, who play
away from home for the third week in a row. Their two previous
trips turned an unbeaten team in control of the AFC Central into a
slumping group that has dropped into a tie with Pittsburgh thanks
to consecutive losses. Now, heading into Baltimore to face the
Ravens isn't exactly as intimidating as last week's trip to Mile
High Stadium, but at this point, the Jags will take nothing for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens update: It didn't take long for things to get ugly for
the Ravens, who are now back to floundering at QB, with Eric Zeier
and Jim Harbaugh trading ineffective performances, while getting
little out of rookie RB Priest Holmes. Nowhere have the Ravens been
as punchless as in the red zone, having scored only 2 TDs in 13
possessions inside the 20. That's 15.4 percent, easily the NFL's
lowest.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Jaguars 30, Ravens 10
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI (5-2) AT BUFFALO (4-3) Time: Noon, Sunday Site: Rich
Stadium, Orchard Park, N.Y. (80.024) Series: Dolphins lead 42-22-1
Line: Buffalo by 2
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins update: They've got arguably the greatest passer in
football history. So why are the Dolphins near the bottom in
passing yards? Because the Miami offense has rung up huge numbers
for years without getting to the Super Bowl, so coach Jimmy Johnson
is ready to try something else. That something is defense. Miami
has been immovable, especially at home, where they have allowed
just one touchdown in four games. But to be a championship team,
the Fish are going to have to get it done on the road, where they
have allowed 63 of their league-low 79 points and lost twice.
</P>
<P>
   Bills update: All hail Doug Flutie, who has made believers of us
all. Amazing how when Flutie starts playing like the second coming
of Fran Tarkenton (only better), starting QB Rob Johnson's injury
is suddenly worse than first thought. Coincidence? You decide.
Flutie's renaissance has led the Bills to an improbable four-game
winning streak, putting them into a three-way tie for second in the
AFC East, just a game behind Miami. A win Sunday might shut down
the city of Buffalo for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Bills 17, Dolphins 13
</P>
<P>
   NEW ENGLAND (4-3) AT INDIANAPOLIS (1-6) Time: Noon, Sunday Site:
RCA Dome, Indianapolis (60,599) Series: Tied 33-33 Line: No line
</P>
<P>
   Patriots update: There is no question the Patriots are the AFC
East's most talented team. But much of that talent will likely be
on the sidelines again this week. QB Drew Bledsoe is terrific, but
with WRs Terry Glenn, Vincent Brisby and Troy Brown out with
injuries, all that's left to throw to are nonentities like Tony
Simmons and Anthony Ladd. This week, Willie McGinest, Brandon
Mitchell and Chad Eaton could all be missing from the defense.
That's a lot to be without, even against a last-place team.
</P>
<P>
   Colts update: Almost halfway through his first season, QB Peyton
Manning is beginning to remind us why he was the first pick in the
draft. In his last start, he led the Colts to 31 points and a near
upset of mighty San Francisco. And most important, he did not throw
an interception for the first time in his young career. He still
leads the league with 14 picks, but looks more polished every time
out. Behind an offensive line that has allowed just 12 sacks all
year, a maturing Manning could be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Patriots 27, Colts 21
</P>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (4-3) AT CAROLINA (0-7) Time: Noon, Sunday Site:
Ericsson Stadium, Charlotte, N.C. (73,248) Series: Panthers lead
4-3 Line: Carolina by 3
</P>
<P>
   Saints update: Does anyone know exactly what it is that the
Saints are good at? They're 11th in the NFC in total offense and
27th in the league in total defense. They have no player ranked
among the NFC's top 10 in rushing, passing or receiving. Their best
OL, T William Roaf, is out with a knee injury. But thanks to a
secondary that has pulled in 11 interceptions and reliable K Doug
Brien, the Saints are above .500, even with Billy Joe Tolliver as
the QB du jour. Or will Kerry Collins make his New Orleans debut
against the team he quit on three weeks ago?
</P>
<P>
   Panthers update: Surely the Panthers have to win sooner or
later, don't they? That's what the oddsmakers must have been
thinking when they installed Carolina as a slight favorite at home.
But the law of averages doesn't apply when a team is as banged up
and snakebit and demoralized as the Panthers. Carolina's defense is
in shambles, especially against the run, and the offense has turned
the ball over 18 times. One of these days, the Panthers will
probably win, but until then, the safe pick is against them.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Saints 16, Panthers 6
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA (7-0) AT TAMPA BAY (3-4) Time: Noon, Sunday Site:
Raymond James Stadium, Tampa, Fla. (65,000) Series: Vikings lead
28-13 Line: Minnesota by 6
</P>
<P>
   Vikings update: I know what you're thinking. Maybe if those
Vikings would turn the ball over once in awhile, they'd be
beatable. Forget it. Last Sunday, QB Randall Cunningham threw his
first two interceptions of the season and RB Robert Smith fumbled
for the first time in more than two years, and the Vikes still
drilled Detroit. Even with all that, Minnesota has given the ball
away just nine times this year, fewest in the NFC, and their
plus-seven turnover margin is also the conference's best.
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers update: On the other hand ... The Bucs' minus-seven
turnover margin among the worst in the NFC, ahead of only
Washington's hideous minus-13, which is only part of their growing
list of offensive problems. Topping that list is QB Trent Dilfer,
who might as well not even be on the field for all the good he does
_ the Bucs average a mere 155.3 passing yards per game, last in the
NFC. The league's No. 3 defense can only take this team so far.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Vikings 34, Buccaneers 9
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK GIANTS (3-4) AT WASHINGTON (0-7) Time: Noon, Sunday
Site: Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, Raljon, Md. (78,600) Series: Giants
lead 75-52-4 Line: New York by 21/2
</P>
<P>
   Giants update: For all their struggles, the Giants are still
just a game behind first-place Dallas in the NFC East, and a
victory Sunday would set up a showdown for the division lead next
week at Texas Stadium. In the meantime, the Giants figure to feast
on Washington's propensity for turnovers, especially since the
fierce New York rush (30 sacks), led by DE Michael Strahan, will
batter whichever QB the Redskins decide to throw out there into
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins update: Trent Green? Gus Frerotte? What's the
difference, really? Both QBs have been awful this year. Not that
that makes them unique among the Redskins, who have had pitiful
performances from much of their roster, most notably the defense.
Not only have they given up more rushing yards than any NFC team,
but they have also taken the ball away just four times in seven
games, by far the league low. By the way, Green starts this week,
as if it matters.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Giants 23, Redskins 17
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (2-5) AT ATLANTA (5-2) Time: Noon, Sunday Site:
Georgia Dome, Atlanta (71,228) Series: Rams lead 39-21-2 Line: No
line
</P>
<P>
   Rams update: The sky is falling in St. Louis, where the home
fans are booing QB Tony Banks, key players such as WR Isaac Bruce,
T Orlando Pace and RB Amp Lee are injured and rookie special-teamer
Leonard Little is up on involuntary manslaughter charges after
slamming his car into that of a woman, killing her. Police said
Little was legally drunk at the time. Amazingly, he is expected to
play Sunday. Not that it will help the Rams, who are more than a
bit wobbly themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons update: What a feel-good story Steve DeBerg was last
week, becoming the world's oldest starting QB at age 44. But it
didn't feel so good to DeBerg, who's still sore after being sacked
five times and throwing for just 114 yards in an ugly loss to the
Jets. The real starter, Chris Chandler, may be back in time for
Sunday, which would make the Falcons look more like the
playoff-bound team they are.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Falcons 26, Rams 13
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE (3-4) AT PITTSBURGH (5-2) Time: Noon, Sunday Site:
Three Rivers Stadium, Pittsburgh (59,600) Series: Steelers lead
35-20 Line: None
</P>
<P>
   Oilers update: Hey, can we get a kicker on the field? No, Al Del
Greco, just one. Del Greco's colossal goof last Sunday took away a
realistic chance to kick a game-tying field goal and the Oilers'
two-game winning streak came screeching to a halt. But the reason
for those victories _ a suddenly inspired Eddie George _ was still
there even in defeat, and that suddenly makes Tennessee a much
tougher opponent. After a horrendous start, George has now rushed
for 365 yards in his past three games, rising to fourth in the AFC
and pulling the Oilers along with him.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers update: Talk about doing it with smoke and mirrors. The
Steelers rank a miserable 13th in the AFC in total offense and are
last in the league in passing. Their one-time star QB, Kordell
Stewart, has thrown for just 929 yards and has a chilly 55.9
rating. RB Jerome Bettis has played well but is hardly having his
best year, and the defense ranks in the middle of the pack. How,
then, is Pittsburgh tied for the AFC Central lead? Special teams
have come up big and WR Hines Ward is showing signs of becoming the
new ``Slash,'' the combination runner-receiver-passer Stewart once
was.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Steelers 19, Oilers 14
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK JETS (4-3) AT KANSAS CITY (4-3) Time: 3:05 p.m., Sunday
Site: Arrowhead Stadium, Kansas City, Mo. (79,101) Series: Chiefs
lead 14-12-1 Line: No line
</P>
<P>
   Jets update: Things change quickly in the AFC East, where the
Jets were hurting two weeks ago but now are on a roll, tied for
second, just a game out of first, after blowing away New England
and Atlanta. It's all working these days for the Jets, from QB
Vinny Testaverde's AFC-best 107.0 rating (11 TDs and just one
interception) to WR Keyshawn Johnson's six scoring catches to RB
Curtis Martin's consecutive 100-yard games to LB Mo Lewis' big hits
on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs update: As fast as the Jets have risen, the Chiefs have
fallen, crashing from a perch as a Super Bowl contender to a team
grappling to stay in the AFC West race. The greatest failings have
come on defense. Why, even punchless Pittsburgh, which averages
15.1 points per game, scored 20 on the Chiefs, who are ranked No. 1
against the pass in part because it's so easy to run on them (134.3
yards rushing allowed per game) that opponents don't have to throw.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Jets 30, Chiefs 21
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND (5-2) AT SEATTLE (4-3) Time: 7:20 p.m., Sunday Site:
Kingdome, Seattle (66,400) Series: Raiders lead 21-19 Line: Seattle
by 7
</P>
<P>
   Raiders update: QB Jeff George sits, the passing game withers
and still the Raiders win. Donald Hollas likely will start again
for the ailing George on Seattle's artificial turf, but that hardly
seems to matter, because offense is not why the Raiders have won
four in a row. Oakland's defense, which ranked dead last in 1997,
is now first in the league, allowing less than 250 yards per game.
DTs Russell Maryland and Darrell Russell clog up the inside running
lanes while CBs Charles Woodson and Eric Allen are swooping on
would-be receivers _ Oakland has picked off an AFC-high 12 passes _
and stopping big plays.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks update: The Seahawks found another losing team to beat
up on last week, barely getting by San Diego. All four of their
wins, in which they have scored an average of 30.5 points, have
come against sub-.500 teams. Seattle's only matchups with winning
teams have resulted in losses, in which they averaged 10.7 points.
So what should we expect Sunday, against a 5-2 team with the
league's best defense, and QB Warren Moon still questionable with
cracked ribs? I'll leave that one to you.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Raiders 20, Seahawks 14
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS (4-3) AT PHILADELPHIA (1-6) Time: 7:20 p.m., Monday Site:
Veterans Stadium, Philadelphia (65,352) Series: Cowboys lead 45-29
Line: Dallas by 61/2
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys update: Troy's back! Troy's back! Finally, after five
weeks of thrills and chills with Jason Garrett, QB Troy Aikman is
back in the lineup for the Cowboys, just in time to start the
Cowboys' run at the NFC East title. His presence should improve a
Dallas offense that already ranks third in the NFC, thanks in large
measure to RB Emmitt Smith's resurgence. Not that they'll need much
offense to outscore woeful Philadelphia, which should be easy
pickings for the Dallas D.
</P>
<P>
   Eagles update: Deion Sanders might as well take the night off,
because the Eagles' passing game is no threat. Philly has scored
only twice through the air in seven games, and neither TD went to a
WR. The running game isn't exactly sound, either _ no Eagles RB has
had a 100-yard game this year. In all, the Eagles have scored just
79 points for the season, an average of 11.3 a game. To have a
chance, Philly has to be strong on defense, but they're allowing
nearly 150 yards per game on the ground. Can you say big day for
Emmitt? Sure. I like the way you say that.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Cowboys 27, Eagles 10

 &HT;    Kentucky standing out as hotbed of tight races
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHLAND, Ky. _ J.R. McKenzie, like many in this Ohio River town,
is a registered Democrat. But McKenzie, who owns restaurants and
other local businesses, is voting Republican in this year's
congressional election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family values,'' McKenzie said, explaining his support for
state Sen. Gex Williams, the Republican candidate in Kentucky's 4th
Congressional District.
</P>
<P>
   The curious thing about McKenzie's rationale is that the
Democratic candidate, Ken Lucas, shares many of Williams' views on
social issues, including opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The race to replace Rep. Jim Bunning (R-Ky.), the Republican
nominee for the U.S. Senate, is a contest of who can come across as
more conservative in this district, which hugs the river as it cuts
a swath across northern Kentucky from just east of Louisville
through the suburbs of Cincinnati to Ashland.
</P>
<P>
   In an election year that has relatively few competitive races
and lacks an overarching national theme, Kentucky stands out as a
political hotbed. Campaigns for three House seats and the Senate
are highly competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Bunning is locked in a close campaign with Rep. Scotty Baesler,
who is seeking to keep in Democratic hands the Senate seat that has
been held by Sen. Wendell Ford for the past 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the Louisville area, freshman Republican Rep. Anne Northup is
seeking re-election in a district she won by 1,299 votes in 1996
even as President Clinton carried it handily. She has a large
advantage in campaign cash over former Kentucky Attorney General
Chris Gorman, an anti-abortion Democrat. But Gorman has begun
airing a commercial that says Northup and the Republicans are
obsessed with impeaching Clinton and have neglected important
policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   In Baesler's Lexington-based district, state Sen. Ernesto
Scorsone is trying to shake the ``liberal'' label and hold the seat
for the Democrats. He faces Ernie Fletcher, a physician and former
state lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher is airing a hard-hitting ad that features a rape victim
who chides Scorsone, a lawyer, for his defense of the rapist, who
received a light sentence. ``The ad doesn't say this happened in
the 1970s, that the rapist was a juvenile or that the most the
judge could give him was six months,'' said Penny Miller, a
University of Kentucky political science professor. ``It's vicious
but effective.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll in that race gives Scorsone a 3-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Lucas-Williams race is among the most closely watched in the
nation, because it follows the model the Democrats said they would
employ to recapture control of the House. Few analysts, or
Democrats for that matter, give the party much chance of gaining a
majority.
</P>
<P>
   But Lucas is the kind of candidate who can draw distinctions
with the national Democratic Party, especially on social issues,
and point to victories in four elections for local and county
offices in the GOP-dominated suburbs of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Williams defeated a less conservative candidate in the primary,
in part by using his ability to mobilize religious conservatives.
The lawmaker's children are home-schooled, and he appealed for
volunteers for his campaign by noting that he is a ``Christian
father of six.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the campaign has taken on a particularly nasty
tone, with Lucas accusing Williams of lying and the Republican
calling his opponent ``a Clinton liberal right here in Kentucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the Kentucky political scientist, said she doubts that
the charge will stick to Lucas. ``They're both trying to depict
themselves as the best conservative,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas has nettled Williams repeatedly with ads that allege that
the Republican has shoddy ethics, using a Kentucky ethics
commission probe that ultimately cleared Williams but chastised him
for not clearly reporting the details of his sale of farm land to a
political supporter.
</P>
<P>
   And lately, Lucas has gotten under Williams' skin by
intentionally mispronouncing Williams' unusual first name. It is
pronounced Jay, but Lucas says it so that it rhymes with hex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucas can't win on the issues so he wants to change the
subject to character,'' said Ralph Reed, the former Christian
Coalition executive director who is Williams' political consultant.
</P>
<P>
   But issues have won Lucas the endorsement of the Kentucky Post,
a paper that frequently opts for Republican candidates.

 &HT;    Owners of Atlanta's Underground mall consider offers
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Underground Atlanta's owners are finalizing a deal to
sell the beleagured downtown landmark to local businessman Dan
O'Leary, who also owns South DeKalb Mall, according to one of the
other bidders.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary, managing partner of Atlanta-based Capitalist Ventures
Inc., is one of three finalists bidding on Underground, and the
first choice of Underground Festival Inc.'s committee negotiating a
deal to present to the Atlanta City Council.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary's bid to beef up Underground's appeal as a
family-oriented tourist attraction apparently beat out a more
ambitious plan from a joint venture of mall giant Urban Shopping
Centers and local retail consultant George Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of what we are proposing and what Dan is proposing
is diametrically opposed,'' said Hawthorne, a former retail
operations manager at Underground and owner of Retail Property
Solutions, a consultancy in Atlanta. ``The council needs to look at
both bids.''
</P>
<P>
   UFI's committee wants to present a contract with O'Leary to City
Council for approval by the end of the year. But several council
members have said they want to study all three final offers. ``It's
not over by any means,'' Hawthorne said.
</P>
<P>
   UFI acting president Charlie Battle said the committee was still
negotiating a letter of intent and declined to confirm the bidder.
But Battle's committee may be in for a political fight when they
take their deal to City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne, who was appointed by the mayor to chair this year's
Freaknik celebration, may generate some support for his proposal _
he is encouraging council members to support his effort to get his
bid on the table alongside O'Leary's.
</P>
<P>
   However, he has at least one ``no'' vote on the City Council.
Council President Robb Pitts told Battle and others he would not
approve a deal with which Hawthorne was associated.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne and Chicago-based Urban are proposing a $100 million
redevelopment of the Five Points area, including a 500-room
convention hotel and 250 condominiums and enclosing Kenny's Alley
at Underground for a nighttime entertainment enclave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underground has to be the entertainment hub for the city,''
Hawthorne said. ``A family oriented attraction doesn't take care of
your business after 6 p.m. and that's when you make your sales per
square foot.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary, a former retail broker who bought the ailing South
DeKalb Mall from the Rouse Co. in 1996, has said he is leaving
nighttime entertainment to Buckhead and Virginia-Highland and
concentrating on tourists and families by bringing new attractions
and shops to Underground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buckhead has emerged as the mecca of nightlife entertainment
and its too difficult to compete against that now,'' O'Leary said
in an earlier interview. ``Underground doesn't have to become a hot
spot for people in metro Atlanta. I see it as a place to showcase
Atlanta rather than a place for Atlantans to hang out at on a
regular basis.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary paid about $20 million for South DeKalb and has
successfully signed new retailers and boosted sales. He convinced
DeKalb County this summer to provide a tax break to build a
12-screen Magic Johnson Theaters complex at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   The likely stumbling block for Hawthorne and Urban's bid was not
money or the concept, but a contingency requiring the city to
spruce up the gritty Five Points area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted a commitment from the city to move in the
direction that solves the overall problem,'' Hawthorne said.
O'Leary's plan, he said, ``is a Band-Aid approach to a festering
sore.''

<P>
   Two new studies undercut scientists' hopes that people infected
with HIV would be able to avoid a lifelong regimen of taking a drug
``cocktail'' of 20 to 30 pills a day, a regimen that can cost
$15,000 a year and cause a variety of side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The studies, being published Thursday in the New England Journal
of Medicine, found that attempts to reduce the number of
medications failed, allowing the resurgence of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists say that the disappointing results should not
discourage badly needed efforts to find better strategies for
controlling HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Patients who are taking the AIDS cocktail of antiviral drugs
have been told that they may require that treatment indefinitely,
perhaps for life. The two new studies were designed to test another
idea, on which many scientists and patients had pinned their hopes:
that the drug cocktail might reduce HIV infection to such a low
level that some of the drugs could be stopped, and the virus kept
in check by the body's immune system and a ``maintenance therapy''
consisting of fewer drugs. That way, patients might be able to
escape some of the adverse effects of medication.
</P>
<P>
   A similar approach has been used successfully in treating
tuberculosis and leukemia. The disease is initially hit hard with
heavy doses of medication, a treatment known as induction therapy,
and then kept at bay with a milder drug regimen. But for HIV,
induction followed by maintenance therapy did not work.
</P>
<P>
   In both studies, patients initially took three drugs, achieved
suppression of the virus, and then, after three or six months,
stopped one or two of the drugs. Virus levels rebounded quickly in
a significant number of patients, and the studies had to be halted
so that the drug cocktail could be reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are truly important and informative studies,'' said Dr.
Jerome Groopman, an AIDS expert at the Harvard Medical School, who
was not involved in the research. ``They're sobering, because they
demonstrate that the virus is an aggressive foe, and once the most
intensive pressures are relieved, even partially, it has a
tremendous capacity to spring back.''
</P>
<P>
   The director of one of the studies, Dr. Diane Havlir, an
associate professor of medicine at the University of California at
San Diego, said that although the results were disappointing, they
were not unexpected. Researchers have seen viral levels rebound
dramatically in some patients who have quit the drug cocktail or
tried taking a ``drug holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Havlir said that patients in her study were closely
monitored for signs of relapse, which sometimes occurred within
weeks of switching treatments. When that happened, she said, they
were urged to resume the triple combination. Preliminary data on a
small number of those patients, Dr. Havlir said, suggest that the
virus was re-suppressed when the more powerful treatment was
resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Havlir and her colleagues said that their findings
underscored warnings already given to patients: that combination
therapy is a long-term proposition, and breaking the regimen may
allow the virus to rebound and evolve resistant strains that defy
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the experiment had to be done, Dr. Havlir said, because
doctors and patients alike want to know whether there is any end in
sight to use of the cocktail. She said that she and her colleagues
had no trouble finding patients eager to enter the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite how these drugs have completely changed the face of
the HIV epidemic in the United States, we're realizing that there
are limitations,'' she said, citing side effects and a strict,
difficult schedule of doses.
</P>
<P>
   One of the pills in the cocktail must be taken precisely every
eight hours, at least one hour before or two hours after a meal.
Side effects can include vomiting and diarrhea, and certain drugs,
the protease inhibitors, are causing high levels of cholesterol and
triglycerides in some patients, increasing their risk of heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Some patients also develop ``protease paunches'' _ a shift of
body fat to the abdomen _ or ``buffalo humps'' _ fat deposits on
the back of the neck that can grow so large and disfiguring that
patients have them surgically removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Side effects are catching up with large numbers of patients,''
Groopman said. He estimated that 20 percent to 25 percent of
patients on protease inhibitors for two or three years have
``significant fat redistribution and, importantly, sky high
triglycerides and high cholesterol.'' He has seen patients with
cholesterol levels driven over 700, and triglycerides over 1,000,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   If people stay on the drugs for decades, Groopman asked, ``Will
it happen to everyone?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases, said that, in addition to the physical
side effects, patients are finding it hard to tolerate the endless
disruption of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their whole day is dominated by the schedule of taking
drugs,'' Fauci said. ``After six months to a year they say, `God, I
can't take this any more.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jay Levy, a professor of medicine at the University of
California at San Francisco, said that the studies revealed the
need for new treatments, particularly vaccines and drugs that would
boost the immune system and help it fight the infection. The
current antiviral drugs fall short, Levy said, because they cannot
reach viruses hiding within the patient's cells that can re-emerge
when the drugs are stopped.
</P>
<P>
   In the study led by Dr. Havlir, patients took three antiviral
drugs for six months: the protease inhibitor indinavir, and two
reverse transcriptase inhibitors, lamivudine and zidovudine, or
AZT. Then, one-third of the patients continued the three drugs,
one-third took indinavir alone, and one-third took AZT and
lamivudine.
</P>
<P>
   Among patients who continued taking the drug cocktail, only 4
percent had loss of viral suppression. But in each of the other two
groups, within two months or less, 23 percent of the patients
relapsed. Those who had taken AZT before the study began were
especially vulnerable to relapse.
</P>
<P>
   The second study reported similar results. Directed by Dr.
Gilles Pialoux of the Rothschild hospital in Paris, patients
initially took the same three drugs as in Dr. Havlir's study, but
for only three months instead of six. Then, they stayed with that
regimen, or switched to a combination of either AZT and lamivudine,
or AZT and indinavir.
</P>
<P>
   In the French study, 8.6 percent of the patients who continued
taking the drug cocktail lost viral suppression. But in the other
two groups, 31 percent and 22 percent of the patients relapsed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both groups of scientists said that despite the failure of
maintenance therapy in their studies, researchers should keep
trying to find alternatives to the current regimen, perhaps
involving longer periods on the full cocktail or different drug
combinations in the second phase.
</P>
<P>
   Fauci said that his research team is planning such a study, to
begin within the next few weeks. Fifty patients taking the drug
cocktail whose virus levels have been undetectable for a year or
more will stop all three medications, to see if their immune
systems have recovered enough to control the infection. Patients
will be tested every one or two weeks to measure their viral levels
and counts of CD4 cells, Fauci said, and if virus levels come up,
the patients will be treated immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have overwhelming confidence that we'll succeed,''
Fauci said, ``but we have to do the study. We're all appreciating
that it's not feasible to say that patients are going to be on
these regimens for 30 years.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Remembering and relishing the excitement, wonder of space
 &HT;    By Jeff Bruce
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ At the guarded entrance to the Kennedy
Space Center, an ancient Redstone rocket rises by the roadside, a
lonely sentry reminiscent of glory days of old.
</P>
<P>
   Atop the seven-story missile sits a Mercury capsule with the
words ``United States'' boldly emblazoned on its thin titanium
hull, white paint on a black spaceship barely large enough to hold
a man.
</P>
<P>
   Alan B. Shepard squeezed into a capsule like this 37 years ago
to begin America's adventure in space. Nine months later, John
Glenn, in a similar capsule but atop the larger and more powerful
Atlas missile, blasted into orbit, the first American to do so.
</P>
<P>
   During the past three decades, many others have followed in
Shepard's and Glenn's trailblazing footsteps. Once there were the
Mercury Seven, household names all. Today, NASA provides a 74-page
catalogue to list all its astronauts, current, retired and
deceased. The space program has 103 astronauts on its active duty
roster. Even more, 105, have retired. Twenty-five astronauts have
died. And another 35 men and women are in the current astronaut
candidate class.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder we don't know their names. No wonder the wonderment is
gone. Heroes don't come by the dozens. But we cherish them when we
find them, which explains the excitement surrounding John Glenn's
return to space.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a hero. In an encore performance, to be sure. But a
genuine hero nonetheless. Finally a chance, too, to relive the
excitement of the days when the space program was young, when men
truly went where no one had gone before.
</P>
<P>
   Tom O'Malley vividly remembers those days. He was the guy in the
blockhouse who pushed the button sending Glenn into orbit the first
time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great that he's going up,'' he told reporters.
``It has given the space program a needed lift. Maybe now we'll get
back on track and put an astronaut on Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   George Page was O'Malley's No. 2 on launch day, Feb. 20, 1962.
He recalls the Atlas missile was unsuccessful a third of the time
during launch. ``I think John Glenn had a heck of a lot of courage
to sit on that damned thing.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley, too, remembers the danger: ``In the early days, every
other one either failed or fizzled. I don't think there was a
launch pad out there we didn't have one blow up on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public wants a hero...and John Glenn fits that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brave then, brave now. Ask Shirley Franks, she'll tell you.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, 62, works at the Space Shop, the official NASA souvenir
store, and has been around the edge of the space program since its
early years. Back in the '60s she was a waitress at Ramon's, the
hottest eatery in Cocoa Beach and a frequent hangout of the Mercury
astronauts. She remembers John Glenn as a customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very nice man and he had a lovely wife and family,''
she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   And how do you feel about Glenn's return to space?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think its a very brave thing that he's doing''
</P>
<P>
   Franks, along with everyone else at the space center, will stop
what they're doing during the final countdown today. ``When you see
a launch going up, it's a very emotional thing to me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If you had a chance to say something to Glenn before liftoff,
what would it be? I asked her.
</P>
<P>
   She look thoughtful for a moment, then replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``Godspeed John Glenn.''

 &HT;    Through time, NASA has grown galaxies more sophisticated
 &HT;    By Jeff Bruce
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ During the past three decades, spaceships
have become far more sophisticated and complex.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the guys who were in the blockhouse on the day John
Glenn was first launched into orbit:
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we had that was automated in those days was the
coffee machine in the control room,'' recalls Paul Donnelly, a
former NASA test conductor.
</P>
<P>
   The Redstone rocket, which first launched man into space, would
fit into the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle. You could take all the
Mercury capsules ever launched and return them to space in the back
of the shuttle, too _ and still have room for a game of pool if you
could figure out how to play in zero G.
</P>
<P>
   The NASA public relations operation, which also has grown in
sophistication over the years, has compiled a fascinating
comparison of space vehicles, then and now, which illustrates how
much things have changed. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ Five computers are on board the space shuttle, helping guide
its flight and re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. That's five
more computers than John Glenn had aboard Friendship 7.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Mercury capsule, designed to hold a single astronaut, had
a mere 36 cubic feet of space. The shuttle, in contrast, can hold
up to 10 people and contains more than 2,300 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   _ While orbiting the planet, John Glenn had to attend to 56
toggle switches, eight push-buttons and 19 event indicators. Aboard
the cockpit of STS 95, the pilots will watch over 856 toggle
switches, 219 push-buttons and 559 event indicators.
</P>
<P>
   _ John Glenn orbited the Earth three times in just under five
hours. The Discovery will remain in space for nearly nine days
orbiting the planet 144 times.
</P>
<P>
   _ Friendship 7 was the ultimate in planned obsolescence, built
to last for only one flight. The Space Shuttle Discovery will be
making its 25th return to space today.

 &HT;    Those who knew Glenn way back should have known...
 &HT;    By Dale Huffman and Brandon Peterson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Isabel Bowers is proud that ``the jolly
little boy with freckles'' from her hometown of New Concord is the
big news of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Twp. trustee Robert T. Douglass is equally proud _ he's
one of the few people who received an invitation from Sen. John
Glenn's office to watch him go back in orbit today.
</P>
<P>
   And Vivian Walton was so proud she wrote a song for the senator.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's return to orbit has moved people in many different ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``From New Concord to space,'' Bowers, 82, said smiling. ``You
know I was older than little John, and we lived about six miles
from his family. John's father had a plumbing business and when my
father went over there to get stuff I would tag along. I got to
play with John. I still find it hard to realize he is the man who
is making all this news.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglass finds it hard to believe he received an invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I talked to John Glenn was in 1996 when we were
at a meeting celebrating the first flight of 1903,'' Douglass said.
``So I wouldn't say we were exactly close.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a close friendship or not, Douglass was one of 100
people, including family members, to get the invitation. The rest
of the group will watch the launch from a designated location.
</P>
<P>
   And he's got his camera too. ``I hope I remember to take
pictures, Douglass said.'' ``I'm like the hunter looking for birds,
gets excited when he sees it, and forgets to shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright State University assistant professor of psychology
Valerie Shalin will also be on hand to watch Glenn's takeoff, but
closer to NASA officials.
</P>
<P>
   Shalin and three Wright State graduate students will be at the
NASA flight control center in Houston observing workplace
activities at mission control as part of a research project to help
NASA improve the design of its software tools.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of design, a Dayton woman has wrote a song
commemorating Glenn's return to space.
</P>
<P>
   Walton, 63, of Dayton, said she was inspired to write ``Pray For
Senator John Glenn and the Crew'' to promote unity and living
longer lives in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in life, and the idea of this song is to encourage
people to live longer,'' Walton said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers, who works at Wilkie's book store in downtown Dayton,
said she was shocked when Glenn went into orbit in 1962, but in
retrospect had a clue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to make model airplanes as a kid,'' she said, ''and he
always played with little planes. I guess I should have known.''

 &HT;    Police show tape second time hoping to find witness to slayings
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler and Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta police had a second world premier movie
showing Wednesday night, hoping to find a murder witness _ a man
caught on video entering the Atlanta Hilton &AMP; Towers the night
three men were shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   After a disappointing first release _ police last week showed a
videotape of the man getting onto an elevator in the hotel with one
of the victims at about 2:10 a.m. _ police now say they hope a
clearer frontal view of the witness will prompt someone to come
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope this additional video will help the public identify
the person we're interested in,'' said Atlanta police spokesman
John Quigley. ``I want to reiterate there is a $30,000 reward
leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons
responsible for this crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The earlier video shows 31-year-old Phillip Dover of
Gainesville, Ga., walking into the hotel's elevator bay with a man
dressed in khaki-colored clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Dover, Gerrold Shropshire, 50, of Altamonte Springs, Fla., and
Ronald Gutkowski, 51, of Leesburg, Fla., were found shot to death
``execution style'' in room 2414 of the Hilton on Oct. 18, police
have said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Eric Kiesel, Fulton County deputy chief medical
examiner, said the men were shot in the head ``more than once.''
</P>
<P>
   California State University at Northridge Criminology Professor
Lewis Yablonsky questioned whether such a shooting could be
considered a cold-blooded execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anger, revenge. This sounds like retribution for being
mistreated in some way,'' said Yablonsky, who has written 16 books
on crime in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone had wanted to kill them, they would have been
killed,'' Yablonsky said. ``But this is overkill, and that would
lead me to believe that there was some enormous, revengeful anger
that came into play.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiesel would not discuss whether the shooting victims had been
beaten or sexually assaulted. The medical examiner collected
evidence from the victims' bodies and said toxicology tests to
determine the presence of drugs or alcohol had not yet been
completed.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery surrounding the triple murder deepened when police
in suburban Orlando, Fla., discovered someone broke into
Shropshire's empty apartment, rifled through papers and ransacked
the place one week after the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta homicide investigators said they are working closely
with police in Altamonte Springs, Fla., to determine whether the
break-in is related to the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law enforcement agencies down there are being very cooperative
with us,'' Sgt. Scott Bennett said Wednesday. ``But it's too early
to tell whether the break-in and the murders are connected yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Chief Mike Deal of the Altamonte Springs Police
Department said his investigators do not know whether anything was
taken from Shropshire's apartment. He said he shared all the
information he had about the burglary with homicide detectives in
Atlanta, but he does not know whether the burglary is related to
the triple murder in the high-rise hotel nearly 400 miles away from
Shropshire's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know a lot about what (the Atlanta police are) doing
and what direction they're going in,'' he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Early in their investigation, Atlanta police ordered the
managers Shropshire's apartment complex to change the lock on his
apartment, Shropshire's relatives said. Five days after the
killings, police officers in the Orlando suburb of about 40,000
people, accompanied Shropshire's daughter and other relatives into
the apartment so they could pick up some clothes for Shropshire's
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   A police report says the apartment was relatively neat and clean
then. On their way out, detectives stuck red tape that says
''EVIDENCE'' on the door.
</P>
<P>
   Two days laters, on Sunday, Oct. 25, someone broke into
Shropshire's apartment, in a complex of beige buildings surrounded
by palm trees. A police report says the burglar or burglars
''pulled out various drawers in the bed room and went through them
scattering articles. Persons went into the living room and pulled
open the drawer and went through some papers.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, written Monday by Officer G.J. Aldrich, said the
burglar or burglars then ''went into the living room and pulled
open the drawer and went through some papers.'' Aldrich said
''there were several papers scattered on the dining room table''
but that valuable items, such as televisions, computers, stereo
speakers and a CD player were ''untouched.''
</P>
<P>
   Aldrich said in his report that ''glove prints'' were recovered
from Shropshire's apartment. Police in Florida said they do not
know whether the glove prints came from the burglar or from a
gloved police officer who accompanied Shropshire's relatives into
the apartment a few days before the burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Maple Bronner, Shropshire's girlfriend, said Wednesday that she
does not know what to make of the burglary.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just getting stranger and stranger and kind of spooky,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bronner said she has ''no idea'' who would have wanted to hurt
Shropshire. She said she is beginning to wonder whether Shropshire
and Gutkowski stumbled onto some information _maybe related to
their trucking jobs _ that was dangerous. If they did, she said,
they certainly did not let on that anything was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just wondering if he found out something or if Ronnie
found out something,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police are also trying to figure out whether the Hilton
slayings are related to a shooting at a College Park Days Inn on
Oct. 15. For the last few days, police from both agencies have said
the incidents shared a handful of similarities, but they would not
discuss what those were. In that case, 19-year-old Ladaris Hawkins
was found shot in the face inside a room at the motel just after
10:30 p.m. Hawkins was also found in his underwear, and as in the
Hilton incident, there was no forced entry to his room.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday morning Lt. Richard Chromi of the major crimes
division, said he was not as certain that both are connected:
``What we apperared to have at first blush, is not what we have
now. I'm not going to discuss whether that means the cases are not
connected or whether the motive is different, I'm just saying
things may not be the same as what was originally thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said investigators still do not have enough evidence in
the Atlanta case to pin down a motive.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard meanwhile, said she is
staying close to the case: ``I am directing, advising, and making
decisions whenever necessary and as appropriate. I am being brief
around the clock.''

FEDS CHARGE 44 WITH DEFRAUDING INVESTORS OVER THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Delivering a blunt reminder to investors that the World Wide Web
can be treacherous, federal regulators said Wednesday that they had
accused 44 stock promoters of fraudulently promoting more than 235
small companies on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which created a special
enforcement squad to police Internet frauds, called the civil
enforcement action the first such nationwide crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC accused an array of little-known stock promoters in 10
states and the District of Columbia of ``illegally touting
securities'' and misleading investors about their relationships
with the companies they were promoting.
</P>
<P>
   Often, regulators said, the promoters recommended stocks but
failed to disclose that they were being paid in cash or stock by
the companies they were promoting. Often, the agency said, the
promoters sold their own shares as the price of a stock jumped in
the period after they pumped up its virtues.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all of these cases, the Internet promoters gave ostensibly
independent opinions about microcap companies that in reality were
bought and paid for,'' Richard H. Walker, director of enforcement
at the SEC, said in a statement. ``Not only did they lie about
their own independence, some of them lied about the companies they
featured and then took advantage of any quick spike in price to
sell their shares for a fast and easy profit.''
</P>
<P>
   The promoters _ who wrote for online newsletters, posted
messages on Web sites and flooded the Internet with junk e-mail _
were paid more than $6.2 million in cash by the companies whose
shares they were promoting and were given 1.8 million shares of
stock or stock options for their work, regulators said.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said many of the accused had already agreed to settle
the complaint by paying fines.
</P>
<P>
   Despite efforts by the SEC to combat Internet fraud, however,
the scams have become increasingly sophisticated and varied.
</P>
<P>
   ``All types of scams are finding their way to the Internet,''
said John R. Stark, chief of the office of Internet enforcement at
the SEC. ``You have Ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes, public
offerings, oil and gas fraud, every kind of fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the fraud, investigators say, involves small-time stock
promoters, many of whom work out of their homes, and a host of tiny
companies hoping to bolster the value of their penny stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the range of schemes appears to have grown enormously,
despite repeated warning from regulators that investors must be
skeptical about what they find on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Stark says it is difficult to know who is falling for the
misleading stock promotions. ``The profile is really all over the
map,'' he said. ``Some people are sophisticated, some are not.
There is no typical Internet victim. The fact is no one should be
making investment decisions based on what they read over the
Internet.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That small companies in several of these cases paid as much as
$300,000 to stock promoters on the Web is an indication of just how
powerful a trading and investment tool the Internet has become in
recent years and how seductive a vehicle of fraud it can become.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, an Internet newsletter called The Future Superstock
recommended that its more than 100,000 subscribers buy shares in
about 25 fast-growing companies whose share prices were expected to
double or triple in the following months.
</P>
<P>
   The writer of the newsletter, which offers company profiles and
``hot breaking news,'' told subscribers that he had conducted
independent research on the companies and that his stock-picking
record was excellent.
</P>
<P>
   But what the writer, Jeffrey C. Bruss of West Chicago, Ill., did
not fully disclose, according to federal regulators, was that the
companies he was touting had paid him more than $1.6 million to do
so. In fact, he had done little or no research, investigators say,
and he misled subscribers about his stock picking record. Efforts
to reach Bruss by telephone and e-mail were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Francis A. Tribble and his company, Sloane
Fitzgerald, were accused of sending more than 6 million e-mails to
fraudulently promote two small companies, including JT's
Restaurants in New York. The SEC said many of the e-mails did not
sufficiently disclose Tribble's compensation arrangements with JT's
Restaurants, which is owned by his father, Joseph Tribble.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the e-mail suggested that it was from independent stock
promoters named ``HotStock,'' ``Net-Vest'' and ``Cyber-Stock,''
according to the SEC. Francis Tribble and Sloane Fitzgerald agreed
to pay a $15,000 civil penalty, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not illegal for a company to pay stock promoters
to tout their stock, the promoters are required by federal law to
disclose whether they are being paid by a company they are
promoting, what form of payment they are receiving and how much
they receive.
</P>
<P>
   With the huge proliferation of Web sites and bulletin boards,
and the increasingly sophisticated methods use to engage in
securities fraud, many say there are not enough regulators to begin
to patrol the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But regulators also point out that the Internet has become a
tremendous tool for those willing to do research on investment
opportunities and stock promoters. Already, there are sites devoted
to combating stock scams, and the North American Securities
Administrators Association, a group of state regulators, says it
would like to form a neighborhood ``watch'' program in which
Internet users could funnel information about potential stock scams
to a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do what we can,'' said Marc Beauchamp, a spokesman
for the association, ``to make sure this medium is not overrun by
charlatans.''

GRIDLOCK EXPECTED, WELCOMED, FOR VIEWING SPOTS AT GLENN, DISCOVERY
LAUNCH 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle

<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ The most enviable spots for viewing
Thursday's liftoff of the shuttle Discovery were claimed by
nightfall Wednesday, but cars, campers and RVs carrying John Glenn
well-wishers were expected to keep on coming, raising the threat of
gridlock before launch time.
</P>
<P>
   Along coastal state highway 528 near here, about a dozen campers
and RVs were wedged into a small, sandy clearing by midafternoon.
They watched the glow of the brightly lit launch pad across several
miles of water as night fell.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Tarsitano of nearby Melbourne, Fla., said she could have
stayed home and gotten a decent view of the shuttle after it
cleared the ground, but that wasn't close enough to suit her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't hear it, you don't see the flames,'' Tarsitano said.
``Here, you get the fire and the vibration.''
</P>
<P>
   The recreational vehicle site featured a hodge-podge of
characters from everywhere. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``I was the very first person here _ it's the best spot,'' said
Keith Hilgers, 40, who is unemployed and drove his recreational
vehicle from a Chicago suburb. ``I like the shuttle. I don't care
who's in it, as long as it's safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few yards away, Australian residents Alec Howie and Jenny
Wingat were settling in to await the launch in the camper they've
used to tour the United States since June.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is revered in Australia, too, said Howie, 76, and he and
Wingat deliberately planned their trip through Central Florida to
catch the launch.
</P>
<P>
   The way he sees it, Americans must be delighted to have
something to think about other than the ongoing presidential
scandal. ``It's taken all that bad news off the front page,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At nearby Jetty Park, Edward Cooper of Bullhead, Ariz., was
scrambling to raise the colors over his camper Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotta get our flag up for this!'' said Cooper. ``This is a
patriotic occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   He and wife Marian tried to make reservations at the campsite
three months ago, she said, but were told it was already booked.
They gratefully squeezed into the overflow section, and plan to
watch the launch from the roof of their camper.
</P>
<P>
   The crush of visitors began affecting traffic days before
launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, the word of the day is gridlock,'' said Titusville Police
Lt. Skip Toney as the 86-member Titusville police force geared up
for crowd and traffic control.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a '60s hero going up in the '90s _ that's pretty
big news.''
</P>
<P>
   So big, in fact, that a lot of Floridians would just as soon
skip the hassle of jockeying for a good spot and watch from the
comfort of their homes along the coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The locals aren't going to be out and about,'' said Charlotte
Leinbach as she and her husband sold souvenirs along U.S. 1 in
Titusville. Most of her customers were home folks, she said, who
bought early to avoid the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just stay home,'' Toney is advising Titusville residents.
``Open your doors and watch it from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials predict it will take two to four hours
for traffic to clear after blast-off, scheduled for 2 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how anyone is going to get to work, to be honest
with you,'' said Helen Voltz, Brevard County Commission Chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting earlier this week, she asked that county employees
get a half-day off because of traffic concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody seemed to be a Scrooge this morning _ they all said
no,'' Voltz said. ``They felt we would need a lot of county
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Voltz plans to take time off and has a VIP pass for a close-up
view of the launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time a launch goes up, I get tears in my eyes,'' she
said ``It's spine-tingling.''
</P>
<P>
   Titusville is just across the the Indian River from the launch
pad and souvenir stands were doing a brisk business.
</P>
<P>
   For vendor Frances Grimm, 67, the excitement went beyond the
money-making opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met John Glenn before he ever went up,'' she gushed. She was
working for Collins Radio in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, she said, and
Glenn toured the plant that would be supplying equipment for his
capsule. ``And he said, `You know girls, our lives are in your
hands,' '' Grimm recalled. ``It was a thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles west off State Road 50, retiree Betty Reinecke, 76,
proudly wore her volunteer vest heavy with John Glenn pins, patches
and buttons. She worked at a tourist information booth earlier in
the week, but, like many locals, plans to take Thursday off and
watch the launch from her front porch.
</P>
<P>
   While Reinecke believes politics played a role in putting Glenn
on the Discovery, she's not complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``The benefit of it is we are going to get a heck of a promotion
by using John Glenn,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of the tourists stopped at the Astronaut Hall of Fame,
many leaving words of encouragement to Discovery's crew in the
visitors book. But the lion's share of the messages were directed
to Glenn _ some making pointed reference to his 77 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Mr. Glenn: Please don't have a heart attack,'' wrote
Elizabeth Snyder, a local elementary school student. &QL;

GLENN'S COMMENTS ON CHALLENGER DISASTER ARE REVIVED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With GLENN-PREPARE)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The day after the space shuttle Challenger disaster
in 1986, Senator John Glenn blasted NASA's decision to send Christa
McAuliffe on the fatal mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The space program is for basic, fundamental research,'' Glenn
said after McAuliffe, a Concord, N.H., high school teacher, and six
crewmates died in the Challenger tragedy. ``It's not to put the
butcher, the baker, and the candlestick maker up there.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Glenn said, space flight should not be ``a cosmic
carnival ride.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, 12 years later, the 77-year-old Democratic senator
from Ohio is poised to lift off for a shuttle ride in space. And
several critics are using his post-Challenger remarks against him.
</P>
<P>
   Although they praised him as an America hero for his historic
space flight in 1962 and wished him success on the nine-day journey
that is scheduled to start Thursday at 2 p.m., Glenn's critics
asserted Wednesday that his mission on the shuttle Discovery is no
more vital to space science than McAuliffe's education-based
``ultimate field trip'' was to have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a favor for someone who is a favorite son of the space
program and has been loyal to the Clinton administration,'' said
Lon Raines, editor of Space News, a weekly newspaper that covers
the aerospace industry. ``There is no scientific justification for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe, who was born in Boston and raised in Framingham, had
been chosen from a field of nearly 11,500 teachers to become the
inaugural astronaut in NASA's civilian-in-space program. She was to
have turned the shuttle into an orbiting classroom, conducting
science experiments and lessons on space history that were to have
been beamed by satellite to millions of American students.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe was 37 when the Challenger exploded 73 seconds after
liftoff, killing the crew and effectively ending the
civilian-in-space program.
</P>
<P>
   Although Glenn expressed ``a profound, personal sense of loss''
over the Challenger tragedy, he questioned the decision to send
civilians into space while the shuttle program was still in ``its
embryonic stage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the taxpayers come to believe that the space program is
becoming a cosmic carnival ride, then we face the very real
prospect that they may withdraw their support,'' Glenn said.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of aggressive lobbying to secure a seat on the
Discovery flight, Glenn is scheduled to act as a human guinea pig
for research on aging in the weightlessness of space.
</P>
<P>
   NASA and some advocates for broader research on aging have
defended Glenn's role on the Discovery flight as a potentially
valuable contribution to science.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn also has responded to the critics. ``If you eliminate the
science benefit,'' he said at a recent news conference, ``then
there's no reason, except I want to go. That's not a justification
for me to go. A lot of people want to go. We are going for science.
That's the reason I am going.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn failed to convince Rick Tomlinson, president of the Space
Frontier Foundation, which promotes opening space travel to
civilians. Tomlinson characterized Glenn's scheduled flight the way
some of McAuliffe's prelaunch critics described her mission. He
called it ``a publicity stunt.''

 &HT;    Godspeed, John Glenn
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Launch day for the space shuttle
Discovery will dawn today on Florida's Atlantic coast, but before
the sun clears the horizon, October 29, 1998, will be the day
America sends its first space hero back into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   John Glenn, the senior senator from Ohio, is the lowest ranking
member of Discovery's seven-astronaut crew. Yet it will be his
presence aboard the ship's windowless mid-deck that makes this 92nd
shuttle flight an event of historic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   The first American in space will become, at age 77, the oldest
man ever in space.
</P>
<P>
   A grove of television satellite trucks has sprouted in the flat
grass of the Kennedy Space Center press site. Cocoa Beach's prime
viewing spot, Jetty Park, filled with campers two nights ago, and
just about every business marquee along the beach has spelled out
some variation of ``Godspeed, John Glenn.''
</P>
<P>
   By about 11:15 a.m. today, Glenn will be on his back inching
into position so he can be strapped to his metal seat. Two other
astronauts will be with him, and the remaining four will ride one
floor up on the shuttle's flight deck. The last time Glenn did
this, 36 years ago on a launch pad 12 miles south, the rocket moved
when he did, the capsule fit around him like the trunk of a car,
and he was alone.
</P>
<P>
   The only open question for the day of the launch may be the
evaluations of its importance. The science to which Glenn has been
assigned is in the early stages, and isn't likely to offer
startling new views of aging in the human body. At best, the Glenn
studies will offer future researchers suggestions on where to look
next. But the historical symmetry of sending an original astronaut
back into space, despite drawing intense publicity now, may not
sustain much interest after Glenn's return.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, believes it will.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great thrill,'' said DeWine, who arrived Wednesday for
the launch. ``And I think it's going to reenergize the space
program. When we get to the point where he's back and talking about
it with people and doing interviews about his experience, it will
continue to energize the discussion. And that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Glenn and the rest of the crew has engaged in a mix
of fine-tuning and relaxation. Tuesday night they had a barbecue at
a beach house with family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have fabulous cooks there,'' said Lyn Glenn, John Glenn's
daughter. ``We had barbecued chicken, and barbecued beef, and links
and salad, and mixed fruit. One of the cooks out there had brought
in these huge apples and they tasted like they had been covered in
a Heath bar. And I asked where they were from because we wanted to
get more because they were so good. They're from Ohio. Mother wants
to track down where these are from because they were so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving from the training facility in Houston on Monday,
the Discovery crew has spent much of its time with family. For the
Glenns, the time has been valuable because despite John Glenn's
enthusiasm, his wife and children were not thrilled with the
prospect of watching him test the limits of his own aged body with
nine days of weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   They have since come around, largely in response to his
resilience in training and the radiating effect of his enthusiasm.
The family attended several of Glenn's training sessions, part of
an intense eight-month program in which his mind and body were
strained to capacity. Between learning the shuttles many systems,
and learning the multitude of experiments aboard, Glenn spent more
than 500 hours preparing for space flight. He admitted to being a
bit sore from time to time, and wishing he'd taken up flexibility
training earlier in his life, but otherwise Glenn was invigorated
by the arduous work.
</P>
<P>
   But the heavy lifting ended with the arrrival of launch week,
and Lyn Glenn said her parents have been together every day this
week. She said her mother, Annie, has lately become more
comfortable with the events to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is really good...'' Lyn said, ``...where we're staying, we
can look across at where the pad is, and (Tuesday) morning when I
got up and came out, Mom was just standing out on the balcony and
looking at the launch site. We can see it off in the distance.''
</P>
<P>
   But today will be a day given to nerves with the liftoff,
something Annie Glenn called ``the scary part.'' Even
professionals, such as Discovery Commander Curt Brown, would rather
not have to ride a rocket to get into space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blasting off is not a good term I like to use. We launch,''
Brown said. ``But it is basically a blast off, and that's very
unforgiving. It's very aggressive and there should be a better
way.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first minute and thirty seconds, while the solid-fueled
rockets drive the shuttle up, computers do all the steering and the
crew has no control. ``The ascent is what you imagine,'' said
Brown, who will make his fifth shuttle flight with Discovery.
``It's some serious stuff happening at the other end of the vehicle
and you're accelerating. It's stressful, the environment, just
because of what you're doing...''
</P>
<P>
   But it's worth remembering that this is not simply something
Glenn wanted to do despite the stresses, it's more than that. He
actually invented this day that will surrender itself to the eyes
of world. Maybe not directly with the media carnival erected around
it, and the postcard-perfect weather, or the press conference and
reception the three surviving Mercury astronauts held Wednesday
night, but it was Glenn's own idea to study the elderly in space
right now, and his relentless determination that found a feasible
plan to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was just 50, his first flight then a decade behind him,
when he came to grips with the reality that he'd never fly in space
again. America had gone to the moon, Skylab was soon to be
launched, and there seemed no logical way for a Columbus business
executive and soon-to-be U.S. Senator to rejoin the astronaut corps
after leaving in frustration because he never got another flight
back in the early '60s.
</P>
<P>
   It was Glenn's own itching curiosity that turned the fates
around. Many years later, when he noticed that lengthy stays in
weightlessness caused the same debilitating effects as growing old,
he sketched out an idea on a legal pad to send an aged man into
space to see what would happen.
</P>
<P>
   He brought the proposal to NASA, then he lined up the National
Institutes of Health and the National Institute on Aging to hold
the academic conferences necessary to get the project
peer-reviewed. They talked about the way muscles wither, bones turn
brittle, immune systems weaken, and sleep is disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What NIA and NASA want to try and find out is if...'' Glenn
said earlier this month, ``Am I immune to some of the things that
happen to them because I've already had that happen on earth? What
will be my recovery rates? Any different? If so, why? What they're
trying to do is determine within the body what turns these systems
on and off.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists had noticed all these parallels, too. They just
hadn't thought of sending an elderly man into space. So, of course,
they surely hadn't thought of sending Glenn, which created its own
hurdle. Critics, though they were few, seized upon the simple truth
that this flight would not be happening if Glenn were not the test
subject, and argued that it was a Senator's priviledge or a blatant
play for the nostalgic.
</P>
<P>
   Few thought he shouldn't go; they just called his science
experiments a fig leaf to permit NASA a public relations coup while
giving Glenn, a stalwart supporter of the agency, the second space
ride he never got. But NASA's Administrator diffused some of that
by admitting that science wasn't the sole purpose for sending Glenn
into space. ``I feel that this nation owes Sen. Glenn his second
flight,'' NASA chief Dan Goldin said. ``Science is one aspect,
giving him his second flight is the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn just had to prove a need for the first aspect to create a
day for the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was him! He did it,'' Goldin said. ``He went out and did
it.''

BRITISH COURT BACKS PINOCHET'S BID TO AVOID CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHILE-PINOCHET-REACT) 
(bl) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 C.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ England's High Court on Wednesday ruled in favor of
Gen. Augusto Pinochet's claim against his arrest here and possible
extradition to Spain on charges of murder, kidnapping and torture.
But the justices ordered him detained pending appeals, which are
expected next week.
</P>
<P>
   The court held that the 82-year-old former Chilean president was
immune from arrest because he was head of state at the time the
crimes cited were committed. ``The applicant is entitled to
immunity as a former sovereign from criminal and civil process in
the English courts,'' said Lord Chief Justice Bingham.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's supporters viewed Wednesday's decision as a
significant victory in his battle to escape charges and return to
Chile, and his opponents reacted to the verdict with tears and
expressions of dismay and condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet has been under police guard in a London hospital, where
he is recovering from back surgery, since Oct. 16 on an extradition
request from a Spanish judge who wants him to try him for the
deaths and torture of Spanish citizens during the years he ruled
Chile. ``The Chilean government is very happy and satisfied that
the British High Court has recognized Senator Pinochet's
immunity,'' Deputy Foreign Minister Mariano Fernandez said at
Chile's embassy in London.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, the military ruler of Chile from 1973 to 1990 and
commander in chief of its army until earlier this year, is a
senator for life.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International issued a statement saying, ``The High
Court has made England a safe haven for dictators and former
dictators acting in their official capacity as heads of state,
undermining the absolute nature of the prohibition against torture
in international law.'' The organization's director, Helen Bamber,
said, ``Does this mean that men like Saddam Hussein and Slobodan
Milosevic are safe to swan around the globe in the knowledge that
legally they are untouchable ?''
</P>
<P>
   Crown prosecutors said they would file an appeal by the close of
business Monday. It will most likely be heard by a panel of senior
judges, known as law lords, of the House of Lords, and a spokesman
there promised swift action, because it involves somebody's
personal liberty, a judicial official in the House of Lords told
Reuters. ``We can hear that very quickly.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the ruling, Lord Bingham said, ``It is of course a matter for
acute public concern that those who abuse sovereign power to commit
crimes against humanity should not escape trial and appropriate
punishment.'' But he said that not even the charter establishing
the International War Crimes Tribunal at Nuremberg in 1945
invalidated the principle ``that one sovereign state will not
impugn another in relation to its sovereign acts.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was quashing the arrest warrants under which Pinochet
had been held for the last 12 days, but ``staying'' the order
pending appeal.
</P>
<P>
   During the two days of hearings before the High Court, lawyers
for the Crown Prosecution Service argued that the general was
involved in the deaths of ``at least 4,000 people'' and had sent
agents to Spain to ``seek out and kill'' political opponents. His
lawyers countered that if the extradition bid succeeded, Queen
Elizabeth II could theoretically be arrested abroad to face trial
for alleged crimes by Britain.
</P>
<P>
   A bail hearing has been scheduled for Friday that could allow
Pinochet to move out of the clinic to another location in London.
</P>
<P>
   Since the general's arrest, Chilean exiles around Europe have
moved to bring additional murder and rights charges against him.
But Wednesday the attorney general's office in London said it was
turning down applications for trials that came from two lawyers
representing alleged victims of the dictator's regime. The action
effectively bars any prosecution of Pinochet in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   French, Swedish and Swiss judicial authorities have said in
recent days that they intend to join Spain in pressing for Gen.
Pinochet's extradition, but there was no word in London on the
status of those petitions or any reaction from British judicial
officials. Geneva's public prosecutor, Bernard Bertossa, said
Wednesday night that he was ``shocked'' by the British ruling and
added, ``If we want to fight sincerely against genocidal behavior,
one cannot invoke the immunity of heads of state.'' Under those
terms, he contended, ``Hitler would get immunity.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from Judge Baltasar Garzon, the
Spanish investigating magistrate who is looking into atrocities
committed during Latin America's ``dirty wars'' of the 1970s and
1980s and who first obtained Pinochet's arrest in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The judge is trying to establish an important legal precedent,
and in the past decade a growing body of international law has made
it somewhat easier to reach across borders to try people accused of
``crimes against humanity.'' There is a war crimes tribunal in The
Hague especially for the former Yugoslavia. And a number of
countries have established laws giving them jurisdiction to
prosecute war criminals. These include Germany, Canada, Sweden, the
Netherlands and Spain. Some countries have used such laws for
crimes committed in Rwanda and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The British have said from the outset said the matter was one
for the judiciary and not the government, and Prime Minister Tony
Blair on Wednesday faced down criticism from opposition
Conservatives during question time in the House of Commons. ``The
judicial process has not involved the government issuing warrants
for arrest,'' he said. ``That is done by the Spanish authorities
through Interpol to the British magistrates, who then take it from
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher protested the
arrest and said Britain should let Pinochet return to Chile.
Wednesday, Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative home affairs
spokesman, told the Commons that ``The government is entirely
responsible for the mess it has created. The Lord Chief Justice of
England has now found that the government did not even know the
meaning of diplomatic immunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon de Miguel, Spain's secretary of state for foreign affairs,
told reporters at the parliament building in Madrid that his
government would honor the ruling. It was one, he said, ``that was
made by the British judges. The government has profound respect for
the institutions and we have nothing more to say.''
</P>
<P>
   There were scuffles outside the London Clinic when, shortly
after the decision, the general's wife, Lucia, his two daughters, a
son and a group of right-wing Chilean legislators arrived to visit.
Since the arrest, the street outside the building has often been
filled with demonstrators, many of them Chilean exiles who say that
relatives and friends died because of government oppression during
the Pinochet years.
</P>
<P>
   A self-declared Anglophile who supported the British in their
1982 war against Argentina in the Falkland Islands, Pinochet has
made a number of visits to Britain in recent years without
incident. He arrived this time Sept. 21 and was treated as a VIP by
the Foreign Office.
</P>
<P>
   He had drinks with Baroness Thatcher at her Belgravia home Oct.
5 and gave a long interview to The New Yorker magazine in which he
talked of his love of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet had suffered back pains during the `17-hour flight from
Santiago and a doctor he consulted recommended urgent surgery. He
had the operation Oct. 9. A Chilean air force ambulance plane is at
the ready at a Royal Air Force base in Oxfordshire to transport
Pinochet home.

<P>
   Joyce Bivens remembers her husband's battle with Alzheimer's as
her ``valley experience.''
</P>
<P>
   It began in 1987 with seemingly small things, like his
forgetting where he was going, and didn't end until January when
the Rev. Roy W. Bivens Sr. died in a local nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd always play (the disease) off with his quick wit,'' she
said. ``As it progressed, though, I knew something was dreadfully
wrong, because the bills began doubling up and he began making
mistakes in the pulpit, mixing biblical characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior is typical of people stricken with Alzheimer's,
the most common form of dementia. But because the debilitating
disease is still a mystery, particularly to the African-American
community, many do not recognize it. And when they do, because of
the stigma associated with the disease, they often do not seek
help.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to change that, the Alzheimer's Association
recently embarked on a campaign to increase awareness about the
disease in the black community.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a former case manager for senior citizen services, I knew
there were families experiencing dementia, but who were not making
the connection,'' said Jim Walters, the association's family
assistance coordinator in Tarrant County.
</P>
<P>
   In September, with funding from the Area Agency on Aging, the
association held its first conference to raise awareness in the
African-American communities, specifically Stop 6 and Polytechnic
Heights. Additional workshops for caregivers are being planned for
early next year. The agency also plans to start a support group at
Sweet Home Baptist Church in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study published recently by ``The Journal of the
American Medical Association,'' African-Americans and Hispanics are
at greater risk of contracting Alzheimer's disease than Anglos. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. A. Ray Lewis, a local family practice physician and
geriatrics fellow at the University of North Texas Health Science
Center in Fort Worth, said that the tremendous effect on families
and the general well-being of patients need to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The needs are really insidious,'' he said. ``It's like all the
other needs related to medical access in the black community.''
</P>
<P>
   Because bizarre behavior is the cornerstone of Alzheimer's,
Lewis said, many in the black community are afraid of confiding
their concern for fear of being misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you try to share stuff with family, people really aren't
able to accept it,'' said Bivens. ``I think historically and
traditionally, African-Americans have not discussed certain things
outside the confines of the home, and so they are not open for the
help that is available. That's not only true with Alzheimer's; it's
also true with cancer, it's true with everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bivens said that not seeking help only adds to the family
pressures. Care-givers often make the mistake of treating patients
as children or try to keep them at home past the point when the
family can care for them.
</P>
<P>
   As Bivens' husband deteriorated, it was no longer possible to
leave him alone. He needed 24-hour supervision. Bivens finally had
to make the tough decision to put her husband in a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask yourself, what does the patient need and can
you provide it,'' she said. ``If the answer is no, you're doing
them an injustice by selfishly keeping them at home. And just
because they are not under the same roof doesn't mean you're not
caring for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing you can do is to be godly enough to pray about
your situation and be intelligent enough to get the resources that
are available.''
</P>
<P>
   RESOURCES:
</P>
<P>
   The Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral (ADEAR) Center,
sponsored by the federal government's National Institute on Aging,
has free brochures covering a variety of topics ranging from risk
factors to new treatment options. ADEAR also provides referrals to
research facilities conducting clinical trials.

SOME CHILEANS LAUD BRITISH DECISION, BUT OTHERS VOW TO FIGHT IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (with CHILE-PINOCHET) 
(bl) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ The Chilean government applauded the ruling
Wednesday by the High Court in London that Chile's former dictator,
retired Gen. Augusto Pinochet, is protected by diplomatic immunity.
But Chilean human-rights activists promised to press on with their
efforts to force him to stand trial in Spain or some other European
country on genocide charges.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Raul Troncoso appeared on national television
to say that the government now hoped for a ``quick resolution to
this case.'' He asked Chileans to keep calm, warning that
``demonstrations will only complicate the legal process.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, about 30 members of the Group of the Families of
the Detained and Disappeared gathered in downtown Santiago to
demonstrate their disappointment as soon as the ruling was
announced. They sang protest songs and waved posters with
photographs of family members who have been missing since the
mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Viviana Diaz, leader of the group, told reporters that the court
decision that Pinochet has diplomatic immunity was unacceptable
because ``he was a dictator who committed so many crimes against
humanity that he cannot enjoy that right.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Communist Party said it was also planning to
mobilize a protest demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   But Pinochet's supporters expressed relief and satisfaction, and
promised celebratory marches of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased,'' said Hernan Guillos, vice president of the
Pinochet Foundation, an organization that seeks to promote the
former dictator's image. ``The events that have put Chile through
so much anguish are about to end.''
</P>
<P>
   The British court's ruling essentially followed the arguments
made by President Eduardo Frei, who has said that Pinochet could
not be arrested and extradited because he carried a diplomatic
passport as a senator for life. Pinochet became an unelected member
of the Senate seven months ago when he stepped down as commander in
chief of the Chilean armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Chilean diplomats have pressed for the general's
release for health reasons, as he is reportedly making a slow
recovery from back surgery and is suffering from a variety of
infections as well as diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's arrest 13 days ago for possible extradition to Spain
has set off almost daily demonstrations, scattered violence and
more than 150 arrests. Over the weekend leftist and rightist
parties sponsored demonstrations that each attracted more than
20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials and political analysts have warned that a
prolonged controversy over Pinochet's arrest _ or even his death
while in custody _ could lead to serious violence and prolong the
legacy of polarized politics born of 17 years of military
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I don't want is General Pinochet to become a martyr of
the right and a cause for division for 25 more years,'' said
Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza.

THE DOW BREAKS ITS FALL AS MOST AVERAGES ADVANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices resumed their advance Wednesday in a
relatively subdued session as investors appraised Brazil's fiscal
package and awaited key government reports on U.S. wage growth and
output.
</P>
<P>
   Most averages posted gains, though the Dow Jones industrial
average retained only 5.93 points of what at one time was a gain of
nearly 67 points. It did, however, break a run of three straight
declines, closing at 8,371.97. The Nasdaq composite index had the
day's best gain, rising 19.72 points, or 1.15 percent, to 1,737.35,
as its technology stocks gathered strength in the afternoon. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.75 points, or two-tenths
of a percent, to 1,068.09.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is having to deal with some cross-currents,'' said
John Shaughnessy, chief strategist at Advest Group. He said that
Brazil, which announced an austerity plan, seemed to be ``getting
its act together'' but that declining consumer confidence in the
United States was a growing concern.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, most retail and department store shares rebounded,
with Wal-Mart Stores rising 1 9/16, to 64 13/16, reversing the bulk
of its loss on Tuesday when the Conference Board said consumer
confidence slipped in October for the fourth month in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Most bank and brokerage stocks also moved higher, paced by J.P.
Morgan, up 1{, to 91[, and Charles Schwab, up 1~, to 44 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks, which has had a
run-up of nearly 20 percent in the last couple of weeks, made a
strong comeback in the afternoon but still could not eke out a
gain. It fell three-hundredths of a percent, with 890 components up
and 874 down.
</P>
<P>
   Clare Zempel, chief strategist at Robert Baird in Milwaukee, was
among those regarding the general market advance of recent weeks as
more likely to be a building block than a bear-market trap for the
unwary. He pointed to the decline in short-term interest rates in
the United States and signs of economic stability in the Far East
that he said ``strongly suggest that the worst'' of this year's
stock decline is past.
</P>
<P>
   As for Brazil, Zempel said it would probably ``muddle through.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's Bovespa stock index retreated six-tenths of a percent
Wednesday as investors evaluated its plan to cut its $60 billion
budget deficit, the centerpiece of an effort to restore its credit
and avoid devaluing its currency, the real.
</P>
<P>
   Other overseas markets were mostly lower as well, with main
stock indexes down 2.53 percent in Frankfurt, 1.61 percent in
Paris, seven-tenths of a percent in London and 2.2 percent in
Tokyo. Stocks rose 1.51 percent in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Although foreign economic and financial turmoil has in the last
15 months supplanted Washington's economic reports as the dominant
market influence, the government's first estimate of gross domestic
product for the third quarter, to be announced tomorrow, will be
closely watched for signs that the economy's slowdown might be
accelerating, said Rosanne Cahn, equity economist at Credit Suisse
First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts already expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest
rates again, perhaps as early as mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   A second focal point will be the Labor Department's release
Thursday of the employment cost index, a quarterly measure of wage
pressure that, like the figures on gross domestic product, has
implications for corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Rising technology stocks Wednesday included Sun Microsystems, up
3 1/16, to 56 11/16; Dell Computer and Cisco Systems, each up 2[,
to 64| and 62~, respectively; and Sun Microsystems, up 3 1/16, to
56 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks were mixed, with Mobil down } after reporting a 45
percent earnings decline, a bit less than expected. Drugs were
mostly higher, paced by Warner-Lambert, up 2 13/16, and
Schering-Plough, up 1~, to 102[.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont was the Dow's biggest loser, slumping 2 11/16, to 56~,
apparently reflecting a negative discussion of the company's
prospects in The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered
advancing ones by 1,535 to 1,456, with new highs exceeding new lows
for the second consecutive session, 30 to 23. Volume was a moderate
677.59 million shares traded. &QL;

RAHAL'S `LAST RIDE' WORTHY OF TRIP TO VICTORY LANE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The final 250 laps of Bobby Rahal's ``Last Ride'' through the
CART series will unwind at the California Speedway on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever your particular driver allegiance, feel free to
park it for a few hours and openly root for one of the sport's
gentlemen. We hesitate to use the term ``elder statesman,'' only
because at age 45, Rahal hardly is preparing to slide into a life
of full-fat retirement.
</P>
<P>
   He will remain thoroughly involved in the Championship Auto
Racing Teams FedEx Series as owner of the cars to be driven by
Bryan Herta and Max Papis.
</P>
<P>
   But Rahal will conclude a distinguished 17-year driving career
in the Marlboro 500 on the 2-mile superspeedway in Fontana, Calif.
The race will be the CART-record 264th career start (and 265th
overall) for Rahal, who made his Championship Car debut with
Truesports Racing at Phoenix International Raceway in 1982. The
perfect script this weekend would see Rahal win the thing, complete
with postrace cigar.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it. I haven't given up yet,'' said Rahal, whose 24
victories are fourth on CART's all-time list. ``I still have one
shot. And in a 500-mile race, I will tell you, anything can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahal has not won a race since 1992. So more than likely, he
will end the day content that as a three-time champion and the only
owner/driver in the series, he has made a difference to the world
of domestic open-wheel racing. That point has been driven home this
season by CART fans all along the 19-race tour. The fans turned out
en masse at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course in Lexington, Ohio, in
early August to bid farewell to their native son and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess because it was Mid-Ohio, you kind of sort of expected
it,'' said Rahal, of New Albany, Ohio, and a prominent business and
civic leader state-wide. ``I think the thing that really hit me
this year, frankly, was Milwaukee after qualifying, when I got a
standing ovation. There were maybe 3,000 or 4,000 people there on a
Saturday, so it's not that many people. But it took me totally
aback. I just never expected that whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the thing that has hit me is the fact that you really
feel like you connected with people after all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of Rahal's championships probably has been lost by
the fact that the last was registered in 1992. They were preceded
by back-to-back titles in 1986 and 1987. Along with Rick Mears _ a
four-time winner of the Indianapolis 500 when it really was the
world's most prestigious auto race _ Rahal is the only other CART
driver to have won three series championships.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Rahal has amassed 18 poles _ fifth all-time _ on
the series' various oval, permanent road-course and street circuit
layouts. He also has finished in the top five 119 times, or 45
percent of his starts, and in the top 10 in 177 events, or 67
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Your average 45-year-old (and older) NASCAR Winston Cup driver
would kill for those competitive stats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd seen other people do the other _ overstay their welcome,''
said Rahal, who is 10th in series points this year as driver of the
No. 7 Miller Lite Reynard/Ford. ``I don't want people to remember
me, you know, going through the motions. And that we had, I guess,
the good judgment to know when to say when.''
</P>
<P>
   The politics surrounding the split between CART and the rival
Pep Boys Indy Racing League have kept Rahal and his cohorts out of
the Indianapolis Motor Speedway since 1996. But two of the moments
that have defined Rahal's career are tied to the Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   Recall the rain-plagued 1986 race, won by Rahal a week after
originally scheduled. What made it special was the fact that Rahal
drove to his first Indy 500 victory with the knowledge that his
team owner and mentor, Jim Trueman, was dying of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won Indy for Jim,'' Rahal said. ``We knew he wasn't going
to be at the Indy 500 next year, and we'd better get with the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``To realize someone else's dream was something truly special,
not just from my part but everybody on the team. It's a little
unreal, even to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   And recall the final day of qualifications at the Speedway in
May 1993, when former champion Rahal failed to make the big race.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the 77th Indy 500, I can remember walking
toward the main gates of the Speedway. At the side of one of the
tunnels was a cut-out figure of Rahal dressed in his racing suit,
proudly holding his helmet and smiling into space.
</P>
<P>
   And draped around his shoulders was a makeshift cardboard sign
that read, quite ironically, ``Need tickets.''
THE BUZZ NHRA
</P>
<P>
   Pro Stock driver Bruce Allen and the Arlington-based
Reher-Morrison Racing Engines team quietly are completing the 1998
season with heavy hearts. Arlington's Buddy Morrison, a founder of
the famed high-performance company with friend and partner David
Reher, has suffered a setback in his battle against cancer. ``Buddy
is seriously ill and fighting a hard battle,'' said Reher, who
added that Morrison's condition has been deteriorating since June.
At that time, Morrison was heading up Reher-Morrison's involvement
in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series with driver David Starr. ``The
Friday before the truck race at Texas Motor Speedway, the doctors
told him he was good,'' said Reher, who has known Morrison for 30
years. ``He came in and told us, `You're going to have to put up
with me a while longer.' On the Monday after that race, his doctor
told him he had to see him. And it was like the end of your world.
We were sitting in his office and having a big time and it wasn't a
few weeks later he can't even walk anymore.'' Reher said Morrison
recently returned home from the hospital to be with his wife,
Susan, and friends. ``That's something we wanted to happen very
bad,'' Reher said. ``We're praying for things to get better, for
him to have a little quality time.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Reher-Morrison has been a star-crossed operation. Driver Lee
Shepherd, a native of Fort Worth, won 26 national events and four
consecutive NHRA Pro Stock world championships as a partner with
Reher-Morrison between 1981-84. But Shepherd, whose other specialty
was cylinder head design, was killed during a crash while testing
at Ardmore, Okla., in March 1985. ...
</P>
<P>
   For the first and only time since 1987, Pro Stock Motorcycles
have been scheduled to compete at the Texas Motorplex in Ennis next
year. In addition to Top Fuel, Funny Car and Pro Stock, the Bikes
have been booked for the third annual Castrol Nationals April
22-25. ``That's a class we get tons of calls on around the event _
`Why don't you run Pro Stock Bikes?' '' said Elon Werner, the
Motorplex's director of media services. ``That class, because of
the personalities _ Angelle Seeling, Matt Hines, Dave Schultz _
will add to our presentation.'' And the Pro Stock Trucks that
debuted during the 13th annual Revell Nationals last weekend have
been scheduled to return next Oct. 21-24. ...
</P>
<P>
   Even though he is the reigning NHRA Top Fuel champion, and the
current points leader, some casual fans still have trouble
pronouncing Gary Scelzi's last name. The ``c'' is silent, and it's
pronounced ``sell-zee.'' But Gary's good friends in the NHRA's
media relations department have simplified matters. They refer to
the affable Californian as ``Gary Sleazy.'' And he likes it.
NASCAR
</P>
<P>
   Had Rusty Wallace not won the DuraLube/Kmart 500 at Phoenix
International Raceway Sunday, his winless streak would have hit 60
consecutive races. Wallace is well aware that is just the kind of
round number that gets the vultures in the media circling the
garage area, asking that at age 42, if he still can get it done.
``It's just something that aggravates the hell out of you,'' said
Wallace, the 1989 Cup champion and driver of the No. 2 Miller Lite
Ford Taurus. ``Dale Earnhardt went through a lot of that, I've gone
through it. \RBill\S Elliott's gone through it, Ricky Rudd _ all
the guys that are over 40 years old. They put a bull's eye on our
head and they target us when we're down and having a problem. I've
led a ton of laps this year. I've had four poles and a ton of
top-five finishes. It's enough to really get you aggravated, but
usually those questions come from people that are under-educated
about our sport and really don't understand it.'' And you know who
you are. ...
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett's gallstone condition apparently will not prevent
him from competing in the final two Winston Cup events of the
season. Jarrett, who has a tenuous 36-point lead over fourth-place
Wallace in the standings, may be discharged from John C. Lincoln
Hospital in North Mountain, Phoenix, today. Jarrett plans to
attempt to qualify and start the ACDelco 400 at North Carolina
Speedway this weekend. Jarrett exited the No. 88 Quality Care/Ford
Credit Taurus after 126 laps at PIR. Hut Stricklin will be at The
Rock as Jarrett's relief driver. Dr. James Magary said surgery to

 &HT;    Ex-astronaut Bean to help call space shot
 &HT;    By J. Matthew Aldag
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When 77-year-old John Glenn rockets into space again,
the voice of fellow man of the stars Alan Bean will follow him.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the 1969 Apollo 12 lunar mission, Bean will join
Walter Cronkite to do color commentary for CNN's coverage of the
space shuttle Discovery's mission (launch time is 2 p.m. today).
</P>
<P>
   ``(Glenn's mission) is one of the best things NASA has done in
the last 10 or 15 years. It is going to change attitudes,'' says
Bean. The former astronaut knows space travel is going to become
much more common in the near future and he thinks the experience
should be offered more often to people who aren't astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should send Tom Hanks next,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Once a Navy test pilot and commander of the Skylab space
station, Bean has a unique perspective on NASA's space program:
that of an artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like painting just as much as I did flying. It makes me feel
just as good,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While a test pilot in 1962, Bean started taking night classes at
a Maryland art school. His interest flourished along with his skill
until he retired from the space program in 1981 to devote his time
to painting and motivational public speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bean re-creates on canvas the images he saw 29 years ago and
over 200,000 miles away. The images are more real that one would
expect: Bean sometimes mixes moon dust into his paints.
</P>
<P>
   This perspective can be seen in Bean's recently released book,
``Apollo: An Eyewitness Account by Astronaut/Explorer
Artist/Moonwalker Alan Bean'' (1998, Greenwich Workshop Press,
$45). Illustrated with 17 years of Bean's paintings, the book
recounts his experiences on the moon and describes his astronaut
life.
</P>
<P>
   Bean used models and his memories to help him re-create scenes
from the lunar mission. He also was able to paint images of things
that never happened. On the book's cover is a picture of three
astronauts on the moon side by side: Pete Conrad on the left, Bean
on the right and in the middle Dick Gordon, who never got to walk
on the lunar surface during the mission. Bean titled this work
``The Fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bean, 66, lives in Houston with his wife, Lesley, and eight
dogs, spending most of his time painting.
</P>
<P>
   His pieces have sold for $20,000 to $100,000. A 40-foot mural he
painted spans a wall at the Johnson Space Center in Houston and he
was commissioned to paint a mural for the Astronaut Hall of Fame in
Titusville, Fla.

U.S. TO PRESS NORTH KOREA FOR ACCESS TO SUSPICIOUS NEW COMPLEX 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ North Korea has agreed to receive a U.S. delegation
next month to discuss American concerns about the construction of a
vast underground complex that is widely feared to house a nuclear
weapons program, the State Department said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation, led by Charles Kartman, will press for access to
the site, which American intelligence agencies believe could be the
centerpiece of an effort to revive a frozen nuclear arms program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made clear to the North Koreans that any attempt by
North Korea to pursue a nuclear weapons development program would
be unacceptable,'' the State Department spokesman, James Rubin,
said. The talks in Pyongyang, the capital, he added, ``are aimed at
completely satisfying U.S. concerns about the suspect
construction.''
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence agencies fear that building the complex
could be an effort to break out of a four-year-old pact in which
North Korea pledged to give up its nuclear-weapons program in
exchange for billions of dollars in aid from the United States,
South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have said spy satellites have recently
photographed thousands of North Koreans around the huge site 25
miles northeast of Yongbyon, the nuclear center where North Korea
was believed to have stockpiled enough plutonium before the 1994
accords to build six or more bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have not explained exactly why the government is
building the complex, North Korean officials have denied that it
would be used to develop nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The official North Korean press agency said last week that the
government was building ``civilian underground structures on which
any `doubt' cannot be cast'' and suggested that American officials
would be allowed to inspect the complex if they pressed for access.
``If the U.S. side persists in inspecting our underground
structures,'' the press agency said, ``we can show it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the United States had received no formal assurances
that Kartman, the American special envoy for Korean nuclear issues,
and his delegation would be allowed to inspect the site on the
trip, which is to begin on Nov. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are beginning a discussion with them in which we will
demand access,'' Rubin said. ``The history of the U.S.-North Korea
discussions involves usually a lengthy discussion process before
there is agreement to our requirements. So we are not expecting to
walk in one day and be able to have access the next.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip was announced as signs grow about a relative warming of
relations between the United States and North Korea.
Representatives of the United States, China and the two Koreas met
recently in Geneva and agreed to steps to reduce tension on the
Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   In September the United States pledged to provide an additional
300,000 tons of grain to North Korea, which has for years been
crippled by severe food shortages.
</P>
<P>
   In addition the White House disclosed that the United States
would provide more heavy fuel oil promised to North Korea under the
1994 agreement, despite concerns that North Korea may intend to
revive its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have said the activity near Yongbyon may not
yet have technically violated the accord, because there is no
evidence that North Korea has begun pouring cement for a new
reactor or a reprocessing plant to convert nuclear waste to
bomb-grade plutonium.

INFORMATION CAMPAIGN TARGETS BLACK COMMUNITY

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joyce Bivens remembers her husband's battle with Alzheimer's as
her ``valley experience.''
</P>
<P>
   It began in 1987 with seemingly small things, like his
forgetting where he was going, and didn't end until January when
the Rev. Roy W. Bivens Sr. died in a local nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd always play (the disease) off with his quick wit,'' she
said. ``As it progressed, though, I knew something was dreadfully
wrong, because the bills began doubling up and he began making
mistakes in the pulpit, mixing biblical characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior is typical of people stricken with Alzheimer's,
the most common form of dementia. But because the debilitating
disease is still a mystery, particularly to the African-American
community, many do not recognize it. And when they do, because of
the stigma associated with the disease, they often do not seek
help.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to change that, the Alzheimer's Association
recently embarked on a campaign to increase awareness about the
disease in the black community.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a former case manager for senior citizen services, I knew
there were families experiencing dementia, but who were not making
the connection,'' said Jim Walters, the association's family
assistance coordinator in Tarrant County.
</P>
<P>
   In September, with funding from the Area Agency on Aging, the
association held its first conference to raise awareness in the
African-American communities, specifically Stop 6 and Polytechnic
Heights. Additional workshops for caregivers are being planned for
early next year. The agency also plans to start a support group at
Sweet Home Baptist Church in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study published recently by ``The Journal of the
American Medical Association,'' African-Americans and Hispanics are
at greater risk of contracting Alzheimer's disease than Anglos. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. A. Ray Lewis, a local family practice physician and
geriatrics fellow at the University of North Texas Health Science
Center in Fort Worth, said that the tremendous effect on families
and the general well-being of patients need to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The needs are really insidious,'' he said. ``It's like all the
other needs related to medical access in the black community.''
</P>
<P>
   Because bizarre behavior is the cornerstone of Alzheimer's,
Lewis said, many in the black community are afraid of confiding
their concern for fear of being misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you try to share stuff with family, people really aren't
able to accept it,'' said Bivens. ``I think historically and
traditionally, African-Americans have not discussed certain things
outside the confines of the home, and so they are not open for the
help that is available. That's not only true with Alzheimer's; it's
also true with cancer, it's true with everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bivens said that not seeking help only adds to the family
pressures. Care-givers often make the mistake of treating patients
as children or try to keep them at home past the point when the
family can care for them.
</P>
<P>
   As Bivens' husband deteriorated, it was no longer possible to
leave him alone. He needed 24-hour supervision. Bivens finally had
to make the tough decision to put her husband in a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask yourself, what does the patient need and can
you provide it,'' she said. ``If the answer is no, you're doing
them an injustice by selfishly keeping them at home. And just
because they are not under the same roof doesn't mean you're not
caring for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing you can do is to be godly enough to pray about
your situation and be intelligent enough to get the resources that
are available.''
</P>
<P>
   RESOURCES:

   The Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral (ADEAR) Center,
sponsored by the federal government's National Institute on Aging,

factors to new treatment options. ADEAR also provides referrals to

SPORTS COLUMN: ONE IDOL TALKS ABOUT HIS IDOL  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   He usually walks with a cane now, but rather than be on his feet
for too long, he'll sit in a wheelchair. Ted Williams is 80 years
old, somewhat affected by the stroke he had in 1994, but he still
glows as a baseball idol.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, the Ted Williams Tunnel is under the harbor. In and
around Fenway Park, they talk about him as if he were still hitting
.406 in 1941, still crashing home runs over the bullpen into the
right-center-field bleachers, still loping after fly balls as a
left fielder. To the Red Sox loyalists, Teddy Ballgame is still
their idol.
</P>
<P>
   But when he was asked about John Glenn, his voice boomed as it
always has, as if through a public-address system. ``John Glenn,''
he said, referring to the 77-year-old retiring senator from Ohio,
who will be launched Thursday in the space shuttle Discovery, ``is
my idol in life right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship goes back more than 40 years to when they
were Marine pilots during the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got there, I didn't know anybody so I went to the
pilots' room just to get acquainted,'' Williams was saying last
Friday during his visit to the opening of the Yogi Berra Museum in
Little Falls, N.J. ``I looked over to the other end of the room and
I saw two Marine majors there. I didn't know who they were, but
they looked good to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``One was John Glenn. The other one, I've forgotten his name,
but he became a major general.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who had been a Marine pilot during World War II, was
hitting .400 after six games with the Red Sox in 1952 when he was
recalled to active duty as a captain during the Korean conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm praying for a quick truce,'' he joked at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, then 33, would serve a 17-month hitch at a salary of
$7,000 a year. In Korea he was attached to Marine Air Group 33 for
aerial reconnaissance. Glenn was the squadron commander.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flew wing with John two or three times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Williams' 39 missions was with Glenn on what the pilots
called an ``early-early,'' taking off in the darkness before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were in the air,'' he said, ``and going to the target.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams could see Glenn peering through the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's looking for anything he can see _ a light, a tunnel, a
bridge,'' he said. ``We had two 250-pound bombs, but now I could
see a lot of stuff coming up at us. I thought, `What am I doing up
here!' We dropped our bombs and hurried back to our base. I asked
him later, `Did you see all that stuff coming up at us?' But he
didn't seem to think it was anything startling.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many people knew about their relationship until Glenn,
appearing at a 1988 dinner in Boston for Williams' longtime
charity, the Jimmy Fund, described his wingman's flaming landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the F-9 got hit and caught on fire,'' Glenn told the
audience that night, ``the tail would blow off almost every time.
So the standard orders were that if you had a fire in the back of
the plane, you were were to eject immediately. Ted was trailing
smoke and fire. People were yelling at him over the radio, `Get
out!' But his radio was out and he couldn't see all this going on
behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hawkins, a young lieutenant from Pennsylvania, pulled his
jet alongside Williams' jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hawkins saved my life; he got me back to the base,'' Williams
has often said. ``I came barreling in at a little more than 200
miles an hour, fighting the stick all the way. No dive brakes,
flaps, nothing to slow up the plane. Then I heard a hollow whoomph
behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   When the plane finally skidded to a flaming stop, Williams
jumped out and ran. Moments later, his jet exploded.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, Williams got a letter from Glenn, then one of the
original seven Mercury astronauts. And ever since they have talked
to each other every so often.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just too bad,'' Williams, a staunch Republican, once told
him, ``that you're a Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   About a week ago, Glenn, whose space shuttle is scheduled to be
launched Thursday at 2 p.m. at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape
Canaveral, Fla., phoned Williams at the Hall of Fame slugger's
Hernando, Fla., home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard him so excited,'' Ted Williams recalled. ``He
was raving about the crew he's going up with. I'm proud to say that
I know John Glenn.''

WITH WARP SPEED, SPACE TRAVEL (AND TRAVELERS) BECAME ORDINARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The first American in orbit, vaguely worried about
sizzling in space, had slipped into a radio blackout. And in her
classroom on Earth, Sister Mary Karen Kelly asked her
second-graders to summon divine help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the radio on and we were praying that he would survive
the trip,'' Sister Kelly recalled as video images of John Glenn
barreling into space flickered behind her at the John F. Kennedy
Library and Museum in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they lost radio contact, that was nail-biting time and a
time for more intense prayer,'' said Sister Kelly, a Grey Nun of
the Sacred Heart from Philadelphia. ``I remember how relieved and
overjoyed we were. Back then, it was something special. Today,
we're more used to it. We're more sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   The same clock that ticks down to Glenn's scheduled return to
space Thursday measures more distance from an era when derring-do
spacemen were enshrined in the pantheon of genuine American heroes,
and an age in which warp-speed technology has reduced orbital
flight to a routine ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids don't grow up wanting to be astronauts anymore,'' said
professor David Mindell of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
who teaches the history of technology, ``as much as they want to be
Bill Gates.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the prelude to Glenn's blastoff as one of the Shuttle
Discovery's seven crew members has been more about publicity and
nostalgia than the tension and excitement he evoked on Feb. 20,
1962, when he was strapped into the capsule called Friendship 7 and
shot into space.
</P>
<P>
   He was Colonel John H. Glenn Jr. then, the captain of a
relatively crude and untested rocketship for three orbits around
the Earth, an early leg in the United States's come-from-behind
space race victory against its sworn enemy, the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Now Glenn, a 77-year-old Democratic senator from Ohio, is a
passenger on a complex machine in which he plays a decidedly
supporting _ some say superfluous _ role in the latest in a series
of missions to which the American public has long since stopped
paying rapt attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody cares anymore,'' said Peter B. Crabb, a psychology
professor at the University of Pennsylvania, where he studies
technology and the perception of it. ``Space missions have become
so routine that like other technological wonders, nobody thinks
about them or notices them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing sexy about it. These guys go up. They come
back down. It's about business, not space exploration. It's a
bore.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than 90 launches of the space shuttle since 1981, the
ship has lived up to a name connoting easy access in and out of the
upper atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists say the journey from the Orville Wright of space
travel to blastoffs of boredom on Cape Canaveral is an
extraordinary one whose mileposts are a flag on the moon, a
crumbling wall in Berlin, and silicon computer chips that have made
smaller the world Glenn hurtled over while those who watched and
waited held their breath.
</P>
<P>
   The day Glenn forever became a space-suited icon, President
Kennedy's New Frontier was embryonic, John Volpe was in the
governor's office, and Bob Cousy ran the backcourt for the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   New England, still recovering from a northeaster that had dumped
a foot of snow on the region the night before, walked away from its
work-day machines in such numbers on that fateful Tuesday that the
New England Electric System in Boston recorded a marked reduction
in the demand for electric power.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months after the Soviet Union stunned the world in April
1961 by sending Yuri Gagarin into space for one orbit of the globe,
the United States was belatedly back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in a very real sense a heroic moment,'' said Frank
Rigg, curator of the JFK Library and Museum, which opens a new
Glenn exhibit on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was a person who was literally risking his life for a
purpose that was a good purpose and the continuation of the human
story,'' said Rigg. ``It was absolutely terra incognita. People
were simply amazed. Glenn became a hero in the sense that (aviator
Charles) Lindbergh had been.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most perilous moment of Glenn's voyage arrived when
a warning light at Mission Control erroneously indicated a problem
with the capsule's heat shield. Glenn, whose pulse on liftoff was
an imperturbable 110 beats per minute, later wrote that he was
prepared to die for his country in the 3,000-degree heat of
reentry. Although he was never directly told of the heat-shield
scare, Glenn said later he figured out that his life could be in
danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being scared,'' recalled 47-year-old Micala Jensen
of Utah, who this week was reviewing Glenn memorabilia at the JFK
Library this week. ``But once he was back, it was thrilling. We
were catching up with the Russians. We were actually going to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite setbacks and tragedy, the United States did do it,
winning the race to the moon and achieving unquestioned space-age
superiority. Along the way, communism collapsed, the Berlin Wall
fell, the Cold War thawed.
</P>
<P>
   And that, specialists agree, is precisely why Glenn's return to
space now conjures adjectives like poignant and quaint, not
thrilling or urgent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation's dominant narrative used to be its Cold War
struggle,'' said Ralph Whitehead, who teaches journalism at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst. ``But space flights are no
longer part of that saga. They simply don't have the national
significance anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   There will doubtless be few schoolchildren petitioning the
heavens when the shuttle lifts off next week _ a mission commanded
by an astronaut almost no one knows, Curtis Brown Jr. of North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few things that can surprise us anymore,'' Rigg
said. ``There is this sense that so much is possible and that we
can do so much. I'm not sure that's an entirely postive thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the days of the space race, said Steven Johnson, editor of
the on-line magazine Feed, the premium on technology has shifted
from the big and the powerful to the small and the fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of physically doing something _ shooting people up
into outer space and those other kind of mechanical, industrial
feats _ is not as captivating as the stuff that happens on our
computer screens,'' Johnson said. ``Today we talk about speed and
how we can connect to another computer server, not how can I move
my body from one place to another.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Beth Adelson, associate professor of psychology at Rutgers
University: ``We are inundated with amazing events. When you go out
into the sunshine, at first it looks dazzling. But then your eyes
adapt to that level of light and it's no longer dazzling.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Young, MIT's Apollo professor of astronautics, said
it's not surprising there are few sweaty palms on the days the
launch pads light up in Florida. Most college students weren't yet
born when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon in July 1969 as 500
million watched on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expect it to go well. It's no longer seen as
dangerous,'' Young said. ``Students have the sense that the space
program was something that belonged to their fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's why Young, who heads a consortium preparing for a
distant manned mission to Mars, said Glenn's flight next week is
important even if it has more to do with publicity than science.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong with propaganda?'' asked Young. ``We need a
national hero at this point. We need something that says to kids,
`Work hard. Study algebra. Go to space camp because you can be part
of this great adventure.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to believe again that space belongs to all of us.
We're all stockholders. We've all paid for it.''

TROJANS HOPING TO LAND BIG MAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC will have its biggest recruiting visit of the
season _ literally _ when 7-foot-3 center Luke Minor of Blue Ridge
High School in Dyke, Va., makes his official visit to the campus
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Minor could give USC coach Henry Bibby his first true center and
answer the one glaring weakness remaining in the Trojans' lineup.
USC does not have a player on its current roster taller than 6-9.
</P>
<P>
   Minor has also made visits to Oregon and Kansas State and is
expected to sign a national letter of intent during the early
signing period next month.
</P>
<P>
   USC has only one scholarship remaining and would like to use it
on Minor. The Trojans have already received a commitment from 6-4
shooting guard Nate Hair of Capistrano Valley High School.
</P>
<P>
   __ Youngsters start quickly: After two weeks of practice, some
underclassmen have been among the most impressive players for the
Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore guard Jeff Trepagnier, sophomore forward/center Brian
Scalabrine, sophomore forward Shannon Swillis and freshman point
guard Brandon Granville have all been playing well.
</P>
<P>
   All of those players have the potential to start for the
Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Kevin Augustine, penciled in as the starter at point
guard, has missed several days of practice with a twisted foot, but
it is not considered serious.

FALTERING BRAZIL ANNOUNCES $80 BILLION AUSTERITY PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BRAZIL-ECONSCENE) 
(mk) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO  
  c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil _ The Brazilian government Wednesday unveiled a
three-year, $80 billion package of spending cuts and tax increases
in a bid to restore the country's flagging credibility in world
markets and prepare the way for a rescue program led by the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The blueprint calls for $23 billion in savings for 1999, with
about $11 billion of that amount coming from tax increases. The
federal government has promised to cut spending by $7 billion next
year, and is proposing controversial legal mechanisms, called
``triggers,'' to force states and municipalities to come up with
the remaining $5 billion in either tax increases or spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time has come for us to make government live within its
limits, with clarity, conscience and determination,'' Finance
Minister Pedro Malan said Wednesday, elaborating on themes
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso raised in a televised speech
Tuesday night, bracing Brazilians for the austerity measures
announced Wednesday. ``The time for gradualism is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, the giant of South America, with half the continent's
population and the world's ninth-largest economy, became the focus
of world attention after the collapse of Russia two months ago.
Almost instantly, interest rates for Brazilian debt doubled, and
the country began sweating away some $30 billion in foreign
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   With Brazil's economy crashing into recession, fears grew that
the country's collapse could trigger devaluations and defaults
across Latin America, and heighten the risks to the U.S. economy.
The International Monetary Fund, along with other multilateral
lending agencies, and the U.S. government have been preparing a
safety net for Brazil of at least $30 billion, with President
Clinton prepared to commit U.S. taxpayer dollars as part of a
package of direct aid from the G-7 industrialized nations to
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's response to Brazil's action Wednesday was both
congratulatory and cautionary. ``It is essential that Brazil
implement its program promptly and convincingly,'' Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin said in a statement, reflecting Washington's
fears that Cardoso's plan could flounder when it reaches the
Brazilian congress.
</P>
<P>
   That message was reinforced, a White House official said, in a
brief conversation between Clinton and Cardoso. Clinton, the
official said, was returning a call Cardoso placed several days ago
to congratulate Clinton on the Middle East accord, but Clinton's
underlying message was that Brazil had to act quickly. American
officials have made no secret of their exasperation at Brazil's
slowness to act, leaving the country vulnerable to another mishap
in the markets.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, reportedly made no reference to the American
contribution to an IMF-led rescue package. Brazilian officials said
they would be traveling to Washington to discuss the plan with IMF
officials by next week.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted warily, and said the measures did not go as
far as they hoped in making structural changes to permanently
reduce Brazil's burgeoning budget deficit, now running at 7 percent
of its gross national product. ``It's a step in the right
direction, but if you think of Brazil climbing a wall of disbelief,
this is just a few inches up,'' said Jorge Mariscal, chief
investment strategist for Latin America for Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders of the president's governing coalition, who
learned details of the plan over breakfast with Cardoso and Malan
Wednesday, did not rule out tinkering with some of the more
controversial elements of the austerity program, but pledged to
maintain the savings targets the government would pledge to the
IMF.
</P>
<P>
   ''The measures are bitter measures, but in our view they're
extremely necessary,'' said Aecio Neves, congressional party leader
of the president's Brazilian Social Democracy Party, which relies
on five allied parties to form its majority base. ``The governing
coalition has an enormous responsibility to overcome this moment of
instability,'' said Neves.
</P>
<P>
   With the sudden sense of urgency and national mission, few in
the president's governing coalition were willing to openly
challenge the austerity package outright. But many raised
objections to specific elements of the program, and said there
could be alternatives thrown up for debate in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most difficult items to pass, said congressional
leaders, would be a requirement that retired public-sector workers
contribute to the Social Security coffers, with contributions of 11
to 20 percent of their benefits. The austerity package also
increases the contribution of public sector workers to Social
Security, and would introduce a minimum age for retirement of civil
servants, which does not currently exist.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security System for public workers in Brazil is far
more generous than that in the United States. Civil servants here
retire with full salaries, according to time served, without regard
to their age.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reduction of expenses and the increase of tax collection, it's
an indigestible cocktail for any Congress in the world,'' said
Geddel Vieira Lima, party leader of the government-allied Brazilian
Democratic Movement Party. ``But we know the moment we're living
through, and that we have to show the world we're capable of doing
what's necessary to address our problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The package also calls for the extension of several taxes that
were originally passed as temporary measures several years ago.
Under one, the emergency stabilization fund, the federal government
impounds 20 percent of all taxes destined for state and local
governments. The austerity package proposes doubling the amount
impounded to 40 percent and extending the fund, which was to have
expired in 1999, to 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The package also calls on Congress to legally oblige states to
limit spending on active and retired employees to 60 percent of
their budgets, at the same time cutting the resources available by
impounding taxes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is by no means sure, however, that fiscal discipline can
successfully be imposed on state and city governments by fiat.
Anthony Garotinho, elected governor of Rio de Janeiro in last
Sunday's elections, said Wednesday, ``Does the government expect us
to make miracles?'' He noted that Rio, which is seeking a $300
million loan from the federal government, is responsible like other
states for providing basic services including education, health and
security. ``I was elected to be a governor, not a magician,''
Garotinho said.
</P>
<P>
   Mariscal of Goldman Sachs also called the impoundment fund's
extension ``another negative,'' and said, ``Brazil is in the mess
it's in is because it has to much debt, too many employees and too
high a Social Security deficit. It's an issue of spending too much
and lowering the debt, and everything else is peripheral.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Goodman, chief economist at Santander Investment
Securities, called the package ``mildly favorable regarding the
potential for an ongoing `muddling through' scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   This week marks the one-year anniversary of the last package
Cardoso announced, with much fanfare, just after Thailand's
collapse. That package to raise $18 billion, hailed as a great show
of decisiveness, was largely passed by Congress. But the only
measures that were implemented involved raising taxes, not cutting
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil will remain captive to a $300 billion domestic debt
that is extraordinarily short-term in nature, which is one of the
paramount issues coming out of the Asia crisis,'' Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Malan and other government officials are to testify
about the austerity package before Congress, which is scheduled to
begin action, starting with Social Security reform, next week.

 &HT;    Issue rarely raised, home builders say

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Quality and availability _ not age or origin _ are
usually the major concerns when buying lumber, several Atlanta home
builders and remodelers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we need to help protect our environment, but I
personally don't think about it much when I am buying what lumber I
need for a project,'' said Al Capogrossi, a Stone Mountain,
Ga.-based home remodeler.
</P>
<P>
   ``With old-growth wood, I usually am buying to match existing
wood that's already in the house,'' Capogrossi said. ``I'm not
looking at how old it is or where it came from.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Brutera of Homes by Brutera in Snellville, Ga., said he
seldom has any need for old-growth, specialty or rare wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``In building homes, we deal mainly with spruce and fir, and we
look for quality and specific grades of lumber we need to meet
building codes,'' Brutera said. ``In fact, I'm not even sure what
old-growth lumber is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Weidmann of Weidmann &AMP; Associates, an suburban Atlanta
remodeling firm, said the major factor in buying lumber for a
project is to buy whatever wood is specified by the customer or
architect. ``The customer may understand the lumber is now rare or
endangered, but if a customer decides not to use it, it's usually
because he or she did not understand how expensive it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   David Chatham, president of Roswell, Ga.-based Chatham Holding
Corp., a home builder, said most home construction companies use
lumber from new-growth forests, not rare or specialty woods from
old-growth forests.
</P>
<P>
   Many such woods are ``very specialized, hard to find, and most
people don't have any idea where they come from,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chatham said protecting the environment is an important issue to
most home builders, but ``sometimes some of the environmentalists
go overboard about it.''

ARAFAT RETURNS TO CHEERS AND REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  GAZA _ Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat returned
home Wednesday to a well-orchestrated hero's welcome and a
Palestinian population skeptical that the peace agreement he signed
in Washington will ever materialize.
</P>
<P>
   His motorcade whipped along a Palestinian-built coastal road
past schoolchildren waving posters of him, troops standing in
salute, and armored military vehicles draped with the Palestinian
flag.
</P>
<P>
   But just behind the cheering crowds lay the grim realities of
life in Gaza on the edge of peace. Squalid refugee camps abut the
new seaside mansions of Palestinian leaders. The stench of human
refuse wafts over stacks of sewer pipes never installed in one of
many long-delayed public works' projects. These failed promises
fuel the disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
   After a tour of Arab states to build support for the
land-for-security-deal signed Friday in Washington, Arafat began
the hard sell to his people. He told them of his confidence that
the plan would be implemented and that it was an important step
toward the creation of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Arafat will face
fierce political attacks from extremists vowing to derail a process
they view as a sellout. He must also stave off a deep mistrust and
growing impatience among Palestinians about the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Before Arafat left for the Wye summit, a Palestinian poll showed
that more than half of Palestinians supported a return to armed
conflict against Israel. But these challenges, and the means at his
disposal, are profoundly different than those of the Netanyahu
government.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Arafat does not have to deal with the demands of
a functioning democracy. Although democratically elected, his
stature as a symbol of resistance has won him authoritarian rule.
Commonly referred to as ``The Leader,'' Arafat has supressed
criticism of his government and has already begun a crackdown on
militants with little regard to human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists have been arrested in recent days, and Palestinian
security forces shot and killed a 17-year-old activist during a
raid Sunday on a headquarters of the Fatah political party. Both
incidents prompted street riots led by groups opposed to the
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat must balance the role he has been given with the pressing
need to control militant groups such as the Islamic organization,
Hamas, so that the larger Palestinian population can reap the
benefits of peace. Pursuit of the military wing of Hamas is a
security requirement Palestinians must provide to Israelis under
the agreement if Israeli troops are to withdraw from an additional
13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But the dismantling of Hamas is also a political necessity for
Arafat. If this agreement is not implemented, many analysts believe
the historic Oslo peace process begun five years ago is doomed,
along with Arafat's enduring dream of an independent Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
   Inaz Ramadan, 31, a mother of three, captured a pervasive
discontent among Palestinians when she said, ``We keep hoping for
more and more and ending up with less and less. The people are fed
up. There is a feeling of depression.''
</P>
<P>
   A construction worker, Said Diyab, 32, who toiled in a hot sun,
said, ``I haven't followed this agreement. We don't have
electricity in our area so we can't see it on TV. But it doesn't
matter. It won't actually be implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, six Palestinian opposition groups in Gaza have publicly
attacked the Wye agreement as ``another retreat in a series of
retreats,'' and warned that it could lead to ``civil war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement represents a dangerous plot by Washington and
Israel to destroy the power of the Palestinian people,'' said a
newspaper advertisement paid for by Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, the
National Islamic Salvation Party, and the Democratic and Popular
Fronts and the Arab Liberation Front.
</P>
<P>
   Mahmoud Zahar, a physician and a leader of Hamas, said, ``The
majority of Palestinians are not interested in this agreement. They
no longer believe in Oslo. They no longer have trust that it will
be implemented. Ask people about corruption in the Palestinian
Authority, ask them about the violation of human rights by Arafat's
security forces. Arafat has already lost the support of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   With grass-roots support, Hamas has provided for years a network
of schools, clinics, and Islamic associations for poor
Palestinians. It openly calls for the destruction of Israel and is
reflexively opposed to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   In response to terrorist attacks carried out by Hamas's military
wing, Arafat, at the insistence of Israel and the United States,
attacked what became known as Hamas's ``infrastructure of terror.''
The Palestinian Authority shut down the schools and the clinics.
Now it must prove that it can step up its fight by rooting out
Hamas's armed wing. Zahar says that battling Hamas will ultimately
hurt Arafat politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who was affected by this? The poor. And there are many of us
here. The Palestinian Authority will pay a price for that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   More centrist critics, such as Jihad Alwazir, director of Gaza's
World Trade Center, agree that Arafat has lost political support
and that the implementation of the Wye agreement is urgently
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oslo has been dead for a while. They tried to resuscitate it.
But we will need to see real improvement on the ground: an airport,
safe passage between Gaza and the West Bank. Then perhaps people
will support the process again,'' said Alwazir. ``We are all a bit
wiser and more cynical now.''
</P>
<P>
   That cynicism has been fueled by Netanyahu's recent announcement
that he would postpone the ratification of the agreement by his
Cabinet until the Palestinians deliver a formal outline of their
security plan. He said the timetable for troop withdrawals would
not take effect until acceptance of the security plan.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will result in Israel ceding a further 13 percent
of the West Bank, the opening of the Palestinian airport, and the
creation of ``safe passage'' between Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the Palestinians must implement:
</P>
<P>
   _A ``systematic and effective combat of terrorist organization
and their infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   _``Apprehend specific individuals suspected of perpetrating
violence and terror.''
</P>
<P>
   _A ``systematic program'' for ``collection of weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   _A formal rewriting of the Palestinian Liberation Organization's
covenant that would annul passages that call for the destruction of
the state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem Wednesday, ``There's a
very simple principle here. They do it, they get it. They don't do
it, they don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leaders blasted this rhetoric as a violation of the
agreement and yet another example of foot-dragging by Netanyahu's
government, which is threatened by intense opposition from its
far-right factions. But Arafat remained confident Wednesday,
saying, ``I think that what has been signed will be implemented
accurately.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by television crews what he wanted to tell the Palestinian
people, Arafat responded, ``My message ... is to continue together
until all of us pray in holy Al Quds, the capital of the
Palestinian state.'' Al Quds is Arabic for Jerusalem.

IMPEACHMENT CONTROVERSY HEATS UP ON SEVERAL FRONTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hundreds of constitutional scholars and historians,
and the man who presided over the Watergate impeachment
proceedings, on Thursday criticized the inquiry into President
Clinton, as House Democrats and Republicans became entangled in a
request for more documents.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Democrats asked Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for material
they said could shed light on Starr's decision to expand his
inquiry to Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky, and on whether
audiotapes that Linda Tripp provided to Starr had been altered.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But one of Starr's top aides rebuffed them, Democrats said,
because House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde had refused
to sign the request, a prerequisite for the independent counsel to
consider the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's tempest was probably rendered moot by late
afternoon, however, when Hyde reversed course and agreed to
cooperate with the panel's ranking Democrat, Rep. John Conyers of
Michigan. ``In light of Judge Starr's response to Mr. Conyers,
Chairman Hyde will work with Mr. Conyers to submit a bipartisan
request,'' said committee spokeswoman Nicole Nason.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday evening, Starr's office had released a letter it
sent to Conyers late Wednesday. Signed by Deputy Independent
Counsel Robert Bittman, the letter disputed the Democrats' account.
It stated that the office had not had enough time to respond to
Conyers' request, and was continuing to evaluate the possible
release of materials to the committee. Bittman asked to have until
Monday to respond, although he cautioned that many of the materials
requested were sensitive or still under active investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, for insurance, Conyers asked Attorney General
Janet Reno to provide the committee with ``any motion, supporting
materials, evidentiary materials or notes'' that Starr submitted to
Reno on Jan. 16 to support his request to broaden his
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   With elections that could fuel or dampen Republicans' appetite
for impeachment less than a week away, the maneuvering by
Republicans and Democrats reflected how they are gearing up for the
end game.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The confusing and contentious exchange came as more than 200
constitutional scholars said the accusations against Clinton did
not warrant impeachment.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among those signing a petition circulated on the Internet were
well-known legal experts like Ronald Dworkin of New York University
and Laurence Tribe of Harvard University, as well as
conservative-leaning academics like Stephen Macedo of Syracuse
University and Douglas Laycock of the University of Texas.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The scholars' sentiment was echoed by former Rep. Peter Rodino,
D-N.J., who as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee in 1974
presided over the impeachment proceedings against President Richard
M. Nixon.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rodino, who has said little about the current scandal, told a
New Jersey television program this week that if no new evidence
emerged, ``I would say that this does not rise to that level where
we have to consider it to be a ground to remove from office the
president of the United States.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has repeatedly invoked Rodino, who is now 89, as a paragon
of fairness, and intentionally patterned the committee's procedures
after those the House Judiciary Committee adopted for the Watergate
proceedings.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In other academic quarters, more than 400 historians, including
Stephen Ambrose and Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., released a statement
Wednesday calling on the public to oppose the impeachment process.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If carried forward, they will leave the presidency permanently
disfigured and diminished, at the mercy as never before of the
caprices of any Congress,'' the statement said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have rescheduled a hearing for Nov. 9 to discuss the
history of impeachment. But Democrats want the hearing to focus on
what constitutes an impeachable offense.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While lawmakers were home campaigning, that did not stop their
aides on Capitol Hill from quarreling over details about hearings
and document requests.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's disputes stemmed from Conyers' request for
information that Starr possesses, which Democrats say might offer
new insights into Starr's inquiry into the president's relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky. Republicans, however, suspect a Democratic
fishing expedition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, for example, want the supporting materials that Starr
submitted to the three-judge panel that oversees the independent
counsel, seeking permission to send grand jury material to
Congress. These applications were made around July 2, before it was
clear that Clinton or Ms. Lewinsky would testify before a grand
jury. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The request also sought ``rough notes'' from any interview of a
witness whose testimony was included in Starr's report. It asked
for FBI reports relating to the independent counsel's conclusion
that some of the audiotapes Ms. Tripp made of conversations between
her and Ms. Lewinsky were doctored.

GAO REPORT OUTLINES HOW STARR SPENT MONEY ON PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, has
employed a team of outside investigators, all of them former
federal agents, to supplement his staff during the course of his
four-year investigation into President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   With Democrats seeking to turn attention away from Clinton and
onto the prosecutor, the hirings _ at a cost of thousands of
dollars _ was questioned Wednesday by Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the whole FBI available to him,'' said Nadler, a
member of the House Judiciary Committee, which is conducting the
impeachment inquiry of Clinton. ``Why is he hiring private
investigators? Why is he wasting the taxpayers' money?''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement officials said that there is
increasingly a struggle for resources among the Justice Department,
the FBI and independent counsels. They said the FBI encourages the
hiring of retired FBI and IRS agents for these investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The use of private investigators was just one glimpse into the
almost $40 million Whitewater and Lewinsky investigation that was
provided by routine audit reports on the expenses of the
independent counsel's office conducted by the government's General
Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler said he had requested copies of the audits because he is
the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary subcommittee that will
consider next year whether to extend the independent counsel law.
</P>
<P>
   The expense statements show that in January, shortly after Starr
began investigating the president's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, his office envisioned that it would be in operation for
at least three more years. On January 26, it justified a decision
to purchase a $56,810 copying machine instead of leasing one
because ``we will have a need for this copier for at least 40
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr is also paying top dollars for some of his legal advisers.
Sam Dash, a Georgetown University professor who was chief counsel
for the Senate Watergate committee, has been getting paid at a rate
of $400 an hour to give ethics advice to the independent counsel's
office. Ronald Rotunda, a University of Illinois law professor who
advises Starr on constitutional law, gets $300 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office also paid a $20,000 retainer to a group called
Decision Analysis to study community attitudes in preparation for
the prosecution of Jim Guy Tucker, the former governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The private investigators hired by Starr are retired agents such
as Jerry Bastin, a former FBI agent who was the losing Republican
candidate for county sheriff in Madison County, Tenn., four years
ago. Bastin was paid $62,360 by Starr's office through September
1997. He was paid another $52,507.72 through the first quarter of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Another contract investigator, Coy Copeland, who was involved in
the Lewinsky investigation, similarly earned $51,976.96 in the
six-month period ending last March. He previously had earned
$93,520 from the independent counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   One of Starr's deputies said that there was ``absolutely nothing
nefarious'' about the use of the investigators. The lawyer, Jackie
Bennett, said the former agents were retained because of a
recurring staffing problem caused when agents of the FBI and IRS
that are detailed to the independent counsel are returned to their
agencies a few months later, just when they gain knowledge about a
particular aspect of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It solves the problem, an insidious problem, of people being
transferred to us for a temporary period and then moving back to
their agency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said that once hired, the investigators fill the same
role as federal agents and that the hiring of the retired agents
was no different from the practice of many independent counsels'
retention of private lawyers and other experts to assist in their
inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Starr also said the payments to Dash were made at his
normal billing rates. The payments are capped so that they cannot
exceed Starr's annual counsel salary of $118,400, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   In their defense of Clinton, the Democrats have been trying to
shift the spotlight away from the perjury accusations against him
and to look at the tactics of Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats have said they will subpoena Starr to testify at
hearings when the Judiciary Committee considers impeachment next
month. Others say they are uncertain about such a strategy for fear
that Starr could steal the spotlight by presenting a compelling
case and erase his negative image with the public.

MITCH STALLS, BATTERS HONDURAS WITH 115 MPH WINDS, RELENTLESS RAIN 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELMOPAN, Belize _ Hurricane Mitch stalled off Honduras on
Wednesday, battering it with huge waves and fierce winds while
forcing people in its expected path to stock up on food and hunker
down in shelters.
</P>
<P>
   In Belmopan, the capital of Belize, as many as 10,000 people
settled into shelters and braced themselves for a hurricane that
traveled little during the day. ``They say the hurricane hasn't
moved,'' said Emelia Cayetano, a Belize army official overseeing a
shelter holding 300 people. ``We're the same way _ just sitting
here, not moving.''
</P>
<P>
   To the north, in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula where Mitch was
expected to strike later in the week, many people took no chances,
buying supplies and filling cupboards. ``A lot of people have been
stocking up,'' said Honorio May, who owns a general store outside
Cancun. ``We've had maybe 800 people in here to buy canned goods,
bread, water and biscuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami said Mitch
was likely to remain a threat to the region for the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Although the storm's force diminished since Tuesday when its 180
mph winds cut through the Caribbean, it still thrashed Honduras
with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph and poured up to 25 inches
of rain over a vast region in Central America, the hurricane center
said.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday night, the hurricane's eye stood about 25 miles
north of the coast of Honduras after sitting for several hours atop
Honduras' Bay Islands, a rustic tourist area popular with divers,
fishermen and sun-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane-force winds from the storm extended outward up to 105
miles, while its tropical storm-force winds spread outward up to
175 miles from the eye, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   The 350-mile-wide storm was expected to weaken somewhat when it
moves into Belize, but its rains took a toll in Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   According to wire service reports, more than 50 rivers
overflowed their banks in Honduras, and authorities there ordered
the evacuations of an estimated 45,000 people. Many towns were cut
off by washed-out roads and downed bridges. Severed phone lines on
the Bay Islands made it difficult to gauge the extent of the damage
there, but ham radio reports indicated it was extensive. President
Carlos Flores Facusse of Honduras declared the country's Caribbean
coast a disaster zone.
</P>
<P>
   Wire services reported at least 35 deaths from the storm _ 23 in
Honduras alone, eight in Nicaragua and one each in Mexico, Costa
Rica, Panama and Jamaica. The toll was expected to increase once
cut-off areas reestablished communications.
</P>
<P>
   Belize City, Belize's capital until 1961 when it was destroyed
by Hurricane Hattie, was virtually deserted Wednesday. The
government had issued a hurricane warning on Tuesday, sending
thousands of residents scurrying away from the coastal city.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus caused bumper-to-bumper traffic on the main road
leaving the city. But once inland, many found little to keep them
occupied Wednesday. Some sunbathed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the government was not willing to suggest that they
return home. ``This hurricane is just so unpredictable,'' said
Godfrey Smith, the Belize prime minister's chief of staff.
``There's nothing to do now, but we're certainly not going to send
people home.''
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline was unavailable throughout most of the former British
colony of nearly 200,000 people. The government acknowledged that
it had cut off supplies to save the fuel for use after the
hurricane moved out of the country. Food and water shortages also
were reported.
</P>
<P>
   In Belmopan, a small town about 40 miles southwest of Belize
City that now serves as the nation's capital, people settled into
shelters, but some tensions began to appear by the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not enough room,'' complained Anacleto Martinez, one
of 300 people who was trying to sleep on the floor of a Roman
Catholic Church annex.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez and his 11 relatives squeezed into a 10-square foot
area and shared just one mattress. Children played throughout the
shelter while their parents tried to cook with limited supplies.
One outdoor spigot with a bucket served as the sink for all 300
people.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, many people said they had little
idea where or when the storm would hit. Rumors abounded, and radio
stations often broadcast conflicting or confusing reports about the
storm's whereabouts and path throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday they said it was going to hit today, and today they
say it is going to hit tomorrow,'' said May, the owner of the small
general store in Akumal, about an hour's drive south of Cancun.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, the weather along Yucatan's Caribbean coast
changed between bright, if clouded, skies and torrential rains. By
late afternoon, the sea was hammering the coast and the rain was
falling steadily.
</P>
<P>
   In Tulum, where expansive Maya temples overlooked the pounding
surf, guides prepared to close the site. The owners of a dozen or
so stalls had packed up and visitors had cleared the area, said the
site's chief, Camilo Kamal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally we get between 700 and 800 people here a day; but
today, because of the weather, there's only been about 30,'' said
Kamal. ``Everybody left yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   A small hotel near the entrance to the ruins was nearly empty,
and owner Felipe Ramirez made final preparations to handle a most
unwelcome guest named Mitch. The bar was taped up with red and blue
plastic sheeting, and the windows were crisscrossed with masking
tape. Ramirez's assistant even moved the bar's refrigerators into a
storeroom, ``so they don't take off'' when the storm blows through.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the hotel, newlyweds Susana and Juan Vaquero from
Barcelona, Spain, sat and watched the rain pour. They came to the
Cancun area for sun and sand and instead got soaked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in Havana and had a ticket for here,'' Susana Vaquero
explained. ``At that time we didn't know if the hurricane was
coming here or going to Cuba, so since we had the ticket, we
decided just to come. We'll probably stay here, especially if it
isn't getting closer.''
</P>
<P>
   And their honeymoon? ``Unforgettable,'' she said.

SURPLUS STANDS AT $70 BILLION AT END OF '98 FISCAL YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government officially closed the books
Wednesday on the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, saying it ran
a $70 billion surplus, the first time since 1969 that Washington
spent less than it took in.
</P>
<P>
   The final tally, announced by President Clinton at a news
conference at the White House, matched precisely the
administration's last estimate, made four weeks ago. Relative to
the size of the economy, it was the biggest surplus since 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the occasion to continue his assault on Republicans
as bent on using the surpluses projected for coming years to pay
for tax cuts, and to repeat his demand that the money be set aside
until Congress and the administration settle on a plan to shore up
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Under intense pressure from Clinton and Democrats in Congress,
Republicans abandoned plans to push through a big tax cut this
year. But they have vowed to enact one next year, and both parties
agreed to spend more than $20 billion of the current year's
projected surplus of $80 billion on a variety of programs that they
deemed emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office has projected surpluses for the
next decade, totaling $1.55 trillion. Most of that money, however,
will come from payroll taxes that are intended for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But with the economy appearing to weaken and the stock market no
longer generating the big capital gains that led to a surge in tax
revenues over the last few years, some economists are questioning
whether the surpluses will be as big as currently estimated.
</P>
<P>
   June E. O'Neill, the budget office's director, said Wednesday
that she would leave the job at the conclusion of her four-year
appointment early next year. She said her decision was unrelated to
criticism from Republicans that she had consistently underestimated
the size of the surplus.

TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH LIFTS GALVESTON BAY OYSTER BAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CINDY HORSWELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Health is lifting a four-month ban on
sale of Galveston Bay oysters intended to be eaten raw.
</P>
<P>
   Effective Sunday, the oysters _ popularly served on-the-shell or
on-the-half-shell _ can be shipped or sold. During the ban they had
to be removed from their shells.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Health Commissioner William R. Archer III said the ban was
lifted because the bacteria ``Vibrio parahaemolyticus,'' which
infected Texas oysters and was blamed for diarrheal illnesses in
416 people, cannot flourish in the cooler water temperatures now
found in the bay.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally occurring in coastal waters worldwide, the bacteria is
more abundant in warm weather.
</P>
<P>
   Also, historical data indicates no oyster-related cases of the
bacterial ailment in Texas after October.
</P>
<P>
   All sale of oysters from Galveston Bay was halted June 26, but
the ban was partially lifted Oct. 3 when the state Health
Department permitted the sale of shucked oysters that were labeled
``For cooked consumption only.''
</P>
<P>
   During the summer months, oysters are only harvested from
private leases where they have been gathered from restricted areas
and allowed to purge themselves of impurities.
</P>
<P>
   The oyster season for the rest of the bay is slated to open
Sunday. However, Archer said elevated levels of harmful bacteria
from floodwater pouring into the coastal waters could delay the
start of the seasons in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Health Department officials are monitoring bacterial counts and
should know Friday which areas will need to be remain closed to
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas oyster season runs from Nov. 1 through April 30.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials routinely advise that anyone with liver disease
or immune system problems avoid eating raw shellfish. &QL;

18 ARE ARRESTED IN 1997 MIAMI BALLOT FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Florida officials arrested 18 people on Wednesday and
were seeking three others in a case of widespread ballot fraud that
tainted last November's citywide election here.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven woman and 10 men, many of them elderly, were accused of
acting as false witnesses to the signing of absentee ballots cast
in the mayoral elections. Two were also accused of voter fraud.
Both crimes are third-degree felonies that carry maximum prison
sentences of five years.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests on Wednesday bring to 36 the number of people
charged in a yearlong inquiry into voter fraud that has propelled
Miami into the national spotlight as a city rife with corruption
and political influence-peddling. Coming just six days before
Election Day, the arrests were characterized by officials as a
warning that election fraud would not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does send a strong message,'' said Doyle Jourdan, regional
director for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. ``We did
intend to try and get this phase accomplished prior to the
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The 18 people arrested on Wednesday had turned themselves in and
were later released on their own recognizance, after being charged
with the other three. Law-enforcement officials were searching for
the remaining three.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those arrested worked in the campaign of the former
Miami mayor, Xavier Suarez, who was ousted this year. Suarez
defeated Joe Carollo in a Nov. 11 runoff election that was forced
by hundreds of absentee ballots cast for Suarez in the first round.
In March, Carollo, a former mayor, returned to his post after state
courts held that many absentee ballots were fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, local election officials have set up rules to make
forgeries and fraud more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the people arrested on Wednesday, Jorge Diaz, 60, and
Maria Gonzalez, 80, were involved in the Carollo campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If indeed one or two people were involved in false witnessing,
that's wrong,'' Carollo said in a telephone interview. ``I don't
approve of that. It saddens me that it happened.''

FEDS CHARGE 44 WITH DEFRAUDING INVESTORS OVER THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: This story has been added to the N.Y. Times front page; also
moved in `f' news file.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Delivering a blunt reminder to investors that the World Wide Web
can be treacherous, federal regulators said Wednesday that they had
accused 44 stock promoters of fraudulently promoting more than 235
small companies on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which created a special
enforcement squad to police Internet frauds, called the civil
enforcement action the first such nationwide crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC accused an array of little-known stock promoters in 10
states and the District of Columbia of ``illegally touting
securities'' and misleading investors about their relationships
with the companies they were promoting.
</P>
<P>
   Often, regulators said, the promoters recommended stocks but
failed to disclose that they were being paid in cash or stock by
the companies they were promoting. Often, the agency said, the
promoters sold their own shares as the price of a stock jumped in
the period after they pumped up its virtues.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all of these cases, the Internet promoters gave ostensibly
independent opinions about microcap companies that in reality were
bought and paid for,'' Richard H. Walker, director of enforcement
at the SEC, said in a statement. ``Not only did they lie about
their own independence, some of them lied about the companies they
featured and then took advantage of any quick spike in price to
sell their shares for a fast and easy profit.''
</P>
<P>
   The promoters _ who wrote for online newsletters, posted
messages on Web sites and flooded the Internet with junk e-mail _
were paid more than $6.2 million in cash by the companies whose
shares they were promoting and were given 1.8 million shares of
stock or stock options for their work, regulators said.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said many of the accused had already agreed to settle
the complaint by paying fines.
</P>
<P>
   Despite efforts by the SEC to combat Internet fraud, however,
the scams have become increasingly sophisticated and varied.
</P>
<P>
   ``All types of scams are finding their way to the Internet,''
said John R. Stark, chief of the office of Internet enforcement at
the SEC. ``You have Ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes, public
offerings, oil and gas fraud, every kind of fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the fraud, investigators say, involves small-time stock
promoters, many of whom work out of their homes, and a host of tiny
companies hoping to bolster the value of their penny stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the range of schemes appears to have grown enormously,
despite repeated warning from regulators that investors must be
skeptical about what they find on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Stark says it is difficult to know who is falling for the
misleading stock promotions. ``The profile is really all over the
map,'' he said. ``Some people are sophisticated, some are not.
There is no typical Internet victim. The fact is no one should be
making investment decisions based on what they read over the
Internet.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That small companies in several of these cases paid as much as
$300,000 to stock promoters on the Web is an indication of just how
powerful a trading and investment tool the Internet has become in
recent years and how seductive a vehicle of fraud it can become.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, an Internet newsletter called The Future Superstock
recommended that its more than 100,000 subscribers buy shares in
about 25 fast-growing companies whose share prices were expected to
double or triple in the following months.
</P>
<P>
   The writer of the newsletter, which offers company profiles and
``hot breaking news,'' told subscribers that he had conducted
independent research on the companies and that his stock-picking
record was excellent.
</P>
<P>
   But what the writer, Jeffrey C. Bruss of West Chicago, Ill., did
not fully disclose, according to federal regulators, was that the
companies he was touting had paid him more than $1.6 million to do
so. In fact, he had done little or no research, investigators say,
and he misled subscribers about his stock picking record. Efforts
to reach Bruss by telephone and e-mail were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Francis A. Tribble and his company, Sloane
Fitzgerald, were accused of sending more than 6 million e-mails to
fraudulently promote two small companies, including JT's
Restaurants in New York. The SEC said many of the e-mails did not
sufficiently disclose Tribble's compensation arrangements with JT's
Restaurants, which is owned by his father, Joseph Tribble.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the e-mail suggested that it was from independent stock
promoters named ``HotStock,'' ``Net-Vest'' and ``Cyber-Stock,''
according to the SEC. Francis Tribble and Sloane Fitzgerald agreed
to pay a $15,000 civil penalty, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not illegal for a company to pay stock promoters
to tout their stock, the promoters are required by federal law to
disclose whether they are being paid by a company they are
promoting, what form of payment they are receiving and how much
they receive.
</P>
<P>
   With the huge proliferation of Web sites and bulletin boards,
and the increasingly sophisticated methods use to engage in
securities fraud, many say there are not enough regulators to begin
to patrol the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But regulators also point out that the Internet has become a
tremendous tool for those willing to do research on investment
opportunities and stock promoters. Already, there are sites devoted
to combating stock scams, and the North American Securities
Administrators Association, a group of state regulators, says it
would like to form a neighborhood ``watch'' program in which
Internet users could funnel information about potential stock scams
to a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do what we can,'' said Marc Beauchamp, a spokesman
for the association, ``to make sure this medium is not overrun by
charlatans.''

MEXICAN COAST BRACES FOR DEADLY HURRICANE

   CANCUN, Mexico _ How do you prepare for an unwanted and angry
visitor?
</P>
<P>
   With Hurricane Mitch seemingly stuck in its massive swirl in the
Caribbean just north of the Honduran coast, Belize to Mexico's
Yucatan Peninsula continued guessing about its trajectory and
protecting themselves if the storm takes a northward turn.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the storm's powerful branches pelted regions of
Honduras with 120 m.p.h. winds, killing 32 people
</P>
<P>
   In this resort city about 375 miles north of Honduras and
Mexico's most popular destination for US tourists, government
officials and hotel managers alike expressed optimism that they
would escape the storm's fury. But the hurricane's size and
strength scared about 20,000 US tourists away early, the government
said, and brought back painful memories of Gilbert, an even bigger
storm that devastated the area in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there were 14,470 hotel rooms in Cancun. Now there are
nearly 24,000, according the Hotel Association of Cancun. Another
7,000 rooms will be built over the next few years, said Alejandro
Gongora Vera, the local director of the federal tourism agency
known as Fonatur.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned many serious lessons from Gilbert and as a result,
we believe that our hotels are very well-built,'' Gongora said.
``But the most important lesson was to take hurricane warnings very
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Cancun's 125 hotels are required to participate in
coordinated evacuation and protection plans when a hurricane
threatens the narrow strip of land where most of the structures are
located. Newer structures were also forced to be built further back
from the shore because of beach erosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a tourist area, Cancun is only 30 years old,'' said the
city's mayor, Rafael Lara, who canceled the city's full alert early
in the day but warned residents to be ready if things change. ``We
weren't prepared for Gilbert because we had never experienced
anything like that. But now we know what we need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another post-Gilbert strategy that Cancun and other areas
benefit from today are cable and satellite television and the
Internet, all of which offer hotels and officials up-to-the-minute
advisories of a storm's progress.
</P>
<P>
   But even the best precautions won't keep guests from leaving if
danger seems near. Hundreds of visitors crammed the Cancun airport
Wednesday trying to get a seat on overbooked flights. Many hotel
representatives said they were at about 35-40 percent capacity,
about half the normal rate for this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is usually a pretty busy time for us because of the
colder weather back in the US,'' said Raul Mesa Quinones, a manager
at a three-story waterfront hotel who Wednesday saw a dozen guests
check out early.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak Tuesday, Mitch was classified as the
fourth-strongest Caribbean hurricane this century with 180 m.p.h.
winds. By Wednesday afternoon, the 350-mile-wide storm's sustained
winds were down to 120 m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   The US National Weather Service said only three Atlantic storms
were stronger than Mitch at its peak: Gilbert in 1988, Allen in
1980, and the Labor Day hurricane of 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sun shone for most of Wednesday here, clouds, heavy
wind and rain returned by early evening _ a sign for some residents
that Mitch was still on his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not panicking, but we're not thinking that it's over
yet,'' said Carmen Villasantos, 44, as she left a Wal Mart with a
cart full of supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The rainfall _ up to 25 inches in mountainous areas of Honduras
_ began to take a toll. More than 50 rivers had overran their
banks, and the government evacuated more than 45,000 people from
low-lying areas, according to Col. Guillermo Pinel, chief of the
country's National Emergency Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Belize City, Belize's capital until 1961 when it was destroyed
by Hurricane Hattie, was a ghost town. Most of its 75,000 residents
had fled in cars buses commandeered by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Police and soldiers patrolled the streets, and a few people
wandered amid the boarded-up houses. The cable television company
was broadcasting only the weather channel.

`LIVING OUT LOUD' CONNECTS IN GENUINE WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   `Living Out Loud'' is a little film about people fighting
loneliness in the Big Apple. The movie marks the directorial debut
of esteemed screenwriter Richard LaGravenese (``The Fisher King,''
``The Horse Whisperer,'' ``Beloved'') and it succeeds in achieving
its modest goals with a tough-minded realism that's typically
absent from romantic movies.
</P>
<P>
   LaGravenese (who also wrote the screenplay) dispenses with the
cutesy-pie dramatics from the outset when we're introduced to
Judith Nelson (Holly Hunter), a woman adrift after her wealthy
doctor husband left her for a younger woman. We're present at the
dumping.
</P>
<P>
   Since Judith has spent so much of her life absorbed in denying
her own dreams to please her husband, she has little identity left
of her own once he walks out. You can feel her emptiness just by
looking at the bare walls of her apartment. This is a solitary soul
who watches and worries over the depressing events on the evening
news simply because the background noise keeps her company.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to reconnect with the outside world, Judith begins
frequenting Jasper's, a downtown jazz club that features a sultry
chanteuse (Queen Latifah) as its featured entertainment. At first,
Judith is more successful fantasizing about meeting people than she
is in actually making contact. But that changes through a
passionate case of mistaken identity. One kiss and Judith is on the
road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bumpy ride, though. Seeing things as if for the first
time, Judith forms a friendship with her building's elevator
operator, Pat (Danny DeVito). Pat is another dreamer whose life is
on the skids _ terminally ill daughter, terminally absent wife and
a pile of debt owed to underworld loan sharks. While Pat never
stops believing in himself, he realizes his life would be a lot
better if he had someone who shared that belief.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Judith.
</P>
<P>
   LaGravenese, who based his screenplay on two short stories by
Anton Chekhov, ``The Kiss'' and ``Misery,'' has created a sweet,
uplifting movie that never lapses into easy sentimentality or
predictability. The film's basic message _ redemption can come from
the smallest of human connections _ is elegantly stated through
believable characters who never lose their messy foibles just so
we'll like them better.
</P>
<P>
   DeVito gives a charmingly vulnerable performance and Queen
Latifah does some surprisingly credible versions of jazz and pop
standards. But the movie belongs to Hunter, who, in the film's
scant 93-minute running time, conveys a vivid portrait of a woman
in her mid-40s rediscovering what it means to be authentic and
alive.
</P>
<P>
   The findings don't set off any huge emotional fireworks or grand
insights into life's deeper meanings. But they make for a nice
human moment or two, which counts for something when it pertains to
movies and, quite often, everything when it pertains to reality. &QL;

OLYMPIAN'S COURT VICTORY BRINGS BITTERSWEET LESSON IN ADULT LIFE 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ This victory brought Olympic gold-medal gymnast
Dominique Moceanu no joy.
</P>
<P>
   Scarcely acknowledging her parents by her side, Moceanu on
Wednesday ended an ordeal that began when she ran away from home
Oct. 17. In the eyes of the law, she now is an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Dumitru Moceanu, 44, choked back tears and could
barely speak as state District Judge John Montgomery asked him
three times if he agreed with allowing his daughter to be declared
an adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a right to have a trial,'' Montgomery said to Dumitru
Moceanu during a tense and silent pause.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Dumitru Moceanu mumbled ``Yes,'' while dejectedly
shaking his head yes to indicate he would acquiesce to his
daughter's wishes and allow her to be declared an adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the hardest thing I've ever done in my life, even harder
than competing in the Olympics,'' the younger Moceanu said, poised
but clearly shaken, after the brief hearing. ``It's a great, but a
sad day.''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu, 17, took no questions after her short statement, but
indicated her battles with her parents may not be finished. She
said her lawyer, Roy W. Moore, will help her investigate her
finances to see if the money she has earned in her seven-year
professional career has been squandered by her parents.
</P>
<P>
   In order to demand an accounting of her money, Moceanu first had
to be declared an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Moceanu is not entitled to have access to her trust
account until she is 35. She said she had always assumed the money
would be available when she turned 18, but found out in a newspaper
article last week this wasn't true. Katherine Scardino, the
parents' attorney, said Moceanu should have known about the trust
fund because she signed off on it.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Koenig, an attorney with Fulbright &AMP; Jaworski who
specializes in trusts, said after minors are certified as adults
they can change the terms of a trust set up for them. This is
because they can claim that as minors, they did not realize what
they were doing, Koenig said.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu filed a lawsuit Oct. 19 seeking adult status, alleging
the trust fund set up in her name is all but gone. The next day,
she also said her parents have taken away her childhood by always
pressuring her to compete in gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents have denied the allegations. Dumitru Moceanu has
said all of his daughter's trust fund has been used to build a
70,000-square-foot gym at 6120 Louetta that opened last year, a gym
he says the young Moceanu wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Scardino has said the gym cost $2 million. When it opened, the
family said it cost $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Moceanu parents declined to comment after Wednesday's
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very upset, Camelia is doing better than Dumitru.
It's hard for the father to let go of his little girl,'' Scardino
said after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The Moceanus had said they would oppose their daughter's request
to seek adult status, but changed their mind Tuesday during a
scheduled deposition of Moceanu by the parents' attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Scardino said the parents had a change of heart because they
realized, ``to show her they loved her, they had to let her go.''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu said she will not go back to her parents' Spring, Texas,
home, but to an apartment she moved into last week.
</P>
<P>
   After signing the order, Montgomery said, ``I sincerely wish you
all the best of luck on the first day of the rest of your lives.
It's not a pleasant situation to come to court. I sympathize.''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu spoke briefly with her mother after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Moore said she plans to stay in the Houston area and
resume training. She is a student at the private Northland
Christian School.
</P>
<P>
   According to Harris County property records, a corporation
listed under Dumitru Moceanu's name, Moceanu Gymnastics Inc. (MGI)
built the gym and is entitled to all the profits from the gym.
Scardino said the gym earned the parents $15,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1997, Woodforest National Bank issued a $750,000
loan to pay for the gym's construction. The daughter's trust fund
has to pay the loan by November 1999. She will be 18 on Sept. 30,
1999. &QL;

TOP CBS EXECUTIVE RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CBS-KARMAZIN-PROFILE.) 
(th) 
 By BILL CARTER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Jordan, the chairman and chief executive of
CBS, who led the transformation of Westinghouse Corp. from an
industrial and broadcasting conglomerate into a pure media entity
retitled CBS Corp., announced his resignation Wednesday. Mel
Karmazin, the president, was appointed the new top CBS executive.
</P>
<P>
   Though the move had been anticipated when Karmzain was elevated
to the job of chief operating officer last April, the timing of
Jordan's departure was a mild surprise. CBS officially
characterized his decision as a retirement, though Jordan said in
an interview ``I'm not retiring, retiring. I don't have a new job
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The ascension of Karmazin to the title of CEO was a transfer of
title only, according to Karmazin, who said he has been running all
the operations of the company since April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was a non-event,'' Karmazin said in a telephone
interview. ``I didn't even want to issue a press release. I have
been running the company. I obviously already had the opportunity
to do whatever I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said the time was right for him to depart because in
January the company will complete the sell-off of Westinghouse's
former industrial assets, a role he described as his principle
mission since he made the decision for Westinghouse to buy CBS in
1995 for $5.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is leaving the company in capable hands with Karmazin
in charge, calling him ``a superb top executive.'' But Jordan
acknowledged that the two men approached management ``in very
different ways'' and that his relationship with Karmazin, who has a
reputation as an aggressive manager, was ``a little stormy.''
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin, who is the largest CBS shareholder with 1.5 percent of
the more than 700 million shares of stock, said the change would
mean ``no differences at all from an operations point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I don't mean to imply Mike's role was not
significant at all, but as far as day-to-day operations go I will
continue to handle them all.'' He said he had a ``great
relationship'' with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Several senior CBS executives agreed Wednesday that Karmazin has
been in total operational control of the company. And though by all
accounts Jordan still controlled the CBS board of directors and the
decision to leave now was completely his, one senior CBS executive
said the shift in power was ``totally inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, added: ``It
just happened a little sooner than some people expected. Mel's an
impatient guy. And he can't work for anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The CBS board will choose a chairman in January.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely assumed that it will be Karmazin.
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin will lead a CBS that has struggled to maintain a
prominent position among much larger media enterprises that now
compete with the company especially in the television business.
</P>
<P>
   While it owns the biggest collection of radio stations in the
country, its television stations have underperformed the rest of
the industry and its network has suffered through several years
without profits as it continues to fight a reputation as a network
primarily for older viewers in a business where advertisers pay
more to reach younger viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin, a radio entrepreneur who built his company, Infinity
Broadcasting, into one of the most successful media companies in
the country, joined CBS in 1996, after CBS acquired Infinity. At
the time, executives both inside and outside CBS forecast that
Karmazin would, within a year or two, take control of CBS, with
Jordan departing.
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin first ran the combined radio operations of Infintity,
Westinghouse and CBS, along with its business in outdoor
advertising. Then Jordan appointed him to head CBS' stations
division, which had badly lagged the stations owned by the other
networks. Finally he assumed the title of chief operating officer
of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The senior CBS executive said, ``First Mel got radio and outdoor
advertising. Then he got the stations. Then he got the network. It
was just a question of when the rest would fall into place.'
</P>
<P>
   CBS owns 160 radio stations, 14 television stations, two cable
channels and an outdoor advertising business. Karmazin said these
assets give CBS ``the advantage over other media companies.'' He
said, `` I respect Mike for putting these assets together.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, 62, joined Westinghouse in 1993 after a career that
included 18 years at PepsiCo, where he rose to the title of
president. He said he moved to acquire CBS as a way to try to
restructure Westinghouse. ``My speciality is acquiring and putting
things together,'' Jordan said. ``Our plan first of all was to
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he said, ``We didn't say it, but the company was
bankrupt.'' Looking to address what he called ``a black hole in the
balance sheet of $7 billion, which was really $15 billion,'' he
decided to start ``trading assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially he said, he leaned toward retaining both the media and
defense- oriented companies held by Westinghouse, but he quickly
realized the latter business was not nearly as sound. So he began
aggressively selling off all of Westinghouse's nonmedia assets.
</P>
<P>
   He said he identified radio as ``our best business'' and that
Karmazin, radio's other big player in the mid-1990s, ``came to us
and said let's put our companies together.''
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin had become a favorite on Wall Street for his management
of Infinity and his entry into the CBS fold helped elevate the
company's stock price. It climbed as high as $36 dollars in the
past year, but then fell sharply, along with many other media
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It hit a low of $18, but in August, Karmazin announced a plan
both for layoffs and for an independent public offering of a
separate unit of CBS' radio and outdoor advertising, to again be
called Infinity Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   In August, CBS announced it would cut 200 to 300 employees by
the end of the year. Karmazin said Wednesday that the IPO is set to
take place over the next two months and that it will ``help us
control our value.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the network side of CBS, which has not been
profitable for several years, is improving and he praised the work
of the president of CBS Television, Leslie Moonves, in making gains
in prime-time programming.
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin also noted that he was criticized for overpaying for
rights to National Football Leauge games this year but cited the
addition of the games as an important factor in CBS' improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what might be the most noticeable change in the company
now that he has been named CEO, Karmazin joked, ``You'll just see
more high-rated shows.''

 &HT;    Plane crashes into highway at height of rush hour
 &HT;    By Scott Marshall
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A small plane en route from Bessemer, Ala., sputtered
and crashed in flames onto Ga. 400 in Sandy Springs, Ga., at the
height of rush hour Wednesday evening, killing a motorist and
injuring the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, possibly having an electrical problem, was trying to
reach Peachtree-DeKalb Airport when she crashed into a southbound
lane of Ga. 400 at the Roberts Drive overpass, near the Northridge
Road exit, fire officials and dispatchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of motorists on the heavily traveled commuter corridor
watched the 6:25 p.m. crash, but no one else was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot was the only person in the Piper Saratoga, said
Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Another plane was seen near the falling plane, witnesses said.
The National Transportation Safety Board was investigating.
</P>
<P>
   After encountering trouble, the pilot of the Saratoga reported
her instruments were failing and officials began clearing airspace
at Peachtree-DeKalb Airport, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, the plane went down on the highway, striking a
southbound vehicle, which partially overturned.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital with second
degree burns on her upper body and injuries to her back, neck and
pelvis. She was in satisfactory condition an hour after the crash,
said Walter Ingram, a doctor in the burn unit.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot was conscious and talking to doctors. Ingram said he
was surprised to see her burns were not extensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into the ER and saw her,'' Ingram said. ``I said: `Is
this the right person?' I was expecting to see something much
worse.'' Neither the pilot nor the dead motorist was identified.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Beasley of Ball Ground, Ga., was nearly a casualty. She
was driving south on Ga. 400 on her way to work at Scottish Rite
Medical Center, where she is a registered nurse. She had just
checked the rear-view mirror of her Jeep Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of a sudden something hit me and it threw my car forward.
I looked in the rear view and I was losing control.''
</P>
<P>
   She sped up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw fire and sparks right on the back of my car. I was all
over the road. I could tell it was an airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, she said, she was swerving on the road and
thought she was going to hit the wall and blow up or catch on fire.
She managed to stop her car, got out and she and a woman who had
been driving behind her hugged each other and watched the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lawson was inside his suburban Atlanta home when he heard
the troubled airplane at 6:25 p.m. ``What made me go outside and
look was I heard the engine and the pilot was revving it,'' he
said. ``I saw the plane pass over and it sounded like it was
running on a couple of cylinders.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawson, who has taken flying lessons, said the pilot was
feathering the engine _ disengaging it _ to build up rpms to gain
more power. ``That's probably what was keeping her going,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the plane was about 300-to-400 feet overhead and a
twin-engine plane was following at about the same altitude just a
few seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
   The crash halted traffic in both directions on Ga. 400, blocking
even the emergency lanes and delaying a platoon of emergency
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The southbound lanes of Ga. 400 were expected to be closed for
several hours. All but one northbound lane near the scene were open
Wednesday night.

 &HT;    An assessment of Wall Street's power brokers
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wall Street is a six-block strip of Lower Manhattan between a
graveyard and a river. But it's also ``the center of the financial
universe,'' Worth (November) notes in a report that surveys
history, players and trends.
</P>
<P>
   Worth profiles Wall Street's ``20 most powerful people,'' who
``finance our households, lubricate the wheels of industry and fund
entire nations.'' Among them are David H. Komansky, chairman and
chief executive officer of Merrill Lynch; Sanford I. Weill, now
co-chairman and co-chief executive officer at Citigroup; buyout
king Henry Kravis; bullish strategist Abby Joseph Cohen; and media
magnate Michael Bloomberg.
</P>
<P>
   Worth sums up the Street with a quote from etiquette expert
Letitia Baldrige: ``Wall Street has some of the very best and the
very worst types of people in American society.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth's special section is just one of a number of efforts to
help readers deal with today's investment markets and economy:
</P>
<P>
   _ Smart Money (November) offers ``the one investment guide you
really need now,'' which reminds us ``periods of fear and
uncertainty often prove to be the best time to invest.'' This
edition looks at smaller stocks _ which may be the best buys now _
and strategies to adjust an investor's mix of stocks, bonds and
other assets based on age.
</P>
<P>
   _ Individual Investor (November) looks at strategies that enable
some mutual funds to perform well in a bear market. The winners
tend to be funds that invest in futures or use other hedging
techniques to post gains in a down market.
</P>
<P>
   _ Specialty magazines such as Working Woman (November) also
provide practical advice. In this case, when to bail out of a
mutual fund. A clue: If you're losing sleep worrying about your
holdings, it's time to sell.
</P>
<P>
   _ Leave it to The Economist (Oct. 30) to splash the cold water
of reality in our faces, reminding readers ``the world's financial
and economic troubles are not over'' despite the recent stock
market rally. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan gets some
credit for boosting the economy with two interest rate cuts, but
the magazine quips ``even Mr. Greenspan cannot prevent a bear
market with a mere wave of his wand.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Penny-pinching architects
</P>
<P>
   In an era of cost cutting and downsizing, architects contribute
to business by designing attractive structures at minimal expense,
Business Week (Nov. 2) says in its second annual architecture
awards edition, in conjunction with Architectural Record (October).
</P>
<P>
   The winner was the new headquarters of Gap in San Bruno, Calif.,
whose West Coast designers _ William McDonough + Partners and
Gensler _ created a three-section building with grass on the roof
and workstations within 30 feet of daylight.

 BofA CEO Will Stay 2 Years Longer  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hugh McColl, who heads the new BankAmerica Corp., will stay on the
job until 2002, two years beyond the bank's normal retirement age,
BofA said yesterday.
<P>
   The announcement that McColl, 63, will remain longer as chairman
and chief executive came a month after Charlotte, N.C.'s
NationsBank Corp. bought San Francisco's BofA and adopted its name,
forming the nation's second-largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days ago, the North Carolina bank announced the
resignation of David Coulter, the old BofA's CEO who briefly held
the No. 2 job at the combined bank.
</P>
<P>
   McColl forced out the 51-year-old Coulter after the old BofA
recorded steep losses in trading and investment banking, including
a $372 million write-down of a loan to D.E. Shaw &AMP; Co., a New York
investment firm specializing in computer-based securities trading.
</P>
<P>
   When BofA and NationsBank agreed to merge six months ago, McColl
declared it was his ``present intention'' that Coulter eventually
replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted at the time that the statement was full of
loopholes and that Coulter was not likely to get the top job.
McColl ``didn't have any intention of turning things over to
Coulter,'' said Sutro &AMP; Co. analyst Michael Abrahams. ``Having
disposed of Coulter, he had a rationale for extending his tenure.''
</P>
<P>
   BofA said McColl agreed to postpone his retirement after the
bank's new board, in its first meeting since the acquisition took
effect, unanimously asked him to remain.
</P>
<P>
   After the merger, the bank's board was made up of 11 directors
from NationsBank and nine from the old BofA. Coulter, a member of
the board, did not attend yesterday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank recently eliminated a rule requiring senior
executives to step down at 65, a bank spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement accepting the board's request, McColl touted the
role of the bank's executive committee, consisting of its six top
managers. The committee includes two executives from the old BofA:
corporate banking chief Michael Murray and investment management
chief Michael O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason I am happy to stay longer is that the other members
of the (committee) all have committed to working together,'' McColl
said. ``This will allow us to keep our team together.''
</P>
<P>
   By highlighting Murray and O'Neill, analysts said, McColl is
trying to boost the morale of the old BofA staff, which was laid
low by NationsBank's lightening moves to seize control of the
combined bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``McColl wants to preserve the illusion that it was a merger as
opposed to an acquisition, which is a pretty tough sell right
now,'' Abrahams said.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, BofA's board raised the bank's quarterly dividend 7
cents to 45 cents a share, an 18 percent increase. The dividend is
payable December 23 to shareholders of record on December 4.

NO LONGER UNDERESTIMATED, PATAKI BECOMES A SOFT-SPOKEN FORCE
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: NY-PATAKI-PROFILE-BOX) 
 (nk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was the most indelible image of the 1994
gubernatorial campaign: a newspaper photograph of George Pataki
being led, literally by the hand, through a crowded fund-raising
dinner by his political patron, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's opponent, Gov. Mario Cuomo, seized on the picture,
using it in television ads, as Democrats derided the Republican
candidate as ``an empty suit,'' the puppet on D'Amato's string.
Pataki contributed to the image of himself as a cipher, running on
a rail-thin platform of cutting taxes and restoring the death
penalty, assiduously avoiding saying what else he would do if
elected. Critics in both parties predicted that he would not amount
to much.
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong. The candidate may have seemed like little more
than the anti-Cuomo, but he was being quintessentially himself.
Pataki has made a career of being underestimated, and a habit of
defying expectations. And in the four years since that day, he has
done just that, with considerable success.
</P>
<P>
   Helped substantially by a cooperating economy, he has emerged as
a shrewd political operator. He grappled successfully with the
Legislature on issues like crime and spending, and now is expected
to win re-election easily _ no small feat for a Republican in a
heavily Democratic state. He is even mentioned as a possible
candidate for national office in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a far, far better politician than people expected,''
said Gerald Benjamin, dean of the College of Liberal Arts and
Sciences at the State University of New York at New Paltz, who
closely studies state government.
</P>
<P>
   In large measure, the governor has surprised people by giving
them very little idea of what he aims to do, beyond one or two
themes of his choosing. Keeping expectations at a minimum
consistently allows him to defy or exceed them. And as with another
Republican, Ronald Reagan, the fuzziness in Pataki's public
positions, once seen as a great weakness, has made him adept at
getting his way on some issues, while continually repositioning
himself to his advantage on others.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Pataki was widely painted as an
arch-conservative _ a view that helped prompt his fellow
Republican, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, to endorse Cuomo. But he has
since crafted a more moderate image, especially in the second half
of his term. He healed the political wounds he suffered from his
early budget cuts with later spending increases. His 1996
environmental bond act seized the initiative on an issue that
Democrats had long thought of as theirs alone. And he has
cultivated at least a tenuous alliance with the mercurial Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   To his allies, that adaptability is the governor's wily way of
getting what he wants. To Democrats, it proves that he lacks any
real convictions beyond his own political advancement. But these
days, even those Democrats will admit with frustration that there
is something, however opaque, inside that gray flannel suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``People badly underestimated him all around,'' said state Sen.
Martin Connor of Brooklyn, leader of the Senate's Democratic
minority. ``But I don't think anyone does still.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, New Yorkers had wearied of Cuomo, the protean figure
with the mile-wide agenda. Pataki made the shrewd calculation that
not being Mario Cuomo was enough to get elected, and that the less
he signaled of his views the better. That strategy of sticking to a
few simple themes is a trademark of Pataki's campaign consultant,
Arthur Finkelstein, and the candidate was seen as following someone
else's script.
</P>
<P>
   But he has governed in much the same way. He has taken positions
on a wide range of issues, but often quietly, and often only when
he had to. He changes positions and adopts his adversaries' ideas
as his own. And he has made a virtue of evading questions and
issues, sticking to his chosen answers _ or nonanswers _ with the
discipline of a monk. It seems as if he sees any strong stance as a
threat to distract and entangle him.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he campaigns for re-election, he says almost nothing
about his plans for a second term. ``It's conscious in the sense
that I want to be free to look at those issues that are critical in
January of 1999, as opposed to saying, in October of `98, that X, Y
or Z is going to happen, because I'm very, very committed to doing
what I said,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   It is his history of elusive adaptability that leads Pataki's
detractors to say he makes his decisions based primarily on
political gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sees the future very well in political terms, which is why
he's been all over the lot, from moderate to hard-right-winger,''
said Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, a Westchester County Democrat.
``What was it Gertrude Stein said? `There's no there there.'''
</P>
<P>
   When the people closest to him are asked what matters most to
the governor, though, they give remarkably similar answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a core group of issues,'' said Zenia Mucha, Pataki's
campaign manager. ``Reducing taxes, preserving the environment,
fighting crime, allowing business to flourish. And he knows that if
you focus on a few things, you can get them done.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he pushed through a 25 percent income tax cut that he
had promised as a candidate, despite a $5 billion deficit that
would have provided ample cover for delay. To balance the budget,
he cut spending on health care, mass transit and education, over
fierce protests. When the economy rebounded, he was able to reverse
many of his earlier budget cuts, even as he basked in the
popularity of the tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has also shown a talent for casting issues to his
advantage. This year, he seized on the case of a young woman who
was murdered, Jenna Grieshaber, to give emotional resonance to his
call to end parole for violent felons. He used the pulpit of the
State of the State message to promote the idea, and enlisted Ms.
Grieshaber's parents as allies. He kept up a relentless drumbeat
until Assembly Democrats succumbed and passed it in July.
</P>
<P>
   If Pataki's tenacity on issues like crime and taxes has been
striking, so has his flexibility on nearly everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, he attacked Cuomo for proposing a state takeover
of the troubled Long Island Lighting Company. This year, Pataki
completed a state takeover of the company, cutting electric rates
on the island by 20 percent. And as part of the deal, every
residence and business received a rebate check of $101 to $232,
just in time for the coming election.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki made deep spending cuts his first two years in office,
then allowed spending to grow rapidly the next two years. The
turnabout was made possible by a growing economy and a roaring
stock market, but it has helped him remake his image as a moderate.

 SEC Charges 44 With Fraud Via Internet  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
In what federal authorities call the biggest crackdown on Internet
fraud, the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday charged 44
individuals and companies with falsely promoting small stocks to
cheat investors.
<P>
   In 23 enforcement actions, the SEC charged the defendants used
unsolicited commercial e-mail, electronic bulletin boards and Web
sites to illegally tout ``microcap'' securities over the Net
without disclosing they received $6.2 million and nearly 2 million
shares of cheap stock and options for their tip services.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants include investment newsletters, Web sites and
other ``touters'' in 11 cities, including Los Angeles, Atlanta,
Boston and New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Microcaps are small-company stocks that are relatively
low-priced, risky and thinly traded.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC's clampdown is designed to curb the proliferation of
misleading &UR;  &LR; online stock tips as the Internet increasingly becomes
a major source of financial transactions. SEC officials said they
are concerned the Net is becoming a virtual haven for fly-by-night
businesses and stock shams.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all of these cases, the Internet promoters gave ostensibly
independent opinions about microcap companies that in reality were
bought and paid for,'' said Richard Walker, director of the SEC's
enforcement division. ``Not only did they lie about their own
independence, some of them lied about the companies they featured,
then took advantage of any quick spike in price to sell their
shares for a fast and easy profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires people who tout securities for a fee to
disclose the source of their compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the charges in the case:
</P>
<P>
   _ Stockstowatch, based in Sarasota, Fla., endorsed the stocks of
at least five publicly traded microcaps in e-mails to subscribers
and on its Web site. After shares increased sharply in value based
on the recommendations, the company allegedly pocketed more than $1
million in stock sales.
</P>
<P>
   _ An online stock promoter in Southern California, International
Alliance Trading Inc., received more than $64,000 in cash and stock
from several microcap companies it hawked online without revealing
its compensation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  _ An online newsletter, the Future Superstock in Chicago,
received more than $1.6 million in cash and stock from about 25
companies it boosted without disclosing it was paid for the tips.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC did not disclose the name of any of the stocks involved.
</P>
<P>
   The commission set up a special ``cyberforce'' unit this summer
to scour Web sites for illegal promotional arrangements. It has
filed 61 cases since it began patroling the Internet in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC encourages consumers to report suspicious online stock
offers to its toll-free phone number, (800) 732-0330, and e-mail
address,  &LR;  enforcement &LR; sec.gov &LR; .

 NEW YORK: a moderate. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a string of issues on which Pataki decided that his
goal was not important enough to wage a serious fight, or that the
political price would be too high.
</P>
<P>
   The governor favors legalization of casino gambling, a ban on
discrimination against lesbians and gay men, and softening of the
state's harsh drug-possession laws, but he has not worked at
getting them past a resistant Senate. Democrats note that if he
pushed harder on such issues, he would incur the wrath of
Republican conservatives around the country as he considers a run
for national office in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he tries to have it both ways on issues, and he does
it fairly skillfully,'' said Judith Hope, chairwoman of the state
Democratic Party. ``He robes himself in moderate positions but
doesn't lift a finger to advance them.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor argues that there is a philosophical constant
running through his policies, one that explains positions as
diverse as his support for abortion rights and his insistence that
welfare recipients work for benefits. ``Giving people more
opportunity, more freedom, more confidence in the future, and at
the same time, requiring responsibility of people,'' is the way he
puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Those views, he says, are the self-reliant legacy of his father,
Louis, the son of Hungarian immigrants who worked as a mailman and
operated a small fruit and vegetable farm in Peekskill.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his undergraduate days as a small-town boy at Yale,
the governor said that too many people believe wrongly that
government makes better decisions for people than they make for
themselves. ``You'd meet people who would look down on the average
worker, those on the right and those on the left who would look
down on the average worker,'' he said. ``And I would sit there and
think that average worker is my father.''
</P>
<P>
   The opacity that makes the governor hard to pin down politically
applies to him personally, too.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is an avid reader, mostly of history and other
nonfiction, who has a taste for fine food and French wine. He can
be an energetic storyteller, and occasionally gives vent to a
serious temper. A fervent outdoorsman, he can wax rhapsodic on
hiking and snowshoeing, avocations that animate his desire to
preserve wild lands.
</P>
<P>
   Most New Yorkers, though, see none of this. In public, his
enthusiasm, sophistication, ambition and intelligence are shrouded
behind a bland, plain-spoken manner.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, he is a sharp political analyst, but when asked to
share such insights for the record _ Does talk of impeaching
President Clinton hurt D'Amato's chances for re-election? How does
the 2000 presidential race shape up? _ he likes to say, ``You'll
have to ask the political people,'' as if he is not one.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Libby, have been careful to shield their
private lives and those of their four children, ages 11 to 19, from
public scrutiny. They did not move into the governor's mansion in
Albany, opting to remain in their home in Garrison, a couple of
hours south. And reporters who cover the governor's doings every
day were unaware until recently that his mother, Margaret, had
moved in with the family after the death of his father, Louis, two
and a half years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's demeanor is relaxed and genial, yet his resume is
studded with bold, successful challenges to incumbents _ for mayor
of Peekskill, for Assembly, for state Senate, and for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy who'd like to give the image he's sort of
listless, and yet he went from being an assemblyman in the minority
party to being governor in a little over two years,'' said one of
his top aides.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his closest advisers say they have urged him, at times,
to loosen up in public, to no avail. Said one: ``I'm not sure he's
a guy that thinks it's to his advantage to have people know him too
much. He never tips his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 and 1995, many Democrats questioned the governor's
intelligence. It was always an odd view to have of a graduate of
Yale, who made law review at Columbia and worked for a prestigious
Wall Street firm.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Albany doubts Pataki's intellect any longer, but some
Democrats still question his work habits, noting that unlike Cuomo,
he does not routinely work marathon days, or feel compelled to
master every issue. Sheldon Silver, the Democratic Assembly Speaker
_ who declined to be interviewed for this article _ once described
the governor as ``lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   But people in and out of government often describe him as a
quick study who is better-informed than they expected.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital
Association, clashed with the governor early in his term, and
thought then that Pataki did not know or care about health care
policy. ``Now, you can have a serious conversation with him on all
these issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki adds to the impression that he is not breaking a sweat by
placing great faith and authority in his top advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very good at determining who can do what, and he's secure
enough to let them go and do it,'' said one of those aides, Louis
R. Tomson, the secretary for public authorities. ``He doesn't mind
if delegating authority means people still underestimate him. They
do it at their peril.''

 Jim Steinwinder Provides Databases that Fuel California
Political  Races  By Dan Fost  
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Jim Steinwinder has barely lit his Marlboro when the phone rings,
again.
<P>
   It's another panicked political consultant, wanting to know why
his mailing list has a missing name, or where his labels are, or if
he can get another set of last-minute literature printed and
mailed.
</P>
<P>
   With less than a week to go before election day, Steinwinder
stands at the caffeine-crazed intersection of politics and
technology.
</P>
<P>
   His Santa Clara firm, Computerized Political Services, provides
the databases that fuel many California campaigns, regardless of
ideology. He keeps track of individual voter records going back 10
to 12 years: how often people vote, how they're registered and
whether they vote at the polls or by absentee ballot.
</P>
<P>
   He's constantly massaging, merging and updating the databases
that have become indispensable in modern politics: the statewide
voter file, homeowner files, telephone files and other large
computerized records.
</P>
<P>
   His business also includes a large printing operation, enabling
him to crank out labels and mailers. ``We fine-tune it so we don't
waste a lot on mail to deadwood,'' he said. ``The laser printer
allows for a lot of highly personalized mail pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   He's provided information this year to both candidates for
governor and frequently works both sides of a ballot measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds mercenary,'' he says, ``and in a way, I guess it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   He cares more about software than soft money, more about
mainframes than the political mainstream. If Steinwinder, 50, has
any political opinions, he keeps them to himself. He doesn't even
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to be in the business and serve both sides, it's
best not to leave a trail,'' he says, a curl of smoke leaving his
cigarette, three half-empty bottles of Coca Cola on his desk. ``My
politics are my politics. Nobody knows what they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway,'' he adds, ``I have a far greater impact than a single
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The political consultants who rely on Steinwinder for their
mailing lists and slate cards verify that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man has touched everybody who votes in the state,'' says
Philip Muller, a San Francisco political consultant. ``Every person
in San Francisco and (most) of California who votes regularly has
received a piece of mail lasered by Jim Steinwinder.''
</P>
<P>
   High-powered consultant Clint Reilly sent Steinwinder a
handwritten note saying that if he runs against San Francisco Mayor
Willie Brown next year, he'll need all the weapons he could &LR;  can
muster _ ``and you are a powerful weapon when loaded and cocked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He helped create the whole computer targeting technology
that's utilized in practically every campaign in politics today,''
Reilly says.
</P>
<P>
   It was Reilly's brother who first introduced the otherwise
apolitical Steinwinder to the hurly-burly world of elections.
</P>
<P>
   Steinwinder, a San Francisco native, had gone straight to work
for IBM Research when he graduated from Mountain View High School
in 1965. He put in two years there, then two years with a service
bureau, and then took a job with Memorex, where he worked on both
software and hardware. In 1981, after 11 years with Memorex, he
hung out his shingle as a computer consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the worst mistake I'd ever made,'' he says now, not
quite seriously.
</P>
<P>
   A mutual friend introduced Steinwinder to Kevin Reilly, who was
working on an insurance initiative in 1986. ``They came up with a
problem, I came up with a solution, and I haven't been able to get
away from them since,'' Steinwinder says.
</P>
<P>
   He finds it somewhat ironic that he started ``at the top,'' with
the influential Reilly. He continues to maintain a small clientele
of mostly heavy-hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do no marketing. I do no sales. I call nobody,'' he says.
``All my work is by referral. I've never had a salesman. I don't
know whether that's good or bad, but it works for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In his office's backshop, people step around stacks of boxes and
reams of paper. The smell of ink pervades the air, while printers
spit out scores of mailers. Steinwinder pokes around a cantankerous
laser printer, jammed again. ``Putting out fires,'' he calls it.
</P>
<P>
   Among the assets Steinwinder brings to the job are proprietary
software systems that sort the voluminous voter records he obtains
from the California secretary of state and others.
</P>
<P>
   He also helped pioneer some of the early vote-by-mail efforts,
in which candidates send out absentee ballots in hopes of gaining
votes from people who would otherwise stay at home.
</P>
<P>
   With Long Beach consultant Jerry Seedborg, Steinwinder produces
sophisticated slate cards that are targeted to voters by region, by
party, by ethnicity, by age.
</P>
<P>
   Seedborg, who was in Steinwinder's office working on a
last-minute mailing this week, proudly showed several cards U.S.
Representative Howard Berman, D-North Hollywood, sent out this
year. One card aimed at Jewish voters touted Berman's toughness
with Saddam Hussein; one aimed at young Hispanics played up
endorsements by Latino politicians; one aimed at conservative
voters showed endorsements from, as Seedborg put it, ``police,
police, police.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the work, though, Steinwinder is anything but a
political junkie. ``Most of the time, I don't know if the campaign
I worked on wins or loses,'' he says. He worked on Assemblyman Don
Perata's bid last month for the Democratic nomination in a state
Senate race, but ``I didn't know Perata won until three days after
the election _ and then because a Republican friend of mine in
Southern California called to congratulate me.''
</P>
<P>
   Perata's victory was credited to an unusually large vote-by-mail
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Steinwinder's willingness to work for either side in the same
campaign sometimes makes consultants uneasy. Gale Kaufman, a
Sacramento consultant, said she won't use him for that reason.
</P>
<P>
   Muller, who is using Steinwinder for vote-by-mail efforts for
the state Democratic Party and for supporters of Proposition 5, the
Indian gaming initiative, said every consultant would prefer that
Steinwinder work exclusively with them _ but very few want to run a
campaign without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have someone like that, you have your hands tied
behind your back,'' Muller says. ``I would prefer that he didn't
(work both sides) but I can't control that, and his integrity is
beyond reproach.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinwinder says the consultants don't even try to wheedle the
other side's strategy out of him. ``They won't get an answer out of
me,'' he says. ``I'm hired to produce. I'm not hired to spy, and
they know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he acknowledges, ``It's a very awkward situation to be in
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinwinder isn't the only person providing computer services to
political campaigns. Other notable companies include Political Data
in Los Angeles, and Voter Contact Services, a Hawaii firm whose
mainframes are in Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   Steinwinder actually owns two companies, both with the initials
CPS: Computerized Political Services and Critical Path Solutions,
the latter handling commercial mailings for businesses like Dolby
Laboratories and Pacific Gas and Electric.
</P>
<P>
   The companies remain private, and Steinwinder says he brings in
$1 million to $2 million in sales each year. He won't divulge
profits.
</P>
<P>
   He employs 11 people in offices in Santa Clara and Los Angeles.
His wife, Myra, a British citizen, works with him, as do two of his
four grown children.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to pictures of his own children, his office wall
features a frame with small photos of children from around the
world. They're all children he sponsors &UR;  &LR; through charities, sending
money and corresponding with them. At any given time, he's
sponsoring five children.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about those kids, the hardened cynic melts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally believe the future of the world is in the
children. The adults have screwed it up. It's going to be the kids
who save it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Although Steinwinder never went to college, he believes that
``the secret there is education. There's a star in there somewhere.
Give them a chance, and they'll blossom.''

 Data Wizard's Words of Wisdom  &HT;       
 By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Jim Steinwinder offers pungent views on a variety of topics:
<P>
   _ On using the Internet to target voters: ``There are some
attempts to use the Internet, but I don't think it's ready for
prime time. As soon as you get outside the Santa Clara Valley,
computers are not saturated like they are here. ... The Internet as
a means to replace mail, or television, or radio? Not in our
lifetime. Not gonna happen.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On working on political campaigns: ``You learn how to deal
with a lot of pressure and a lot of unhappy people.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On politicians: ``Of course, when they lose, it's your fault.
They can do no wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On ideology: ``I'm an enigma in politics. I don't care whether
the campaign is Republican or Democrat. I don't care whatever wins.
I care about my job.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On political mudslinging: ``By the time you get hit with 10 or
12 mail pieces and all of these ads attacking the other guy, you
get turned off. I'd like to see campaigns where issues get
discussed, not attacking the other guy all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On why he uses DOS instead of Windows: ``The thing in politics
is, they don't care about technology. They care about speed.
Windows has a nice interface. It's even easy to use _ sometimes.
But it's slow. When you're trying to shove as much data through the
pipeline as you can, Windows slows it down.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On changes in Silicon Valley: ``Technology goes at such a fast
pace, it's becoming more and more impersonal. The Santa Clara
Valley has changed. It's not what I grew up with. I don't mind the
computers _ I get along fine with them. It's this mass of people
... I'd like to have the apricot orchards back.''

 Teligent to Dish Out Local Phone Service by Using Its Height  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
If you work in a tall building, you could soon have an interesting
alternative to Pacific Bell for local phone service and high-speed
Internet access.
<P>
   Virginia's Teligent Inc. will soon enter the local market,
bypassing Pac Bell's wires with a network of rooftop satellite
dishes capable of delivering voice and data services _ at lower
cost than wire-based options.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  During a recent visit to San Francisco, Teligent chief
executive Alex Mandl explained how his company will get around Pac
Bell's biggest asset: the wires that run to every office and home.
</P>
<P>
   Teligent will mount wireless dishes atop customers' office
buildings in San Francisco and Oakland. Those dishes will transmit
phone calls and high-speed Internet traffic to and from Teligent's
central dish in Oakland, bypassing Pac Bell's wires.
</P>
<P>
   Each dish will tap into the wiring closets in its skyscraper, so
Teligent can reach any office inside _ but only in the building _
via the wires and phone plugs in the walls.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Teligent's central dish will patch into three wire-based
networks: Pac Bell's phone switches for local calls, Frontier's
long-distance lines and the Internet backbone.
</P>
<P>
   Home consumers miss out. So do businesses in short buildings.
Teligent will target businesses in skyscrapers. Blame the
technology. The satellite dishes need a clear line of sight to the
big dish in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Dawson, a telecommunications analyst in New York, said
Winstar Communications of New York is right behind Teligent in
deploying a similar service also aimed at business customers.
</P>
<P>
   Several firms, called competitive local exchange carriers or
CLECs, already offer data and local voice services in California.
But they've mainly focused on data services, and most of them use
Pac Bell's wires to reach their customers, according to Michael
Bloom, a telecommunications analyst in San Ramon.
</P>
<P>
   He said Teligent's wireless network should let it offer phone
service at lower cost than other CLECs or Pac Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell spokesman Paul Cohen noted that all the newcomers focus
on business clients, leaving Pac Bell to serve residential
customers.
</P>
<P>
   And he couldn't resist getting in a word for Pac Bell's
long-sought agenda: selling long-distance. The fact that Teligent
will push phone service, in addition to data, only proves local
competition exists, he said. Therefore, the Baby Bells should be
allowed to enter the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get into long-distance, then you'll see real
competition at the local level,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; EFF Turnover: &LR;  After less than a year, Barry Steinhardt has
resigned as president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San
Francisco advocacy group. His departure for personal reasons
highlights EFF's growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who think it's never really been an
organization as much as a collection of unique individuals,'' said
one EFF watcher in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Investment banker Giles McNamee, who's been on EFF's board for
over two years, said the group has outgrown its fringe image and
become a mainstream player on free speech and privacy issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first joined, we had two weeks' cash on hand,'' he
said. Today, EFF has enough to pay its staff of nine for a year.
</P>
<P>
   EFF co-founder John Gilmore said there are some differences in
style between EFF's long-hairs _ himself and co-founder John Perry
Barlow _ and more buttoned-down board members like Esther Dyson or
Lori Fena, who think ``we need to appeal more to people in suits.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gilmore said EFF's board is united on finding a new
president with the same organizational savvy as Steinhardt, who
learned the nonprofit ropes at the American Civil Liberties Union.
EFF has even asked Isaacson &AMP; Miller, a Boston headhunting firm, to
find its new chief.
</P>
<P>
   EFF also wants to grow its membership, now a paltry 965. But
Gilmore admitted there was some board-level talk about whether EFF,
which has crusaded against spam, should send junk mail to attract
members.
</P>
<P>
   So spare 'em the anguish and visit the Web site  &LR; (www.eff.org &LR; )
to find out how you, too, can become a card-carrying member.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Foreign affairs?  &LR; Want to sell in Europe but don't parlez
vous? For a fee, Protege Software &LR;  (www.protege.co.uk) &LR;  will set up
your office, hire staff, provide a general manager and turn over
the keys.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been lots of horror stories about how companies
have lost their boots in Europe because they didn't understand the
cultural nuances,'' said Protege CEO Larry Levy.
</P>
<P>
   There's a cultural nuance; here we lose our shirts. But Levy
helped NetGravity of San Mateo sell its Internet advertising
software in Europe without shedding anything. ``Other U.S.
companies (should) consider Protege instead of building their
European operation themselves,'' said NetGravity CEO John Danner.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Hollenbeck, with H&AMP;Q Venture Associates, said Protege has
helped one of his startups, Vignette, open a European market for
Web management software. For Vignette, it's been great. But
Hollenbeck wonders how long Protege can keep building beachheads
for new companies.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Levy is managing European offices for eight U.S.
startups. Oops. Make that nine. He phoned me from a car phone to
say Virage, the San Mateo firm that sells video search tools, just
hired Protege to keep its boots on.

SPORTS COLUMN: BELL-TINKLERS TAUNT STRUGGLING STARS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The tinkle of bells on the sidewalk in front of a
midtown hotel Wednesday afternoon appeared to be hurrying the
season. But it was not quite the familiar sound ringing from
soldiers of the Salvation Army seeking alms during Yuletide. There
was indeed a handful of people, not wearing red but black _ black
caps and black-and-white shirts _ and standing beside cardboard
boxes designed for contributions.
</P>
<P>
   They held up placards reading ``NBA Canned Food Drive _ Give
Generously.'' ``Help Feed the Players and Owners.'' ``Bring on the
Ticket Prices Increase.'' And the always ominous, ``Prepare _ The
Sports Apocalypse Is Coming!''
</P>
<P>
   These eleemosynary souls were stationed near the entrance to the
hotel where the National Basketball Association players and owners
were meeting to try to iron out their heart-rending differences
concerning, as David Stern, commissioner of the NBA said, the split
of ``the one-billion-dollar-plus revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   The lockout, as Patrick Ewing, the president of the players
union and a man making the keeping-the-wolf-from-the-door salary of
$18 million a year, had said with a straight face, ``is about
survival, about being able to feed our families.''
</P>
<P>
   The bell tinklers were led by a man named Steve Siegel, who
traveled here from his home in San Diego to try to help the players
and owners out ``from the goodness of my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   He is the president of an organization called Fans Union.
Siegel, a slight, bearded middle-aged man, was, for want of another
figure, the voice and embodiment of the Everyman Fan.
</P>
<P>
   How long has his organization been in existence?
</P>
<P>
   ``About a week,'' Siegel said. ``This lockout inspired it. The
players and owners, after all, are suffering. The owners need to
buy their Cuban cigars and Russian caviar. The players need to make
payments on their nine cars and their 14 gold watches.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said that some people passing by made contributions.
Someone dropped a can of sardines, another a can of Alpo, a third
some cat food. ``Someone wanted to contribute money and had a
nickel,'' he said, ``but he asked for change.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the smile left his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is enough,'' he said. ``We fans should stand up to both
these ridiculous groups and stop this nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel is not quite sure how to do it, other than boycott games
and stop watching games on television, which would hurt
advertisers, which would reduce television revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened to some degree in baseball over the last few
years,'' Siegel said. ``The players and owners think their cash cow
can go on forever. But Michael Jordan will be leaving soon, and
then what? You've got Chris Webber and Latrell Sprewell and I see
where Nick Van Exel just found a team. This is what we have to look
forward to, and with higher and higher ticket prices?''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult for a fan to sympathize with either side, but in
this corner, the edge goes to the players. The issues of a hard and
soft cap, of revenue sharing, are often lost in the welter of
stupefying utterances, from Kenny Anderson, at $5.8 million a year,
lamenting that ``the more money you make, the more you spend'' to,
well, multimillionaire owners steeling for a war to clutch a
thicker share of the billion-plus.
</P>
<P>
   But Mario Elie, the Houston Rockets' veteran guard, wisely said,
``Guys have to learn how to manage their money.'' He added that
when you're making $2.5 million a year, as he is ``that alone could
set you up.''
</P>
<P>
   Elie could have said the same for the owners. At bottom, the
players have as much right to make as much as they can as do the
owners. And it is the owners who are paying the salaries. Only
because they believe they can make profit from it.
</P>
<P>
   And Stephon Marbury mused about the owners, ``If they're giving
out a hundred million for a player, how much are they making?''
</P>
<P>
   So a few more games _ through November _ were canceled while
negotiations continue. No matter. Even if all the regular-season
games were canceled, the league could still hold a playoffs. The
playoffs are what the NBA is all about anyway, isn't it? Sure, jump
right into the playoffs, and include all the teams, and add a
month, or more, and prorate salaries. And recoup millions.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Ewing had come by the Fans Union, and laughed. ``Right
on!'' he said. But he never dipped into his pocket to aid the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Stern. When asked if the league contributed anything to
the charitable group on the street, he smiled kindly from within
his freshly minted gray goatee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave at the office,'' he said.
</P>

AMAZON SAYS SALES SOARED AS QUARTERLY LOSS NARROWED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wash.)   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amazon.com Inc., the leading online bookseller, Wednesday
reported a quadrupling of sales and a narrower-than-expected
third-quarter loss.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon said it also became the leading online music retailer in
the quarter, with sales of $14.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported results after the close of the stock
market. In NASDAQ trading, Amazon shares closed at $117.0625, up 75
cents.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Amazon reported a loss of $45.2
million, compared with a loss of $9.6 million in a year earlier.
Sales soared to $153.7 million from $37.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's third-quarter 1998 earnings included $20.5 million of
costs related to mergers and acquisitions. Excluding those one-time
items, Amazon lost $24.7 million, or 49 cents a diluted share.
Analysts surveyed by the First Call Corp. had expected the company
to lose 57 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very grateful to our customers for choosing Amazon.com
as their online music store so quickly,'' Jeffrey P. Bezos,
Amazon's founder and chief executive, said in a statement. ``Though
pleased with these results, we know our growth initiatives will
continue to require aggressive investment and entail significant
execution challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Although sales quadrupled, the cost of sales nearly did so as
well, at $118.8 million, compared with $30.7 million in the period
a year earlier. Amazon's continued losses despite growing sales
reflect the high cost of acquiring and retaining customers as
traditional book retailers like Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. launch their
own services on the World Wide Web. Moving into music sales pits it
against against online music stores like CDNow Inc., which agreed
to buy a rival, N2K Inc., this month.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, based in Seattle, said cumulative customer accounts
increased by more than 1.2 million during the third quarter to
nearly 4.5 million. A year earlier, accounts totaled 940,000.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat customers accounted for more than 64 percent of orders
during the quarter, Amazon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the business model continues to work,'' said Lise J.
Buyer, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. ``For those who
argued that Amazon is just catering to the digerati and Internet
nerds, 4.5 million customers is a pretty big refutation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Amazon has yet to make money, she said, ``they've
always said that making money early was not their goal; making a
lot of money some time is.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, Amazon.com acquired two companies, Planetall and
Junglee, in stock swaps valued at about $280 million. Planetall
provides a Web-based address book, calendar, and reminder service.
Junglee provides Web-based database technology that can help
shoppers find products on the Internet.

 Church Hospital Challenges Labor Law  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A Ukiah hospital owned by Seventh-day Adventists says it should be
exempt from U.S. labor laws because of its religious affiliation,
in a dispute that could become a test case for worker rights in
religious hospitals.
<P>
   Ukiah Valley Medical Center, a 101-bed hospital owned by
Adventist Health, has asked federal labor officials to reject a
request by 75 percent of its registered nurses for a union
election.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital administrators say requiring them to recognize and
bargain with a union would violate their constitutional right to
religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teachings of the Adventist faith prohibit Adventist
institutions such as Ukiah from recognizing or bargaining with a
union,'' hospital lawyers wrote in a brief submitted last week to
the National Labor Relations Board.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the California Nurses Association is arguing that the
nurses _ most of whom are not themselves Adventists _ have as much
of a right to organize as any health care workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a misuse of religion that it's astounding,'' said
Rose Ann DeMoro, executive director of CNA. ``There isn't anything
in the law that says employers should be able to force their
religious beliefs (about unions) on their workers.''
</P>
<P>
   With about $38 million in revenues, Ukiah Valley Medical Center
is one of 14 hospitals in California and 159 hospitals worldwide
operated by the 10 million-member Seventh-day Adventist church.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the only religious hospital currently facing a union
drive. Union organizing has been on the upswing at all kinds of
health care institutions in recent years as workers chafe against
the cost-cutting that has accompanied the spread of managed care.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ukiah Valley union dispute is different from others
because so far, only Ukiah Valley has claimed a religious exemption
from the National Labor Relations Act, which gives workers the
right to organize.
</P>
<P>
   The Seventh-day Adventists _ an evangelical Christian
denomination founded in the 19th century _ strictly prohibit their
members from belonging to unions. They say individual union
membership runs counter to Jesus' teachings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Church believes that the self-sacrifice required for its
healing mission is inherently incompatible with the economically
self-serving goals of unions,'' the lawyers for Ukiah Medical wrote
in their NLRB brief.
</P>
<P>
   The Adventists also say collective bargaining with a union would
interfere with hospital administrators' ability to receive policy
guidance directly from God.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are required to seek God's direct guidance and direction
with how we employ our resources,'' said Alan Reinach, an Adventist
official testifying before the NLRB. Union negotiations ``would be
a direct interference with our process of seeking God's guidance
and leadership for the operation of the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Although run by the Adventist church, Ukiah Valley Medical
Center plays an important role in the broader non-Adventist
community that surrounds it.
</P>
<P>
   The only hospital in Ukiah, it was formed when Ukiah Adventist
Hospital took over secular Ukiah General Hospital in 1988. It
receives a significant portion of its revenues from federal sources
such as Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Of its 170 registered nurses, fewer than 20 are Adventists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived here for 21 years and raised my family here,'' said
Cinda Johansen, a non-Adventist nurse who has worked at Ukiah
Valley Medical Center for 11 years. ``When I went back to school to
become a nurse, I wanted to stay in Ukiah. This is the only game in
town. We're sort of a captive audience here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ukiah nurses decided to form a union last spring when budget
troubles led the hospital to cancel a planned pay raise and a
long-standing bonus program. Most nurses at Ukiah Valley earn about
$20 an hour, according to the hospital, several dollars less than
at some other rural hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been at the top of our pay scale for four years, and the
only raise I've gotten in that time was on my 10-year anniversary,
and that was 20 cents,'' Johansen said.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials say they intend to give their staff raises as
soon as finances stabilize. ``We are working to square things
around so we can reinstitute step increases,'' said ValGene Devitt,
CEO of the hospital. ``We anticipate being able to give raises
before January.''
</P>
<P>
   The nurses say their complaints also extend beyond wages to
concerns about staffing levels and patient care. ``We're asked to
do more and more with less and less,'' said Linda Webster, a nurse
who has worked at Ukiah Valley since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, about 75 percent of the nurses signed cards
requesting a union election.
</P>
<P>
   The company responded with its request for exemption from the
National Labor Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
   The legal arguments are fairly complex and revolve around a 1993
law passed by Congress called the Religious Freedom Restoration
Act, which said government must show a ``compelling state
interest'' before requiring someone to obey a law that clashes with
his or her religion.
</P>
<P>
   Before passage of RFRA, the courts had ruled that religious
hospitals were clearly covered by federal labor laws. In one 1980
case, a Wisconsin nursing home run by the Adventist church was
ordered to let its workers unionize.
</P>
<P>
   Ukiah Valley Medical Center is arguing that RFRA now imposes a
higher standard on government when it comes to enforcing laws that
would violate religious practices. The hospital says that under
RFRA, it should not be required to let workers unionize.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the nurses say the argument holds little water.
``It's questionable whether RFRA is even constitutional,'' said
Jane Lawhon, the Oakland lawyer representing CNA.
</P>
<P>
   But Ukiah Valley says it intends to pursue its case through the
NLRB's hearing process and appeal it to the courts if necessary _
even to the U.S. Supreme Court. ``I wouldn't rule that out,''
Devitt said. ``The ramifications are larger than one little
hospital.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ President Clinton is scheduled to arrive
at Palm Beach International Airport at the end of rush hour today
for a hurried three-hour, make-up reception and dinner in Palm
Beach to raise money for the state Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be gone again before dessert.
</P>
<P>
   All that assumes once-and-future astronaut John Glenn and the
shuttle Discovery blast off on time at 2 p.m. Clinton, Gov. Lawton
Chiles and gubernatorial candidate Buddy MacKay will watch the
launch at Cape Canaveral.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles will hitch a ride on Air Force One for the trip to Palm
Beach County. For security reasons, officials won't reveal his
route from the airport to Palm Beach but Vice President Al Gore's
motorcade took the Royal Park (middle) Bridge earlier this month,
tying up midday traffic.
</P>
<P>
   While Chiles and MacKay strum a few strings with Jimmy Buffett
at a hastily-scheduled rally in the courtyard of the county
government center, Clinton will meet 100 folks who paid $2,500 for
a handshake at a 7:10 p.m. reception at the Palm Beach condominium
of Democratic donor S. Daniel Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   The reception is to raise money for a Political Action Committee
maintained by U.S. Rep. Peter Deutsch, D-Fort Lauderdale, to help
Democratic congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the reception folks will be ushered out and replaced with
60 or 70 others who paid $5,000 a person for an 8:30 p.m. dinner
with the president. This money will go to the Florida Democratic
Party, which will help MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham, the founder and chairman of Slim-Fast Foods Co., also
was the host for Gore's lunchtime visit Oct. 13. Clinton had to
cancel his appearance because of federal budget politicking.
</P>
<P>
   It's all very private. Clinton is not scheduled to make any
public appearances here.

EXECUTIVE FROM AMERICA ONLINE APPEARS AS GOVERNMENT WITNESS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY and STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Firsthand testimony from a senior executive at
America Online and new documents introduced in court on Wednesday
provided an extraordinarily detailed portrait of Microsoft Corp.'s
campaign to thwart a planned partnership between the nation's
largest online service and Netscape Communications Corp.,
Microsoft's rival in the Internet software market.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's main weapon in the campaign, the government alleges
in its antitrust suit, was offering America Online a prime place on
the desktop of its industry-standard Windows operating system. That
deal, the Justice Department contends, is an example of how
Microsoft illegally used the market power derived from its monopoly
in operating-system software to stifle competition in the market
for the browser software used to navigate the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1995, America Online and Netscape, the browser
pioneer, were eager to forge a strategic alliance to fight
Microsoft, which they saw as ``the common enemy,'' according to an
internal document written by Stephen Case, the chairman of America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   In the internal e-mail, a draft document circulated among senior
America Online executives before being sent back to Netscape, Case
said he agreed wholeheartedly with a recent message from Marc
Andreessen, one of Netscape's founders, urging the two companies to
``use our unique respective strengths to'' resist ``the Beast from
Redmond that wants to see us both dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser competed against
Netscape's Navigator, which was then the industry-leading Web
software, and its MSN online service was seen as an important
challenger to America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by March 1996, the planned America Online-Netscape alliance
had been abandoned and America Online chose Internet Explorer as
its main browser _ a big lift for Microsoft in the browser market,
as its software was soon used by millions of America Online
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   During dogged cross-examination by John Warden, Microsoft's lead
lawyer, David Colburn, a senior vice president at America Online,
held firmly to his assertion that the pivotal consideration for
choosing Internet Explorer was that Microsoft eventually agreed to
put a start-up button for America Online in a folder on the Windows
desktop _ ``a critically important competitive factor that was
impossible for Netscape to match.''
</P>
<P>
   In court on Wednesday, Warden repeatedly sought to argue that
America Online chose Microsoft's browser largely because
Microsoft's software was technically superior _ and he introduced
internal documents from America Online engineers who preferred
Microsoft's technology.
</P>
<P>
   But when he asked if that was so, Colburn said simply, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   The government entered into evidence e-mail messages intended to
support Colburn's answer _ including one written by Bill Gates,
Microsoft's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail message written on Jan. 8, 1996, Gates was
describing to four of his executives a recent telephone
conversation he had had with Case of America Online. Gates wrote
that Case had told him that he ``views us technically as behind
Netscape but credible enough to do a very good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates added, ``I said integration with Windows will be great for
his users.''
</P>
<P>
   An internal e-mail message from Case to several members of his
executive team a few weeks later suggests that he was bargaining
hard with Gates _ and that Microsoft's technology was neither
inferior nor the only consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a pure technology standpoint, it does look like Microsoft
may win this one,'' Case wrote on Jan. 24, 1996. ``Couple that with
their distribution (OS) muscle, then Netscape clearly faces an
uphill battle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OS'' referred to Microsoft's operating system, Windows, which
is loaded on more than 90 percent of personal computers shipped
today.
</P>
<P>
   After introducing the Case e-mail in court, Warden asked Colburn
if it did not suggest that Microsoft had won the America Online
deal mainly because of its superior technology.
</P>
<P>
   Colburn gave little ground, saying that he would focus more on
the second sentence of the Case e-mail, which referred to
``distribution muscle.'' And, Colburn added, ``In the first
sentence he says Microsoft may win, which is hardly a ringing
endorsement.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's position on the deal is that America Online ``played
Microsoft and Netscape off against each other, and in the end
Microsoft won fair and square,'' Mark Murray, a Microsoft
spokesman, said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Warden used his cross-examination to question America Online's
motives for testifying on the government's behalf. He noted that
proposals for an alliance with Netscape in 1995 called for America
Online to pull back from some software development efforts and for
America Online to handle the programming for Netscape's popular Web
site, now called Netcenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In your dealings with the Justice Department to defeat the
`Beast from Redmond,''' Warden asked, ``did you disclose that you
had proposed a market division agreement with Netscape?''
</P>
<P>
   A central allegation in the government's case against Microsoft
is that it illegally proposed dividing up the browser market with
Netscape in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
   To the question, Colburn replied, ``Those are your words, not
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   After the day's court session, David Boies, the lead trial
lawyer for the Justice Department, said that the Microsoft defense
team's focus on a proposed arrangement between Netscape and America
Online was another attempt by Microsoft to ``change the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The antitrust rules are different for a company with monopoly
dominance like Microsoft,'' Boies said. ``In the case of Netscape
and America Online, neither one of them had monopoly power.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time the deal was being negotiated, however, America
Online was four times as large as its nearest competitor, and
Netscape had an estimated 84 percent of the browser market.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The East Lake Meadows housing project was once so
violent that it was nicknamed Little Vietnam. Drug dealers ruled.
Many residents of Atlanta's East Lake section lived in fear during
the 1980s, particularly those in the project.
</P>
<P>
   The deteriorating East Lake Golf Club, where the legendary Bobby
Jones learned to play, was just another casualty of the
neighborhood. Surrounding it was an environment where premature
death was part of the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``About six or seven years ago, the drug dealers started
shooting out, and we started shooting in,'' said Carlos Banda, a
25-year-veteran of the Atlanta police force, who works in the East
Lake area. ``A small child was killed. Even after that, it didn't
get that much better.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the situation facing Tom Cousins, a local real estate
developer and philanthropist, in 1993 when he bought the golf club:
a course in desperate need of restoration, and a community in
desperate need of hope.
</P>
<P>
   Amid East Lake's brush and dirt, Cousins saw an opportunity to
secure a legacy as the man who saved Jones' golfing home and helped
to revive a blighted neighborhood in the process. From his own
charitable foundation, Cousins spun off the East Lake Community
Foundation, and he used it as the linchpin for a complex marriage
involving the golf course, the federal government, city officials
and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Together they raised $93.5 million, with the goal of reviving
the golf course and the East Lake community _ through new housing,
an after-school academic program, a community center, a golf
academy and a caddie scholarship program that has sent some East
Lake youths on to college.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been many efforts to attract members of
minority groups to golf, this plan was unique in its ambitious
attempt to use the sport as a vehicle for urban restoration. The
undertaking will gain national attention beginning Thursday when
East Lake is host to the Tour Championship, one of professional
golf's most prestigious events.
</P>
<P>
   It is a somewhat odd partnership: golf, a sport with a history
of exclusion, being used to revitalize a troubled, predominantly
African-American neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, many corporate leaders were skeptical. Politicians
disagreed on a course of action. Some within the community
resisted, feeling they were given little voice in the effort;
others were distrustful, having been betrayed in the past by
numerous broken promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, if people asked you where you lived, you better not
say East Lake,'' said Geraldine Lowery, who moved with her
children, Meoshia and Rodriquez, into a new town house last spring.
``When they first started talking about doing this, I thought it
was a joke. Then when they started building the new places, I said,
`They're not really going to let us live over here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm happy, very happy. I wanted something better for my
children, and this is it. And this is how I knew things had
changed: My mother never used to want to have any family
get-togethers at my house. But one day when we were talking about
getting together, my mom said, `Let's do it at your house.' That
made me happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowery said that when her children were toddlers, she had taught
them how to roll off the bed and onto the floor when they heard
gunfire, and how to keep their heads low to avoid possible stray
bullets coming through the window. Now, both children attend the
golf academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what they've done is absolutely phenomenal,'' said
Tiger Woods, who will play at East Lake this week. ``It says a lot
for that community. It's just a matter of everyone coming together.
And you don't find that very often. Somebody always has some kind
of agenda, instead of everyone pulling together for a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiative began earlier this decade when federal money from
the Department of Housing and Urban Development was secured. In
1993, Cousins' own charitable organization _ the CF Foundation _
bought the course, and two years later it focused on the East Lake
area and formed the East Lake Community Foundation. Together with
contributions from the Atlanta Housing Authority and private
donations, the money to finance the plan was raised.
</P>
<P>
   What happens to the East Lake community over time will be a
large part of Cousins' legacy. Now 66 years old, he played at East
Lake as a child in the 1940s, and his respect for Jones and the
course was embedded at a young age.
</P>
<P>
   A wealthy developer who is well known in Atlanta, Cousins
developed the downtown Omni complex and NationsBank plaza. He could
have simply renovated East Lake Golf Club and still drawn rave
reviews for restoring a part of golf history. But he chose not to
ignore what was on the other side of East Lake's gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me all the time why am I doing this,'' Cousins
said. ``It's like they're waiting for the other shoe to drop. We
need to do something about situations like this all over the
country, or we're going to lose our future. If I had grown up the
way a lot of kids had to grow up in East Lake, I would have gone
bad a lot sooner than most of them did.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Cousins hopes the project will serve as a model for
similar efforts elsewhere in the country, and is determined to make
his case to investors nationwide. Of the 100 corporate memberships
at East Lake, 90 have been reserved for corporations outside
Atlanta. Those memberships cost $250,000, with $200,000 of that
earmarked for the East Lake Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to attract 100 of America's best and brightest
corporations so that they see what we do, and take it back to their
cities,'' Cousins said. ``This has been a problem all across the
country. Public housing has been very poorly done and conceived. In
the past, our foundation has donated to hunger programs, school
programs and housing programs, but we were never really satisfied
with the result. This time, we decided to focus on one area, to see
if we could come up with some solutions. We focused on East Lake
Meadows.''
</P>
<P>
   To visit the East Lake community now is to see a rejuvenated
neighborhood. The golf course, restored by the noted architect Rees
Jones, is in immaculate condition, and the picturesque clubhouse
includes personal artifacts belonging to Jones, who won 13 major
championships from 1923 to 1930. The club seeks neighborhood
youngsters and local college students for the caddie program, with
all student caddies eligible for the foundation's college
scholarship program.
</P>
<P>
   But the most impressive restoration has occurred outside the
golf course's black wrought-iron gates. Old housing projects have
been demolished and replaced by new housing called the Villages of
East Lake, where middle-income and low-income families are living
side by side in 182 new units, including single-family homes,
duplexes and apartments. An additional 318 new units are planned,
for a total of 500, with construction to begin sometime next year
on the opposite side of the course.
</P>
<P>
   Working residents are responsible for the rent, which ranges up
to $820 a month for a two-bedroom unit. Unemployed residents are
required to pay what they had been paying at East Lake Meadows, but
under the lease agreement they must also participate in a
self-sufficiency program that focuses on education, job readiness
and life skills training. If unemployed tenants get jobs, their
rents will increase an amount relative to their salaries.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the project, East Lake residents were given
the choice of moving into the new housing or relocating to other
areas of Atlanta. Today, some of the residents who turned down the
opportunity are now trying to get into the new development.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can understand why some people would be leery about
wanting to stay in this neighborhood, no matter how much we talked
about what was going to happen,'' said Scarlet Pressley, the golf
academy's director of community affairs. ``There were so many bad
memories here. People had lost family members to violence here. But
now that they have seen the positive changes in the community, a
lot of them want to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   According to city statistics, the neighborhood has seen a
dramatic drop in crime rate, and a dramatic increase in property
values. Now, instead of moving out, people are looking to move in,
particularly since the area is only about a 10-minute drive from
downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Charlie Yates Golf Course, a new 18-hole public facility,
has been built in the neighborhood; Woods attending the official
opening last month. Financing is in place to build a YMCA adjacent
to the Yates course. And the East Lake Golf Academy, a golf and
academic after-school program, provides tutoring for neighborhood
youths and regular golf instruction to 115 children who otherwise
might not have any exposure to the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Puryear, a former golf team captain at Tennessee State
University and the director of junior golf at the academy, has seen
first-hand the difference golf has made to the children in the
neighborhood. Asked how many children in the academy had parents
who played golf, Puryear said: ``None of their parents play golf,
not one. And now look at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Erick Poteat, a promising 13-year-old golfer, was about 20 yards
in front of Puryear, painstakingly hitting a bucket of balls on the
same driving range where a month before he had been introduced to
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes you want to study, because you want to be able to
play golf,'' Poteat said. ``I want to be a pro golfer, but if not,
I want to be an architect.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, not everyone is content, which was probably unavoidable,
considering the magnitude of the undertaking around East Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Davis, president of the East Lake Meadows Tenants
Association, has lived in the community for almost 30 years, and
she bristles at the way she feels the plan was pushed onto local
residents. `` Cousins and his group want to do things, but do it
their way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She is also fighting for 28 more families whose apartments are
scheduled to be demolished, asking that they be housed temporarily
in the new village. Organizers have offered a compromise of 15
families, but that has not yet been accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could go back to the bargaining table and work some of
these issues out, I would be the happiest 63-year-old woman in the
world,'' said Davis, who has threatened legal action if some of her
demands are not met. ``I'm proud of what has happened here, and I
had a lot of these same visions before anybody else even cared. But
the residents deserve to have their say in everything, and that
hasn't always happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two former East Lake Golf Club employees, Andy
Portilla and Richard Trent, sued the club in March, saying there
were fired because of discrimination. Portilla is Hispanic, Trent
is African-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say anything bad about Cousins, or what he's
trying to do,'' said Portilla, a former assistant caddie master at
East Lake, who caddied last week for Brandel Chamblee at the
National Car Rental Golf Classic. ``In fact, I came to East Lake
because I believed in the program, and I still do. I'm just saying
that not everyone who works for Cousins is like he is, and I wasn't
treated fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at East Lake have vehemently denied Portilla's
charges, and point to the club's strong record in hiring members of
minority groups since Cousins arrived. Sedric Jackson, an
African-American, was recently hired as the head golf professional
for the Yates course.
</P>
<P>
   But whenever Cousins grows weary of the many challenges and
disputes that have accompanied this venture, he can look out the
window at a changed golf course and a changed community to draw
inspiration. To see 30 of golf's greatest players competing at East
Lake this week will be the latest example of how much things have
changed.
</P>
<P>
   When the golfers and the fans depart after this weekend, the
neighborhood and the golf course will be left behind, hoping to
continue the progress that has been made. And golf may be viewed in
a different light, as a vehicle for social change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure a lot of people thought this was a crazy idea,''
Puryear said. ``Look around this place. This isn't crazy. This is
beautiful.''

CONE GRANTED A WEEK TO WEIGH YANKEES' OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Cone's affiliation with the Yankees could have
ended Wednesday. But the pitcher, apparently intent on working out
an agreement that would keep him in pinstripes, agreed to wait an
additional week before deciding whether to accept a $5.5 million
deal for the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Yankees and Cone have until midnight Wednesday to
explore middle ground and possibly negotiate a new deal. There
could be major obstacles to hurdle, however, to prevent the 20-game
winner from becoming a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Cone's future is one of a number of issues that Yankees'
officials are dealing with: others include the remote possibility
of signing the cantankerous slugger Albert Belle; re-signing
center-fielder Bernie Williams in a financial market that rewards
stars with contracts of nearly $100 million; retaining third
baseman Scott Brosius, and investigating the possibility of signing
Kevin Brown or Randy Johnson, star free-agent pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Cone, coming off surgery to correct an aneurysm in 1996 and
shoulder surgery after the 1997 season, earned the right to accept
or reject a $5.5 million option for 1999 when he pitched more than
200 innings this season.
</P>
<P>
   Cone earned his 20th victory in his final start and will most
likely get some secondary consideration for the American League's
Cy Young Award, a performance that would usually be rewarded with
far more than a one-year, $5.5-million deal; that is why Cone
didn't accept the 1999 option immediately.
</P>
<P>
   If Cone were younger than his 35 years and had a clean medical
history, the Yankees would probably be rushing to reach a new
agreement. But Cone generally struggled through the final month of
the regular season, and in two of his four starts in the
post-season, his arm seemingly tired.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the Yankees have not pushed to hammer out a new
agreement; rather, it appears they have been waiting to see if Cone
would accept his one-year option, demonstrating little willingness
to exercise Cone's $5.5 million option for the year 2000, or to
give him money in addition to the $5.5 million for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Cone could almost certainly sign for more money elsewhere. The
Los Angeles Dodgers, now managed by Cone's former manager, Davey
Johnson, could have interest, and the Baltimore Orioles may make an
offer.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone has played most of his career in New York, and his wife
has a business in Greenwich, Conn., and his willingness to wait a
week before making his decision is a strong indication he would
like to stay here.
</P>
<P>
   Cone, who could not be reached for comment, agreed to the
one-week extension Wednesday on a conference call with George
Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, Brian Cashman, the
general manager, and Steve Fehr, Cone's agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Cone has been a big part of this organization,'' Cashman
said, ``and this gives both sides a chance to think about the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Yankees will at least look into signing Belle, who has
until Dec. 2 to consider offers from other teams or accept the
remaining three years and $30 million on his current contract with
the Chicago White Sox. Belle is among the game's best hitters, but
has a history of confrontations with reporters and fans and was
disliked by teammates in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, who presented $200,000 for hurricane victims in
the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico at the ground-breaking
Wednesday for the 33rd Precinct in Washington Heights, said Belle's
reputation did not concern him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's history scares me _ who came from deeper problems
than Darryl and Doc?'' said Steinbrenner, referring to Darryl
Strawberry and Dwight Gooden. ``We couldn't be crucified any more
than when we signed those two.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will consider all the possibilities when they have
staff meetings in Tampa, Fla., beginning Monday.
</P>
<P>
   _ The seven-year, $91 million deal signed by the Mets' Mike
Piazza on Monday will very likely drive up the bidding on Williams,
and Steinbrenner tweaked the Mets for their generosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that all of baseball has been a bit shocked,''
Steinbrenner said. ``I hear that others are quite upset.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Cashman left a message Wednesday for the agent representing
Kevin Brown, and intends to call the agents representing Randy
Johnson. Cashman also contacted the agent for outfielder Brian
Jordan, whom the Yankees might pursue if Williams signs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Los Angeles Dodgers offered the reliever Jeff Shaw in
return for Mariano Rivera, the Yankees' closer, but the Yankees
rejected that proposal. &QL;

END OF STRAIGHT-TICKET VOTING MAY BACKFIRE ON ILLINOIS GOP

(See also ILL-GOV-RACE) 
(bl) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ It was an old hard-nosed politician, Paddy Bauler, who
crowed defiantly, and accurately, in 1955, ``Chicago ain't ready
for reform.''
</P>
<P>
   But the good government crowd, not-so-affectionately called
goo-goos in some precincts here, has finally prevailed. One of the
staples of the Democratic machine _ one-punch, straight-ticket
voting _ has been eliminated. Election Day, on Tuesday, will be the
first time in more than a century that Illinois voters will be
required to choose each candidate, rather than having the option to
endorse a party slate with a single swipe.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when television advertisements have much more
political power than any precinct captain, the end of
straight-ticket voting illustrates the weakening grip of parties on
the political process.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans here had quite a bit to do with this, as well.
When they briefly controlled the state Legislature, the Republicans
in 1997 pushed through a bill that banned the one-punch system in
Illinois. But now Republicans are wondering whether it might
backfire downstate and in the suburbs, where voters have become
adept at punching the Republican straight-ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The single, straight-ticket punch was perfected by Democratic
Party organizations in big cities, where loyalty to the machine
meant jobs and other favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sold as a way for immigrants to make their votes
count,'' said Paul Green, a political science professor at
Governor's State University in Chicago and the author of several
books on Chicago politics. Nearly 20 states still allow voting a
straight-ticket with a single stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Under Mayor Anton Cermak, who brought the fabled Chicago machine
to power in the 1930s, the straight-ticket fostered loyalty among
party workers and voters. Cermak, who adopted a one-for-all
philosophy, would analyze the voter turnout in Chicago
neighborhoods and rank his top ward committeemen _ a rating system
not unlike the Top 20 for college football. A familiar battle cry
of Cermak went: ``Only lazy precinct captains steal.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of single-punch voting saw it as a way to keep voters in
the dark about candidates. David Starrett, a spokesman for the
Independent Voters of Illinois, a nonpartisan group that calls for
election reforms, said voters ``ought to think about individual
candidates and do their homework,'' rather than simply depend on
the party label.
</P>
<P>
   He said the single-punch system made it much easier for party
bosses to punish people who did not tow the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take very long to make a single punch, and if a
voter was in the booth taking his time, the precinct captain would
make note of it,'' Starrett said. ``Questions got asked. Sometimes
garbage didn't get picked up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was part of the tight-fisted control that extended even to
campaign volunteers. Milton Rakove, the late political science
professor at the University of Illinois in Chicago, once used a
familiar political slogan for a book title, ``We Don't Want Nobody
Nobody Sent.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, the rules went, people looking for jobs in city
government or campaigns had to come with an endorsement from
someone on the inside. That power is largely gone.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard M. Daley, son of the legendary boss of the
Democratic machine, ``has not addressed a ward organization in
years,'' said Green, the political science professor.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of straight-ticket voting could mean longer lines at
the polls in Chicago, where voters will encounter a ballot with
more than 100 questions, including 33 political offices, 72 judges
up for retention, a state constitutional issue and, in some
precincts, a referendum on whether to ban alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody has a longer ballot than we do,'' said
Tom Leach, a spokesman for the Board of Elections in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois law requires that voters spend no more than 10 minutes
in the booth, no more than 5 minutes if there is a line. With more
than 100 decisions, voters would need to hurry. But the state
elections board has issued an advisory, Leach said, not to enforce
the time limit, unless someone is intentionally trying to keep
others from voting.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Andrea Moore, a sponsor of the bill to end the
one-punch system, said the old style gave too much power to party
bosses. The change could help some Republicans in strongly
Democratic Cook County, which includes Chicago, but she
acknowledged that some Republicans in other places are not so eager
to see the system changed.
</P>
<P>
   In some suburban counties, she noted, perhaps one-third of
voters have cast a straight-Republican ballot. ``Not all
Republicans thought this was such a good idea,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Brunner, the head of the Better Government Association in
Chicago, said precinct captains years ago sometimes went into the
booth with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``A precinct captain would say, `Hey, Mrs. Jones, remember how I
took care of that ticket?''' Brunner said. ``And then he'd say,
`You're a good Democrat, right? Do you know how to operate this
machine? Let me help you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Brunner, who has long been a champion of election reforms in
Chicago, said the old system, for all its warts, was not without
its merits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, the machines were kind of confusing,'' Brunner
said, ``and somebody like Mrs. Jones really did want to vote for
the Democrats.'' &QL;

   ATLANTA _ The East Lake Meadows housing project was once so
violent that it was nicknamed Little Vietnam. Drug dealers ruled.
Many residents of Atlanta's East Lake section lived in fear during
the 1980s, particularly those in the project.
</P>
<P>
   The deteriorating East Lake Golf Club, where the legendary Bobby
Jones learned to play, was just another casualty of the
neighborhood. Surrounding it was an environment where premature
death was part of the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``About six or seven years ago, the drug dealers started
shooting out, and we started shooting in,'' said Carlos Banda, a
25-year-veteran of the Atlanta police force, who works in the East
Lake area. ``A small child was killed. Even after that, it didn't
get that much better.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the situation facing Tom Cousins, a local real estate
developer and philanthropist, in 1993 when he bought the golf club:
a course in desperate need of restoration, and a community in
desperate need of hope.
</P>
<P>
   Amid East Lake's brush and dirt, Cousins saw an opportunity to
secure a legacy as the man who saved Jones' golfing home and helped
to revive a blighted neighborhood in the process. From his own
charitable foundation, Cousins spun off the East Lake Community
Foundation, and he used it as the linchpin for a complex marriage
involving the golf course, the federal government, city officials
and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Together they raised $93.5 million, with the goal of reviving
the golf course and the East Lake community _ through new housing,
an after-school academic program, a community center, a golf
academy and a caddie scholarship program that has sent some East
Lake youths on to college.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been many efforts to attract members of
minority groups to golf, this plan was unique in its ambitious
attempt to use the sport as a vehicle for urban restoration. The
undertaking will gain national attention beginning Thursday when
East Lake is host to the Tour Championship, one of professional
golf's most prestigious events.
</P>
<P>
   It is a somewhat odd partnership: golf, a sport with a history
of exclusion, being used to revitalize a troubled, predominantly
African-American neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, many corporate leaders were skeptical. Politicians
disagreed on a course of action. Some within the community
resisted, feeling they were given little voice in the effort;
others were distrustful, having been betrayed in the past by
numerous broken promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, if people asked you where you lived, you better not
say East Lake,'' said Geraldine Lowery, who moved with her
children, Meoshia and Rodriquez, into a new town house last spring.
``When they first started talking about doing this, I thought it
was a joke. Then when they started building the new places, I said,
`They're not really going to let us live over here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm happy, very happy. I wanted something better for my
children, and this is it. And this is how I knew things had
changed: My mother never used to want to have any family
get-togethers at my house. But one day when we were talking about
getting together, my mom said, `Let's do it at your house.' That
made me happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowery said that when her children were toddlers, she had taught
them how to roll off the bed and onto the floor when they heard
gunfire, and how to keep their heads low to avoid possible stray
bullets coming through the window. Now, both children attend the
golf academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what they've done is absolutely phenomenal,'' said
Tiger Woods, who will play at East Lake this week. ``It says a lot
for that community. It's just a matter of everyone coming together.
And you don't find that very often. Somebody always has some kind
of agenda, instead of everyone pulling together for a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiative began earlier this decade when federal money from
the Department of Housing and Urban Development was secured. In
1993, Cousins' own charitable organization _ the CF Foundation _
bought the course, and two years later it focused on the East Lake
area and formed the East Lake Community Foundation. Together with
contributions from the Atlanta Housing Authority and private
donations, the money to finance the plan was raised.
</P>
<P>
   What happens to the East Lake community over time will be a
large part of Cousins' legacy. Now 66 years old, he played at East
Lake as a child in the 1940s, and his respect for Jones and the
course was embedded at a young age.
</P>
<P>
   A wealthy developer who is well known in Atlanta, Cousins
developed the downtown Omni complex and NationsBank plaza. He could
have simply renovated East Lake Golf Club and still drawn rave
reviews for restoring a part of golf history. But he chose not to
ignore what was on the other side of East Lake's gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me all the time why am I doing this,'' Cousins
said. ``It's like they're waiting for the other shoe to drop. We
need to do something about situations like this all over the
country, or we're going to lose our future. If I had grown up the
way a lot of kids had to grow up in East Lake, I would have gone
bad a lot sooner than most of them did.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Cousins hopes the project will serve as a model for
similar efforts elsewhere in the country, and is determined to make
his case to investors nationwide. Of the 100 corporate memberships
at East Lake, 90 have been reserved for corporations outside
Atlanta. Those memberships cost $250,000, with $200,000 of that
earmarked for the East Lake Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to attract 100 of America's best and brightest
corporations so that they see what we do, and take it back to their
cities,'' Cousins said. ``This has been a problem all across the
country. Public housing has been very poorly done and conceived. In
the past, our foundation has donated to hunger programs, school
programs and housing programs, but we were never really satisfied
with the result. This time, we decided to focus on one area, to see
if we could come up with some solutions. We focused on East Lake
Meadows.''
</P>
<P>
   To visit the East Lake community now is to see a rejuvenated
neighborhood. The golf course, restored by the noted architect Rees
Jones, is in immaculate condition, and the picturesque clubhouse
includes personal artifacts belonging to Jones, who won 13 major
championships from 1923 to 1930. The club seeks neighborhood
youngsters and local college students for the caddie program, with
all student caddies eligible for the foundation's college
scholarship program.
</P>
<P>
   But the most impressive restoration has occurred outside the
golf course's black wrought-iron gates. Old housing projects have
been demolished and replaced by new housing called the Villages of
East Lake, where middle-income and low-income families are living
side by side in 182 new units, including single-family homes,
duplexes and apartments. An additional 318 new units are planned,
for a total of 500, with construction to begin sometime next year
on the opposite side of the course.
</P>
<P>
   Working residents are responsible for the rent, which ranges up
to $820 a month for a two-bedroom unit. Unemployed residents are
required to pay what they had been paying at East Lake Meadows, but
under the lease agreement they must also participate in a
self-sufficiency program that focuses on education, job readiness
and life skills training. If unemployed tenants get jobs, their
rents will increase an amount relative to their salaries.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the project, East Lake residents were given
the choice of moving into the new housing or relocating to other
areas of Atlanta. Today, some of the residents who turned down the
opportunity are now trying to get into the new development.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can understand why some people would be leery about
wanting to stay in this neighborhood, no matter how much we talked
about what was going to happen,'' said Scarlet Pressley, the golf
academy's director of community affairs. ``There were so many bad
memories here. People had lost family members to violence here. But
now that they have seen the positive changes in the community, a
lot of them want to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   According to city statistics, the neighborhood has seen a
dramatic drop in crime rate, and a dramatic increase in property
values. Now, instead of moving out, people are looking to move in,
particularly since the area is only about a 10-minute drive from
downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Charlie Yates Golf Course, a new 18-hole public facility,
has been built in the neighborhood; Woods attending the official
opening last month. Financing is in place to build a YMCA adjacent
to the Yates course. And the East Lake Golf Academy, a golf and
academic after-school program, provides tutoring for neighborhood
youths and regular golf instruction to 115 children who otherwise
might not have any exposure to the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Puryear, a former golf team captain at Tennessee State
University and the director of junior golf at the academy, has seen
first-hand the difference golf has made to the children in the
neighborhood. Asked how many children in the academy had parents
who played golf, Puryear said: ``None of their parents play golf,
not one. And now look at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Erick Poteat, a promising 13-year-old golfer, was about 20 yards
in front of Puryear, painstakingly hitting a bucket of balls on the
same driving range where a month before he had been introduced to
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes you want to study, because you want to be able to
play golf,'' Poteat said. ``I want to be a pro golfer, but if not,
I want to be an architect.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, not everyone is content, which was probably unavoidable,
considering the magnitude of the undertaking around East Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Davis, president of the East Lake Meadows Tenants
Association, has lived in the community for almost 30 years, and
she bristles at the way she feels the plan was pushed onto local
residents. `` Cousins and his group want to do things, but do it
their way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She is also fighting for 28 more families whose apartments are
scheduled to be demolished, asking that they be housed temporarily
in the new village. Organizers have offered a compromise of 15
families, but that has not yet been accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could go back to the bargaining table and work some of
these issues out, I would be the happiest 63-year-old woman in the
world,'' said Davis, who has threatened legal action if some of her
demands are not met. ``I'm proud of what has happened here, and I
had a lot of these same visions before anybody else even cared. But
the residents deserve to have their say in everything, and that
hasn't always happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two former East Lake Golf Club employees, Andy
Portilla and Richard Trent, sued the club in March, saying there
were fired because of discrimination. Portilla is Hispanic, Trent
is African-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say anything bad about Cousins, or what he's
trying to do,'' said Portilla, a former assistant caddie master at
East Lake, who caddied last week for Brandel Chamblee at the
National Car Rental Golf Classic. ``In fact, I came to East Lake
because I believed in the program, and I still do. I'm just saying
that not everyone who works for Cousins is like he is, and I wasn't
treated fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at East Lake have vehemently denied Portilla's
charges, and point to the club's strong record in hiring members of
minority groups since Cousins arrived. Sedric Jackson, an
African-American, was recently hired as the head golf professional
for the Yates course.
</P>
<P>
   But whenever Cousins grows weary of the many challenges and
disputes that have accompanied this venture, he can look out the
window at a changed golf course and a changed community to draw
inspiration. To see 30 of golf's greatest players competing at East
Lake this week will be the latest example of how much things have
changed.
</P>
<P>
   When the golfers and the fans depart after this weekend, the
neighborhood and the golf course will be left behind, hoping to
continue the progress that has been made. And golf may be viewed in
a different light, as a vehicle for social change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure a lot of people thought this was a crazy idea,''
Puryear said. ``Look around this place. This isn't crazy. This is
beautiful.''

BIG UNIT, NOW A FREE AGENT, HAS A SHORT LIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The second Randy Johnson sweepstakes in three months began
Wednesday. Houston won the first; who will win the second? Try the
Yankees, Anaheim, Texas, Houston, San Diego, Los Angeles or
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the teams most likely to appeal to Johnson, who became
a free agent Wednesday. He has some definite ideas about where he
would like to pitch for the next several seasons, but no ideal
situation has presented itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give Houston a chance because we're very grateful
for what they did for Randy this year,'' said Alan Nero, who, with
Barry Meister, represents Johnson. ``But at the same time we'll
entertain offers from other teams. Randy has a short list of about
six teams that meet his criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Nero did not want to discuss the criteria, but Johnson
apparently prefers pitching in the American League, wants to play
for a contender and would like to be close to his new home in
Paradise Valley, Ariz. Of the teams thought to be leading
contenders for his services, the Yankees are the farthest away
geographically but fit the other two criteria perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely will call,'' Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general
manager, said when asked about his interest in the 35-year-old
left-hander. ``I'd like to have the opportunity to bring him over
here. We'll be pursuing him _ to what level of years and dollars
remains to be seen.'' Johnson is expected to get a three- or
four-year contract at an average annual salary in the $12 million
to $14 million range.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mariners finally made Johnson available in July, the
Yankees could have had him but chose not to give up the players
that Seattle wanted. Then the Astros swooped in and snatched him
for minor leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had asked to be traded last winter after the Mariners
said that they would not sign him to a new contract, but they
retained him and he sulked. After he staggered to a 9-10 record and
4.35 earned run average in his four months with the Mariners,
Johnson responded to his new environment and the Astros' presence
in a pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   He reeled off 10 victories in 11 starts, losing the other start
while compiling a 1.28 ERA and striking out 116 and allowing a
total of 83 hits and walks in 84-and-a-third innings. He also
performed well in the playoffs, giving up 3 earned runs in 14
innings in two starts against San Diego, but lost both games.
</P>
<P>
   Some baseball people have believed that Johnson would prefer to
play for the Arizona Diamondbacks because he lives only a few miles
from their park. Joe Garagiola, the expansion team's general
manager, said Wednesday that he liked that possibility but conceded
the Diamondbacks had one or two strikes against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he plays for us, he lives at home,'' he said. ``But will we
be in the playoffs next year? Not likely. Then does he want to play
in the American League?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was one of 12 players who filed for free agency
Wednesday, raising the total to 109. Among the others: Tony
Phillips of the Mets, Mark Clark of the Cubs and Jeff Montgomery of
the Royals. &QL;

BELL ATLANTIC CHIEF MOVES TO ROTHSCHILD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raymond W. Smith, the chairman of Bell Atlantic Corp., said
Wednesday that he would become chairman of Rothschild North America
Inc., the Rothschild Group's North American holding company, in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also said that he would leave his post at Bell Atlantic by
the end of this year. As expected, Ivan G. Seidenberg, who became
Bell Atlantic's chief executive in June, will become chairman on
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   During the almost 40 years Smith has been with the telephone
company, he has built it into one of the world's biggest
telecommunications businesses. He most recently oversaw its
purchase of NYNEX and its proposed $52.9 billion acquisition of the
GTE Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring Smith is a considerable coup for the Rothschild Group,
which is seeking to bolster its North American businesses two years
after the British and French Rothschild families _ its owners _
decided to work more closely together. While the Rothschild Group
is well-established in European banking circles, it remains a
financial boutique in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telecom has been a very big area of activity for the firm
worldwide,'' said Wilbur L. Ross Jr., senior managing director at
Rothschild Inc., the group's American broker-dealer. ``This is the
first time we have been able to attract to the firm a very major
CEO respected both in telecom as well as throughout the corporate
sector.''
</P>
<P>
   To start with, even Smith did not take Rothschild too seriously.
``I was engrossed in completing the mergers of NYNEX and GTE at the
beginning _ when I was first contacted by Rothschild, so I didn't
think much of it,'' Smith, who is 62, said in an interview
Wednesday. ``But, the more we talked about it, the more I liked the
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he decided that he should ``work with some people I
really like. Baron David and Sir Evelyn are marvelous people,'' he
said referring to Baron David de Rothschild, senior partner of
Rothschild &AMP; Cie. Banque in Paris and Sir Evelyn de Rothschild,
chairman of N.M. Rothschild &AMP; Sons in London, the leaders of the
Rothschild Group.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Evelyn and Baron David praised Smith's experience and
business talents in a statement. Smith, they said, would bring them
and their clients ``the perspective of a highly successful CEO who
understands both the U.S. and global markets and who knows how
successful companies operate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will be fun for him and for us,'' Yves-Andre
Istel, vice chairman of Rothschild Inc. said in an interview
Wednesday. Istel, who spoke by telephone from London, added that
Smith's experience and knowledge of business strategy could
particularly benefit Rothschild's investment banking business.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's long experience in the telecommunications industry _ an
area where Rothschild has represented such companies as British
Telecom and Deutsche Telekom _ also is expected to help the
investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Istel said Smith would also be pursuing ``some venture capital
investing'' interests, but would otherwise spend his time working
for Rothschild. Smith said these interests were an investment fund,
the Arlington Group, that he was setting up with his son, which
would invest in ``information products and services.''

DEMOCRATS LAUNCH ASSAULT ON REPUBLICANS ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Subs 16th graf to delete name of committee)  (Also moving in `p' category) 
(sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A parade of prominent Democrats on Wednesday
pounced gleefully on what they called a Republican blunder in
waging a last-minute, multimillion-dollar advertising offensive
that exploits President Clinton's sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of desperation that we can expect from
Republicans as we get close to Election Day,'' said Vice President
Al Gore. ``Attacking the president and investigating the president
has apparently become an obsession with the Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, general chairman of the Democratic
Party, said: ``This is a desperate attempt from a Republican Party
completely devoid of an agenda. The American people will see right
through it and this cynical Republican ploy will backfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton joined in the assault, declaring that while
Republicans were free to say whatever they wanted in their
commercials, ``it's fair for a person to be judged on his whole
record.''
</P>
<P>
   By late Wednesday, the Democratic Party had hastily begun
assembling a commercial of its own in response to the Republicans'
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   In the commercial, a narrator says: ``This no ordinary time.
Republicans have made removing the president from office their top
priority. They want to waste millions of our tax dollars on endless
investigations. Democrats believe this is about solving our real
problems _ protecting Social Security, patients' rights, smaller
class sizes, more teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   The narrator closes: ``Next Tuesday, vote Democratic. And tell
Congress we're ready to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   While some Republican consultants agreed with Democrats that the
advertisements were a mistake, or at least risky, officials of the
National Republican Congressional Committee dismissed the notion
that their commercials would spur any backlash. They said they were
convinced that the advertisements would energize loyal Republican
voters _ as well as people who were undecided but leaning toward
Republican candidates. House Speaker Newt Gingrich personally
approved the campaign, a top party official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Democrats really believed that our message was the
wrong message for us and that it was not going to work,'' said Mary
Crawford, communications director of the congressional committee,
``why would they be squealing like stuck pigs?''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party officials said three scandal-related
commercials were being broadcast in about 30 congressional
districts. Of the three, the toughest is appearing in Southern and
rural areas where the president is particularly unpopular. The
others are being broadcast in more suburban and coastal districts
where party polls found that people were still fuming over
Clinton's misleading the public about his affair with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials, they said, were part of a $10 million
advertising barrage in the final week of the campaign that includes
spots on specific issues tailored to individual congressional
districts; party officials would not say what proportion of the $10
million were for the scandal-related advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to emphasize the scandal marked an abrupt shift of
strategy for the Republicans, who for weeks have stayed clear of
the Lewinsky matter and advised many of the party's candidates not
to raise the affair in their own advertisements. Party officials
said that they had been moving toward the change of approach in
recent days, and that a final decision was made on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who has publicly counseled House members not to
politicize the scandal, signed off on the decision, party officials
said. ``He knew in general'' about the plans, said a top party
official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``As we got more
specific, he knew that as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertising blitz stirred intense debate among Republicans,
with some expressing fears that it could alter the dynamic _ to the
detriment of Republicans _ in the closing days of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took their bait _ this is exactly what the Democrats
wanted,'' said Tom Edmonds, a Republican media consultant. ``It
makes Republicans look unnecessarily mean spirited. They look like
opportunists. There was absolutely no need to do this. This is the
stupidest thing I've ever seen. It's a self-inflicted wound.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the chairman of the committee that sponsored the
advertisements, Rep. John Linder of Georgia, said commercials
focusing on the scandal could be perilous. ``If our candidates all
pick up the cudgel to beat up on the president,'' he told reporters
at a lunch on Tuesday, hours before the first advertisements were
broadcast, ``it could be overkill. And it could backfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Marsh, a Republican consultant who created one of the
advertisements, said: ``Obviously, there's risk associated with
everything. But it's an important message.''
</P>
<P>
   While the commercials unmistakably bring up the scandal, they
are careful not to appear too brazen. Marsh's commercial opens with
one woman saying to another, ``What did you tell your kids?'' But
after that suggestive beginning, the conversation turns to subjects
of infrequent juvenile fascination _ big government and Social
Security,
</P>
<P>
   The two other advertisements were produced by Michael Murphy, a
veteran media consultant. In one, the narrator asks, ``Should we
reward not telling the truth?'' The other does not cite the scandal
in the text, but ends with the perhaps more powerful image of
Clinton wagging his finger at the camera when he denied his affair
with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader in the
House, said that in its advertisement responding to the attacks,
the Democrats could not afford to match spending of the
Republicans. He said the spot would make the point that ``if you
want to spend another two years investigating the president's sex
life, vote for Republicans.''

LONG HUD INQUIRY COMPLETED
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Almost 10 years after Congress found the federal
housing agency under President Reagan to be replete with waste,
fraud and abuse, two independent counsels have concluded their
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In a report presented this week to the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia, the counsels said their
eight-and-a-half-year effort _ which led to the convictions of 16
people _ found ``a pervasive pattern of criminal behavior''
involving officials at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, as well as consultants and others who did business
with the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The counsels _ Arlin M. Adams, who led the investigation from
1990 through May 1995, and Larry D. Thompson, who completed the
work _ said they also determined that Reagan's housing secretary,
Samuel R. Pierce Jr., was the ``central person'' in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But they concluded that Pierce's cooperation through ``full and
public written acceptance of responsibility for his role in the
mismanagement and abuse at HUD in the 1980s'' warranted their
decision not to charge him with any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   While the events covered in the counsels' voluminous report
ended in 1989, their reverberations echoed into the Clinton
administration, under former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros and
the current secretary, Andrew Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, members of Congress outraged by Pierce's stewardship
called for abolishing the housing agency, and Cisneros and Cuomo
embarked on programs to weed out fraud, abuse and other problems.
Both secretaries reduced the number of department employees, and
Cuomo has continued the trimming efforts by reorganizing major
departments. Currently, the department has 9,000 employees, almost
half as many as the 17,000 a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Congress rewarded those efforts this year, by approving the
administration's $25 billion budget request, which included $2
billion for new spending.
</P>
<P>
   The need for an independent counsel grew out of congressional
hearings that determined by November 1990 that the housing agency
under Pierce had engaged in ``widespread abuses, influence
peddling, blatant favoritism, monumental waste and gross
mismanagement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Congress did not determine whether federal crimes were
committed. That fell to an independent counsel. Between 1990 and
1996, indictments led to convictions and plea bargains with an
array of housing officials.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   They included Deborah Gore Dean, an executive assistant to
Pierce who was convicted of 12 felony counts in 1993; Catalina
Vasquez Villalpando, U.S. treasurer from 1989 to 1993; Philip Winn,
an assistant housing secretary who became ambassador to
Switzerland; Joseph Strauss, a special assistant to Pierce; and
Thomas Demery, an assistant housing secretary.
</P>
<P>
   All the cases have been resolved except for the one involving
Ms. Dean, who has asked an appeals court to grant her a new trial
based on new evidence.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LA QUINTA, Calif. _ After 36 years of professional golf, the
competitive fire does not burn as it once did for Raymond Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   He walked away from the game for two months this summer, the
first such hiatus in his career, and now time on his hands rather
than on a course does not seem to be such a bad deal.
</P>
<P>
   With 60 tournament wins worldwide and $16 million in earnings,
Floyd is financially secure enough to think of other things, like
charitable work, family events and a golf-course-design business
instead of leaderboards and three-putts.
</P>
<P>
   And while Floyd, who has been playing for official money since
1961 and unofficial money a while longer, can contemplate life
without a caddy or tour bag, he will never turn his back on the
game that has brought him so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see Ray Floyd one day without competitive golf but not
without golf,'' he said during an interview earlier this week at
the La Quinta Resort and Spa's Citrus Course, the site of next
month's Lexus Challenge, which he hosts.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the World Golf Hall of Fame, Floyd is now content
with his place in the game's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``My career is not going to change if I win 10 more tournaments
or don't win again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd was on his way to Los Angeles for this week's Pacific Bell
Senior Classic at Wilshire Country Club, where he will discover
whether he can find his way back into the winner's circle, a place
he has not visited since the Ford Senior Players Championship in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd ranks 19th on this year's money list with $637,143 in
earnings with his best finish a second place tie at the LG
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The long vacation was a much needed break. Floyd played a few
social rounds but mainly just relaxed for most of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited about playing again and I'm looking forward
to coming back next year with a little more enthusiasm,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd's main purpose for stopping in the desert was to announce
the field for the Lexus Challenge, a charity event which pairs a
senior pro with a celebrity in a 36-hole best-ball tournament. Ten
percent of the tournament's purse will be donated to Childhelp USA
and the Entertainment Industry Foundation to help in their efforts
to curb child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexus Challenge falls in what is known as the silly season,
the period roughly between Thanksgiving and New Year's that is
packed with made-for-television events.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd said the event is more about benefiting the charities and
socializing than birdies and pars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a golf tournament. This is a special event. It's
strictly for charity. We are trying to contribute to a marvelous
cause,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Floyd's favorite tournaments was the old Bing Crosby
National Pro Am, now known as the AT&AMP;T National Pro Am, and he
tries to give his tournament the same kind of flavor by picking
participants who like to have a good time. The list of senior pros
pretty much stays the same and the celebrities make repeat
appearances if their schedules permit.
</P>
<P>
   This year the pros will be Jim Colbert, Hubert Green, Hale
Irwin, Johnny Miller, Larry Nelson, Gary Player, Chi Chi Rodriguez,
Jay Sigel, Dave Stockton and Lee Trevino.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrities include Roger Clemens, Kevin Costner, William
Devane, Glenn Frey, Ken Griffey Jr., Matt Lauer, Matthew
McConaughey, Joe Pesci, Alan Thicke and Alberto Tomba. Two more
celebrities will be added later, Floyd said.
</P>
<P>
   __ New sponsor: This is Pacific Bell's first time as the sponsor
of the senior tournament at Wilshire CC in L.A., which benefits the
City of Hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a world-class event that benefits an important
charity,'' Carmen Nava, a Pacific Bell executive, said. ``Los
Angeles is our largest market and we wanted to add this to the list
of other sponsorships we have here in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Nava declined to say what kind of financial commitment the
company is making to the tournament during the course of its
three-year involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets our brand out in front and our products out in front
and gives us the opportunity to spend some quality time with our
customers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Field set: The field for the 1998 EMC Golf Skills Challenge
has been set. It includes Nick Price, Ben Crenshaw, John Daly,
Constantino Rocca, Peter Jacobsen, Craig Stadler, Casey Martin and
Billy Andrade.
</P>
<P>
   It will be played on Nov. 9 at the Ojai Valley Inn &AMP; Spa.

ADVERTISING: MASTERCARD JOINS CROWD THAT BELIEVES WHAT SELLS HERE
WILL SELL THERE, TOO. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Y.)  (af) 
 By GREG FARRELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Theodore Levitt may or may not pay for anything with a
Mastercard, but he can certainly use the company to prove his
theories of global marketing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Levitt, a marketing expert at the Harvard Business
School, popularized the idea of the global village in marketing. He
wrote that advances in technology and communications were shrinking
the planet, encouraging consumers everywhere to develop similar
tastes for the same products.
</P>
<P>
   With few notable exceptions, most people ignored his theories,
continuing to believe that what sold in the United States would not
necessarily sell in Japan, France or Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, that has changed. Advertisers have realized that
their greatest asset is the value of their brands and that in an
increasingly interdependent global economy, those brands should
stand for the same things worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, many global marketers have consolidated their
advertising and marketing relationships at single agencies to help
build consistent, globally recognizable personalities for brands,
with Nike's ``swoosh'' the blueprint to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are IBM, which in 1994 consolidated its advertising
at the Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide unit of WPP Group PLC, and
Citibank, which last year combined accounts at Young &AMP; Rubicam
Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mastercard International is following suit.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Mastercard selected McCann-Erickson Worldwide
Advertising in New York to handle its United States advertising. In
recent months, Mastercard's regional partners in Europe and Latin
America have agreed to shift their advertising to McCann, and the
agency is continuing to pitch the business to local partners,
country by country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mastercard is a major global brand,'' said Debra Coughlin,
senior vice president for global advertising and marketing services
at Mastercard in Purchase, N.Y. ``We began searching in the U.S.
for a campaign, but we were looking for a global agency.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann-Erickson, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of
the  &UR; Interpublic Group &LR;  of Companies, came up with a campaign
carrying the theme ``Priceless,'' in which average people use
Mastercard credit cards to pay for all the mundane things that add
up to a special moment.
</P>
<P>
   In one commercial, for instance, two golfers pay for greens fees
and lunch with the card; an announcer supplies the prices for each
transaction. When one golfer gets a hole-in-one, the announcer
describes the moment as ``priceless'' and concludes, ``For
everything else, there's Mastercard.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann-Erickson will use that commercial in the United States,
Canada and Asia. Moreover, it is using the concept of the overall
campaign and localized versions as a drawing card to compete for
and win the Mastercard accounts in other major markets: Asia, Latin
America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most other worldwide account consolidations, Mastercard's
has not been dictated from a chief executive's office; rather, it
has been a gradual process of convincing the regional and local
offices that there are merits to a single approach, and one agency,
to build a unified brand.
</P>
<P>
   Within that unity, however, there is room for customization.
McCann-Erickson has shot extra footage so the commercials can be
re-edited and made more appropriate in local markets. For example,
one spot set at a baseball stadium could be changed to show a
soccer stadium for Europe and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   What does Mastercard consider the advantages of consolidating
its account? ``You want to be a big player with a major agency that
can help you manage your business around the world,'' said Ms.
Coughlin, who joined Mastercard in 1996 after an advertising career
at Y&AMP;R and the J. Walter Thompson unit of WPP.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a communications partner,'' she added, ``but a
business partner'' that ``can look at your brand the way you look
at your brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Coughlin emphasized the importance of cross-pollination: not
just running American work overseas but also running overseas work
in this country.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have been preaching the gospel of globalization,
moves like Mastercard's only confirm the truth of what they have
been saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all these years of ballyhoo, globalization of ad
accounts is finally a reality and here to stay,'' said Kelly O'Dea,
president for client services at Ogilvy, who has helped the agency
manage its worldwide relationships with IBM, Ford and Eastman
Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are finding that old assumptions about how well
brands travel had to be challenged,'' he added. ``Brands can travel
quite well across borders, and you need somebody to help you figure
that out.''
</P>
<P>
   John J. Dooner Jr., chairman and chief executive of
McCann-Erickson World Group, which established its global network
decades ago to serve the Coca-Cola account, said: ``The march
toward globalization is inexorable. It's not just Lever, L'Oreal
and General Motors. The second level of marketers are recognizing
the importance of being global.''
</P>
<P>
   Reckitt &AMP; Colman, a maker of household cleaning products,
consolidated its advertising at McCann-Erickson in 1996. After two
years, Philip Darnton, group director for global marketing, said he
was pleased with the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spend your money in lots of little pieces, things don't
happen,'' he said. ``You can't command the best people on your
account. With a global agency, there's a degree of consistency in
brand position'' because ``the agency starts to be a custodian of
the brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward H. Vick, chief operating officer at Y&AMP;R Inc., recalled
that after the Colgate-Palmolive Co. announced in late 1995 that it
was consolidating its account at Y&AMP;R Advertising, his people put
together a study called ``The Big Game.''
</P>
<P>
   By its reckoning, there were about 40 worldwide marketers with
ad budgets of more than $500 million a year. Now, Vick estimated,
that number has grown to 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``As these companies go global,'' Vick said, ``they begin to
realize that as the world gets smaller, the need for a brand to
stand for something is more and more important.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, Dooner said: ``The bigger will get stronger.
That's true not only in the advertising business, but on the client
side.''

PROGRESS REPORTED IN TALKS, WHILE 2 MORE WEEKS' GAMES LOPPED FROM
NBA SCHEDULE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wednesday was the 120th day of the National
Basketball Association lockout and it was unlike any other, with
the owners and the players going face to face for 90 minutes, with
the league deleting two more weeks from the 1998-99 schedule and
with both sides negotiating into the night in the hopes that a deal
can be reached before more damage is done to the season.
</P>
<P>
   The backdrop for the eventful day was the fact the two sides
have at least agreed on an economic framework _ a luxury tax
followed by a modified cap _ that could lead to an agreement to end
the first work stoppage in league history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically filling in the blanks at this point,'' Billy
Hunter, the players union executive director, said optimistically
after he and about 100 players emerged from an unprecedented
90-minute meeting with the owners who sit on the league's labor
relations committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skeleton is there,'' Hunter added, ``but it might take us
a while to get some workable numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   League officials were not as optimistic, however, wondering
aloud whether the union will compromise enough to achieve the
owners' goal of lowering the players' share of overall revenue to
48 percent by the year 2003. Still, NBA Commissioner David Stern
for the first time acknowledged that progress was being made to end
the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty sure that we are past the label point,'' Stern
said. ``We are talking about share.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel neither optimism nor pessimism,'' Stern added. ``I just
think that we've got to talk. We may have the skeleton of a deal.
But in terms of a hard negotiation on the guts of this deal, I
would say we're no place yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's negotiations began after the league announced it
would cancel the rest of November's games. But straying from its
stance on Oct. 13, when the first two weeks of November were
canceled, the league backed off from its position that all games
that are canceled would not be made up. Instead, Stern said both
sides would discuss the rescheduling of games.
</P>
<P>
   A league official, who asked to remain anonymous, said a
reconfiguration of the season was being worked on so that teams
would end up with the same number of road and home games. As it is,
the league's 82-game schedule has been whittled to 68 games.
</P>
<P>
   Stern estimated that players have lost nearly $200 million in
salaries with the recent cancellations. Union President Patrick
Ewing, whose $18.5 million annual salary is currently the highest
in the NBA, has already lost about $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellations were announced after a meeting of the league's
Board of Governors, at which owners discussed the possibility of
the entire season being lost. Stern said a date for declaring the
season dead was not decided upon for fear of it being perceived as
a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make a deal,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   It was after the owners met, and before negotiations resumed,
that Stern, Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik and members of the
owners' labor relations committee met with about 100 players in a
Sheraton Hotel conference room, with such stars as Michael Jordan,
Scottie Pippen and David Robinson in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting quickly turned into a spirited question-and-answer
session, with players grilling the owners as to why they needed
cost controls. The meeting was intended to be informational, but
both sides used the 90 minutes behind closed door to vent their
frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say it was a heated exchange but it was a very good
exchange,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   According to several participants in the meeting, the Washington
Wizards owner Abe Pollin became visibly upset when Jordan and
others wondered aloud why owners should not consider selling their
franchises if they cannot make them profitable enough. With
Pollin's voice rising, Stern interceded and tried to settle down
the 78-year-old owner.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven owners who were present, Pollin, who has been in
the league for 35 years, is regarded as having a notably hard-line
approach to negotiations. Dave Checketts, the Madison Square Garden
president; Mickey Arison, the managing general partner of the Miami
Heat; the Cleveland Cavaliers' chairman, Gordon Gund; Jerry
Colangelo, the Phoenix Suns president and chief executive officer;
the San Antonio Spurs' owner, Peter Holt, and the Utah Jazz' owner
Larry Miller were also present.
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the committee, the Los Angeles Lakers owner,
Jerry Buss, did not attend. After the 90-minute meeting with the
players ended, the two sides began formal negotiations at 5 p.m. at
an undisclosed midtown sight.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side was expecting a deal to be struck Wednesday night,
but the framework appears to be there, even though there is a wide
gap between the 48 percent of revenues the owners want the players
to receive and the 63 percent the players have proposed. Last
season, the players received 57 percent of the revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're driving a car,'' Ewing said. ``They want us to
go back to horse and buggies. Going back to 48 percent is not
reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   The framework both sides are discussing would run five years and
would involve using the union's proposal for a luxury tax the first
two years, the league's desire for some kind of cap system the next
two years and a moderation of the two plans in the fifth season.
</P>
<P>
   The luxury tax would be on the highest contracts, with the tax
money going to lower-income teams. If that system did not reduce
the amount of revenues being devoted to salaries, a modified hard
cap would be implemented under which players would put 10 percent
of their salaries into an escrow fund.
</P>
<P>
   The sides also need to find a middle ground on the luxury tax.
The players have asked for a tax of 50 percent on the amount of any
annual salary over $18 million, a figure that would only affect
Ewing; owners have asked for tax rates of 50-200 percent on
salaries signed under the Larry Bird exception for more than $2.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have to do now is agree on the numbers,'' Ewing said.
</P>
<P>
   The league said Wednesday it would not announce further
cancellations of games, preferring instead to say nothing until the
point is reached where it has to announce the entire season has
been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see any point to making further announcements about
our schedule until we either make a deal or cancel the season
entirely,'' Granik said. ``Going forward, the rule of thumb is that
for each week that goes by without a new agreement, we lose one
more week of games.''
</P>
<P>
   NBA season ticket-holders are receiving cash refunds plus 6
percent interest for all preseason and regular-season games that
are canceled. Anyone holding individual game tickets is entitled to
a cash refund of the face value of the tickets or a raincheck to be
used at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an urgency here, but I don't want anyone to
misinterpret the urgency,'' Hunter said. ``The urgency is not one
in which we are going to throw the hat in and accept what anybody
puts on the table. We're just saying time is of the essence. The
longer you wait to put something on the table, it's a missed
opportunity.''

   BRAZIL PLANS $80 BILLION IN CUTS AND TAX INCREASES
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian government of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
detailed a three-year, $80 billion package of spending cuts and tax
increases in a bid to restore the nation's flagging credibility in
world markets and prepare the way for a rescue program led by the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials reacted cautiously, and international investors
warned that the measures could easily stall in the Brazilian
Congress. The blueprint calls for $23.5 billion in savings for
1999, with about $11 billion of that amount coming from tax
increases and $7 billion from federal spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Architects of the IMF rescue hope it will shelter Latin America
from financial turmoil, but their optimism may be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   CRACKDOWN ON INTERNET STOCK FRAUD
</P>
<P>
   Delivering a blunt reminder to investors that the World Wide Web
can be treacherous, federal regulators said they had accused 44
stock promoters of fraudulently promoting more than 235 small
companies on the Internet. The Securities and Exchange Commission,
which created a special enforcement squad to police Internet
frauds, called the enforcement action the first such nationwide
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S OFFICIAL: A $70 BILLION SURPLUS
</P>
<P>
   The government closed the books on the fiscal year that ended on
Sept. 30, saying it ran a $70 billion surplus, the first time since
1969 that Washington spent less than it took in.
</P>
<P>
   NASDAQ LEADS MILD STOCK ADVANCE
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices resumed their advance in a relatively subdued
session as investors appraised Brazil's fiscal package and awaited
key reports on U.S. wage growth and output. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 5.93 points, to 8,371.97. The Nasdaq
composite index climbed 19.72 points, to 1,737.35, and the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.75 points, to 1,068.09.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices fell for the first time in three days as the yield
on the benchmark 30-year bond rose to 5.12 percent from 5.08
percent.
</P>
<P>
   SPRINT DELAYS AN INITIAL OFFERING
</P>
<P>
   Sprint has delayed plans to take its wireless operations public
this year because of the volatility of world financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   DURABLE-GOODS ORDERS UP AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods rose in September for
the fourth consecutive month, pointing to an economy that is
healthier than expected despite a raft of economic problems abroad.
The Commerce Department said that new orders for durable goods rose
nine-tenths of 1 percent, to $192.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   BELL CHIEF TO JOIN ROTHSCHILD
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Smith, who is retiring from his chairman job at Bell
Atlantic at the end of the year, will become chairman of Rothschild
North America Inc., the North American holding company for the
Rothschild Group in January. The Rothschild Group is well
established in European banking circles, but wants to bolster its
North American businesses.
</P>
<P>
   AMAZON LOSS LESS THAN FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the online book seller, reported much higher sales
and a narrower-than-expected loss for the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil's third-quarter profit fell 45 percent, to $497 million,
because of low crude-oil prices and decreased production.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest brewer, said third-quarter
earnings rose 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Revlon reported a decline of 62 percent in third-quarter
earnings, hurt by retailer inventory reductions, product delays and
softness in international demand.
</P>
<P>
   BUILDING BRANDS WITH A SINGLE VOICE
</P>
<P>
   Many global marketers are consolidating their accounts at single
agencies to help build consistent, globally recognizable
personalities for brands. Mastercard is doing that now with with
McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising. &QL;

NEW CBS CHIEF IS KNOWN FOR FOCUS ON BOTTOM LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CBS-CEO-RETIRE) 
(js) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aggressive is the word most often used to describe Mel Karmazin,
the new chief executive officer of CBS Corp., and it is an epithet
as often as it is a compliment.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old businessman has no tolerance for excuses or
extravagances, and cares little whether he makes enemies as long as
he makes money. His impressive track record at doing just that has
made him a hero of Wall Street investment firms, which see his
relentless focus on the bottom line as something that will almost
always help his company's stock perform better.
</P>
<P>
   And as the single largest shareholder in CBS, owning about 1.5
percent of its stock, or roughly 10 million shares, Karmazin has a
keen personal interest in that performance along with his
responsibility to investors.
</P>
<P>
   He became a CBS executive as well as its chief shareholder in
1996, when he sold his Infinity Broadcasting Inc., then the largest
radio station group in the country, to Westinghouse Electric Corp.,
then CBS' parent, for $4.9 billion. Given his well-known pugnacious
approach to business, people who knew him predicted he would soon
elbow aside everyone else _ even Michael H. Jordan, the chairman
and chief executive officer _ to run the company the Karmazin way.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, by May of 1997, he had elbowed aside Peter Lund,
the CBS network president, convincing Jordan to let him to take
control of the 14 television stations owned by CBS. ( Lund resigned
as a result.)
</P>
<P>
   Eleven months later, in April of this year, Karmazin was
promoted to president and chief operating officer of the entire
company, leaving Jordan to operate only certain corporate units
like the legal, finance and human resources departments.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Karmazin has overseen the trimming of the news
division's budget by 10 percent, the beginning of company-wide
layoffs that will reach about 300 people by the end of the year,
and the widely publicized dismissal of several longtime television
sales executives.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Karmazin defended those dismissals, saying the
salespeople ``were not doing as good a job as needed to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he had recently told a Goldman Sachs investors'
conference that ``if there is going to be a recession, we aren't
going to participate in it,'' adding: ``If every one of CBS' sales
people sells 10 percent more advertising, our revenues will be up
10 percent. Sometimes it's easier and sometimes it's harder to sell
10 percent more, but it's always possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, advertising sales alone do not make a successful
television network business. Programming must attract enough
viewers to attract the advertisers, and news and sports divisions
are expensive to operate, regardless of the state of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect, this is not Infinity,'' said one
high-level CBS executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``Mel is a brilliant radio operator and businessman, but
programming a television network and its owned-and-operated
stations is a trickier enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin said Wednesday that he was pleased with the way the
network's operations were going, under Leslie Moonves, president of
CBS Television. He firmly denied a report that he had told
investors he wanted to sell off the network and keep the stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at the network in concert with our television
stations,'' he said Wednesday. ``The network provides over 50
percent of our station's programming. And we are seeing some very,
very encouraging early signs of CBS improving on the network
side.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the network ``will be profitable next year.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And he said he had no regrets about the decision to allow
Eyemark Entertainment, the television syndication unit owned by
CBS, to produce and distribute ``The Howard Stern Radio Show,'' a
late-night television program derived from the notoriously vulgar
radio show hosted by Stern.
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin began his career as an ad salesman for WCBS radio
station in New York, in 1967. He then spent 11 years at Metromedia
before moving to Infinity, also in sales, in 1981. Over the next 15
years, he built it into the largest station group in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Karmazin approached Westinghouse in 1996 seeking to
buy its CBS and Westinghouse radio stations, to add to his Infinity
stable. He even offered to buy the whole corporation, with the
intention of selling off the non-radio divisions, but Jordan
refused. Karmazin later said he realized the combined strength of
CBS and Infinity radio stations was worth being acquired by another
company, as long as he could stay in charge of the radio
operations.
</P>
<P>
   He did far more than that.

FALTERING BRAZIL ANNOUNCES $80 BILLION AUSTERITY PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for general rewrite; expands by 175 words)  (See also BRAZIL-ECONSCENE) 
(mk) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO  
  c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil _ The Brazilian government introduced a
three-year, $80 billion package of spending cuts and tax increases
Wednesday in an effort to restore the country's flagging
credibility in world markets and prepare the way for a rescue
program led by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for $23.5 billion in savings in 1999, with about
$11 billion of that coming from tax increases and $7 billion from
spending cuts. The rest is to come from social welfare and
structural reforms. Part of the plan calls for controversial
mechanisms, called triggers, to force states and municipalities to
limit spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come for us to make government live within its
limits _ with clarity, conscience and determination,'' Finance
Minister Pedro Malan said Wednesday, elaborating on themes that
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso raised in a televised speech on
Tuesday night, bracing Brazilians for the austerity measures. ``The
time for gradualism is over.''
</P>
<P>
   The blueprint was anxiously awaited by investors and U.S.
policy-makers who fear that the collapse of the country's financial
system could trigger defaults and devaluations across Latin
America, worsening a world financial crisis that threatens even
nations with the strongest economies.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted warily, and said the measures did not go as
far as they hoped in making structural changes to permanently
reduce Brazil's burgeoning budget deficit, now running at 7 percent
of its gross national product.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a step in the right direction, but if you think of Brazil
climbing a wall of disbelief, this is just a few inches up,'' said
Jorge Mariscal, chief investment strategist for Latin America for
Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   In Sao Paulo, Brazil's financial center, the benchmark stock
index fell 42.63 points, or five-eights of 1 percent, to 6,826.51.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, the giant of South America, with half the continent's
population and the world's ninth-largest economy, has been the
focus of world attention since the collapse in Russian finances two
months ago. Interest rates for Brazilian debt doubled, and the
country began using up roughly $30 billion in foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
   As the country moved into recession, fears have grown of a
financial collapse here, setting off devaluations and defaults
elsewhere in Latin America and heightening risks to the U.S.
economy. The International Monetary Fund, along with other lending
agencies, and officials in Washington have been preparing a safety
net for Brazil of at least $30 billion, with President Clinton
prepared to commit American taxpayer dollars as part of a package
of direct aid from the Group of Seven industrial nations.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's response to Brazil's action Wednesday was both
congratulatory and cautioning. ``It is essential that Brazil
implement its program promptly and convincingly,'' Secretary of the
Treasury Robert Rubin said in a statement, reflecting fears in
Washington that Cardoso's plans could flounder when they reach the
Brazilian Congress.
</P>
<P>
   That message was reinforced, a White House official said, in a
brief conversation between Clinton and Cardoso. Clinton, the
official said, was returning a call Cardoso placed several days ago
to congratulate the American president on the Middle East
agreement, but Clinton's underlying message was that Brazil had to
act quickly.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have made no secret of their exasperation at
Brazil's slowness to act, leaving the country vulnerable, in their
view, to another market upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, though, reportedly made no reference to an American
contribution to an IMF-led rescue package. Brazilian officials said
they would travel to Washington to discuss the plan with IMF
officials by next week. On Wednesday, a spokesman for the fund said
the plan represented ``important progress in the implementation of
Brazil's stabilization and reform program, which will be supported
by the IMF and other members of the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders of Cardoso's governing coalition, who learned
details of the plan over breakfast with Cardoso and Finance
Minister Pedro Malan Wednesday, did not rule out tinkering with
some of the more controversial elements of the austerity program,
but pledged to maintain the savings targets the government would
pledge to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   ``The measures are bitter measures, but in our view they're
extremely necessary,'' said Aecio Neves, congressional party leader
of the president's Brazilian Social Democracy Party, which relies
on five allied parties to form its majority base. ``The governing
coalition has an enormous responsibility to overcome this moment of
instability,'' said Neves.
</P>
<P>
   With the sudden sense of urgency and national mission, few in
the president's governing coalition were willing to openly
challenge the austerity package outright. But many raised
objections to specific elements of the program, and said there
could be alternatives thrown up for debate in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most difficult items to pass, said congressional
leaders, would be a requirement that retired public-sector workers
contribute to the social security coffers, with contributions of 11
to 20 percent of their benefits. The austerity package also
increases the contribution of public-sector workers to social
security, and would introduce a minimum age for retirement of civil
servants, which does not currently exist.
</P>
<P>
   The social security system for public workers in Brazil is far
more generous than that in the United States. Civil servants here
retire with full salaries, according to time served, without regard
to their age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reduction of expenses and the increase of tax collection, it's
an indigestible cocktail for any Congress in the world,'' said
Geddel Vieira Lima, party leader of the government-allied Brazilian
Democratic Movement Party. ``But we know the moment we're living
through, and that we have to show the world we're capable of doing
what's necessary to address our problems.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The package also calls for the extension of several taxes that
were originally passed as temporary measures several years ago.
Under one, the emergency stabilization fund, the federal government
impounds 20 percent of all taxes destined for state and local
governments. The austerity package proposes doubling the amount
impounded to 40 percent and extending the fund, which was to have
expired in 1999, to 2006.
</P>
<P>
   It will also raise the tax on financial transfers to .38 percent
from .2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fernando Bezerra, president of Brazil's National
Confederation of Industry, said Wednesday that the tax increases
would have ``a very negative impact on national production.''
</P>
<P>
   But the government justified the measures as necessary to
relieve a credit crunch and bring down interest rates, now running
over 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The austerity package also calls on Congress to legally oblige
states to limit spending on active and retired employees to 60
percent of their budgets, at the same time cutting the resources
available by impounding taxes.
</P>
<P>
   It is by no means sure, however, that fiscal discipline can
successfully be imposed on state and city governments by fiat.
Anthony Garotinho, elected governor of Rio de Janeiro in last
Sunday's elections, said Wednesday, ``Does the government expect us
to make miracles?'' He noted that Rio, which is seeking a $300
million loan from the federal government, is responsible like other
states for providing basic services including education, health and
security. ``I was elected to be a governor, not a magician,''
Garotinho said.
</P>
<P>
   Mariscal, of Goldman Sachs, also called the impoundment fund's
extension ``another negative,'' and said, ``Brazil is in the mess
it's in because it has too much debt, too many employees and too
high a social security deficit. It's an issue of spending too much
and lowering the debt, and everything else is peripheral.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Goodman, chief economist at Santander Investment
Securities, called the package ``mildly favorable regarding the
potential for an ongoing `muddling through' scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   This week marks the one-year anniversary of the last package
Cardoso announced, with much fanfare, just after Thailand's
collapse. That package to raise $18 billion, hailed as a great show
of decisiveness, was largely passed by Congress. But the only
measures that were implemented involved raising taxes, not cutting
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil will remain captive to a $300 billion domestic debt
that is extraordinarily short-term in nature, which is one of the
paramount issues coming out of the Asia crisis,'' Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Malan and other government officials are to testify
about the austerity package before Congress, which is scheduled to
begin action, starting with social security reform, next week.

   This is a new 30-second commercial that the Republican National
Committee began broadcasting this week to support the party's
Congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Russo Marsh &AMP; Raper Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: The advertisement opens with two women in their
30s, talking to each other in a living room. They are dressed
casually. One woman sends off her children, a boy and a girl. The
camera focuses on the other woman and then follows their dialogue.
The advertisement concludes with six words on the screen:
``Republicans. The balanced leadership we need.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT:
</P>
<P>
   First woman: ``What did you tell your kids?''
</P>
<P>
   Second woman: ``I didn't know what to say.''
</P>
<P>
   First woman: ``It's wrong. For seven months, he lied to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Second woman: ``But aren't there other things to do?''
</P>
<P>
   First woman: ``And say it's OK to lie? Besides, the Republicans
are doing them. They cut taxes, they helped balance the budget, and
they're putting people on welfare back to work. And now they have a
plan to save Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Second woman: ``But the Democrats say __.''
</P>
<P>
   First woman: ``The truth is, the Democrats gave us higher taxes
and more government.''
</P>
<P>
   Second woman: ``Now there's a difference that really matters.''
</P>
<P>
   First woman: ``Republicans are the balance we need.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: President Clinton has acknowledged that his public
comments about Monica Lewinsky ``gave a false impression'' of their
relationship, and he has conceded that he ``misled people,
including even my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders of Congress did negotiate a tax cut with
Clinton last year. They did help balance the budget by cutting many
types of domestic spending. And Republicans led a two-year effort
to redesign the nation's main welfare program by establishing
stringent work requirements for people who receive cash assistance.
</P>
<P>
   But it is difficult to know exactly what the commercial means
when it says that Republicans now ``have a plan to save Social
Security.'' They have a multitude of proposals, but not ``a plan.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, many Republicans have expressed interest in
various proposals to revamp Social Security to keep it solvent for
the baby boom generation. Neither the Republican Party nor its
congressional leaders nor its rank and file has formally or
officially endorsed a single plan to solve Social Security's
long-range financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans who have studied the issue support some type of
private retirement accounts that would allow workers to invest at
least part of their payroll taxes in stocks or bonds. Republicans
insist that this is still a worthy idea because such accounts
would, on the average, pay a higher return than the government
program. But the plunge in stock prices this summer illustrated the
volatility of the market, and Republicans may not want to emphasize
the details of their proposals at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: This commercial pointedly reminds voters of the White
House sex scandal. Indeed, that is its major objective, even though
the commercial quickly moves to other issues that distinguish
Republicans from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The opening line _ ``What did you tell your kids?'' _ is
arresting. Most listeners will immediately recognize the subject
even though Ms. Lewinsky's name is not mentioned. The commercial
does not dwell on the scandal, a subject for which many citizens
have expressed distaste.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the commercial seeks to exploit the sex scandal without
offending or disgusting voters. The commercial strongly suggests
that it would be a mistake for voters to ignore the scandal,
because to disregard it would be to condone lying.
</P>
<P>
   In referring to Republicans as ``the balance we need,'' the
commercial plays up the idea that a Republican-controlled Congress
is needed as a counterweight to a Democratic president. Some
political scientists say that voters intuitively favor such a
balance between the branches of government, even if voters do not
consciously or explicitly recognize it as a reason for the choices
they make on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement woos voters who may be tempted to accept
Clinton's contention that his affair with Ms. Lewinsky does not
matter much in next week's elections. Thus, it says, the parties'
disagreement on taxes and the role of government is the difference
that ``really matters.''

   This is a new 30-second commercial that the Republican National
Committee began broadcasting this week to support the party's
Congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Russo Marsh &AMP; Raper Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: The advertisement opens with two women in their
30s, talking to each other in a living room. They are dressed
casually. One woman sends off her children, a boy and a girl. The
camera focuses on the other woman and then follows their dialogue.
The advertisement concludes with six words on the screen:
``Republicans. The balanced leadership we need.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT:
</P>
<P>
   First woman: ``What did you tell your kids?''
</P>
<P>
   Second woman: ``I didn't know what to say.''
</P>
<P>
   First woman: ``It's wrong. For seven months, he lied to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Second woman: ``But aren't there other things to do?''
</P>
<P>
   First woman: ``And say it's OK to lie? Besides, the Republicans
are doing them. They cut taxes, they helped balance the budget, and
they're putting people on welfare back to work. And now they have a
plan to save Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Second woman: ``But the Democrats say __.''
</P>
<P>
   First woman: ``The truth is, the Democrats gave us higher taxes
and more government.''
</P>
<P>
   Second woman: ``Now there's a difference that really matters.''
</P>
<P>
   First woman: ``Republicans are the balance we need.''
</P>

JAMES GOLDMAN, 71, AUTHOR OF `LION IN WINTER' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ill.)   (bl)  
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ James Goldman, who wrote the Broadway play ``The Lion
in Winter'' and the book for the Stephen Sondheim musical
``Follies,'' died Wednesday. He was 71 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a heart attack in the lobby of his apartment
building and was taken to Lenox Hill Hospital. He never regained
consciousness, said his wife, Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman was a screenwriter and novelist as well as playwright.
In 1968 he won an Academy Award for his adaptation of ``The Lion in
Winter.'' A revival of that play is scheduled to open in February
at the Roundabout Theater starring Laurence Fishburne and Stockard
Channing.
</P>
<P>
   A historical play about the 12th-century English ruler Henry II
and his estranged wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, and their battle over
succession, ``The Lion in Winter'' had only a brief run on Broadway
in 1966, though the leading roles were played by Robert Preston and
Rosemary Harris. Two years later, the play was turned into a
popular movie starring Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn, who
shared the Academy Award for best actress with Barbra Streisand
(for ``Funny Girl'').
</P>
<P>
   Although Goldman covered a wide variety of subjects, history was
a specialty. In addition to ``The Lion in Winter,'' he wrote the
screenplay for ``Nicholas and Alexandra'' (1971) and a novel,
``Myself as Witness,'' about King John, who ruled England in the
13th century. Two years ago his play about Tolstoy was presented in
London.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Chicago and graduated from the University of
Chicago. During postgraduate work at Columbia University he was
drafted into the Army. After he was discharged he decided to become
a playwright.
</P>
<P>
   His play ``They Might Be Giants'' was produced by Joan
Littlewood in London in 1961 and was later turned into a movie
starring George C. Scott and Joanne Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   With his younger brother, William, a novelist and screenwriter,
he wrote ``Blood, Sweat &AMP; Stanley Poole,'' a comedy about life in
the Army. It was produced on Broadway in 1961. The following year
the Goldman brothers collaborated on the book for the John Kander
musical ``A Family Affair,'' with James Goldman also writing the
lyrics with Kander.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965 Sondheim asked Goldman if he had an idea for a musical.
Goldman said he had thought about writing one about a reunion,
perhaps of graduates from a college like Vassar, until he read a
newspaper item about a reunion of Ziegfeld Follies actresses. In
its earliest phase, the show was a murder mystery called ``The
Girls Upstairs.'' Gradually it evolved into ``Follies.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, Goldman and Sondheim also collaborated on a television
musical, ``Evening Primrose,'' based on a John Collier story about
people living secretly in a department store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Follies,'' which opened on Broadway in 1971, was, in
Sondheim's words, ``a dream play, a memory piece.'' The show,
produced by Harold Prince and directed by Prince and Michael
Bennett, won the New York Drama Critics Circle award as best
musical and ran for 522 performances. It came to be regarded as a
milestone in the composer's career. Subsequently it was revived in
a concert version in New York and was fully staged in 1987 in
London, receiving the Evening Standard Award and the Olivier Award
as best musical.
</P>
<P>
   A revival of ``Follies'' presented last spring at the Paper Mill
Playhouse in Millburn, N.J., had been a Broadway possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman was also writing the book and lyrics for a new musical
(with Larry Grossman), based on the novel ``Tom Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   His other screenplays included ``Robin and Marian'' (Richard
Lester's Robin Hood movie starring Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn)
and ``White Nights'' (with Mikhail Baryshnikov). He wrote four
novels, ``Waldorf,'' ``The Man From Greek and Roman,'' ``Myself as
Witness'' and ``Fulton County.'' He adapted several classics for
television, including ``Oliver Twist'' and ``Anna Karenina.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and brother, both of Manhattan, he is
survived by two children, Julia and Matthew, from a previous
marriage.

LORD SAINSBURY, 96; BUILT A BRITISH GROCERY EMPIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Lord Sainsbury of Drury Lane, who revolutionized the
retail food industry in Britain, transforming his family's grocery
business into the country's first modern, self-service supermarket
empire and forever changing the shopping habits of the average
Briton, died Oct. 21. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
   When Alan Sainsbury, as he was called then, and his brother,
Robert, took over the family business in 1938, it was a chain of
small grocery stores run in the traditional way: The customer
selected the products and the grocer took them off the shelves and
packed them up. But, inspired by a trip to America in which he saw
his first supermarket, Lord Sainsbury decided that the future lay
in self service.
</P>
<P>
   It was a breathtaking idea, but not everyone was thrilled to be
on the cutting edge of grocery innovation. In 1950, when the first
new-style store opened, in Croydon, Lord Sainsbury stood at the
front door, handing out wire shopping baskets. One customer threw
her basket back at him in a fury. Another customer, the wife of a
judge, shouted that she did not want to do the job of a shop
assistant. Meanwhile, competitors ridiculed the idea and said it
would never catch on.
</P>
<P>
   ``How wrong they were,'' Lord Sainsbury said later, ``and how
lucky we were that they were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan John Sainsbury was born in Hampstead, London, in 1902, into
a family that had been in the grocery business for more than 30
years. From its humble beginning as a shop selling dairy products
on Drury Lane in London, the first Sainsbury's had grown to a chain
of 250 stores across the south of England. Lord Sainsbury's father,
John, served as the company's chairman until he died in 1956,
though he ceded much of his power to his sons in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Sainsbury joined the business in 1921, explaining, ``My
mother said it would break my father's heart if I didn't.'' He
served behind the counter at the Boscombe branch, using an assumed
name, and worked in the dairy department under the supervision of
his uncles, Arthur and Alfred. At that time, only family members
were allowed to buy eggs and milk for the stores.
</P>
<P>
   He moved quickly up the ranks, serving with his brother as joint
general manager. Lord Sainsbury, then known by everyone as ``Mr.
Alan,'' was in charge of the retail side of the business; his
brother handled the finances and administration. After World War
II, Lord Sainsbury traveled to the United States on a fact-finding
mission to learn about frozen food. It was then that he had an
epiphany. Confronted by his first supermarket, he said, he was
``thrilled and stimulated by the potentiality of self-service
trading.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite lean times in the postwar years, when widespread
shortages and strict rationing depressed the food industry, the
brothers went on to preside over an enormous expansion, opening new
stores that were bigger and more sensitive to customer convenience
than ever before. Lord Sainsbury brought in fresh produce and
frozen foods; revolutionized packaging so that the product became
the ``silent salesman''; promoted the company's ``own-label''
foods, which were sold under the Sainsbury's brand, and pushed the
concept of low-cost, high-quality foods under the slogan, ``Good
Food Costs Less at Sainsbury's.'' When it went public in 1973, the
company was worth 117 million pounds; today, sales in the chain of
supermarkets runs more than 12 billion pounds ($20 billion) a year.
</P>
<P>
   A perennial loser as a political candidate, Lord Sainsbury was
made a life peer in 1962, an appointment that enabled him to join
the House of Lords. Initially a member of the Labor Party, he
switched to the Liberal Democratic Party but remained fiercely
independent.
</P>
<P>
   He was an active participant in the business of the House of
Lords _ ``I'm part of the furniture,'' he said _ as well as working
as an advocate for the food retail industry and serving on numerous
food-related public committees and government advisory boards. He
also campaigned for social welfare and liberal causes and gave
generously to a range of charities, particularly those helping
underprivileged children.
</P>
<P>
   A childhood of rejection from the British upper classes _ his
mother was Jewish and his father was ``in trade,'' as Britons of
the time disparagingly called even grocery magnates _ left him with
a lifelong distrust of snobbery and of the British class system and
a strong belief in the philanthropic uses of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Although he retired in 1967, when he was appointed life
president of Sainsbury's, Lord Sainsbury never stopped going to his
office at the firm, which had changed almost beyond recognition in
his more than 75 years in the business. When he started,
Sainsbury's carried 50 items and made deliveries by horse and cart;
now its stores stock more than 23,000 products and accept orders
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Married in 1925, Lord Sainsbury divorced his wife 14 years later
and married again in 1944. He outlived both wives. He is survived
by three sons, a daughter and several grandchildren and
great-grandchildren.

   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ The machines, the weather and John Glenn
himself were ``go'' for launching Wednesday, as countdown
preparations progressed smoothly toward the liftoff of the space
shuttle Discovery, scheduled for 2 p.m. Thursday, on the most
eagerly awaited space mission in years.
</P>
<P>
   All because of Glenn, returning to space after 36 years, crowds
of well-wishers were already descending on the Kennedy Space Center
here and were expected to swell into the hundreds of thousands. The
expected turnout of 3,700 media people is thought to be the largest
since the Apollo lunar flights. All the major television networks
will show the liftoff live _ something else that has not happened
in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   And President Clinton is expected to fly in to celebrate the
comeback mission of the national hero who was the first American to
orbit the planet. Glenn's three-orbit, five-hour flight in a tiny
Mercury capsule occurred on Feb. 20, 1962, when Bill Clinton was
still in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, the retiring Democratic senator from Ohio, will join six
other astronauts on a planned nine-day mission devoted primarily to
astronomical observations, tests of new space hardware, experiments
in materials processing in weightlessness and biological and
medical studies, including monitoring Glenn's health as an
experiment in the physiology of aging.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Holloway, NASA's shuttle program manager, reported
Wednesday that all the preparations and tests on the Discovery were
``proceeding exceptionally well and all systems are go.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven crew members were ``in the best of spirits and more
than ready to go,'' said Col. Charles Precourt, chief of the
astronaut office at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, at a news
conference at Cape Canaveral. They had a barbecue with their
families on Tuesday night, paid a traditional visit to the
launching pad Wednesday morning and spent the rest of the day in
briefings and some late-afternoon flying.
</P>
<P>
   Precourt, an astronaut himself, said that Glenn was holding his
own and fitting in well with the rest of the crew, most of whom are
half his age. ``His attitude is infectious,'' Precourt said. ``He's
very eager to get the work done.''
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists flashed a green light on the weather. Their
forecast was for a 100 percent chance of favorable weather at
launching time: clear, dry and calm skies. It is rare for a weather
forecast here to be so unambiguous and optimistic, and much better
than Glenn had to contend with in 1962. His launching then was
postponed 10 times, 4 for bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like Mother Nature wants John Glenn to return to
space just like the rest of us,'' said Capt. Cliff Stargardt, an
Air Force meteorologist.
</P>
<P>
   The expected presence of Clinton and scores of congressional
leaders and celebrities has led to especially tight security
precautions, including requirements for visitors to pass through a
close inspection at three checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the ``heightened security precautions,'' Robert B.
Sieck, director of shuttle operations here, said, ``It's a
common-sense thing to do, considering the environment today, the
attention this is getting and what's going on in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   After several years of pressing his case for a second chance to
fly in space, Glenn was added to the Discovery crew in January. The
decision was made by NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin after
consulting with medical experts on the scientific merit of aging
tests on Glenn and receiving assurances that Glenn was physically
fit to fly. Physicians said he passed all the tests required of any
non-pilot crew member.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Glenn conceded that his ``body
flexibility is not as good as it used to be, and that becomes
apparent every day.'' He noticed especially he tries to enter the
shuttle hatch. ``I don't bend quite like the others in the crew
do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is not expected to stop him when he suits up Thursday
morning and climbs into the Discovery and takes his place below the
flight deck. With him will be Lt. Col. Curtis Brown and Lt. Col.
Steven Lindsey, the Air Force officers who are the commander and
pilot, respectively. Others on the crew are Dr. Stephen Robinson,
an engineer; Dr. Scott Parazynski, a physician; Pedro Duque, a
Spanish aeronautical engineer representing the European Space
Agency, and Dr. Chiaki Mukai, a physician and medical researcher
from Japan.

31 PICASSOS SOLD AT PARIS AUCTION 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ One of Picasso's ``Weeping Woman'' portraits, perhaps
the last still outside museum collections, was bought by the Zurich
gallery Apedoros for $7.1 million as the auction of the estate of
the artist's former mistress, Dora Maar, began Tuesday night.
Although their relationship ended in 1945, Ms. Maar held on to all
of Picasso's gifts to her until her death last year.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the sale of 31 Picasso paintings and drawings and
one portrait of Picasso by Ms. Maar fetched a total of $30 million,
commission included. Smaller works by Picasso as well as Ms. Maar's
own photographs and paintings are being sold in other auctions this
week and next month. Decorated stones and matchboxes, jewelry,
sketches and other objects fetched $6.2 million at Wednesday's
auction.
</P>
<P>
   Two Picasso drawings, of the poet Max Jacob and ``Dora Maar and
the Minotaur,'' were withdrawn from the sale at the last minute to
go toward death duty payments to the government. All other works up
for sale have been cleared to leave France.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz Berggruen, a German-born dealer who worked for many years
in Paris, bought the painting ``Dora Maar with Green Fingernails''
for $4.6 million and a drawing, ``Dora Maar With Her Hair Loose,''
for $994,000. Both are expected to enter Berggruen's private
collection, which is on permanent exhibition in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The only other works that brought significantly more than $1
million were ``Dora on a Beach'' ($2.3 million) and ``Dora Maar
With Yellow Scarf'' ($2 million). &QL;

L.A. GETS FOOTBALL TEAM, SORT OF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Professional football is returning to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And the team doesn't even need an overhauled 70-year-old stadium
or a Spanish-style mall on a toxic dump to play.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it isn't the NFL, either, but L.A. is in no position to
get nit-picky.
</P>
<P>
   The Arena Football League, the quirky, eight-on-eight, ``50-yard
indoor war,'' is returning to this city for the 2000 season. An
as-yet unnamed expansion team will play in the new Staples Center,
joining the Lakers, Clippers and Kings as tenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are anticipating an announcement early next week,'' said
league spokesman David Cooper. ``We're just really, really, really
excited about getting back to Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Roth, spokesman for Staples Center, confirmed talks with
the Arena league have taken place but said, ``Nothing's been signed
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the ownership group has not been revealed, but
Cooper said the group was ``the linchpin'' in granting L.A. the
franchise. One unconfirmed report had Universal Studios involved,
but a studio spokeswoman said she knew nothing about it.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles will be the league's 17th franchise, following the
addition of New Orleans. But with the Arena league seeking ties to
NFL cities _ Saints owner Tom Benson is the one bringing Arenaball
to New Orleans _ observers had expected the next team to go to an
NFL city, possibly Kansas City or Cleveland. AFL officials hope to
reach 20 teams by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Arena football just completed its 12th season and, like the NFL,
has been operating without an L.A. franchise for some time. The
Arena league's Cobras played one season at the Sports Arena, going
5-6-1 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-paced sport, part football, part soccer, part hockey,
is a high-scoring affair, boasting an average of about 90 points
per game. The league's 15 teams have combined to draw more than 1
million fans for the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's SabreCats are the only other California franchise.
Other teams play in New York City, East Rutherford (N.J.), Houston,
Tampa Bay, Phoenix, Orlando, Portland (Ore.)., Milwaukee,
Nashville, Grand Rapids, Buffalo, West Palm Beach (Fla.), Albany
(N.Y.) and Des Moines, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Arena league play runs from May through August, culminating in
the ArenaBowl.

   (NYT22) NEW YORK -- Oct. 28, 1998 -- CARTER-MUSIC-2, 10-28 --
Elliott Carter at his 90th birthday concert. There is a
fastidiousness in Carter's ear for colors and the way he separates
them one from another. The notes of a single horizontal line often
fragment and pass from one instrument to the next; silences let in
light. Perhaps this is why music so dense with diverse agendas can
sound so clear. (G. Paul Burnett/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT18) UNDATED -- Oct. 28, 1998 -- HOME IMPROVEMENT-B&AMP;W, 10-28
-- Many homeowners become complacent about home security because
they think they have nothing worth stealing. What these homeowners
fail to realize is that a majority of burglars have no way of
knowing what is inside a home. Most break in hoping to get lucky.
Given enough time, a burglar will try to make his own luck by
tearing into a house. (Edward R. Lipinski/New York Times

10-28 -- Gov. George Pataki and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato head to a

being underestimated, and a habit of defying expectations. And in
the four years since his election, he has done just that, with
considerable success. (Andrea Mohin/New York Times Photo)

10-28 -- Pumpkin carving of Martha Stewart by Hugh McMahon. Armed
with little more than a sheaf of recipes, a glue gun, some dried
flowers and a puritanical zeal for modern homekeeping, Martha
Stewart has built a $200 million multimedia empire. Thus, it comes
as no surprise that pretenders are cropping up thicker than sprouts
on a chia pet. (Abe Frajndlich/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT13) NEW YORK -- Oct. 28, 1998 -- CIR-FASHION, 10-28 -- Betty
Lo Mann and Steve Mann are connected by marriage as well as the
matching cyborg suits designed by Mann. ``We understand each other
more when we are connected,'' Ms. Mann says. ``It's the same way
the left side of your brain is connected to the right side of your
body, and so is the right side. There is no argument between the
two sides.'' (Brian Willer/New York Times Photo)

WOMEN CHARGED MORE FOR HAIR, CLOTHING SERVICES, STUDY FINDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Women are literally being taken to the cleaners
when they're handed the bill at dry cleaners and hairstylists,
according to a new statewide survey.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, released Wednesday by the California Public Interest
Research Group, found that 45 percent of the hair salons, 46
percent of the launderers and 17 percent of the dry cleaners
surveyed in Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco and Sacramento
charge women more for similar services than they do men, despite a
1995 law banning the practice.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 59 salons and 56 dry cleaners were investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Among those, women paid $7 more than men for a shampoo, cut and
blow-dry; $1.08 more for each laundered shirt; and $1.04 more for
each dry-cleaned shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the businesses surveyed didn't post their prices or make
written price lists available when asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are being taken to the cleaners by gender pricing,''
said consumer program associate Janee Pelletier of CalPIRG's Los
Angeles office. ``Not only is it unfair, but it's illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   The businesses were investigated in late September and early
October.
</P>
<P>
   On average, women paid $21.51 for a simple haircut, shampoo and
blow-dry, compared with $18.30 for men; $1.82 for a laundered
shirt, compared with $1.31 for men; and $3.32 for a dry-cleaned
shirt, vs. $3.24 for men. These averages include prices at the
businesses that did not discriminate.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Curti of Hollywood, who pays $50 for a shampoo, cut and
blow-dry at a salon in suburban Studio City, wasn't surprised by
the gender-based discrepancy for one simple reason: Women's hair is
much more labor-intensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would charge women more -- they have more hair and it has to
be styled more,'' she said. ``A man just runs his fingers through
his hair and he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friend, Tony Cicero of Studio City, pays an acquaintance
only $25 for his short 'do.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a friend of mine, otherwise she'd charge me $35,''
Cicero said. And it's for a styling job that's pretty basic. ``No
blow-drying, just cut and go.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelletier, however, said women are charged more at the salon
even when their hair is shorter than the average man's. And the
same goes with dry cleaners: A woman pays more than a man to clean
a plain white cotton shirt that needs neither special machines nor
special handling.
</P>
<P>
   And that is outlawed by the state's Gender Tax Repeal Act of
1995, which took effect Jan. 1, 1996. The law was passed in the
wake of a 1994 study by the now-closed California Assembly Office
of Research that found 64 percent of dry cleaners and 40 percent of
hair salons in five metropolitan areas charged women more than they
did men for the same services.
</P>
<P>
   That study found that women paid $5 more for a haircut and $1.71
more to have a shirt laundered, according to CalPIRG. Further
studies concluded that each woman in the state annually paid an
average of $1,351 more for those services than men, amounting to
$15 billion each year.
</P>
<P>
   Violators of the law are subject to a minimum $1,000 fine -- if
they're caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``This law is a good law, but it's not being enforced,''
Pelletier said.
</P>
<P>
   At Hair Sanctuary in suburban Woodland Hills, a woman who would
only identify herself as a manager said the salon charges men with
short hair $30 for a shampoo, cut and blow-dry. For women with
``normal'' hair the price ranges from $40 to $45, or ``a little
more'' if it's ``extra thick.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager said women who opt not to get a blow-dry would pay
$30. She said women's hair takes more time and effort than men's,
accounting for the price difference.
</P>
<P>
   For example, women's hair is blow-dried with a brush. For the
typical man, it's just a few swipes with fingers and dryer, and
they're done.
</P>
<P>
   ``For men, usually they don't blow-dry with the brush. If they
do brush, we would charge (more),'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Martinez, assistant manager at Fazio Cleaners in suburban
Sherman Oaks, said the six-store chain charges men and women $1.65
to launder their plain white cotton shirts. Both are charged $4.85
to dry-clean the same garment.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, machines do all the work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because it's a woman's item, a cleaner doesn't have the
right to charge more,'' Martinez said. ``If it's an item that needs
special handling, they would have to charge that.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's where the price discrepancies start, because many
women's garments can't just go through the machines and need more
handling than men's, calling for extra personnel to do the work, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have your silks, beaded items, rhinestone, leather trims,
and that requires special handling,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Fazio doesn't post its prices, but will print them out at the
customer's request, Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Things are actually worse in other parts of the country,
Pelletier said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 88 percent of dry cleaners in Massachusetts charge
women more for their services. In Illinois, 80 percent of hair
salons charge women more.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is way ahead of the pack because we have the law,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to Diana Horn of suburban Encino and her friend Jane,
who hadn't seen each other in some time and spent part of Wednesday
afternoon relaxing over coffee at a Starbucks in Sherman Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Both say they have noticed that men pay less than women do at
the dry cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   But the first thing each wanted to know of the other when they
met was who had done their hair. Both admit they pay a bundle, or
had paid plenty in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason that Horn, a script supervisor for the NBC
television series ``Jessie,'' no longer pays the $100 a pop she was
charged by a salon in posh Bel-Air is that the hairdresser cuts her
a good deal -- and does a terrific job to boot.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll cut my hair for me for $35,'' Horn said. ``Otherwise
I'd be spending ($100).''
</P>
<P>
   Jane, an actress and acting coach from Sherman Oaks who would
not give her last name, said she pays $70, plus a $10 tip, to get
her hair done at that same Bel-Air salon, where she has gotten the
only cut she ever really liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I send a lot of people his way,'' she said. ``He charges $100
normally, which is outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more outrageous is that her boyfriend, whose hair is
longer than Jane's shoulder-length tresses, gets charged only $65
at that salon.
</P>
<P>
   She once asked the stylist about the discrepancy. ``He would
say, Well, well, that's just the way things are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, according to CalPIRG, is to close loopholes in the
law, increase enforcement and industry oversight, and require
service providers to post their prices in easily visible areas.

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ Today, a 77-year-old man will sit on a few million pounds
of rocket fuel and get launched into outer space.
<TEXT>
<P>
   So why can't a 49-year-old man win golf's richest event? Tom
Watson wants to know.
</P>
<P>
   When the Tour Championship tees off today at East Lake Golf
Club, it will be nothing if not a celebration of the PGA Tour's
young guns. David Duval, Tiger Woods and Justin Leonard are just a
few of the 20-somethings with legitimate aspirations of winning
this week.
</P>
<P>
   If any of them do, it will continue the onslaught on the tour by
the younger generation in the past couple of seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of those, there is Watson. Or 41-year-old Mark
O'Meara. Or Payne Stewart, Hal Sutton or Fred Couples, all of whom
are closer to the older generation than the younger.
</P>
<P>
   A lot closer.
</P>
<P>
   Watson is the senior member of the 30-man field playing in the
season-ending Tour Championship at East Lake Golf Club. They ought
to call it East Lake Gold Club with all the high finance going on
here. The winner takes home $720,000 nuggets out of a $4 million
pot of gold.
</P>
<P>
   Watson may not be 77 like John Glenn. But he's 49, more than
twice as old as Woods. He isn't in the running for Player of the
Year. Duval and O'Meara will fight that battle. Watson isn't going
to win the money title, either. In fact, at No. 29, he barely
squeezed into this event.
</P>
<P>
   And he risked that spot by not playing last week at Walt Disney
World, opting to spend the weekend with daughter Meg at parents'
weekend at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sort of thing that puts another space in the
generation gap. Watson, sitting very nearly on the bubble for a
place in golf's richest payday, put his spot in jeopardy for a
family obligation.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Watson, O'Meara and others who remember the '80s
and maybe even the '70s puts this week's tournament in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   While the spotlight is on Duval and Leonard and Woods and the
other new blood, the old-timers aren't exactly fading into the
lush, green background at East Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can play in the tournament like I did today in the
practice round, I have a chance to win this thing,'' Watson said
Wednesday. ``I like to feel like I can win going into a tournament.
I haven't practiced much the past few months. And I worry about not
being tournament-tough, tournament-ready. I worry about my swing
holding up for 72 holes. It might hold up for 18 or 36. But you
never know about 72.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a foreign concept to the whippersnappers. They don't
worry about their swings betraying them. Mostly, they are concerned
with East Lake's glassy greens and the rough that will play havoc
with the occasional stray shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very comparable to Olympic (in San Francisco),'' said
Duval, comparing East Lake to this year's U.S. Open venue. ``The
fairways are narrow, the rough is extremely tough, and the greens
are hard, fast, and have some slope to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course dictates that you hit it in the fairway, knock it
on the green and make a birdie every now and then. Other than that,
you're not going to play golf out of the rough here. There's no
way.''
</P>
<P>
   A reliable swing off the tee truly will be the most valuable
asset this week. East Lake has bermuda grass in the fairways and
rough. It is rare that a marquee PGA Tour event is played on a
course with bermuda grass in the rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never played a major where we've had bermuda grass, so
it's different,'' said Woods. ``The rough is pretty deep. And being
semi-dormant, the ball goes straight to the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be interesting to see how the tournament goes
once it starts. It will be a great test, no doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, who has won two major championships, and Duval, who has
four wins for the year, are battling for the tour's Player of the
Year honor. Neither is a clear-cut winner yet. What happens this
week could sew it up for one of them. Or merely muddle the picture
more if neither seriously contends.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus at this point seems to be that Duval is the best
player in the world at the moment but that O'Meara has had the best
full season.
</P>
<P>
   If accuracy is at a premium at East Lake, it could favor
O'Meara. He consistently finds the short grass. Duval has a length
advantage, but at East Lake there is very much a risk/reward gamble
on every tee shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roughs are unforgiving here,'' said Vijay Singh. ``And
then on the greens, it's almost as bad. You have to hit a lot of
fairways and a lot of greens.''
</P>
<P>
   As Woods added: ``It's going to favor whoever hits it long and
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Watson. After his practice round
Wednesday, he gave an hourlong clinic to Atlanta-area kids who
otherwise would have no contact with a PGA Tour player.
</P>
<P>
   During the clinic, Watson asked how far the kids wanted to see
him hit the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as Tiger Woods,'' came the reply, almost in unison.
``I'm twice as old as Tiger,'' Watson explained. ``I can't hit the
ball as far as Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can hit it straighter than Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that's enough to keep the older generation in step with
the youngsters remains to be seen.

MOB BODYGUARD BARRED FROM WORKING AS LONGSHOREMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When he was the underboss and No. 2 power in the
Gambino crime family in the early 1990s, Salvatore Gravano decided
that his bodyguard and chauffeur lacked a killer's instincts and
was unfit to become a Mafia soldier.
</P>
<P>
   So, as a substitute promotion, Gravano said, he arranged for his
driver, Louis Saccenti, to become a longshoremen's union official,
according to a report Wednesday by the agency that regulates
stevedore operations on the New York and New Jersey piers.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor,
revoked Saccenti's right to work as a longshoreman and as a
supervisor and urged his union, the International Longshoremen's
Association, to remove him from his posts as a vice president of
the union's Atlantic Coast District and as a delegate for Local 1
in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The commission found that Saccenti, 57, lied under oath at an
administrative hearing about his dealings with Gambino members and
that from 1981 to 1996, he met regularly with 38 family members at
Gambino hangouts in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Saccenti, the commission asserted, also siphoned $1,700 from a
union welfare fund and put in false work claims on days that he was
meeting with mobsters and was absent from his waterfront jobs.
</P>
<P>
   For 40 years, the ILA in the New York area and on the East Coast
has been the target of federal and state investigations into
penetration and corruption by organized crime. Asked about the
current extent of Mafia rackets on the waterfront, Patrick Vetrano,
the commission's chief counsel, said, ``It's not the overt stuff we
had years ago, but they are constantly trying to get influence and
their people into positions of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Weighing heavily against Saccenti was a statement by Gravano to
federal authorities in 1994 after he defected and became a
government witness against John J. Gotti, the family boss, and
other organized crime figures.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, which was turned over to the commission by the
U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, Gravano, who was known in the
Mafia as Sammy the Bull, identified Saccenti as an ``associate'' or
worker for the Gambino family and as his ``driver and bodyguard''
from 1986 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intended at one time,'' Gravano said in his statement, ``to
make Saccenti a soldier but decided not to do so because Saccenti
could not do a piece of work or murder, and that he would be killed
if he failed to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano was indicted with Gotti on federal murder and
racketeering charges in 1990 but in 1991 pleaded guilty to reduced
charges. For his role as a key witness against Gotti and other
reputed mobsters, he was freed after five years in federl custody
and after admitting that he had participated in 19 murders.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Saccenti's lawyer, Gerald McMahon, said that his client no
longer worked as a longshoreman and described the commission's
action as meaningless and an attempt to get favorable press
attention. McMahon denied that Saccenti had been a bodyguard for
Gravano, maintaining that they had been neighbors in Staten Island
and that Saccenti, a bricklayer, had worked for Gravano's
construction company when he was laid off from waterfront jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was so close to Gravano and other Gambino members, why
has he never been arrested or indicted for any crime,'' McMahon
said of Saccenti. ``In 1988 and '89 he did associate with Gravano
and so did a million other people.''
</P>
<P>
   John Bowers, the ILA's president, who was in Philadelphia
Wednesday on union business, said through a spokesman that he would
have no comment until he had read the commission's report.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, James McNamara, said that Saccenti's salary as
one of 16 vice presidents was about $70,000 a year but he was was
uncertain what Saccenti was paid as a union delegate.

MOCEANU GETS ADULT STATUS IN DISPUTE OVER HER MONEY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like Bernie Williams of the Yankees, the Olympic gymnast
Dominique Moceanu has been declared a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the 17-year-old high school senior was granted adult
status by a Houston judge as she resolved a lawsuit against her
parents, whom she has accused of squandering her earnings from a
gymnastics career that peaked with a gold medal at the 1996 Summer
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling empowers Moceanu to seek an accounting of her
finances, to hire her own agents and to make her own endorsement
deals without interference from her parents, Dumitru and Camelia
Moceanu. She hopes for a reconciliation with her parents, but will
not live at home, said her attorney, Roy Moore of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   She also retains the right to sue her parents if an examination
of her finances shows that her earnings have been mismanaged, Moore
said. It remains unclear how much money Moceanu has left from the
approximately $1 million she has earned from competitions,
endorsements and her autobiography since the 1996 Olympics. ``She
will begin getting her ducks in a row,'' Moore said. ``The big
thing is that she can contract and run her own life.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ruling will not speed up Moceanu's ability to draw
money from a trust fund, to which she is blocked access until she
is 35, Moore said. But he said she is free to begin keeping the
money she earns from now on.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu ran away from her parents' home 12 days ago and filed
suit against her parents last week seeking to be declared an adult.
She has accused her parents of placing her money in risky
investments, including a $2 million gym in north Harris County.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents initially opposed her attempt for legal
independence, saying she was being influenced by friends interested
in her money, but both sides reached a settlement on Tuesday.
Wednesday, Moceanu was given adult status during a 20-minute
hearing in Houston by State District Judge John Montgomery, and a
restraining order against her parents was removed. Her father
signed the agreement with tears in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life,''
Dominique Moceanu told reporters. ``It was something I felt I had
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``This is a great day, but a sad day. I want to get
one thing straight. I'm not living at home, I'm not going back
home.''

CONVICTED OF MURDER, MAN IS CLEARED 7 YEARS LATER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also HERBERT-COLUMN) 
(bl) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jeffrey Blake went to prison for murder in 1991 on
the weight of one man's word. Thursday, after spending more than a
quarter of his life behind bars, Blake will go free because,
officials now concede, that man's word was a lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case of a lifetime,'' exclaimed Michelle Fox, the
Legal Aid Society lawyer who handled the six-year appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday night, Ms. Fox delivered the stunning news to her
client: Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes had agreed to ask
that the guilty verdict be set aside and that the indictment
against Blake be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Blake, 29, will leave his Dutchess County prison cell
and appear before Acting State Supreme Court Justice Robert
Kreindler, who is expected to grant the requests and make him a
free man.
</P>
<P>
   Hynes spokesman Patrick Clark credited Ms. Fox and Bob Herbert,
a columnist for The New York Times, for setting in motion the
events that led to Blake's exoneration.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, Herbert wrote two columns revealing critical
weaknesses in the case against Blake, most notably that the only
witness, Dana Garner, had passed a polygraph test admitting that
his original testimony was a lie. The columns and a later meeting
with Ms. Fox prompted Hynes to order the case re-examined.
</P>
<P>
   Hynes was the Brooklyn district attorney during the 1990 trial,
which was prosecuted by an assistant district attorney, Anthony
Catalano. Wednesday, Deputy District Attorney Dennis Hawkins, who
led the re-examination of the case, defended the handling of the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live by an adversarial system,'' he said. ``Our job is to
present evidence we believe is credible. The defense's job is to
poke holes in it. In a sense, the system worked, although it took
some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fox was less forgiving, particularly since her client had
spent a little more seven years in prison and about a year in jail
for the crime. She said investigators should have taken a harder
look at Garner's credibility, particularly because he also claimed
to be a witness to a second double shooting two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   The 13th of 14 children, Blake will be greeted Thursday by a
joyous family. ``We're planning a big party for him,'' his sister,
Denise Blake, said. ``Everybody is happy. Every time I went to
visit him, all he could say was that he would be glad when he gets
out of there. He said he was in there for something he didn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Blake seemed to have little hope of an early release. By
this summer, Ms. Fox said she had exhausted her appeals, when she
happened to read a July 12 column by Herbert titled, ``Wrong Man at
Rikers,'' about a different case in which Hynes' office put the
wrong man in Rikers Island. In the column, Herbert quoted Hynes as
saying, ``I'm the last person in the world who wants the wrong
person in jail.'' So Ms. Fox picked up the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call from her,'' Herbert said Thursday. ``She said the
appeals process had been exhausted. She wanted to know if I was
interested in writing about the case. I said I was interested only
if I could be fully convinced that the guy was innocent.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Herbert said he reviewed trial transcripts and appeal records
and interviewed prosecutors. The killings happened on June 18,
1990, when two men, Everton Denny and Kenneth Felix, were killed by
dozens of bullets fired from an automatic weapon into their car in
East New York, Brooklyn. Police canvassed the area, but found no
one willing to testify, Hawkins said. A few days later, Dana Garner
told the police that he saw Blake firing into the passenger side of
the car.
</P>
<P>
   The Garner and Blake families lived a block apart in East New
York and often socialized together. But Garner's credibility was
suspect even at the time of the trial. Ms. Fox said his cousin
testified that Garner was not in the city at the time of the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Blake had no record of violent criminal offenses, though in 1986
he had been sentenced to five years' probation after being
convicted of possessing a small quantity of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the shootings, Blake worked at a
religious-supplies store in Bedford-Stuyvesant about five miles
away. His co-workers testified that on the day of the killings, he
had been on the job. But prosecutors established that Blake had
taken his lunch break between 1:15 p.m. and 2 p.m. The murder
occurred at 1:45 p.m. His sister testified that Blake ate lunch at
her apartment, not far from his job.
</P>
<P>
   But Blake was convicted in May 1991 and sentenced to 36 years to
life in prison. In 1993, Ms. Fox had reason to hope: Garner
recanted his testimony on videotape and agreed to testify at
Blake's appeal. Upon taking the stand, though, Garner refused to
testify.
</P>
<P>
   But Garner passed a recent polygraph test in which he again
recanted his testimony. ``I think he likes the attention,'' Ms. Fox
said, trying to explain Garner's motivation in lying. ``He enjoys
thinking of himself as being at the center of attention of things
and helping police solve crimes.'' Garner will not be charged with
perjury because the five-year statute of limitations on the charge
has expired. Hawkins said a new investigation has begun in the
search for the real killer. ``We are continuing to pursue that as
well,'' he said.

SCHUMER SAYS D'AMATO'S MISSED VOTES CLOSES THE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also filed in category `a') 
(mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMIRA HEIGHTS, N.Y. _ Rep. Charles Schumer denounced Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato Wednesday for running a ``cynical campaign on what
we now see clearly is a phony issue'' after D'Amato acknowledged
that he had skipped hundreds of votes as a local official when he
first ran for the Senate in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of missed votes is now over,'' Schumer declared in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But D'Amato was quick to disagree. After appearing to hold back
Wednesday morning at a rally along the Hudson River in Yonkers,
D'Amato later returned with a vengeance to the issue of Schumer's
skipping votes in order to run for the Senate, as he campaigned for
a second day across upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   While rattling off statistics relating to Schumer's absentee
record this year to illustrate what has been the central thrust of
his campaign, the senator defended himself against the
countercharges over his own missed votes, which came 18 years ago
when he was a member of the Nassau County Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato said it was ``ludicrous'' to compare his attendance
record when he first ran for the Senate _ he attended only one out
of six meetings of the supervisors' board that fall _ with
congressional votes that Schumer missed this year.
</P>
<P>
   And in a sharp effort to move attention away from a disclosure
that even the senator's own supporters described as threatening to
D'Amato's re-election prospects, he raised 18-year-old allegations
that Schumer had used state employees to work on his first campaign
for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges between D'Amato and his Democratic challenger came
as the two candidates entered a tense final week of a campaign that
has clearly been jolted by the disclosure of records that suggested
that D'Amato had, as presiding supervisor of the town of Hempstead
in 1980, done the same thing for which he has criticized Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, who has spent much of the last month responding to
questions about votes he missed this year, seemed elated by the
turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is coming back to haunt him,'' Schumer asserted at a
Manhattan news conference, where he appeared with James Brady, the
former White House press secretary who was gravely wounded in the
assassination attempt on President Reagan and has since become the
nation's leading advocate for gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The votes he missed demonstrates that Al D'Amato's whole
campaign was a fraud,'' Schumer said, standing in front of a blue
backdrop in his midtown campaign headquarters. ``Again, I repeat,
it's not that he missed the votes. It's rather that he would use
the issue of missed votes, knowing he missed as many as he did, to
be the whole centerpiece of his campaign. It's definite proof that
New Yorkers can't trust him, and after 18 years, it's time for the
hypocrisy to end.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Brady turned one of D'Amato's campaign lines against him as
he endorsed Schumer _ for the second time this year _ for his
efforts on behalf of the gun control legislation that Congress
passed in Brady's honor. ``Yesterday, I read where Al D'Amato
missed more than 900 votes,'' Brady said, reading from a sheet of
paper. ``I wished he would have missed the votes on the Brady bill
and the assault weapons ban.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato missed more than 1,000 votes taken on both boards on
which he served _ the Hempstead Town Board and the Nassau County
Board of Supervisors _ during the 1980 election campaign, according
to a count by Newsday.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's campaign staff, and many of his supporters, showed
signs of concern about the disclosure throughout the day _ both
because the senator may have now lost the issue on which he had
hooked his campaign and because the incident feeds into Schumer's
attempt to portray him as untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Several elected Republican officials who attended D'Amato's
rallies Wednesday but who asked not to be identified said they were
growing increasingly concerned about D'Amato's prospects for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   One supporter expressed anger at D'Amato's campaign for making
such a fundamental political error: not adequately investigating
its candidate's background before raising the allegations about an
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, who is normally eager to talk to reporters, went to
great lengths Wednesday to avoid discussing the issue as he
campaigned across the state with Gov. George Pataki. In Yonkers,
appearing before a huge contingent of television cameras, the
senator took just one question, and then, again
uncharacteristically, read from a statement that he was holding
down on the lectern against the wind blowing off the Hudson River
behind him.

 &HT;    Chipper Jones faces the music on WSB
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Braves third baseman Chipper Jones went before the
callers Wednesday morning on WSB Radio, spending three hours
responding to questions and comments about his infidelity in what
he hoped would be the first step toward public forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, along with Braves announcers Pete Van Wieren, Don Sutton
and Joe Simpson, were sitting in for the vacationing Neal Boortz, a
commitment that was made before Jones confirmed that he had
fathered a child out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the questions surprised me,'' Jones said afterward.
``All of the questions I had fielded already from family members. I
was prepared for anything, the best and the worst. In Atlanta, if
you are sincere, most people are the forgiving kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was encouraged by what happened, but I know it's going to
take some time.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the calls were supportive. The most critical
call came from a woman about two hours deep into the show.
</P>
<P>
   She said it appeared to her that Jones was getting support
because he was a star athlete, and the fact he was ``willing to
work it out makes it OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones replied, ``All I'm trying to do is ask for forgiveness.
... I'm not using the fact that I'm the third baseman for the
Braves to automatically sweep this under the rug. I'm not using my
authority to weasel my way out of this. I'm genuinely sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Wieren said there were discussions before air time as to how
much of the show would be devoted to Jones' problems off the field.
</P>
<P>
   All three Braves' announcers were candid in their questions to
Jones, with no attempts to play spin doctor. But Simpson leaped
once to Jones' defense after one particularly unforgiving caller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said at the start we did not want the program to be Chipper
Jones at the whipping post,'' Van Wieren said. ``We asked Chipper
if he wanted us to try and move in another direction, but he said
no. He wanted to hear whatever the callers had to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other notables:
</P>
<P>
   _ On his reaction if his wife had acted the way he did:the
situation was vice versa with his wife: ``I honestly can't say I
would handle it as well as she did. ... I'd like to say I'd have
the grace, faith and hope she displayed, but there's only one Karin
Jones. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the strongest person I've ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On why he went public: ``I've not been blackmailed. It was my
decision and Karin's decision. ... I felt like the people needed to
know. I'd see all those Chipper Jones signs at the ballpark and
felt tremendous, tremendous guilt. I was wondering whether I was
worthy of all that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt if everything was out on the table, then people could
make their judgments. If they were still behind me, that's great.
If they were not, I understand. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was important to do it so that we could start the
process of getting this behind us.''

 &HT;    Ga. State picked to win the TAAC
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the Trans America Athletic Conference held its
annual basketball media-day event in Atlanta on Wednesday, two
coaches from a year ago were conspicious by their absence. Shakey
Rodriguez of Florida International and John Kresse of College of
Charleston have taken their teams to other leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Those changes explain in parts why Georgia State, in Lefty
Driesell's second year as coach, has been picked by league coaches
and sports information directors to win the TAAC title this season.
</P>
<P>
   The 66-year-old Driesell, seated next to former Georgia coach
and TAAC newcomer Hugh Durham on the podium at the gathering,
seemed unfazed by the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean a thing to be picked No. 1 in the preseason,
although I'd rather be picked first than last,'' he said. ``It's
still going to depend on what kind of coaching job you do.''
</P>
<P>
   The job Driesell and his staff did last season produced a
school-record 16 victories and left the veteran coach one win
shortof 700 heading into the Nov. 18 opener against Georgetown in
the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   However, only two starters return from last year, and senior
forward Quincy Gause recently was declared academically ineligible
for fall semester.But that game also marks the resumption of
basketball careers for former Georgia Tech point guard Kevin Morris
and off guard Anton Reese, who started at Alabama two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Durham, who has compiled a record of 536-330 during his 30 years
in the business, is one of two new coaches introduced. His
Jacksonville University team _ not to be confused with TAAC member
Jacksonville State of Alabama _ joins the 11-team league from the
Sun Belt Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The other newcomer is Jacksonville State coach Mark Turgeon, who
played for Larry Brown at Kansas ('83-'87) and comes from an
assistant's position with Brown's Phiadelphia 76ers.

 &HT;    Anderson blames himself for woes
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ On a May night in Gulfport, Miss., a 34-year-old man
who should have known better sat cringing in a casino hotel room,
his arms filled with drug money, a cop's pistol barrel screwed into
his ear, his head spinning, looking across the room at the dealer
who gave him up and asking the same question his friends have asked
for months.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   This week, Greg ``Cadillac'' Anderson, dapper as always in a
gray suit, sat in a conference room in Houston with Tim Johnson,
his attorney, and remembered his desperate words:
</P>
<P>
   ```Why did you do this to me?' That's what I asked him.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the better question would have been: Why did Anderson, a
10-year NBA veteran, do this to himself?
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Anderson, who pleaded guilty on Oct. 20 to
participating in a drug deal five months ago, can't come up with
one rational explanation for his behavior and can't put the blame
on anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't do it for the money. Anderson never took the $1,000
the dealer offered. He didn't do it for the drugs, either. Anderson
never was a hard-drug user.
</P>
<P>
   Like a character in an Elmore Leonard novel, this man who earned
about $7 million playing basketball was caught in the web of drug
dealers and government agents because he lacked the smarts and the
backbone to walk away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have said I don't want to be affiliated with this,''
he said Tuesday. ``When I knew what they were doing, I could have
said no. But I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Anderson says, he understands the damage was
self-inflicted, that he is guilty of negligence and, worst of all,
participating in a drug deal. That's why he twists in the wind,
awaiting his sentence on Feb. 9 for the crime of possession of
cocaine with intent to distribute. He tries to keep his life
together _ and his relationship with four children who were removed
from his home by a wife who is suing for divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is living, breathing proof that you don't have to be a
bad guy to get in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, you sure don't,'' Anderson said. ``I wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   He should have known better on the late-winter evening in a
Buckhead nightspot when he first met and drank beers with Anthony
Bates, who turned out to be an FBI informant, and Howard Hill, a
drug dealer Bates was assigned to collar. They were easy to know,
and Hill shared something in common with Anderson _ love of a big,
powerful V8 sedan, the Chevrolet Impala SS. Anderson's was black,
Hill's burgundy.
</P>
<P>
   During weeks that followed, Hill and Bates made frequent trips
from Biloxi to Atlanta, and Anderson ``only tried to show them some
hospitality.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson says he wasn't sure at the time why they chose him, but
he later learned that Hill needed a drug connection in Houston and
that Bates was content to let the operation unfold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have been suspicious,'' Anderson said. ``I wondered
how they had the money to keep coming up to Atlanta like that, but
I never asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, he brought them to his teammates, who remember them today
as a couple of guys from Mississippi. ``Those were the guys?'' Ty
Corbin asks, incredulous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I introduced them around,'' Anderson said. ``They'd come to
shoot-around, and after that we'd go to eat. They came when we
played Chicago, Charlotte. I didn't see no wrongdoing. We'd laugh,
joke, go eat. After that, they'd go separate ways. It never dawned
on me to have these guys checked out, never dawned on me these guys
were trouble. It was like friends come down see you play, cheer you
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Anderson says, he was made suspicious by the frequency
of their visits. ``I'm beginning to think, you guys keep coming
back; money ain't no object to 'em,'' Anderson said. ``But the
season be ending and the weather be nice, and you don't really
focus in on that.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the season ended, Anderson stopped in Biloxi
with teammate Anthony Miller. When Miller left the group that
night, Anderson learned the truth about his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``They showed us a good time,'' Anderson said. ``We went to a
club, and that's when Hill told me, 'This (selling drugs) is what
we do in Mississippi. We got all this area, and that's what we do.'
Right then and there, I should have said I don't want to be
affiliated. That's what I should have did, but I didn't. You're
laughing and joking. I been driving all day, and your mind don't
click.''
</P>
<P>
   The trap is sprung
</P>
<P>
   A week later, on May 13, Bates and Hill went to visit Anderson
in his hometown of Houston. The two offered Anderson a $1,000
finder's fee if he could assist in helping them set up a drug deal.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson introduced the men to Kevin Blackmon, an old
acquaintance he thought might have drug connections. Anderson
recalls that Blackmon always drove a nice automobile. ``In the
neighborhood where I grew up, if you had a nice car, everyone knew
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Anderson and to FBI reports, here's what happened:
</P>
<P>
   Blackmon put up a kilo of cocaine and gave it to Hill, who left
his Impala in Anderson's driveway as security for the $26,000 cost
of the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Bates informed law enforcement officials on the Gulf Coast of
the transaction, so when Hill and his associate, Kevin Porter,
transported the drugs to Biloxi they were quickly apprehended
during a set-up traffic stop. When the cocaine was found in their
car, Hill agreed to implicate Anderson, just as Anderson later
implicated Blackmon.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, unaware of the drug bust in Biloxi, was called daily
by Hill in an effort to get Anderson to incriminate himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calling me every day, how much he sold, how much he made,
everything all right,'' Anderson explained. ``Calling me every day
to get me to come to Mississippi to pick up (Blackmon's) money;
saying he couldn't come to Houston because his son was diabetic and
in the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson didn't have to go. It wasn't his business. But he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel I had to do it, but I introduced these two guys,
and the car is sitting at my house, and this guy's asking for his
money, and that guy's saying he can't bring the money, and what I
should have done was let these two guys fight it out,'' Anderson
said. ``I could have asked Blackmon to pick it up. I put it off two
days in a row. Hill called: 'Man, come on down; the casino's
packed.' He's saying, 'Come hang with me.' So I figured I'd get it,
square Blackmon up.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson flew to Mississippi on May 20 and was apprehended an
hour after he arrived in town. The FBI had put Hill in room 870 of
the Grand Casino Bayview in Gulfport. Monitoring equipment was
placed in an adjoining room. Hill set the trap, ``saying a guy
(was) coming to buy this last bit of drugs he had left _ two, three
ounces. I said I don't want to see that; I don't want this around
me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson didn't walk away. ``Soon as (an undercover cop)
buys (the drugs), the guy gives me the money, like 'Here's the
rent.' ``
</P>
<P>
   And that, says Anderson, is why he was holding $26,000 in drug
money when cops crashed into the room and put a gun to his head. He
was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   As Hill handed him over, Anderson agreed to reel in Blackmon.
Anderson was released and sent back to the Grand Casino Bayview to
spend the night in the government's entrapment room.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Anderson and Hill set up Blackmon at a Houston
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up the pieces
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Hawks officials and Anderson's teammates were
unaware of the situation until an FBI agent made references to the
case during a government hearing in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks learned of Anderson's involvement the night of June
24, while they were participating in the NBA draft. A day later, a
startled Miller said, ``I spoke to Caddy last night. He never said
a word.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization was shocked. Anderson just didn't fit the
profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have known better,'' Anderson said. ``I should have
been more careful, more suspicious, but I wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   So, now he tries to figure out what to do with the rest of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is going to prison, no escaping that. Federal
sentencing guidelines call for 30 to 37 months, but Johnson says he
probably will get less, under a recommendation from the government.
He would like to play in the NBA again, but he knows that it's a
longshot, at best. He could play overseas, if he can get a visa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could work with young players, too,'' he said. ``Tell them
what to look out for, give them some guidance so they don't make
the mistake I made, of trusting everybody.''

 &HT;    Anatomy of a deal gone bad
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A summary of Greg ``Cadillac'' Anderson's involvement
in and arrest for drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   _ Late winter 1998: Greg Anderson goes to the Buckhead
nightclub, Atlanta Live, and begins a friendship with two men from
Biloxi, Miss. _ Anthony Bates, an FBI informant, and Howard Hill, a
drug dealer that Bates is stalking. Bates and Hill travel to
Atlanta often during March and April to visit Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   _ May 5, 1998: Anderson and teammate Anthony Miller are
entertained by Bates and Hill in Biloxi, then drive to Houston,
Anderson's hometown, the next day. Anderson knows his estranged
wife and children have moved out of his home but now learns that
most of the furniture also has been taken.
</P>
<P>
   _ May 13: One day after Miller returns to Atlanta, Bates and
Hill visit Anderson in Houston. They tell him they are looking for
a drug deal and offer to cut him in on a finder's fee of $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ May 14: Anderson introduces his new friends to Kevin Blackmon,
an old Houston acquaintance, who has drug connections. The meeting
is successful; the operation is planned.
</P>
<P>
   _ May 15-16: After being supplied with a kilo of cocaine, Bates
and Kevin Porter, Hill's crony, are detained at a set-up traffic
stop in Biloxi. The supply of cocaine, already divided into 16
bags, is discovered. Hill, the deal-maker, has Anderson drive him
to the airport in Houston. He flies home to Gulfport and is quickly
apprehended.
</P>
<P>
   _ May 20: Anderson flies to Gulf Shores to pick up a payment for
Blackmon at the Grand Casino Bayview Hotel. In room 870, an
undercover agent buys the remaining three ounces of cocaine and
hands the money to Anderson. Agents enter the room, put a gun to
Anderson's head and arrest him. Anderson is released, after
promising to cooperate. He is allowed to spend the night in room
869, the room from which the events in 870 were recorded hours
earlier. The government has paid for the room.
</P>
<P>
   _ May 28: Anderson arranges a meeting at a Houston restaurant
with Blackmon, so Hill can pay him $26,000 for the cocaine. As
Anderson goes to the men's room, Blackmon is apprehended with a
total of $28,000, including $1,000 meant for Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Oct. 20: Anderson, Porter and Blackmon plead guilty to one
count each of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.
Three other counts are dropped. Hill had pleaded guilty one week
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   _ Feb. 9, 1999: Anderson can be sentenced to a maximum of 40
years but really is facing 30 to 37 months, according to sentencing
guidelines. He might draw a lesser sentence at the request of the
government, which promised to intercede, pending his cooperation
and good conduct.

 &HT;    Clemson to meet N.C. State on Saturday
 &HT;    By Norman Arey and Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEMSON vs. N.C. State, Saturday, noon
</P>
<P>
   Questions about coach Tommy West's job security that began early
in the season reached a peak after the 28-23 loss to Duke. West
says he has not talked or met with athletics director Bobby
Robinson about his job and has already started planning for next
season. Although Robinson has said West and the team will be
evaluated after the season, the AD said last week that West's
one-year contract extension given this summer was not guaranteed
and any buyout was capped at $325,000. ... Despite the team's
struggles on offense, the defense is ranked second in the ACC
heading into Saturday's game against North Carolina State. ...
Freshman running back Travis Zachery, a former All-State player at
Marietta High, leads the Tigers with 441 yards.
</P>
<P>
   DUKE at Vanderbilt, Saturday, 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem strange, but the Blue Devils could be a bowl team
at the end of the season. The 4-4 Devils close out their season
against Vanderbilt, Maryland and North Carolina _ three teams
without a winning record. But don't say that to Duke coach Fred
Goldsmith. ``I haven't been talking about a bowl,'' he said. ``My
gosh, look at our record over the past few years. It hasn't been
that impressive, and it's not that impressive this year. Vanderbilt
has probably chalked us up as a `W' a long time ago.'' Duke has
gotten better, and the turnaround seems to have been most
pronounced when Bobby Campbell replaced Spencer Romine at
quarterback. Campbell has completed 49 of 85 passes for 524 yards
and two TDs and only one interception in his last three games.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA STATE vs. North Carolina, Saturday, 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bobby Bowden says he's very familiar with North Carolina
freshman quarterback Ronald Curry, who will face his team for the
first time Saturday. ``We tried our best to recruit Curry out of
high school,'' he said. ``I thought he was the best quarterback,
no, football player, I've ever seen.'' ... Bowden also says he's
aware of Tar Heels All-America cornerback Dre Bly and expects to
see FSU's wideout Peter Warrick go against Bly. ``If I knew where
Bly was going to line up, I'd try to get Pete somewhere else. But
we're going to test him.'' ... Both defensive tackle Jerry Johnson
and cornerback Tay Cody got banged up against Georgia Tech last
week, but Bowden says both will play. Only Lamont Green will miss
the game with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   MARYLAND vs. Georgia Tech, Saturday, noon
</P>
<P>
   The Terrapins, mired in a three-game losing streak, will make
their debut in the new Ravens Stadium in Baltimore. Maryland hopes
to attract 25,000 for the game, held approximately 40 miles from
its College Park campus, although it had only 23,419 for its Oct.
17 homecoming game against Wake Forest. ``It's such a close
proximity to College Park,'' coach Ron Vanderlinden said. ``It's a
win-win for everybody.'' ... The lone bright spot for a Maryland
offense that ranks last in the conference is running back Lamont
Jordan, who posted the fourth 100-yard rushing game of his career
in the 20-10 loss to Wake Forest. Jordan is third in the ACC with
81.7 yards per game. ... The Maryland defense, led by linebackers
Eric Barton and Kendall Ogle, ranks fifth in the ACC.
</P>
<P>
   NORTH CAROLINA at FSU, Saturday, 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Carl Torbush probably will wait until game time before
making a decision on a starting quarterback. Freshman Ronald Curry
passed for 230 yards and a touchdown in last week's 38-31 victory
over Wake Forest; senior Oscar Davenport returns after serving a
one-game suspension for violating team rules. ... After opening the
season with three losses in a row, the Tar Heels take a three-game
winning streak into Saturday's game at Florida State. UNC, with the
conference's seventh-ranked offense, goes against a defense ranked
No. 1 in the ACC and the nation. ``The key against them is to make
yardage on first down,'' Torbush said. ``If they get you in
second-and-long or third-and-long, that's when they're able to make
the big plays with the sacks, hits, and interceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   N.C. STATE at Clemson, Saturday, noon
</P>
<P>
   Ray Robinson had a career performance in last week's 23-13 loss
to Virginia, and the freshman running back hopes to build on the
effort against the ACC's second-ranked rushing defense. Robinson
rushed for 202 yards on 27 carries against the Cavaliers, an
individual high and the fourth-best single-game rushing total in
school history. ... The Wolfpack are second in the ACC in total
offense and seventh in total defense. ... Junior quarterback Jamie
Barnette holds the school record for total offense (6,104 yards)
and probably will add another pair of records this week. He needs
12 yards to pass Terry Harvey as the all-time leading passer and
one touchdown to break his tie with Harvey for TD passes. ...
Receiver Torry Holt is fourth in the ACC in career touchdown
receptions (26) and fifth in receiving yardage (2,709).
</P>
<P>
   VIRGINIA at Wake Forest, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers must play the rest of the season without
All-America safety Anthony Poindexter, out with a torn ligament.
Coach George Welsh says he hasn't decided on Poindexter's
replacement yet. ``We're trying Adrian Bumin and Antwan Harris
there, but I don't want to go into the Wake game, with their
passing attack, with only one cornerback. If we take Harris away
from corner and play him at safety, I'm not sure that's the way to
go.'' ... Virginia is one of only seven teams in the country to
average 200 yards or more both rushing and passing. ... Virginia
tailback Thomas Jones has scored six touchdowns in his last three
games and leads the ACC in rushing and is ninth in the country with
1,229 yards. ... Wake's Desmond Clark has 23 catches against
Virginia over the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   WAKE FOREST vs. Virginia, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   With injuries throughout the season to seven of its 11 defensive
starters, the Deacons have fallen well short of expectations. ``We
have had a whole rash of injuries,'' coach Jim Caldwell said.
``It's the most I've ever been through except for one year when I
was an assistant at Penn State.'' ... With Virginia leading the ACC
in rushing offense, Caldwell knows what his team's priority is.
``The focal point in this game is to stop the run,'' he said. ``We
can't allow people to run the ball and keep the ball out of our
offense's hands. Virginia's front seven is as fine as you'll see in
the country.'' ... Wake might have a few tricks up its sleeve.
Wideout Desmond Clark lined up at tight end against North Carolina
last week on several sets.

SCHUMER SAYS D'AMATO'S MISSED VOTES CLOSES THE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also filed in category `p') 
(mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMIRA HEIGHTS, N.Y. _ Rep. Charles Schumer denounced Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato Wednesday for running a ``cynical campaign on what
we now see clearly is a phony issue'' after D'Amato acknowledged
that he had skipped hundreds of votes as a local official when he
first ran for the Senate in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of missed votes is now over,'' Schumer declared in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But D'Amato was quick to disagree. After appearing to hold back
Wednesday morning at a rally along the Hudson River in Yonkers,
D'Amato later returned with a vengeance to the issue of Schumer's
skipping votes in order to run for the Senate, as he campaigned for
a second day across upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   While rattling off statistics relating to Schumer's absentee
record this year to illustrate what has been the central thrust of
his campaign, the senator defended himself against the
countercharges over his own missed votes, which came 18 years ago
when he was a member of the Nassau County Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato said it was ``ludicrous'' to compare his attendance
record when he first ran for the Senate _ he attended only one out
of six meetings of the supervisors' board that fall _ with
congressional votes that Schumer missed this year.
</P>
<P>
   And in a sharp effort to move attention away from a disclosure
that even the senator's own supporters described as threatening to
D'Amato's re-election prospects, he raised 18-year-old allegations
that Schumer had used state employees to work on his first campaign
for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges between D'Amato and his Democratic challenger came
as the two candidates entered a tense final week of a campaign that
has clearly been jolted by the disclosure of records that suggested
that D'Amato had, as presiding supervisor of the town of Hempstead
in 1980, done the same thing for which he has criticized Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, who has spent much of the last month responding to
questions about votes he missed this year, seemed elated by the
turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is coming back to haunt him,'' Schumer asserted at a
Manhattan news conference, where he appeared with James Brady, the
former White House press secretary who was gravely wounded in the
assassination attempt on President Reagan and has since become the
nation's leading advocate for gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The votes he missed demonstrates that Al D'Amato's whole
campaign was a fraud,'' Schumer said, standing in front of a blue
backdrop in his midtown campaign headquarters. ``Again, I repeat,
it's not that he missed the votes. It's rather that he would use
the issue of missed votes, knowing he missed as many as he did, to
be the whole centerpiece of his campaign. It's definite proof that
New Yorkers can't trust him, and after 18 years, it's time for the
hypocrisy to end.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Brady turned one of D'Amato's campaign lines against him as
he endorsed Schumer _ for the second time this year _ for his
efforts on behalf of the gun control legislation that Congress
passed in Brady's honor. ``Yesterday, I read where Al D'Amato
missed more than 900 votes,'' Brady said, reading from a sheet of
paper. ``I wished he would have missed the votes on the Brady bill
and the assault weapons ban.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato missed more than 1,000 votes taken on both boards on
which he served _ the Hempstead Town Board and the Nassau County
Board of Supervisors _ during the 1980 election campaign, according
to a count by Newsday.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's campaign staff, and many of his supporters, showed
signs of concern about the disclosure throughout the day _ both
because the senator may have now lost the issue on which he had
hooked his campaign and because the incident feeds into Schumer's
attempt to portray him as untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Several elected Republican officials who attended D'Amato's
rallies Wednesday but who asked not to be identified said they were
growing increasingly concerned about D'Amato's prospects for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   One supporter expressed anger at D'Amato's campaign for making
such a fundamental political error: not adequately investigating
its candidate's background before raising the allegations about an
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, who is normally eager to talk to reporters, went to
great lengths Wednesday to avoid discussing the issue as he
campaigned across the state with Gov. George Pataki. In Yonkers,
appearing before a huge contingent of television cameras, the
senator took just one question, and then, again
uncharacteristically, read from a statement that he was holding
down on the lectern against the wind blowing off the Hudson River
behind him.

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two former Division I coaches now guiding programs in
the SWAC will meet Saturday in the Magic City Classic in
Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Former Temple coach Ron Dickerson will lead the Alabama State
Hornets against Alabama A&AMP;M and coach Ron Cooper, the former coach
at Louisville. Both teams are struggling entering the annual match
at Legion Field, which has attracted crowds of more than 40,000
each of the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets (2-5) was idle last week, while Alabama A&AMP;M (4-4)
has two losses in a row to Division II opponents, Tuskegee and
Miles of the SIAC.
</P>
<P>
   _ A blast from the past
</P>
<P>
   The once-powerful ``Big Blue'' of Tennessee State, which has
gone eight years without a winning record, played its last
homecoming game at Hale Stadium last week and mustered the kind of
offensive performance last seen during the heyday of the late
``Big'' John Merritt.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers (5-2), a victory shy of their first winning record
since the 1990 team coached by Joe Gilliam Sr. finished 7-4, routed
Ohio Valley Conference foe Tennessee-Martn 76-0 before an overflow
crowd of 22,046 _ 6,000 more than seating capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The most lopsided victory since TSU routed Kentucky State 83-0
in 1966 came without head coach L.C. Cole and his brother, Johnnie
Cole, the offensive coordinator. The Cole brothers were serving a
university-imposed one-game suspension that resulted from an
in-house investigation of alleged violations of NCAA rules
involving former TSU quarterback Todd Valentine. The NCAA's
investigation is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, who take their home games to new Tennessee Oilers
stadium in downtown Nashville next season, will play their final
home game Nov. 16 when former Big Blue player and coach Bill Thomas
brings his Texas Southern team to town.
</P>
<P>
   _ No 'D' for Doug
</P>
<P>
   Grambling's Doug Williams, after watching his team get blown out
68-35 at home by Jackson State, fell to within two defeats of a
losing record in his first year as coach at his alma mater. The
Tigers, 3-4, have matched the number of victories recorded last
season under Eddie Robinson. They haven't done it with defense,
though, giving up 40 points or more in three games. In Saturday's
loss, Jackson State wide receiver Sylvester Morris from New Orleans
victimized the G-Men's defense so severely he was named SWAC
``Offensive Player of the Week.'' The 6-2, 210-pound junior caught
eight passes for 201 yards and five TDs.
</P>
<P>
   _ MIghty little, mighty powerful
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone College, the smallest Division II school in the
country, with 650 or so students, continued to roll toward Atlanta
and the Pioneer Bowl for the second year in row. Livingstone
registered the CIAA's most lopsided win of the season, shellacking
Elizabeth City State 59-0 Saturday to reach 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Three of Livingstone's running backs, freshmen Carlton Jones
(849 yards) and Ray Chambers (496), and sophomore Shannon Gainey
(452), have averaged 6 yards or more per carry.
</P>
<P>
   _ Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Anticipated blowout of the week: Florida A&AMP;M, the I-AA scoring
leader at 50 points a game, has had a week to rest for battle-worn
Morgan State (1-6). Morgan coach Stump Mitchell should expect no
mercy in Tallahassee.

 &HT;    Falcons line focusing on blitzes
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Falcons coach Dan Reeves added an extra period
to practice Wednesday so his offensive line could work on picking
up blitzes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what the team really could use is extra blockers on
passing downs. The Falcons have surrendered 30 sacks this season,
including 14 on third down and one on fourth down, and are on pace
to allow 69. Opponents are sacking Atlanta quarterbacks once every
7.7 passing attempts, worst in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   So the priority at Suwanee is to improve.
</P>
<P>
   The simple idea of keeping more people in to block isn't always
the answer. Recognition of the defense, however, is part of the
solution.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta didn't anticipate New York coming with an all-out,
eight-man blitz Sunday, such as the one on which quarterback Steve
DeBerg got hit and lost a fumble that New York returned for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   A week earlier, starting quarterback Chris Chandler was knocked
out of the Saints game when all three New Orleans linebackers
criss-crossed up the middle. The Falcons didn't anticipate that
move, either.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest answer in these situations? ``Get rid of the ball
quick,'' Chandler said, even if it means throwing it away.
</P>
<P>
   As Atlanta struggles, opponents continue to blitz. They look at
Chandler, or any quarterback for that matter, and see instant
injury potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's not like every team is showing the same blitzes each
week,'' center Robbie Tobeck said. ``We have to get better at
recognizing. The talent is there. We're getting our quarterback hit
too much. We need ... a sense of urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, who looked healthy enough in practice Wednesday to
make the team think he'll be the starter Sunday against the Rams
(2-5), would say amen to that.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said that rookie tackle Jose Portilla will split time
with rookie right tackle Ephraim Salaam and that rookie Bob Hallen
will split time with second-year left guard Calvin Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need better recognition (of what defenses are doing),
better film study, watching where the 'backers and safeties line
up,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons rarely involve tight ends in blitz pickups. Starter
O.J. Santiago often leaves the game in passing situations.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, there are two running backs in the backfield, and their
first assignment is blitz pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can stop (blitzes) one (game),'' Collins said, ``other
teams won't use it as much.

 &HT;    Falcons starting defense hit hard by injuries
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Falcons (5-2) have the NFL's No. 5 defense against
the run, allowing 90.1 yards per game, but that number could be in
jeopardy Sunday against the Rams (2-5) if the team's infirm list
doesn't improve.
</P>
<P>
   Starting DTs Travis Hall and Shane Dronett, and MLB Jessie
Tuggle did not practice Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hall missed Sunday's Jets game with a bruised knee. Dronett tore
the plantar fascia muscle completely free from the bone in his his
foot against New York, where Tuggle suffered a high ankle sprain.
</P>
<P>
   All are questionable, although Tuggle appears least critical.
</P>
<P>
   Hall is having problems pushing off. Dronett's injury, which is
similar to the one that has sidelined Georgia Tech flanker Jon
Muyres for the entire season, is causing great soreness, but, he
said, not much loss of function.
</P>
<P>
   Starting left DE Lester Archambeau (strained thumb), who leads
the team with 4.5 sacks and is third with 46 tackles (behind LB
Cornelius Bennett's 59 and Tuggle's 50), could start for Hall,
making John Burrough the starter at LDE.
</P>
<P>
   Esera Tuaolo would start for Dronett on a defense that already
will have second-year CB Michael Booker starting for injured Ronnie
Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, Henri Crockett, who was starting strongside LB
before dislocating his left wrist Sept. 13 against the Eagles,
returned to practice. He was Tuggle's backup before, and worked at
MLB Wednesday. If Tuggle can't play, though, Ruffin Hamilton would
probably start.
</P>
<P>
   Help wanted
</P>
<P>
   Looking for depth, and perhaps a right gunner for the punting
team, the Falcons Monday put in a claim on CB Rod Smith, who was
waived by Carolina. Green Bay also put in a claim. Since both the
Packers and Falcons are 5-2, there was a coin toss. Atlanta lost.
On Tuesday, Atlanta put in a waiver claim on CB Juran Bolden,
waived earlier this year by the Falcons and waived Monday by the
Packers. He was claimed, however, by Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Good news on Chandler
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Chandler looked and felt great Wednesday after
his first full practice since straining his non-throwing shoulder
and bruising ribs Oct. 18 against the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot stronger,'' he said, ``and it's improved a lot
after 10 days of rest and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll be ready to go (Sunday).''
</P>
<P>
   Musical chairs
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves said WRs Todd Kinchen and Jammi German will
replace Tim Dwight (sprained knee) in the ``H'' position, but the
team will not put in any special plays for them, like it did for
Dwight.
</P>
<P>
   Kinchen played the first two games, but then was inactive for
three of four before catching three passes against the Jets. He
insists a rift between him and Reeves, which began in the season
opener when the coach got on the seven-year veteran after he
attempted a lateral, is patched up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very demanding coach, and I would be, too,'' Kinchen
said. ``I made some mental errors at the beginning of the year when
I wasn't focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinchen will replace Dwight as punt returner.
</P>
<P>
   On kickoff returns, rookie CB Elijah Williams will become the
primary return man, and will be joined either by German or rookie
RB Ken Oxendine.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery continues regarding RB Harold Green, who has been
inactive five straight games.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he usually joined RB Byron Hanspard (who's out for
the season with a knee injury) deep on kickoffs. He also was the
team's premier third-down back and third-leading receiver, with 29
catches for 360 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves has said Green has been de-activated because he doesn't
play special teams and Oxendine does. Oxendine dressed but did not
play the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why Green isn't practicing with special teams, even
as a backup, special teams coach Joe DeCamillis said it was because
Green isn't going to be active.
</P>
<P>
   Green said he's willing to play special teams and doesn't know
of anything he's done wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not a situation where they think I won't play
special teams,'' he said. ``I pride myself on doing my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis third-down back Amp Lee, who broke a hand Sunday,
won't play, and TE Ernie Conwell (torn knee ligaments) is out for
the season. Rookie TE Roland Williams (two catches, 13 yards) will
start. Also missing Rams practice Wednesday: WR Isaac Bruce
(strained hamstring), LT Orlando Pace (bruised shoulder), G Mike
Gruttadauria (back spasms), G Zach Wiegert (hyperextended knee) and
G Ryan Tucker (neck). ... The Falcons Wednesday worked out DT Ed
Jasper (6-foot-2, 295), a second-year player released last week by
the Eagles. ... Ticket sales for Sunday's game are dismal, as there
have been just about 37,000 sold. That's become a trend. Atlanta
sold fewer tickets for the Rams game in each of the last two years
than any other: Just 36,583 last year, and 26,519 in '96. The
Dolphins had sold out every home game for more than two years until
the Rams played there two weeks ago.

ARIZONA: WITH $4 MILLION, WHY GO FOR MORE?  
 UTAH: LIBERTARIANS TAKING A CRACK AT MORMONS 
IOWA: SENATOR DUMPED FOR MRS. CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
   (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also sent in category `p')

<TEXT>
<P>
   The other night when Sen. John McCain of Arizona debated the
four challengers who are trying to unseat him on Nov. 3, only 40
people showed up to listen, which was as good a measure as any of
the excitement this race has stirred.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a conservative Republican in a state that loves
conservative Republicans, appears to be a shoo-in for a third term,
with the latest poll showing he will probably pull more than 60
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Even one of his challengers, John Zajac, a Libertarian, conceded
during the debate that ``the senator will be easily re-elected.''
</P>
<P>
   So why is McCain, who has raised $4 million for his re-election
effort, a lot of money for a race like this, still out raising even
more money? Why did he send out a fund-raising letter the other day
saying that ``in the next seven days'' he had to come up with
another $80,000 or so?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be prepared,'' he explained in Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that earlier this year, when he led the congressional
crusade to increase the tax on cigarettes _ a crusade that enhanced
his already high national profile and increased speculation about
possible presidential ambitions _ the tobacco industry mounted a
$40 million counterattack against him and his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But while the senator may fear a new attack, with less than a
week to go until Election Day, there is no real evidence that the
industry plans one. So the likelihood is that he will not be forced
to make a last-minute defense and will end up with a campaign
surplus of some $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   How will he spend it?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to roll all that money into a presidential fund the
day after the election,'' Ed Ranger, his Democratic challenger,
predicted in Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   He can do that. Others have.
</P>
<P>
   But the senator insists he is looking only toward Nov. 3, not
the year 2000. His only concern, he says, is ``personal attacks of
the most vicious nature, as orchestrated by the tobacco industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Libertarians Taking a Crack at Mormons
</P>
<P>
   As in most other states, the Libertarian Party of Utah finds
itself almost perpetually short of members and in an uphill fight.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, two of every three people in Utah are Mormons,
members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and
Mormons tend to vote Republican. In fact, so many Mormons vote
Republican that a few months back church leaders, concerned that
the church was increasingly being viewed as a political monolith,
urged members to be diverse in their political thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Which gave Libertarian leaders an idea.
</P>
<P>
   They are going hard after the Mormon vote, arguing in Mormon
phrases and words that their party is the party of ``correct
principles'' and ``free agency'' and thus the logical ``righteous''
choice for faithful Mormons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our principles and LDS principles are the same,'' says Jim
Dexter, the Libertarian chairman.
</P>
<P>
   To spread the Libertarian recruiting message as widely as
possible, the party recently ran half-page advertisements in the
Sunday editions of the state's newspapers, under the headline,
``It's OK to be a Mormon and a Libertarian.'' Played prominently
was a reference to the recent plea by Mormon leaders for political
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders have not made public comments on the Libertarian
recruitment effort except to say that the church is generally
``politically neutral'' and does not endorse candidates or parties.
But Republican and Democratic leaders, especially the former, have
criticized the effort as a blatant, offensive and unacceptable
mixing of religion and politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religion is a personal matter with people,'' said Spencer
Stokes, the executive director of the Utah Republican Party. ``It
will backfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Dumped for Mrs. Clinton
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, a possible Democratic
presidential aspirant in 2000, asked to speak to a big AFL-CIO
rally in neighboring Iowa, home of the first presidential caucuses.
Labor leaders said no: He was out of tune on changing Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Now the senator has had the door slammed on him again.
</P>
<P>
   He was scheduled to speak this weekend at a major
get-out-the-vote rally in Des Moines. But instead, he has been
told, Hillary Rodham Clinton will be in the state that day and,
well, she'll be the headliner.
</P>
<P>
   ``A matter of practicality,'' said Iowa Democratic Chairman John
Norris.
</P>
<P>
   Was it also a matter of the Clinton candidate for 2000 being
Vice President Al Gore, not Kerrey?
</P>
<P>
   Norris wasn't saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the first lady is terrific,'' Kerrey said, gamely.

BUSINESSMAN RESCINDS HIS OFFER OF $1 MILLION TO END JONES SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., N.Y.)  (bl) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Abe Hirschfeld, the New York City parking garage
magnate who tried to ride to the rescue in ending Paula Corbin
Jones' lawsuit against President Clinton, said Wednesday that he
was withdrawing his offer to pay Mrs. Jones $1 million to settle
the case.
</P>
<P>
   He said his efforts were over, finished, off the table and not
to be renewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing became a shenanigan,'' said Hirschfeld, who
described himself as thoroughly fed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the country shouldn't be playing around with such a
thing, this lawsuit,'' he said in an interview Wednesday. ``But I
withdraw my offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld blamed feuding among Mrs. Jones' lawyers about how to
apportion the money for his decision to rescind the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Mrs. Jones and Clinton were close earlier this month
to settling her sexual misconduct lawsuit against him. She had
demanded $1 million from Clinton, and the White House had gone up
to $700,000 from its initial offer of $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   But with Hirschfeld's offer, Mrs. Jones saw a way earlier this
month to put together a large package. She increased her demand,
asking for $1 million from Clinton in addition to the Hirschfeld
contribution for a total of $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The White House quickly rejected the proposal. Privately, White
House advisers described Mrs. Jones as unrealistic and said they
could not be part of any deal in which a third party like
Hirschfeld paid Mrs. Jones to withdraw her suit because that would
raise issues of whether the money was a gift to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the breakdown in negotiations, both sides went
ahead with arguments Oct. 20 in St. Paul, Minn., before a panel of
appeals court judges over whether the lawsuit should be reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   A federal trial judge dismissed Mrs. Jones' lawsuit in April,
saying her account of being propositioned by Clinton in a Little
Rock, Ark., hotel room in 1991 did not amount to a legal case of
sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones' lawyers told the appeals panel that the complaint
should be allowed to go to a jury for many reasons, not least of
which was their claim that Clinton had lied under oath to them when
he said he had not had sexual relations with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   After the arguments, lawyers for both sides said they would
still try to work out a settlement, although John Whitehead, one of
Mrs. Jones' lawyers, said Wednesday that talks had not resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead said it was difficult to evaluate what effect
Hirschfeld's withdrawal would have on the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may complicate things or it may well streamline them,''
he said, by emphasizing to Mrs. Jones that she must focus solely on
whatever terms are offered by the White House.

EDITORIAL: ELIOT SPITZER FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Oct. 29:
</P>
<P>
   The race for New York state attorney general this year involves
two flawed candidates, and the temptation is to skip an endorsement
for either the incumbent Republican, Dennis Vacco, or his
Democratic opponent, Eliot Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer has misled the public about how his father's wealth was
used to support $8.9 million in loans that financed his campaigns
in 1994 and 1998. His conduct may not be illegal, but it was
clearly designed to circumvent laws that would have limited his
father's direct contributions to the campaign. In normal
circumstances, Spitzer's evasions would have made it impossible to
endorse him for the state's top legal position.
</P>
<P>
   But the voters must choose, and so must we. We endorse Spitzer
because Vacco's performance and his key policy positions make him
an even worse choice.
</P>
<P>
   In only four years Vacco has turned an important office with a
distinguished public-service tradition into a patronage mill known
for taking suspect contributions and for his mixed record on such
key issues as women's right to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   From the start Vacco sent a message of intolerance by rescinding
a longstanding executive order banning discrimination against gay
and lesbian workers in his office. As his chief lieutenant he
installed someone who had repeatedly failed the bar examination and
then purged scores of experienced attorneys to make way for
politically connected new hires.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, for all his dishonesty on campaign funding, does offer
the prospect of an attorney general who will not be hobbled by
ideology. That has been a problem in Vacco's career.
</P>
<P>
   As a U.S. attorney in Buffalo, Vacco, who is personally opposed
to abortion, resisted enforcing a court order against abortion
protesters blocking a clinic entrance. This led a federal judge to
remove him from the case. As attorney general, Vacco did pursue a
case brought by his predecessor and won a Supreme Court ruling
upholding a new Federal law protecting clinic access. But he can
hardly be relied upon to defend abortion rights in the future,
having dismantled the team of senior attorneys who worked on the
issue under his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he has not been vigorous about pursuing litigation to
protect the environment or civil rights. His late entry into the
states' lawsuit against the tobacco industry cannot erase his
embarrassing comment two years earlier likening such an action to
suing the dairy industry to get money to treat people with high
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Spitzer has promised a politically moderate
approach that puts the public interest ahead of rigid philosophy
and special-interest contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco's acceptance of suspiciously timed contributions from
people and companies his office is investigating, and his bad habit
of raising money from those working in his office, shows a broad
disdain for ethics. He has not been a force for reforming the New
York campaign finance laws that encourage the rewarding of
regulatory breaks to political contributors.
</P>
<P>
   None of that, however, can excuse Spitzer's deception about his
father's role in an ostensibly self-financed campaign. Our
endorsement goes to him with the expectation that he will return
the attorney general's office to a tradition of professionalism and
bipartisanship and that he will be driven to make amends for his
campaign trickery by leading the fight for new campaign finance
legislation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Oct. 29:
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to recapture, so long after the event, what a
galvanizing effect John Glenn's first ride into orbit had on an
apprehensive nation. In the years before that triumph, Americans
had been plunged into self-doubt by the Soviet Union's success in
orbiting an unmanned Sputnik satellite and then two Russian
cosmonauts while a succession of American rockets exploded on the
pad. Then, on Feb. 20, 1962, the freckle-faced, square-jawed Marine
flier got America back in the space race with the nation's first
manned orbital flight. A delirious public honored him with a
tumultuous ticker-tape parade and canonized him as a genuine
American hero whose exploits owed much to his unswerving
patriotism, his enduring marriage, his deep roots in
Presbyterianism and small-town America.
</P>
<P>
   Now Glenn, retiring from the Senate at the age of 77, is poised
to mount again into the heavens, this time as a lowly payload
specialist on Wednesday's scheduled flight of the space shuttle
Discovery. Instead of piloting the spaceship, he will serve as a
guinea pig for medical tests to determine the effects of
weightlessness on an aging body. But neither his duties nor his low
crew ranking will have much to do with how anyone views a flight
that long ago became known as The John Glenn Flight, a testament
more to past eminence than present value.
</P>
<P>
   There is something a little sad _ even desperate _ about all the
hoopla surrounding this otherwise unremarkable flight. It is as if
a nation that no longer has Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa to cheer on
seems determined to wallow in nostalgia while Glenn and NASA try to
rekindle past glories. But this is a flight that will not probe
much further into the unknown than Glenn did the first time around
36 years ago. The spacecraft he will ride in is bigger and a lot
more complex technologically. But it will still be flying in low
Earth orbit, the cheaper arena to which the space agency repaired
after the successful moon landings vanquished the Soviet space
program once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Most conspicuously missing this time around will be that
galvanizing sense of mission. NASA's truly riveting explorations
these days are its unmanned probes of other planets. But its
troubled manned space program is now remembered less for the image
of American astronauts planting a flag on the moon than for a
teacher and her fellow crew members perishing in the Challenger
explosion. The centerpiece of today's manned program, the
international space station, is behind schedule and over budget,
its progress threatened by Russia's economic troubles. Meanwhile,
the space shuttles have flown intermittently, raising concerns that
safety margins are eroding.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the space agency, and presumably the White House as
well, were willing to let Glenn cap his career with one last
victory lap. To be sure, officials have clapped a veneer of
scientific justification on his participation, but that veneer is
looking even thinner now that he has failed to qualify for what was
billed as one of the more important tests to be performed on him.
</P>
<P>
   The greater meaning of this flight has nothing to do with
research or even with space. Rather it is the dramatic symbolism of
a robust, healthy senior citizen shaping his own destiny. This old
space warrior refused to exit quietly. Instead he kept nagging and
nagging until he bent the space bureaucracy, and his own family, to
acquiesce in his dream for one more flight. Few senior citizens can
exert the political clout of a John Glenn to achieve their goals,
but the relaunching of this space-age icon is being taken _ indeed,
seized upon _ as a symbol of what a growing cohort of energetic
seniors can achieve if their aspirations and capabilities are
honored. The irony of this much-ballyhooed flight is that it may do
more to combat ageism on the ground than to register new triumphs
in space.

EDITORIAL: PINOCHET'S ESCAPE ROUTE  (bl)  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Oct. 29:
</P>
<P>
   England's High Court on Wednesday quashed the arrest order of
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, ruling that as a former head of state he is
immune from prosecution or arrest in Britain. The decision is a
mistake. If the evidence holds up, Pinochet should be turned over
to the Spanish judge who issued a warrant for his arrest on charges
of genocide, terrorism and torture. His military coup in Chile in
1973 led to the killings of at least 2,000 people. Though Pinochet
may soon be free to return home, the court decision does not have
standing outside Britain. It does not save him, or other accused
international criminals, from arrest or prosecution in other
nations.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a chance that Britain will hold Pinochet for
possible extradition to Spain, although a slim one. He remains in
custody because prosecutors can appeal to the Law Lords, a panel of
the House of Lords. The British court also said that Pinochet could
be tried by an international tribunal. But British law, it
concluded, grants immunity in Britain to heads of state who
committed crimes ``in the course of exercising public functions.''
</P>
<P>
   It is repugnant to consider torture, murder and forced
disappearance as public functions. But the real problem with the
decision was that international law _ the basis of Spain's
extradition request _ was apparently not even considered by the
court. The Nuremberg principles, the foundation of modern
international law, specifically say that heads of state can be
prosecuted for international crimes. Those are certain crimes
considered so heinous that any nation can prosecute them, including
widespread murder and torture. Indeed, leaders bear the most
responsibility for such systematic crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has signed and ratified international conventions
against torture and genocide. These allow prosecution of genocide
and widespread torture _ including by leaders _ no matter where in
the world they are committed.
</P>
<P>
   What may have been at work in this case is diplomatic politesse,
with a British panel of judges unwilling to violate a political
amnesty deal that supposedly reflects the will of Chileans. If so,
this was misguided. A poll taken just before the arrest shows that
the majority of Chileans still want prosecutions for the crimes
committed by Pinochet's forces. The democratic government honors
the amnesty he granted himself in part because it is afraid of the
response from his followers.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's continued power in Chile can protect him politically.
But in the case of especially horrendous crimes, an amnesty imposed
by a dictator should not get the world's legal approval.

NEW ORLEANS GETS SUPER BOWL IN 2002 
</HEADLINE>

 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Super Bowl XXXVI on Jan. 27, 2002, will be
played in the Superdome in New Orleans. The National Football
League owners chose that city Wednesday over the other finalist,
San Diego, but said that San Diego would be favored to be the host
in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the next five Super Bowls will be played in Miami (1999),
Atlanta (2000), Tampa Bay (2001), New Orleans (2002) and San
Francisco (2003).
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great presentation and so did San Diego but New
Orleans is a city that sells itself,'' said Saints owner Tom
Benson. ``We'll have 17,000 downtown hotel rooms and nearly
everything will be in walking distance to the game. It was New
Orleans' time. It was New Orleans' turn.''
</P>
<P>
   In other news here at the NFL owners annual fall meeting,
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said that the committee studying
expansion will be expanded. The new group will be led by New
England Patriots' owner Robert Kraft and Carolina Panthers owner
Jerry Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Three groups _ one from Houston and two from Los Angeles _ are
vying for the NFL's next expansion team. Cleveland next season
becomes the league's 31st franchise and the league would like to
add a 32nd franchise to begin play in 2002. Those three group want
that spot and the new committee will study their financing and
stadium options and will set a franchise fee. The Cleveland
franchise, the latest purchased, cost $473 million. Tagliabue said
the new franchise would cost at least that and likely more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Los Angeles and Houston are very important to the league
not just as the two cities but because of the regions,'' said
Tagliabue. ``In each case, we do not have a football team in
regions of the country where there is a strong interest in the
game.''

A NEW YORK COMEBACK AFTER A SCARY DETOUR
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After she finished 10th in the 1996 Olympic marathon, Anne Marie
Lauck and her husband, Jim, took a Christmas season vacation to
Hawaii. It was a chance to relax and celebrate, to pop the cork on
a successful season. But, in one horrific moment, her career nearly
ended just as it had reached its peak.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had hiked four miles along a rugged jungle trail on
the island of Kauai, arriving at a spectacular 400-foot waterfall,
when a rock slide rained down.
</P>
<P>
   One rock struck Lauck on the left shoulder, causing a compound
fracture where the clavicle meets the scapula. Her husband
fashioned a sling out of his shirt, ran two miles to the nearest
phone and called for a rescue helicopter that transported Lauck to
a local hospital for surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real mess,'' she said. ``But we were fortunate. We
could have easily been killed.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury led to biomechanical problems that compromised
Lauck's season in 1997. This year, she completed a six-month course
in massage therapy and contemplated retirement. But her health has
returned, and for the first time since Atlanta, she will run a
26.2-mile race when she competes Sunday in the New York City
Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   It has become fashionable for many top American runners to enter
the Chicago Marathon, with its flat course and inviting appearance
fees. But Lauck, 29, grew up near New York, in Glen Gardner, N.J.,
and she is drawn here because the victorious images of Alberto
Salazar and Grete Waitz are preserved in her mind as if in amber.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably my first remembrance of any event,'' Lauck said.
``People think New York is a pressure pot. It has the opposite
effect on me. I feel comfortable here. I grew up with the event.
It's part of my makeup. I want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be Lauck's third entry in New York. She started too
quickly in 1993, overheated and dropped out at 23 miles. A year
later, she finished third to Tegla Loroupe, who has since set the
world record at 2 hours 20 minutes 47 seconds and will be seeking
her third New York victory on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The key, as Lauck sees it, will be patience. Her personal best
of 2:30:19 is nearly 10 minutes slower than Loroupe's, but she must
avoid depleting herself in the first half of the race and risk
exhaustion on the hills of Central Park. There is no need to go
through 13.1 miles in 1:10 or 1:12, she said, when 1:13, 1:14 or
1:15 is more practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I run to my capability through the first half and not run
crazy, I'll be in the thick of it,'' Lauck said.
</P>
<P>
   She feels ambivalent about the Olympic marathon _ proud that she
finished in the top 10, disappointed that she didn't finish higher
after living and training in Atlanta to acclimate herself to the
heat and humidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, that day my body didn't perform the way it had
been trained to do,'' Lauck said.
</P>
<P>
   After her scary accident in Hawaii, it began to appear as if the
Olympic marathon might be Lauck's last. Obsessive about training,
Lauck began walking for two or three hours a day a week later on a
treadmill. But she could not walk smoothly with one arm bound to
her side by a sling, and her form was thrown out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the imbalance led to a strain of her upper left
hamstring that was annoyingly slow to heal. She struggled to
recover from hard workouts. A difference of opinion over training
led to a split with her coach, Salazar, and she advanced into
massage therapy training. But as she eventually realized, ``I
didn't want to do this; I wanted to run.''
</P>
<P>
   By May, her body started coming around as she did cautious track
work near her home in Hampton, N.J. In late September, she finished
an encouraging third in 1:11:23 in the Philadelphia Distance Run, a
half-marathon.
</P>
<P>
   The precipitous drop in marathon times for men and women this
year is ``mind-boggling,'' Lauck said. The suspicion of widespread
drug use has cast a dark cloud over the sport, and Lauck called it
``sad that any time there's a fast time, people think something is
not legitimate. But what if it is?''
</P>
<P>
   All she can do is run her best ``with a clean slate,'' Lauck
said. And she hopes that will be sufficient to drop her personal
record to 2:27 or 2:28.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time I should be under 2:30,'' she said. ``It's
getting nagging to say it's my p.r.''

METS SEAL THE LEITER DEAL AND LOOK TO FREE AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As expected, the Mets announced Wednesday that they
had officially come to terms with their ace left-hander, Al Leiter,
on a four-year, $32 million contract. The deal, with an
accompanying news conference with Leiter, came two days after the
Mets announced a seven-year, $91 million agreement with All-Star
catcher Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Mets were able to keep their best pitcher, and best
everyday player, from going elsewhere. And having done that,
General Manager Steve Phillips will now turn his attention to the
free agents who might look good in a Mets uniform in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips will be armed with what one lawyer affiliated with
baseball said would be a $65 million budget next season, a
significant increase over the $57 million payroll the Mets had in
1998, which turned out to be the sixth-highest figure in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   If the $65 million figure is accurate _ and the lawyer said the
Mets' co-owners Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday had signed off on
it _ it would appear that Phillips will have the ability to go
after at least one major free agent in an effort to get the Mets
into the post-season. And the priority will be offense, Phillips
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take a baseball genius to see that we scratched and
clawed to score runs last season,'' the 33-year-old Leiter, who
went 17-6 with a 2.47 ERA, said at Shea Stadium. ``Clearly, we need
some more thump. Last year, we didn't have enough of what I call
that fear factor in our lineup. But we're not that far away.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips has indicated that the areas he is looking at are left
and right field and either second or third base, with Edgardo
Alfonzo either staying at third or moving over to second depending
on what the Mets do. The Mets could address their outfield and
infield needs in one fell swoop if they are able to swing a rumored
deal with the Dodgers for a former Met, outfielder Bobby Bonilla,
and second baseman Eric Young, who would also become the leadoff
hitter the Mets lack.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips has also spoken to the agents who represent such
intriguing free agents as Brian Jordan, Albert Belle and Ellis
Burks. Phillips is not allowed to actually make a money offer for
any free agent until Nov. 6. But it is likely that the Mets will
make a strong run at the 31-year-old Jordan, who hit .316 with 25
homers and 91 RBIs for the Cardinals last season. Another free
agent who reportedly interests the Mets is 31-year-old Robin
Ventura, who hit .263 for the Chicago White Sox last season with 21
homers and 91 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said Wednesday that he thinks he will be able to fill
his team's needs ``partly by trades, partly by the free-agent
route.'' With a dozen players currently under contract, the Met
payroll is already just short of $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Todd Hundley, who will earn $5.3 million next season, will
almost certainly be traded. The Mets are also believed to be
shopping their opening-day starter last season, Bobby Jones, which
would give Phillips added flexibility to work with. Jones will earn
$4.8 million next season. And the Mets might also be willing to
part with outfielder Butch Huskey, who is eligible for arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   What the Mets are doing now, Doubleday said, is much different
than their failed strategy of shopping for big-name free agents
(like Bonilla) in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a plan then,'' Doubleday said. ``We have a plan
now. And Steve knows exactly where we're trying to get to.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the Mets do, they have already assured themselves
that Leiter will be one of the anchors on a staff that was one of
the better ones in baseball last season.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Originally, the Mets offered Leiter a two-year deal with an
option year for a third at under $6 million a season. Leiter said
Wednesday that had the Mets not increased their offer to four years
at about what he settled for (an average of $8 million a season),
he would have tested the free-agent waters.
</P>
<P>
   But entertaining other offers was something that Leiter, who
grew up in Berkeley Township in New Jersey, said he really did not
want to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think Steve did a really nice job,'' Leiter said of
the negotiations. ``Everything was so easy. As I saw the way the
year was going last season, I decided that this is a good place to
play. This was so fitting. I came up with the Yankees. Four years
out of high school, I started my first game at Yankee Stadium.
After all the ups and downs that I have been through, to finish up
my career not only in the same city but with the team I rooted for
growing up, it's almost perfect.''

DOES CARSON HAVE THE RIGHT STUFF?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Out of nowhere, Carson, Calif., that little community forever
immersed in the shadow of Long Beach, that obscure hamlet whose
high school once produced mighty football teams, suddenly finds
itself a major player in Los Angeles' attempt to secure an NFL
expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, as Hollywood super agent Michael Ovitz was in Kansas
City unveiling his Carson stadium plan to the NFL owners, I did
something I sheepishly must admit I've never done during my lengthy
encampment in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   I ventured to Carson.
</P>
<P>
   While it doesn't exactly have the magnetic ambiance of the
French Riviera, I have to admit I've never been to a place that had
as many hair salons per square block, nor have I ever been to a
place that had a cleaner trailer park.
</P>
<P>
   With the old Olympic Auditorium fight publicist Van Barbieri
serving as my guide, I drove around the landfill acreage where
Ovitz wants to build his stadium and walked around the strip malls
on Carson St.
</P>
<P>
   I spoke to attorneys, real estate brokers, locksmiths,
restaurateurs, waitresses, legal aides, short order cooks and,
natch, hairdressers and various other types in an attempt to get a
reading on the mood of those who actually work in Carson.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of hours of scouring the gritty area, I
discovered that an overwhelming preponderance of the populace hopes
Michael Ovitz's dream stadium comes to fruition, with only a few
vocal dissenters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's going to happen,'' says Theron Jackson, a
long-time broker for Realty World and a 1972 Long Beach State
graduate. ``Why not? This is the perfect location. It'll be right
next to the San Diego and Harbor Freeways, and the Long Beach and
91 freeways aren't that far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Coliseum has a chance with the NFL. There
are just too many deterrents in the areas surrounding the Coliseum.
I used to live at 41st Drive and Figueroa, and I'd never live there
now. It's just too dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carson to me is the perfect place, halfway between L.A. and
Orange County. I think it would be a huge boost to the area. And
I'm sure a new stadium would increase the real estate values in
Carson.''
</P>
<P>
   But the proprietor of an Italian diner, Domenick Sardisco, is
keeping his fingers solemnly crossed that Carson doesn't go ahead
with its stadium plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be disastrous for this city from a financial
standpoint,'' says Sardisco, whose Domenick's has been a 42-year
fixture in Carson. ``I think this thing is a total joke. Where's
the money going to come from?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're talking about floating a $150 million bond. You can
bet that means they're going to raise our property taxes. Why
should I pay for something that won't help me. The whole idea is
ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about freeway access? There'll be traffic jams here that
will disrupt the entire area. And they talk about putting in a new
mall. We already have a mall, a good mall. And it's struggling. Why
do we need another mall? I can't believe our politicians have got
us involved in something like this. It might sound good to some
people. But in reality, it just won't work. We just don't have the
money here in Carson.''
</P>
<P>
   Domenick Sardisco, a man not afraid to give opinions, shakes his
head slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way this is going to happen,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But others have brighter, slightly more positive outlooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a football stadium here would be just great,'' says
Walter Janoff, a UCLA graduate who has practiced law in Carson for
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big sports fan and I hope it goes through,'' says Tito
Lacorda, a law clerk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think there is a fifty fifty chance of this stadium
venture making it,'' says Chi Ferrer, as he sits on a barber chair
getting a trim from Mario Rabaino at Gill's Hair Studio. ``I hope
it does. I live right near where the stadium would be, and it would
be so easy for me to go to the games.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty fifty?
</P>
<P>
   The New Coliseum people will tell you that Michael Ovitz has a
better chance of joining John Glenn in space than he does of
erecting a stadium in Carson.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe so.
</P>
<P>
   But at least people outside the boundaries of Carson are doing
something that has never been done before in this country actually
holding a conversation about Carson.
</P>
<P>
   I figured the one person who could offer penetrating insights on
Ovitz's stadium proposal would be a palm reader on Carson St. near
Delores.
</P>
<P>
   I rang the buzzer on her front door, and told the lady who
answered that I'd like to know her feelings on the Carson stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'm just a helper the palm reader isn't here,'' she said.
``But I'm not sure she can predict the future of a football
stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither can anyone else.

MAURO'S `DOCTOR CHOICE' ISSUE HAS DISAPPEARED FROM RHETORIC AS HE
AND BUSH NEAR END OF CAMPAIGN TRAIL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
and R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ The issue of doctor choice, an early focus
of Garry Mauro's gubernatorial bid, has practically disappeared
from the stump rhetoric as he and Gov. George W. Bush near the end
of the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Mauro, the state's land commissioner, said Wednesday
that he still supports requiring health maintenance organizations
to allow patients to choose their doctors. He said he has focused
on education issues during this week's campaign blitz through West
and South Texas because public school issues are of greater
concerns to voters there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people in this area don't have access to HMOs so
it's kind of silly to talk about choosing your own doctor when you
don't have an HMO,'' Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Bush also has said little about the issue in the
waning days of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   During appearances Wednesday in Waco, College Station and
Nacogdoches, he pushed his plans for welfare reform, urged voter
turnout and acknowledged that he'd like a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope 50 percent plus one, but if you ask me, I would hope to
get maybe 60 percent of the vote,'' Bush said in Nacogdoches.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Mauro has trailed by double digits in polls taken throughout
the campaign, and hoped to hit a nerve with voters last April when
he launched a $1 million television advertising campaign,
criticizing Bush for vetoing the 1995 Patient Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the legislation would have raised health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   It would have required health maintenance organizations to allow
patients to choose their own doctors and to pay for care at
specialty institutions such as Houston's M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro's expensive ad campaign was viewed as a good strategic
gamble, since 84 percent of respondents in a February Houston
Chronicle-Dallas Morning News poll agreed that HMOs should not be
allowed to restrict a patient's choice of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   HMO plans are not required to offer the choice, although some
do. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``I ran the TV ad early to send the message that I was in the
race seriously, that I wasn't going away,'' Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   In the ads, Mauro said, ``To choose your own doctor, you need to
choose a new governor.'' Mauro advocates a constitutional amendment
guaranteeing doctor choice.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has argued that patients can choose their doctors within
their own insurance plans, and he said most insured Texans have the
option of paying more for a full-service insurance plan that will
pay for them to see a doctor of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has noted that Texas law guarantees every citizen
treatment at cancer centers such as M.D. Anderson, and he said most
health insurance plans will pay for that treatment if it is deemed
medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In campaign stops this week, Mauro has only briefly mentioned
doctor choice, and usually only when the issue has been raised by
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said he has not changed his position on doctor choice and
that he is still running a television spot on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But as he campaigned Wednesday in Laredo, San Antonio, Corpus
Christi, McAllen, Edinburg and Brownsville, his speeches focused
almost entirely on his plan to give teachers a $6,000 pay raise and
borrow $2 billion from the Permanent School Fund to reduce class
sizes.
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized Bush's plan to end ``social promotions'' by
requiring students in certain grades to pass the Texas Assessment
of Academic Skills standardized test before advancing to the next
grade.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro says promotions should be based on evaluations by
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the three issues that are going to win the election
for me are teacher pay raise, TAAS and HMOs and I'm choosing to
talk about TAAS and teacher pay raise right now,'' Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a judgment call. It's a political decision. I just happen
to think teacher pay raise and TAAS is a better issue right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, seemed to be sensing a big victory as he
suggested the possibility of claiming 60 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In Nacogdoches, Bush told about 500 cheering students at Stephen
F. Austin State University that voting is their duty: ``In a free
society, a society that relies upon people, it's important to
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush promoted his welfare reform plans while touring Mission
Waco, a faith-based ministry that uses state funds for job
training. The mission's operations are set up in what used to be an
adult movie house and bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place has gone from a porno theater to a house of love,''
Bush declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government can hand out money,'' Bush said. ``What it can't do
is put hope in our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's welfare plan includes homes for teen-age welfare mothers,
allowing faith-based mentoring of welfare recipients and $100
million in funding for child care for the working poor and for
welfare recipients in job training.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush also wants to cut off welfare for people who do not
cooperate in child support enforcement and permanently cut off
people who cheat on welfare. &QL;

 &HT;    East Lake course offering test equal to a PGA major
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Considering how tough the neighborhood used to be,
maybe it's fitting that the best players in the world are expecting
a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of practice rounds at East Lake Golf Club for the
start of today's $4million Tour Championship, members of the top 30
are beginning to wonder if there's an exorbitant price to be paid
for such huge financial rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Playing hard and fast from unseasonably sun-baked fall
conditions, East Lake has become difficult enough to be disguised
as a major championship. Typical of such events, par is about to
become an acceptable score. From what the players are saying, if
you hid the $720,000 winner's check in this clumpy, nasty Bermuda
rough, somebody probably would find it by Thanksgiving. If the
greens get any faster and firmer, those sadistic guys from the USGA
are liable to become jealous.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the pressure and everything, it's set up like a U.S.
Open,'' Masters and British Open winner Mark O'Meara said. ``The
rough is that deep. If you're an inch off the fairway, you're going
to take out your wedge, your 9-iron. ... I think 6-under by the end
of the week is going to be a good score. If you gave me 6-under,
I'd sit in the clubhouse after 72 holes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a choice, I wouldn't be playing these roughs,'' PGA
champion Vijay Singh said. ``It's unbelievable. It's probably the
hardest roughs I've ever played. ... Even if you're 100 yards away,
it's almost impossible to move it sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   If some cooler weather approaches by the weekend and the wind
picks up, said Tiger Woods, the 1997 Masters champion, ``I'd say
anything under par is looking pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they really want to tuck the pins and get the greens really
hard and fast, even par would be a good score,'' No. 2 money winner
Jim Furyk said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tour Championship starts today, with tee times beginning at
11 a.m., five years after Tom Cousins began his $25 million project
to refurbish East Lake as the center of a entire neighborhood
redevelopment exceeding $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   People such as David Duval, who went to school at Georgia Tech,
1989-92, barely recognize the property that once was considered
among the most crime-ravaged in Atlanta. Where muggers once
harrassed club members and a classic Donald Ross course went into
serious disrepair, new cars from Mercedes, a co-sponsor, with the
Southern Co., are parked safely near tee boxes. This week's
security, according to PGA Tour officials, is no tighter than at
any other Tour Championship venue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot different now than it was then,'' Duval said. ``It
doesn't look like the same place coming in. Six, seven years ago it
wasn't the best area to be driving into.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Tour Championship marking a return to the spot that
hosted the 1963 Ryder Cup Matches, many of the PGA Tour's
season-ending awards are to be decided by Sunday, when the winner
through 72 holes will have earned $10,000 per hole.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a highly unlikely scenario, Duval has the money title
all but wrapped up. With $2,470,498, Duval needs to finish 24th to
guarantee the distinction and could be thwarted then only if Furyk,
second with $1,820,334, wins.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, only the second player since 1982 to win two majors in
a season, could see the voting for PGA Tour player of the year
tighten considerably if Duval were to win Sunday and pass $3
million. Duval said he considers the money title ``more significant
than the stardom, personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods leads Duval 69.10 to 69.14 in the race for the
Vardon Trophy, for the lowest scoring average.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the season-ending event, and there's a lot at stake,''
O'Meara said. ``The money title is at stake. The stroke average is
at stake. The player of the year is at stake, a little bit. ... I
think (the Tour Championship) is a great idea. It's kind of like
our World Series, you might say.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the last year the Tour Championship will mark the end of
the official money season. In 1999, the World Golf Championship
American Express Championship will be held the next week in
Valderrama, Spain, and will be counted as official money.

 &HT;    Woods fever slowly breaking
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Is Tigermania over?
</P>
<P>
   The first wave might be ebbing, as the 22-year-old golf
superstar tees up today in the Tour Championship at East Lake Golf
Club.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Tiger Woods failed to win a major golf title, won only
one other time _ at the BellSouth Classic in Duluth in May _ and
this weekend someone else will inherit player-of-the-year honors
from him.
</P>
<P>
   A mellower Tiger showed up Wednesday for an early-morning
practice round, and afterward, about 75 fans stood around the
practice green waiting for his autograph or photos. Twice that many
followed four-time winner David Duval as he teed off on the 10th
hole. Woods looked up from his putting lesson from coach Butch
Harmon and appeared curious that a TV crew was setting up greenside
to film not him but PGA champion Vijay Singh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to win, get a victory under my belt,
considering I haven't won as much as I would like to this year,''
Woods said about this week's event against the tour's 29 other top
players. ``But it's still been a great year, whether I win or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   To those outside the game who love to see him rip mammoth drives
and sink unbelievable putts for a come-from-behind win, Woods'
consistent year might seem boring. But that's what Woods treasures
about this season. In all but four of his 17 PGA events, he
finished in the top 10. It's the biggest change from his erratic
breakout season in which he acknowledges, ``I was either winning
the tournament, or I'd be 20th or 30th. (This year has) just been
one of those years where I've been close, but not quite good
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   A major consolation is that his 69.10 average strokes per round
is the lowest on Tour. If he can hold off Duval (at 69.14), he will
take home the Vardon Trophy, which he sees as a validation of his
growing maturity on the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes to show you haven't shot yourself in the foot with
some 80s, or when conditions are tough, you don't blow up and blow
out of the tournament; you still hang in there,'' Woods said.
``That's what I was able to do this entire year.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's next year to think about. This will be Woods' last
appearance in Georgia before the Masters in the spring. He will
skip his defense of the BellSouth because it didn't fit his
schedule that revolves around the four majors, lucrative
international events and corporate commitments.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how he plays, he still has a gantlet to run every day.
After he finished putting Wednesday, fans chased after him,
thrusting hats, posters and magazines at him. When he reappeared
from the clubhouse and later from the media tent, fans still waited
for him. His life is not that different from when he won the 1997
Masters, and he gets tired of it. ``I still get hassled just as
much,'' he complained.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, his mere entry in a tournament created such a
media frenzy that the tour called a special weekly press conference
just for him. One sign that Tigermania might have peaked appeared
last week, when Woods was finally allowed to skip that obligation.
When asked if he's become just another pro golfer, Woods replied,
``God, I hope so.

 &HT;    East Lake's range lives up to its name
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It throws them off a bit at first.
</P>
<P>
   It kind of takes the lob wedge out of warmup preparations.
</P>
<P>
   It's not every day the PGA Tour's elite players have to clear a
water hazard on the practice range.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, those balls they kept plunking in the pond in front of
East Lake's practice range are free, anyway. East Lake members have
to lose their own balls there during the other 51 weeks of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Furyk said he's seen floating driving ranges in Florida, but
never one with about 110 yards of required clearance to hit dry
land and the first flagstick target.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting,'' he said. ``I can't pull the sand wedge out
for the first club of the day unless I want to lose about 10 balls.
First swing of the day, I'm not getting one over that lake.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara said Wednesday when striking his first ball on the
range, ``What's with the water?'' He finally went to a pitching
wedge to stop the dunking.
</P>
<P>
   Several players turned the strange setup into a competitive
situation. Intentionally hitting low, punch shots into the water,
players such as David Duval, Vijay Singh and Phil Mickelson tried
to skip balls onto the green. Known for his creativity, Mickelson
managed it on his second try.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where's the fairway?
</P>
<P>
   To a man, the players are impressed by East Lake's quality and
the joy of playing a classic, old-style course renovated so
carefully by Rees Jones. Only one area of moderate criticism has
been heard. At the 480-yard fifth hole, which plays as a par-5 for
the members, the fairway is among the most narrow on the course.
``I'm not sure if there is a fairway out there,'' said Furyk. ``I
haven't found it yet. I'm still looking. I walked across the
fairway at one spot and counted 21 yards. ... I guess it's fair
because everyone has to play it. But I would say that hole is
definitely the one I hear the most grumbling about in the locker
room.'' ... Course conditions have been drastically altered by the
warm, dry weather. The zoysia fairways normally are a bit softer
and don't run this swiftly. Packed this tightly, balls are more
prone to find the penalizing bermuda rough. The bermuda is even
tougher because some spots were slightly hit by last week's frost,
creating pockets in the turf. ``Being semi-dormant,'' noted Tiger
Woods, ``every ball goes straight to the bottom. I've hit a couple
wedges just trying to hack the ball out.'' ... Duval said he ``just
flat killed a 2-iron'' on the par-3 18th, which was playing 242
yards to the hole. Joked Duval, ``It's nice to have a driveable
par-4 on every golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   _ O'Meara gets Singh's vote
</P>
<P>
   If you ask Singh, nothing that happens this week should affect
the player of the year voting by the PGA Tour players, which will
be announced Nov. 20. ``Five years from now, nobody's going to know
who won the 1998 money list,'' Singh said, ``but they're all going
to know that O'Meara won two majors.'' ... Commissioner Tim Finchem
made no announcement on future Tour Championship sites Wednesday,
but predicts one in a few weeks. East Lake is expected to get a
return engagement in 2000. Finchem said that when the decision to
play at East Lake was first made, ``somebody said the weather in
Atlanta can be a little iffy at that time of year. If this is iffy,
we can take this all year long.

UCLA COUNCIL CAN BE MORALE BOOSTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Every Friday night, UCLA fullback Craig Walendy
piled the white, wet, chilled french fries on his plate.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't fried but baked, resembling slices of a raw potato.
They were supposed to be a late-night snack, but Walendy never
touched them. He tried salt, he tried ketchup, he tried salt and
ketchup. Yet they remained white, wet and chilled _ and uneaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ate them,'' Walendy said. ``We picked them up and threw
them away, and we didn't get full. I talked to the trainers, and
they said they never ordered them to be baked.''
</P>
<P>
   Walendy had one recourse: the UCLA players' council, a nine-man
elected body that meets regularly with coach Bob Toledo to discuss
everything from team morale and practice times to pregame food and
locker-room towels.
</P>
<P>
   As the running backs' representative, Walendy described the faux
fries. Toledo listened, agreed and decreed that the fries be fried.
It sounds silly, but it meant everything to Walendy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really important to the team to have the players'
council,'' Walendy said. ``When I first got here, there wasn't one,
and there was a lot of complaining. When your opinions are never
voiced to the coach, it leads to players being unhappy and a
general bad feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Walendy was a freshman in 1995, Terry Donahue's last season as
coach. Donahue had team captains during his 20-year tenure but
never a council or advisory board to hear concerns and complaints
from various limbs of the 105-man team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't think of coach Donahue as someone you couldn't
talk to, but we didn't really have a way to make our complaints
known,'' said one player who requested anonymity. ``It's not easy
for younger guys to walk into the head coach's office and start to
tell him what we think.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo replaced Donahue after the 1995 season and redecorated
the program like a new home. He upgraded the
strength-and-conditioning program. He emphasized national
recruiting. He installed a dynamic offense and he recreated the
player council from his head-coaching tenures at UC Riverside
(1974-75) and Pacific (1979-82).
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a player, there was a head coach, but you never
talked to him, you never knew who he was,'' Toledo said. ``You can
separate yourself as a head coach if you're not careful.'
</P>
<P>
   Each position and the freshman class have a representative on
the council, which complements team captains Cade McNown and Larry
Atkins. Toledo meets with the captains regularly, as well, but two
cannot speak for 105. McNown, a senior quarterback, has different
concerns than a freshman offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The council) helps develop a bond between the players and
coaches,'' said safety Jason Stephens, a redshirt freshman. ``No.
1, it's a vehicle to communicate things. And No. 2, it tells us the
coaches care how we feel. We're not just players on a team. We're
part of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   The council is unique among UCLA teams, and only two Pac-10
football programs have similar bodies. Washington State's panel is
selected by position and class; Oregon uses a senior-loaded,
16-member board that includes one player from the other classes.
</P>
<P>
   For all three teams, councils, not captains, are the most
effective method of communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found that being a captain is a tough situation for
kids,'' Ducks coach Mike Bellotti said. ``It puts them in a role
between the coaches and players. The coaches want them to be team
leaders, the players want them to do player advocacy. They get
caught in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins elect their representatives during training camp. The
current members are Walendy, junior Brad Melsby (receivers), senior
Mike Grieb (tight ends), junior Kris Farris (offensive line),
junior Pete Holland (defensive line), junior Ramogi Huma
(linebackers), senior Tod McBride (defensive backs), junior Chris
Sailer (special teams) and Cory Paus, who represents the freshman
class and the quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo meets with the council each week during training camp and
every two weeks during the season, unless there is a pressing
concern. They gather on Spaulding Field after practice, away from
fans, family and media. Sometimes the meetings last two minutes,
sometimes 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we went to him and said, `We're dog tired,' then if he felt
it was right, sure, he'd cut back practice,'' Farris said. ``But
the reason he respects our input is because we're not going to ask
out of practice because we want to watch TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the requests are mundane _ ranging from bigger towels
and a locker-room clock to pregame Snapple and postgame pizzas _
but Farris says that's the beauty of it. A slew of petty
complaints, if left to fester, can clot player-coach relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's risk vs. reward,'' Farris said. ``The cost of giving us
Snapple is nothing compared to the appreciation we have for him
listening to us. It shows us we're in it together.''

TESTIMONY IN LEVIN MURDER TRIAL FOCUSES ON DNA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The trial of the former student accused of killing
Jonathan Levin turned to the intricacies of scientific evidence
Wednesday as a forensic expert testified that DNA evidence linked
the student to the knife used in the attack and showed that his
clothes had been stained with his former teacher's blood.
</P>
<P>
   But defense lawyers for the former student, Corey Arthur, 20,
seized on another piece of the expert's testimony: that some of the
DNA found on the knife could not have come from their client,
another man charged in the attack or the victim. The defense has
contended that other unknown people took part in the attack and
shot Levin.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur and the other man charged, Montoun Hart, are accused of
torturing Levin in his apartment on the Upper West Side of
Manhattan on May 30, 1997, to force him to divulge the access code
to his bank card so they could withdraw money from his account.
Then, prosecutors said, Arthur shot and killed Levin, his former
English teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur is facing first-degree murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, who was 31 when he was killed, was the son of Gerald
Levin, chairman of Time Warner Inc. The younger Levin taught
English at William Howard Taft High School in the Bronx, where he
met Arthur.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Quarino, a forensic scientist at the office of the
chief medical examiner, testified that Arthur's clothes were
stained with his own blood and with blood that contained DNA that
matched Levin's. Only one in 3,600,000 white men have that precise
DNA, he testified.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after putting on latex gloves, Quarino held up the knife
that prosecutors say was used to torture Levin and explained that
Levin's DNA was found in the blood that stained both sides of the
blade.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a mixture of DNA on the handle of the knife, he
said. Some matched Levin's and some matched Arthur's, but other
samples of DNA found on the knife handle could not have come from
either man or from Hart, Quarino testified.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, one of Arthur's former girlfriends, Carlethia Weeks,
testified that he had told her he shot Levin but that ``Monty tied
the guy up and stabbed him.'' The trial of Hart, 26, on
second-degree murder charges is set to begin on Jan 18.
</P>
<P>
   Quarino also testified that unidentified DNA found on a
cigarette butt in Levin's apartment was also mixed with DNA
consistent with Arthur's and Levin's.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, George Goltzer, a defense lawyer, asked
Quarino if it was possible that a fourth person had been in the
apartment and left traces of DNA on the cigarette butt and the
knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible,'' Quarino answered, adding that while the
unidentified DNA found on the cigarette is consistent with the
unidentified DNA found on the knife, it is not rare and could come
from two different people.
</P>
<P>
   Bloodstains found on one of Arthur's black Timberland boots and
on the left sleeve and right elbow of his Yankee jacket contained
DNA consistent with Levin's, Quarino testified.

TWO PATAKIS: IN 4 YEARS, HE HAS PUSHED CONSERVATIVE AND MODERATE
IDEAS
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: NY-PATAKI-PROFILE, NY-PATAKI-PROFILE-BOX) 
 (nk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When asked to assess George Pataki's record as governor, Tom
Carroll, president of the conservative group Change-NY, asked:
``Which one? The Pataki of the first two years or the Pataki of the
second two years?''
</P>
<P>
   On a host of issues, like state spending, education and health
care, there is a sharp difference between the conservative
Republican governor who took office promising to shrink government,
and the moderate Pataki now running for re-election. But on what
his aides say are his core issues, like tax cuts and crime, the
governor has been fairly consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a look at Pataki's record on key issues.
</P>
<P>
   TAXES, SPENDING AND THE ECONOMY
</P>
<P>
   The signal claim of this administration is, as Pataki puts it,
that ``we have led the nation in cutting taxes every single year.''
In this respect, the governor has been a striking success.
</P>
<P>
   He cut the state income tax 25 percent, though his original plan
favored the wealthy much more than the one eventually agreed to by
Democrats in the legislature. He won a 27 percent reduction by 2002
in property taxes charged by local school districts. Again,
Democrats forced changes in his plan, which did not benefit New
York City, securing a 10 percent cut in the city income tax.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the governor signed into law cuts
including those in estate taxes, business taxes and the sales tax
on clothing. All told, he has enacted $12 billion a year in tax
cuts. But despite the cuts and Pataki's reputation as a fiscal
conservative, he has increased state spending at double the rate of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In his first two years, he held spending nearly flat,
eliminating 20,000 state jobs, to close a $5 billion projected
deficit, and to pay for the income tax cuts. But state revenues
soared, thanks to the booming financial markets, and over the
ensuing two years the governor increased spending. The current
$71.4 billion budget is 15 percent larger than the $62 billion one
he inherited.
</P>
<P>
   The state's debts have grown rapidly, continuing a trend that
began in the mid-1980s. Debt repaid out of the budget rose from $28
billion to $35 billion under Pataki, and debts incurred by the
state's public authorities climbed even faster.
</P>
<P>
   Independent monitors have expressed alarm, saying that rising
spending and debt, plus promised tax cuts, are bound to produce a
crisis within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has done a great deal to improve conditions for
business _ including cutting business taxes, granting tax breaks
and cutting unemployment and workers' compensation premiums more
than 30 percent. But it is not clear what effect that has had on
the state's economy.
</P>
<P>
   CRIME
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has been more consistent _ and consistently conservative
_ on crime than on any other major issue.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he signed a law reinstating the death penalty and
creating a sentence of life in prison without parole. He won longer
sentences and strict limits on parole for violent felons, and
construction of a maximum-security prison. The only major change he
sought without success was tougher penalties for juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   The governor ended college-level classes for prison inmates and
curtailed work-release programs. And his administration began
housing inmates two to a cell. Prison reform groups contend such
changes make prisons more dangerous and leave inmates less prepared
for release.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has made treatment available as an alternative to prison
for some drug crimes, though the program is small in scope. But
while he has talked about easing the state's harsh drug-possession
laws, he has not made a proposal.
</P>
<P>
   He claims some of the credit for the steep drop in crime, though
it began before he took office and is concentrated in New York
City, where most experts credit changes in police strategy.
</P>
<P>
   WELFARE
</P>
<P>
   On welfare, Pataki has moved from the political fringe to the
center, without changing his basic views.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, he tried unsuccessfully to force dramatic changes
in the system, and Democrats attacked him as a right-wing
ideologue. But the new federal welfare law enacted many of the
changes he had sought, like time limits and work requirements for
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Pataki retreated from the more draconian
aspects of his plan. Instead of simply abolishing Home Relief, the
welfare program for childless adults, he replaced it with a
less-generous Safety Net program. He also changed the law to allow
recipients to earn some money without losing benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki saw to it that unlike many states, New York does not
apply college or job-training classes toward work requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Since Pataki took office, New York's welfare rolls have shrunk
by 570,000 people. Much of the drop has occurred because local
governments, armed with changes the governor made in state policy,
have become more aggressive about cutting off benefits and denying
new benefits.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   EDUCATION
</P>
<P>
   No area offers a sharper contrast between the two halves of
Pataki's term.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 and 1996, he attempted to cut state aid to schools, but
in the last two years, following the legislature's lead, he agreed
to increases. He also agreed to Democrats' plans to sharply
increase spending on school construction, expand kindergarten and
pre-kindergarten programs, and reduce elementary class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   At the college level, Pataki raised tuition at the State and
City Universities by 30 percent in 1995, and lowered financial aid.
He proposed further tuition increases in 1996 and 1997, which were
beaten back by the legislature. And he sharply cut aid to public
colleges, forcing them to cut teaching staffs.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the governor embarked on a $3 billion, six-year
capital program for public colleges. He also played a major role in
the City University's decision this year to end open admissions.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH CARE
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's term began with pitched battles with health care
advocates, but he has won over many of them as his policies have
evolved.
</P>
<P>
   In his first three years, he proposed sharp reductions in
Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, cuts that
health care advocates said would bankrupt hospitals. He also tried,
without success, to eliminate the state's AIDS research institute.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature refused most of the cuts, but there were
significant reductions in Medicaid. This year, for the first time,
Pataki did not propose serious cuts in health care.
</P>
<P>
   The governor says his proudest achievement in health care was
ending state regulation of hospital prices, which he says will
promote competition and innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Again, opponents in the hospital industry predicted chaos from
his original plan. So Pataki agreed to maintain financing for
medical schools and care for the poor, and to include money for
retraining thousands of laid-off hospital workers.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates who criticize some of the governor's moves praise
others, like the enactment of one of the nation's most
comprehensive ``bill of rights'' for patients of health maintenance
organizations. In 1996, Pataki greatly expanded the state's health
care program for poor children. This year, with more federal money
forthcoming, he initially proposed a bare-bones package of
benefits, but eventually agreed to a program that children's
advocates called the most generous in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ENVIRONMENT
</P>
<P>
   More than any other group of issue advocates, environmentalists
are torn over Pataki's record. Some praise him, others berate him
and others do both, often in the same breath.
</P>
<P>
   The governor is committed to preserving wild lands, and much of
his $1.75 billion environmental bond act in 1996 went to buy
wilderness acreage.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has fought for some clean-air causes, as well. He has
pushed a recalcitrant Metropolitan Transportation Authority into
buying natural gas-powered buses. And this year he signed a law
making heavy trucks subject to annual inspections and maintenance.
He has done significant work on preserving water quality, with
money from the bond act going to clean lakes and rivers and improve
sewage treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say that when environmental goals run up against
corporate interests, Pataki goes soft.
</P>
<P>
   In policing corporate polluters, the Department of Environmental
Conservation has cut enforcement actions, clean-up orders and fines
by about half in the last four years. In 1995 and 1996, the
Environmental Protection Agency repeatedly criticized the
department's enforcement of clean-air laws on smokestack industry.
</P>
<P>
   The administration sharply reduced the much-lauded energy
conservation program after industries protested helping pay for it.
And while Pataki has taken steps to develop parks along the Hudson
River, environmentalists complain that he has not tried to force
General Electric to remove PCB's it dumped there.

   ATLANTA _ People usually do not die here, 24 floors up.
</P>
<P>
   When a maid at the luxurious Atlanta Hilton and Towers used her
pass key to open room 2417 on the morning of Oct. 18, she found
three men lying in a pool of blood.  &UR;  &LR; The city police said the men
appeared to have been forced to the floor, then shot in the head,
execution-style.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, the police and tourism officials in this very
public- relations savvy city speculated that the killings were
drug-related and probably not random acts of violence. The Hilton
is a jewel in Atlanta's tourism crown, after all, a big, glittering
downtown hotel that is often aswarm with conventioneers and foreign
visitors. So the possibility of random killings is a potential
public relations nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends of the three victims have become increasingly
incensed by the suggestion of a drug connection, saying the only
reason for it seemed to be the notion that tourists in Atlanta do
not die in nice, big hotels unless they do something to deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have they been assuaged by the fact that the police have
recently backed away from that notion, apparently unable to find
evidence to support it.
</P>
<P>
   The three men, friends from Florida and Georgia who came to
Atlanta to see the Falcons play the New Orleans Saints, eat a
fancy, expense account meal and sleep in a $180-a-night hotel, did
not deserve what happened to them, people who knew them said. And,
they said, the men did not deserve what happened to them after the
Atlanta public relations forces went to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seemed to be more concerned about tourism than they were
about the lives of my husband and these men,'' said Alice
Gutkowski, whose husband, Ronnie Gutkowski, 51, had no history of
drug activity or any other crime and had moved with his wife from
Long Island to Leesburg, Fla., in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Family members and friends of the other two men _ Gerrold
Shropshire, 50, who had helped found a church in Altamonte Springs,
Fla., and Phillip Dover, 31, a dispatcher for a Gainesville, Ga.,
shipping company who, friends said, lived from paycheck to paycheck
_ said those men, too, were just in Atlanta for a big weekend out
and had nothing to do with drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before you say that, have the facts,'' said Scott Shope, who
worked with Dover as a dispatcher at GTO 2000 of Gainesville and
was his roommate for two years. Shope had obtained four free
tickets to the Falcons game and invited Dover and Shropshire,
telling Shropshire to bring a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Shropshire asked his friend Gutkowski, who also worked in
shipping in the Orlando, Fla., area.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just guys, going to a game,'' Shope said.
</P>
<P>
   The killings, he and others said, were random.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband was a hard-working, good, honest Christian,'' Mrs.
Gutkowski said. ``They were meeting there to see the ballgame, and
to do some sightseeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Atlanta police and tourism officials seem to agree. The
unthinkable did, apparently, happen. Three tourists were shot to
death in the heart of Atlanta's convention district, and no one
seems to know why. Officials of the Police Department said they do
not know what motivated the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The drug angle, which crept into newspaper and television
accounts and lingered for days resulted from several
misunderstandings, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Officer John P. Quigley, a spokesman for the Police Department,
said a police spokesman's response to reporters' questions about
whether drugs had anything to do with the killings led to one
misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman had answered that question with, ``Yes, we're
looking into that,'' but continued to say that it was just one
angle investigators were pursuing, Quigley noted.
</P>
<P>
   The way the men had been killed, as if executed, seemed to hint
at something other than a random robbery, the police investigators
said after the bodies were found.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said reporters interpreted that into articles about a
possible drug-related motive.
</P>
<P>
   The drug theory, Quigley said Wednesday afternoon, ``led
nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials, too, had said the killings appeared to be
drug-related and not random.
</P>
<P>
   After the killings, Spurgeon Richardson, president of the
Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau, told the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution that tourism would probably not be affected if
the victims were involved in drug dealing or some other illegal
activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meeting planners understand that while it's unfortunate,
drug-related crime can happen anywhere in the country,'' Richardson
told the newspaper.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bill Howard, the vice president for public relations and tourism
of the Convention and Visitors Bureau, said those comments were a
``reaction to the early statements by police.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is one of the country's most popular convention
destinations, and it grooms that image constantly.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, friends and relatives of the three dead men remained
disappointed over how the city was handling the memory of the
victims, and puzzled at how it could be considered even plausible
that three ordinary men were linked to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The three men gathered in Atlanta on Oct. 17. They toured the
headquarters of CNN and the World of Coke museum, ``doing some
sight-seeing,'' Mrs. Gutkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   The police are not saying much about what information they have
on what happened later that night or early the next morning. A
hotel video camera recorded Dover talking to another man in the
hotel lobby on Saturday night, then the two men stepped into the
elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter George, an editor with The Birmingham News in Alabama,
was staying near room 2417. Late on Saturday night, he and his wife
heard laughter and music from the vicinity of room 2417 _ George
said he was not certain that the noise came from 2417 _ but never
heard gunshots or other suspicious noises, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims' friends and relatives have no theories beyond, as
one of them said, ``cold-blooded murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gutkowski said her husband had planned to retire in the
next few years. ``He liked to play golf,'' she said. ``We thought
maybe we'd get a boat again.''
</P>
<P>
   Shope described Dover as a young man who liked to drink a few
beers and ``just have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Shropshire, who also worked in a shipping business outside
Orlando, was a churchgoer and was engaged to be married, said
Shope, who knew him through business contacts. Like the others,
Shope said, he had no history beyond that of an ordinary man who
had been looking forward to a night on the town, and a football
game on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mystery,'' Shope said. The only thing that seems to
make sense is that the three men met someone who pretended to be a
friend, he said, and killed them.

STEINBRENNER WILL DONATE $200,000 FOR HURRICANE RELIEF EFFORT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Still jubilant after his baseball team won the World
Series last week, George Steinbrenner announced Wednesday that he
would donate $200,000 from the Yankee Foundation to hurricane
relief efforts in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the money will be used to rebuild a hospital in the
Dominican town of San Pedro de Macoris _ the hometown of Chicago
Cubs star Sammy Sosa _ and half will help rebuild a center for the
elderly in Gurabo, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who visited Puerto Rico and the
Dominican Republic earlier this month to survey the damage from
Hurricane Georges, promptly hailed Steinbrenner, the principal
owner of the Yankees, as a hero.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also took the opportunity to inform New Yorkers _ many
of whom have bridled at Steinbrenner's talk of moving his team from
the Bronx _ that the Yankees owner cared about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have that kind of generosity and that kind of caring happen
spontaneously is rare,'' the mayor said during a news conference
with Steinbrenner in Washington Heights. ``I want to thank
Steinbrenner very, very much for caring so much about the people of
our city, and about the people of Puerto Rico and the Dominican
Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner said he would send Bernie Williams, the Yankees'
star outfielder, to deliver two checks next week. ``It's just a
small thing in these times, when the Yankees and all the city of
New York are celebrating our victory, to think of others in need,''
Steinbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   But he stopped talking when reporters asked whether he planned
to move the Yankees from the Bronx. ``I'm not going to get into
that,'' he said. ``Don't drive me away.''

FALTERING BRAZIL ANNOUNCES $80 BILLION AUSTERITY PLAN 
</HEADLINE>

  c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil _ The Brazilian government introduced a
three-year, $80 billion package of spending cuts and tax increases
Wednesday in an effort to restore the country's flagging
credibility in world markets and prepare the way for a rescue
program led by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for $23.5 billion in savings in 1999, with about
$11 billion of that coming from tax increases and $7 billion from
spending cuts. The rest is to come from pension and fundamental
financial changes. Part of the plan sets up controversial
mechanisms to force states and municipalities to limit spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come for us to make government live within its
limits _ with clarity, conscience and determination,'' Finance
Minister Pedro Malan said Wednesday, elaborating on themes that
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso raised in a televised speech on
Tuesday night, bracing Brazilians for the austerity measures. ``The
time for gradualism is over.''
</P>
<P>
   The blueprint was anxiously awaited by investors and U.S.
policy-makers who fear that the collapse of the country's financial
system could set off defaults and devaluations across Latin
America, worsening a broader crisis and threatening stronger
economies.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's response to Brazil's action Wednesday was
congratulatory but also cautionary, reflecting concerns that the
program could flounder when it reaches the Brazilian Congress, and
some economists said the austerity plan and the IMF bailout package
might not be sufficient to pull Brazil out of its financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted warily, and said the measures did not go as
far as they hoped in making structural changes to permanently
reduce Brazil's burgeoning budget deficit, which is now running at
7 percent of the gross national product. In Sao Paulo, Brazil's
financial center, the benchmark stock index fell 42.63 points, or
five-eighths of a percent, to 6,826.51.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Mariscal, chief investment strategist for Latin America of
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., said, ``It's a step in the right direction,
but if you think of Brazil climbing a wall of disbelief, this is
just a few inches up.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, the giant of South America, with half the continent's
population and the world's ninth-largest economy, has been the
focus of world attention since the collapse in Russian finances two
months ago. Interest rates for Brazilian debt doubled, and the
country began using up roughly $30 billion in foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
   As the country moved into recession, fears have grown of a
financial collapse here, setting off devaluations and defaults
elsewhere in Latin America and heightening risks to the U.S.
economy. The International Monetary Fund, along with other lending
agencies, and officials in Washington have been preparing a safety
net for Brazil of at least $30 billion, with President Clinton
prepared to commit American taxpayer dollars as part of a package
of direct aid from the Group of Seven industrial nations.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement after the plan was detailed Wednesday, Secretary
of the Treasury Robert Rubin said, ``It is essential that Brazil
implement its program promptly and convincingly.''
</P>
<P>
   That message was reinforced, a White House official said, in a
brief conversation between Clinton and Cardoso. Clinton, the
official said, was returning a call Cardoso placed several days ago
to congratulate the American president on the Middle East
agreement, but Clinton's underlying message was that Brazil had to
act quickly.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have made no secret of their exasperation at
Brazil's slowness to act, leaving the country vulnerable, in their
view, to another market upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, though, reportedly made no reference to an American
contribution to an IMF-led rescue package. Brazilian officials said
they would travel to Washington to discuss the plan with IMF
officials by next week. On Wednesday, a spokesman for the fund said
the plan represented ``important progress in the implementation of
Brazil's stabilization and reform program, which will be supported
by the IMF and other members of the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders of Cardoso's governing coalition, who learned
details of the plan over breakfast with Cardoso and Finance
Minister Pedro Malan Wednesday, did not rule out tinkering with
some of the more controversial elements of the austerity program,
but pledged to maintain the savings targets the government would
pledge to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   ``The measures are bitter measures, but in our view they're
extremely necessary,'' said Aecio Neves, congressional party leader
of the president's Brazilian Social Democracy Party, which relies
on five allied parties to form its majority base. ``The governing
coalition has an enormous responsibility to overcome this moment of
instability,'' said Neves.
</P>
<P>
   With the sudden sense of urgency and national mission, few in
the president's governing coalition were willing to openly
challenge the austerity package outright. But many raised
objections to specific elements of the program, and said there
could be alternatives thrown up for debate in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most difficult items to pass, said congressional
leaders, would be a requirement that retired public-sector workers
contribute to the social security coffers, with contributions of 11
to 20 percent of their benefits. The austerity package also
increases the contribution of public-sector workers to social
security, and would introduce a minimum age for retirement of civil
servants, which does not currently exist.
</P>
<P>
   The social security system for public workers in Brazil is far
more generous than that in the United States. Civil servants here
retire with full salaries, according to time served, without regard
to their age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reduction of expenses and the increase of tax collection, it's
an indigestible cocktail for any Congress in the world,'' said
Geddel Vieira Lima, party leader of the government-allied Brazilian
Democratic Movement Party. ``But we know the moment we're living
through, and that we have to show the world we're capable of doing
what's necessary to address our problems.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The package also calls for the extension of several taxes that
were originally passed as temporary measures several years ago.
Under one, the emergency stabilization fund, the federal government
impounds 20 percent of all taxes destined for state and local
governments. The austerity package proposes doubling the amount
impounded to 40 percent and extending the fund, which was to have
expired in 1999, to 2006.
</P>
<P>
   It will also raise the tax on financial transfers to .38 percent
from .2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fernando Bezerra, president of Brazil's National
Confederation of Industry, said Wednesday that the tax increases
would have ``a very negative impact on national production.''
</P>
<P>
   But the government justified the measures as necessary to
relieve a credit crunch and bring down interest rates, now running
over 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The austerity package also calls on Congress to legally oblige
states to limit spending on active and retired employees to 60
percent of their budgets, at the same time cutting the resources
available by impounding taxes.
</P>
<P>
   It is by no means sure, however, that fiscal discipline can
successfully be imposed on state and city governments by fiat.
Anthony Garotinho, elected governor of Rio de Janeiro province in
last Sunday's elections, said Wednesday, ``Does the government
expect us to make miracles?'' He noted that Rio, which is seeking a
$300 million loan from the federal government, is responsible like
other states for providing basic services including education,
health and security. ``I was elected to be a governor, not a
magician,'' Garotinho said.
</P>
<P>
   Mariscal, of Goldman Sachs, also called the impoundment fund's
extension ``another negative,'' and said, ``Brazil is in the mess
it's in because it has too much debt, too many employees and too
high a social security deficit. It's an issue of spending too much
and lowering the debt, and everything else is peripheral.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Goodman, chief economist at Santander Investment
Securities, called the package ``mildly favorable regarding the
potential for an ongoing `muddling through' scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   This week marks the one-year anniversary of the last package
Cardoso announced, with much fanfare, just after Thailand's
collapse. That package to raise $18 billion, hailed as a great show
of decisiveness, was largely passed by Congress. But the only
measures that were implemented involved raising taxes, not cutting
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil will remain captive to a $300 billion domestic debt
that is extraordinarily short-term in nature, which is one of the
paramount issues coming out of the Asia crisis,'' Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Malan and other government officials are to testify
about the austerity package before Congress, which is scheduled to
begin action, starting with social security reform, next week.

   NEW YORK _ It's that time of year in New York. Fashion designers
parade their new spring lines down the runway for review and
college athletic conferences give the news media a look at their
starting lineups for the coming basketball season.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, no matter how hyped the collection or the team,
no one really knows who's going to be this year's success.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz Wednesday at the Big East Conference's media day at the
New York Hilton Hotel was the University of Connecticut's men's
team, which was the unanimous choice of the league's head coaches
to win the 1998-99 Big East regular-season title. The Huskies
exceeded expectations last year by making it to the regional final
of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, where
they lost to North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches picked Syracuse for second place, followed by Miami
and St. John's, Georgetown, Villanova, Pittsburgh, Rutgers, Seton
Hall, Providence, West Virginia, Notre Dame and Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   UConn coach Jim Calhoun sounded cautiously optimistic about the
team's chances of withstanding the pressure that comes with a No. 1
ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're deep and we have enough talent to be a great basketball
team,'' Calhoun said. ``But our kids have to understand that a win
over us this season will be considered a big win. If we start to
assume we're the best and teams will roll over for us, then we're
in trouble. I think this team understands that.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's Richard Hamilton, the 1997-98 player of the year
in the Big East, and Khalid El-Amin, last year's Big East rookie of
the year, were selected to the preseason all-conference team. Also
named to the squad were Providence forward Jamel Thomas, Miami's
Tim James and Pittsburgh's Vonteego Cummings. Georgetown guard
Anthony Perry and St. John's guard Erick Barkley were chosen
preseason co-rookies of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the scrappy, self-effacing Metro Atlantic Athletic
Conference, which introduced members of this year's men's and
women's basketball teams to the news media on Tuesday, the Big East
has long been a perennial leader of the NCAA pack. This year marks
the league's 20th anniversary and the league continues to go
through some changes.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the last season the league will play 18 conference
games, a format that began in 1995-96. Next season, the league will
go back to 16 conference games.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Michael Tranghese, in justifying the switch, said
playing less conference games improves the league's chances of
sending teams to the NCAA tournament, and at higher seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Tranghese said he was proud of the accomplishments the league
has made over the past 19 years. He pointed to 1985, when the Big
East placed three teams in the Final Four, and 1996, when the
league produced three first-team all-Americans _ a first for any
conference _ as two of the most memorable moments in the league's
history.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Big East will offer up its women's basketball
programs for the news media's scrutiny. The dazzling styles of both
the men's and women's games will be available to the public next
week when the Big East officially kicks off its season.

   LONDON _ England's High Court ruled Wednesday in favor of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet's claim that he is immune from arrest here and
extradition to Spain on charges of murder, kidnapping and torture.
But the justices ordered him detained pending an appeal, which is
expected next week.
</P>
<P>
   The court held that the 82-year-old former Chilean president was
immune from arrest because he was head of state at the time the
crimes cited were committed. ``The applicant is entitled to
immunity as a former sovereign from criminal and civil process in
the English courts,'' said Lord Chief Justice Bingham.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's supporters viewed Wednesday's decision as a
significant victory in his battle to escape charges and return to
Chile, and his opponents reacted to the verdict with tears and
expressions of dismay and condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet has been under police guard in a London hospital, where
he is recovering from back surgery, since Oct. 16 on an extradition
request from a Spanish judge who wants him to try him for the
deaths and torture of Spanish citizens during the years he ruled
Chile. ``The Chilean government is very happy and satisfied that
the British High Court has recognized Senator Pinochet's
immunity,'' Deputy Foreign Minister Mariano Fernandez said at
Chile's embassy in London.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, the military ruler of Chile from 1973 to 1990 and
commander in chief of its army until earlier this year, is a
senator for life.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International issued a statement saying, ``The High
Court has made England a safe haven for dictators and former
dictators acting in their official capacity as heads of state,
undermining the absolute nature of the prohibition against torture
in international law.'' The organization's director, Helen Bamber,
said, ``Does this mean that men like Saddam Hussein and Slobodan
Milosevic are safe to swan around the globe in the knowledge that
legally they are untouchable ?''
</P>
<P>
   Crown prosecutors said they would file an appeal by the close of
business Monday. It will most likely be heard by a panel of senior
judges, known as law lords, of the House of Lords, and a spokesman
there promised swift action, because it involves somebody's
personal liberty, a judicial official in the House of Lords told
Reuters. ``We can hear that very quickly.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the ruling, Lord Bingham said, ``It is of course a matter for
acute public concern that those who abuse sovereign power to commit
crimes against humanity should not escape trial and appropriate
punishment.'' But he said that not even the charter establishing
the International War Crimes Tribunal at Nuremberg in 1945
invalidated the principle ``that one sovereign state will not
impugn another in relation to its sovereign acts.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was quashing the arrest warrants under which Pinochet
had been held for the last 12 days, but ``staying'' the order
pending appeal.
</P>
<P>
   During the two days of hearings before the High Court, lawyers
for the Crown Prosecution Service argued that the general was
involved in the deaths of ``at least 4,000 people'' and had sent
agents to Spain to ``seek out and kill'' political opponents. His
lawyers countered that if the extradition bid succeeded, Queen
Elizabeth II could theoretically be arrested abroad to face trial
for alleged crimes by Britain.
</P>
<P>
   A bail hearing has been scheduled for Friday that could allow
Pinochet to move out of the clinic to another location in London.
</P>
<P>
   Since the general's arrest, Chilean exiles around Europe have
moved to bring additional murder and rights charges against him.
But Wednesday the attorney general's office in London said it was
turning down applications for trials that came from two lawyers
representing alleged victims of the dictator's regime. The action
effectively bars any prosecution of Pinochet in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   French, Swedish and Swiss judicial authorities have said in
recent days that they intend to join Spain in pressing for Gen.
Pinochet's extradition, but there was no word in London on the
status of those petitions or any reaction from British judicial
officials. Geneva's public prosecutor, Bernard Bertossa, said
Wednesday night that he was ``shocked'' by the British ruling and
added, ``If we want to fight sincerely against genocidal behavior,
one cannot invoke the immunity of heads of state.'' Under those
terms, he contended, ``Hitler would get immunity.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from Judge Baltasar Garzon, the
Spanish investigating magistrate who is looking into atrocities
committed during Latin America's ``dirty wars'' of the 1970s and
1980s and who first obtained Pinochet's arrest in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The judge is trying to establish an important legal precedent,
and in the past decade a growing body of international law has made
it somewhat easier to reach across borders to try people accused of
``crimes against humanity.'' There is a war crimes tribunal in The
Hague especially for the former Yugoslavia. And a number of
countries have established laws giving them jurisdiction to
prosecute war criminals. These include Germany, Canada, Sweden, the
Netherlands and Spain. Some countries have used such laws for
crimes committed in Rwanda and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The British have said from the outset said the matter was one
for the judiciary and not the government, and Prime Minister Tony
Blair on Wednesday faced down criticism from opposition
Conservatives during question time in the House of Commons. ``The
judicial process has not involved the government issuing warrants
for arrest,'' he said. ``That is done by the Spanish authorities
through Interpol to the British magistrates, who then take it from
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher protested the
arrest and said Britain should let Pinochet return to Chile.
Wednesday, Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative home affairs
spokesman, told the Commons that ``The government is entirely
responsible for the mess it has created. The Lord Chief Justice of
England has now found that the government did not even know the
meaning of diplomatic immunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon de Miguel, Spain's secretary of state for foreign affairs,
told reporters at the parliament building in Madrid that his
government would honor the ruling. It was one, he said, ``that was
made by the British judges. The government has profound respect for
the institutions and we have nothing more to say.''
</P>
<P>
   There were scuffles outside the London Clinic when, shortly
after the decision, the general's wife, Lucia, his two daughters, a
son and a group of right-wing Chilean legislators arrived to visit.
Since the arrest, the street outside the building has often been
filled with demonstrators, many of them Chilean exiles who say that
relatives and friends died because of government oppression during
the Pinochet years.
</P>
<P>
   A self-declared Anglophile who supported the British in their
1982 war against Argentina in the Falkland Islands, Pinochet has
made a number of visits to Britain in recent years without
incident. He arrived this time Sept. 21 and was treated as a VIP by
the Foreign Office.
</P>
<P>
   He had drinks with Baroness Thatcher at her Belgravia home Oct.
5 and gave a long interview to The New Yorker magazine in which he
talked of his love of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet had suffered back pains during the `17-hour flight from
Santiago and a doctor he consulted recommended urgent surgery. He
had the operation Oct. 9. A Chilean air force ambulance plane is at
the ready at a Royal Air Force base in Oxfordshire to transport
Pinochet home.

 RACE FOR 3rd PLACE PITS GOLISANO AGAINST McCAUGHEY ROSS  
(duplication warning: also sent with `a' code) 
 (bl)  
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although nothing in politics is certain, polls suggest that
Republican incumbent George Pataki will probably win the race for
New York governor on Tuesday, and that Democratic nominee Peter
Vallone will finish a distant second.
</P>
<P>
   The real mystery is who will come in third.
</P>
<P>
   Among the minor-party candidates jostling for that dubious honor
are Thomas Leighton of the Marijuana Reform Party, which advocates
a system of legal distribution of marijuana; the Green Party's Al
Lewis, also known as Grandpa Munster, and Michael Reynolds of the
Right to Life Party.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to carrying the Republican Party standard, Pataki is
the candidate of the Conservative Party. Vallone counts on the
support of the Working Families Party.
</P>
<P>
   But the two leading contenders for also-ran are a millionaire _
B. Thomas Golisano, a Rochester businessman who ran for governor on
the newly formed Independence Party ballot line in 1994 and is
doing so again _ and a millionaire's wife: Betsy McCaughey Ross,
the formerly Republican lieutenant governor whose try for the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination collapsed after her husband,
financier Wilbur Ross, withdrew much of his financial support. Ms.
McCaughey Ross is now on the Liberal Party line.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent New York Times/CBS News Poll shows Golisano with
9 percent of 1,235 registered voters polled, and Ms. McCaughey Ross
with 5 percent, to Vallone's 21 percent. Pataki is in front with 56
percent. Nine percent are undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Given Pataki's sizable lead from the start, neither Golisano nor
Ms. McCaughey Ross has exactly shaken up the race. But not
constrained by hope or expectations, they have persisted with their
quixotic campaigns, Golisano with considerably more enthusiasm. For
both candidates, more than mere ego is at stake. Unless they win
50,000 votes, their parties will lose their official lines on the
ballot in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Golisano's campaign strategy is simple: a few news conferences
assailing Pataki's ``borrow-and-spend'' policies, and lots of
money. His most recent financial disclosure form, filed Oct. 20,
showed that he had lent his campaign just over $20 million, and
that it had spent close to $12 million. He estimates that his
spending will total $13 to $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   With paid media doing the work for him, Golisano is free to
continue tending his payroll processing company, Paychex Inc.,
which he founded in Rochester in 1971. He and the political
consultants and media concerns he has hired have papered the
state's buses, trains and billboards with his slightly smiling
visage and blitzed its television stations with witty political
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ads needle Pataki about the state's growing debt. In
1994, Golisano ran on a range of issues, including massive tax
cuts, and won 4 percent of the vote, but this year, he has made
debt reduction the centerpiece of his campaign, saying that Pataki
has irresponsibly increased state spending and ballooned its debt,
particularly through ``back-door borrowing'' that is not approved
by the voters. ``He's trying to create a false sense of euphoria
about our state's economy,'' Golisano says of the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate's focus appears to be paying off. In an attempt to
ride Golisano's financial coattails, aides say, Vallone has begun
hammering the theme of debt reduction much harder. And on Sunday,
The Rochester Democrat &AMP; Chronicle, which endorsed Gov. Mario Cuomo
in 1994, endorsed Golisano, whom it described as ``beating the
drums of fiscal responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the withdrawal of her husband's financial support, Ms.
McCaughey Ross has had no choice but to keep a lower profile. She
devotes most of her time to banging out Op-Ed articles and policy
papers at her Manhattan office. ``She's spending a lot of time
behind her laptop,'' said Cristina Page, an aide at the lieutenant
governor's office. ``She usually spends her day with me in the
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross was plucked from political obscurity by
Pataki in 1994 after writing several highly critical articles about
President Clinton's health care plan. As she put it, ``I'm not a
typical career street politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Her demeanor is not that of a desperate campaigner but of a
beatific crusader. She, too, has adopted only a few issues:
reproductive rights; the expansion of the state's prescription drug
program for the elderly, and explaining to Congress, the public and
anyone who will listen why the Republican Congress should not
impeach Clinton. (``I'm a constitutional scholar,'' she says in
explaining the issue's relevance to her.)
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. McCaughey Ross does venture out, it is often unclear _
even to her own aides _ whether her appearances are as lieutenant
governor or as a candidate. Last week, for instance, she visited a
Chinese-American health care clinic, debated Dick Morris, a former
presidential adviser, on the president's travails and showed up on
a Saturday morning at 8:30 in a black suit and pearls to support a
Brooklyn abortion clinic regularly visited by anti-abortion
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the blurring of lines is a practical matter. As her
campaign spokesman, Kevin Davitt, put it, ``Frankly, she has a
little more oomph as lieutenant governor'' on the issues. ``Our
problem is we're not as _ how shall we put it _ desirable as we
were during the primary,'' Davitt said.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. McCaughey Ross was one of the political dignitaries in
last week's Yankee parade _ riding alone in a convertible _ she did
not share the dais with the governor and Vallone, who is the
speaker of the City Council. (The governor and the lieutenant
governor essentially stopped speaking several years ago.)
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign has fallen to the Liberal Party and its chairman,
Raymond Harding. His party cast its lot with Ms. McCaughey Ross in
part because her husband had pledged several million dollars to her
campaign. When he withdrew the bulk of that support less than two
weeks before the primary, all bets were off, and the pressure was
on Harding to raise enough cash to run something of a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first time the Liberal Party has had the `privilege'
of having to not only run the campaign but worry about the
fund-raising angle of it,'' Harding said. Harding is a close
mayoral ally and a partner in the lobbying firm of Fischbein
Badillo Wagner Harding and among the friends and clients he has
tapped are some, like Donald Trump and David Walentas, the
developers, whose real estate concerns are likely to be affected by
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Harding has raised enough money to get some television ads
featuring Ms. McCaughey Ross on the air, and he says he is
confident that the Liberal Party will win enough votes to secure
its future.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross said she was uncertain about her future past
election day, but she said that another gubernatorial campaign was
possible, although she did not specify a party. Many politicians
and analysts believe it is unlikely, after the events of this year,
that she will ever again be a major party candidate for either
party.
</P>
<P>
   The future of Golisano's party, which he founded about four
years ago, seems assured as well, which he says is partly the
reason he ran. The Independence Party now has 122,172 registered
members. (The Liberal Party has 92,498 members, and the
Conservative Party, 166,985.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're creating permanent competition with the Independence
Party,'' Golisano said. ``With competition, the consumer wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Consciously or not, Golisano is also building his business:
while he has spent millions of his own money, he and Paychex have
also earned millions in free publicity. But Golisano said that the
attention in New York state would not have a significant impact on
his nationwide business.
</P>
<P>
   Will he run again? ``I'm certainly going to keep an open mind to
it,'' Golisano said, ``and I'm going to be very active in the next
four years. There are some issues I still want to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them, he said, is campaign finance reform. If he had
another way of reaching voters, he said, like debates or free air
time or public financing, he would have preferred to give the $13
million or so to charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could take the money out of the campaigns,''
Golisano said. ``Peter Vallone might have had a better chance.''

DODGERS, SHAW WORKING ON MULTIYEAR DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw is expected
to demand a trade before the Nov. 5 deadline, even as the club
works toward an agreement on a new multiyear contract.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone has spoken to Shaw's
Cincinnati-based agent Joe Bick several times in the past few days
and both seemed optimistic about reaching a new deal that could be
worth almost $4.5 million per season.
</P>
<P>
   Malone flew Wednesday to the Dodgers spring-training camp in
Vero Beach for four days of organizational meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, who had 25 of his 48 saves after being traded from the
Reds at the All-Star break, has three years left on his existing
deal at $2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' John Wetteland is baseball's highest-paid closer at $5.5
million per season. The Giants' Robb Nen makes $4.5 million and the
Cubs' Rod Beck $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The demand is more procedural, even though Shaw has said he
would like to play closer to his home outside Cincinnati. But in
most cases, the contract is renegotiated and the demand is dropped.
</P>
<P>
   A player moved during a multiyear contract can demand to be
traded after the first season with the new club. If he is not
traded, he can become a free agent March 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the final analysis, he signed the contract he signed
because it was close to their permanent residence,'' Bick said.
``If it was Los Angeles or Seattle or Pittsburgh, I think he
certainly would want to be paid his true market value, which he is
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a condemnation of Los Angeles, not at all. Jeff
enjoyed it there.''

CAL PRANKSTERS BRANCH OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Silicon Valley is up to its microchip in crime.
Specifically, grand theft arbor.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Stanford Tree was stolen from its on-campus
resting place, the Band Shak. Obviously, Cal students were the
prime suspects, and officials from both schools pleaded for the
Tree's safe return without any retaliatory incidents. Stanford
police treated the theft as a felony.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, a group of Cal students calling themselves
the Phoenix Five sent a picture of the Tree _ blindfolded _ to the
student paper, the Daily Californian, with a note signed by the
Tree.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, they've watched ``Ransom'' a few too many times.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's Chris Henderson, who made and wears the Tree,
responded to the picture and note with a press release directed at
the Phoenix Five:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tree costume is an inanimate object,'' Henderson wrote.
``It does not move. It does not think. It does not write letters,
especially letters which deprecate Stanford.... I AM THE TREE. Stop
talking to a pile of fabric and show a little backbone.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Tree is not returned today, Cal officials will prohibit
the Bears' mascot, Oski, from performing at the Big Game.
</P>
<P>
   __ The latest salvo: Cal coach Tom Holmoe called his UCLA
counterpart, Bob Toledo, on Tuesday to apologize for receiver
Dameane Douglas' remarks. After UCLA's 28-16 victory Saturday,
Douglas said the Bruins looked more like the nation's No. 27 team
than its No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   That comment prompted a response from Toledo: ``He caught 10
passes for 70 yards. My daughter can catch 10 passes for 70
yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Holmoe's apology, Douglas had more to say Tuesday
afternoon. Informed of Toledo's retort, Douglas said: ``If I'm a
bad guy, then he's a bad guy, too. If his daughter can run those
routes, then why couldn't his players cover them.''
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   __ Review of the Week: All-American offensive tackle Kris Farris
is a film buff who wants to make movies when his career ends. He
has agreed to review a movie each week for the Daily News. This
week: ``Apt Pupil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Talented director Bryan Singer's new film explores the hidden
evil within everyday young men. The story concerns a teen-age
prodigy (Brad Renfro) whose obsession with the Holocaust leads him
to establish a relationship with an ex-Nazi SS man (played
masterfully by Sir Ian McKellan).
</P>
<P>
   ``Singer's fresh camera work and aptitude for integrating
chilling sound effects _ remember the climax to his previous film,
`Usual Suspects'? _ are unfortunately overshadowed by a weak
script. The film needs more conflict. A few more rewrites would
have done it wonders, but the talent of Singer and McKellan make
`Apt Pupil' hard to pass up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 3 pancakes (out of four).

AIKMAN'S RETURN LEAVES IRVIN GIDDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The man was soaked from the afternoon workouts.
Sweat is flying everywhere with each crazy gyration of his arms,
with each swivel of his hips. Yet you move in closer. You don't
want to miss one word. This is Michael Irvin unplugged.
</P>
<P>
   He's going on and on about his struggles without Troy Aikman:
``I know we lost some of our bravery, some of that `oomph, we can
do it.' '' He's telling you that he still has not learned coach
Chan Gailey's complex offense, ``all we do is run plays ... but I
still don't know it like I'd like to know it.''
</P>
<P>
   He does know this: Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Bobby Taylor
has built his reputation mostly because of his play against Irvin.
This reputation has come even though Taylor often gets double- and
sometimes triple-team help against Irvin. In four head-to-head
regular-season and playoff matchups, Taylor and the Eagles double-
and triple-teaming have held Irvin to an average of 53 yards
receiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young guys come in and they want to play a guy with a name
so they can get their name,'' Irvin said. ``Then they say to
\Rhim\S, `Man, you put it on Michael Irvin.' That's all you need,
and it's off and running.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin might understand this rite of manhood in the NFL. But he's
hardly flattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does that flatter me?'' said Irvin, whose matchup against
Taylor will be scrutinized when the Cowboys play at Philadelphia on
Monday Night Football. ``I'm already the big boy. I get no flattery
knowing that he got the big-boy title over me.''
</P>
<P>
   You want to know how Aikman's return from a five-game absence is
supposed to help the mental wherewithal of the Cowboys? Look no
further than the demonstrative Irvin. Not only is the yak back, but
so is the confidence of a man who has caught 45 of his career 61
touchdown passes from Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to play with any quarterback in the history of this
league, there is no one I'd pick over Troy. No one!'' Irvin said.
``I know that he knows the things I'm trying to do on the field. I
know he knows when I'm going to break out, and when I'm going to
break in. And I'm talking about when I have my back to him, even if
the play didn't dictate that. I know if he's on the field and if
there's a chance in the world that I'm one-on-one, the ball is
coming to me. I just know he's throwing it to me. That's our
comfort level.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman calls it, ``flattering,'' to hear how much he's missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those things that sometimes you get with a
particular player or receiver and sometimes you start seeing the
same things they are seeing,'' Aikman said. ``And they start
thinking the same way that you are thinking. It's fun when you
develop that and play alongside guys like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But both concede there is still lots of new ground to cover.
Aikman has played just 5 1/2 quarters. And Irvin, though he is
third in the NFL in receiving yards (578) said he feels lost in an
offense that has him running routes from all over the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are ways I run routes in this offense when \Rcoach Chan
Gailey\S tells me \Rcorrecting\S, `No, you've got to go now, you've
got to do this now,' '' Irvin said. ``I don't know the catching
point of every play in this offense, where I should look for the
ball, or how I should expect it coming out.
</P>
<P>
   But Irvin insists that he will get Gailey's offense down soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run so many plays in practice that you can't help but get
better,'' Irvin said. ``We didn't run as many plays before Chan got
here. Before, we had a lot of individual things. Now it's
different. Chan may dress it up, calling it a team drill,
perimeter, red zone, Nickel blitz. But it's all 11-on-11. When you
do that so much you get comfortable with your assignment.''
</P>
<P>
   To Irvin, though, the learning is not coming fast enough. He's
reminded nearly every day about not having scored a touchdown since
Dec. 8 against Carolina, a span of nine games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed because if I'd have scored, maybe those
13-12 games would be wins,'' Irvin said. ``If we were 7-0 it would
not be as disappointing. But losing, knowing I didn't get in the
end zone, that's disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   A few moments after musing about his touchdown drought, Irvin
noticed injured linebacker Broderick Thomas across the locker room.
Thomas shouted to Irvin, ``watch out for the \Rmedia\S traps.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin smiled and flicked some sweat off his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no trap I can't get out of with No. 8,'' he said.

TROJANS HOPING TO UNCROSS SIGNALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The big decision for USC coach Paul Hackett this
week isn't who to start at quarterback but how to signal plays into
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett is considering having the quarterbacks wear wristbands
or sending a receiver with the play, to ease the process with which
the offense receives the information.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Ken O'Brien has signaled plays into the
quarterback all season, but USC has burned timeouts and received
delay-of-game penalties in critical situations because of frequent
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans lost a touchdown pass to Mike Bastianelli against
Oregon because the 25-second clock had expired. A similar penalty
nullified a long pass to R. Jay Soward against Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we've been looking into,'' Hackett said about
having the quarterbacks wear wristbands. ``I've been hesitant to
change. I think we might take the pressure off them. We haven't
made a decision yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he is also mulling the possibility of having a
receiver run the plays in to the huddle. Hackett said he would
prefer to continue signaling in the plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a whisker away from saying things are working very
well,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Powell gets the start: Fullback Marvin Powell will get his
second straight start this week. At left guard, there is still a
battle between last week's starter, Donta Kendrick, and Jason
Grain.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's going to get into a comfort zone,'' offensive line
coach Steve Greatwood said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hopeful but realistic: The Trojans are trying to remain
positive despite recognizing that the team's Rose Bowl hopes are
all but eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of games left. You can win the four games that
are left and go 9-3,'' linebacker Chris Claiborne said. ``Right
now, it doesn't look like we're going to do it, but we've got a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've put ourselves in a position to make us work harder than
we have to.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Tapering down: USC practiced in shorts Wednesday, because
Hackett felt the Trojans are physically banged up.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Aaron Williams is day-to-day with a neck
stinger, but Hackett expects him to play. Shamsud-Din Abdul-Shaheed
has moved from end to tackle and will start if Williams can't play.
</P>
<P>
   __ Thomas cleared to practice: Freshman quarterback Jason Thomas
practiced in pads for the first time since undergoing ankle
surgery. Thomas played scout-team quarterback. Also practicing for
the first time in several weeks was Quincy Woods, who has had a
swollen knee.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Marc Matock underwent X-rays Tuesday, which
revealed that his broken ankle is healing as scheduled. Matock said
he hopes to return for the UCLA game.

DEBATES: A TRADITION WITH MORE IMPACT ON REPORTERS THAN ON VOTERS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Back in the summer of 1982, few people gave Mario
Cuomo, then the lieutenant governor of New York, a real shot at
winning the Democratic primary for governor. By almost any measure
_ financial backing, name recognition _ he stacked up miserably
against the front-runner, Ed Koch, the seemingly indomitable mayor
of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a July morning when the two squared off at a breakfast
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Most voters did not see it. Most probably heard little about it.
But opinion makers were there, and Cuomo's assured and eloquent
performance wowed them. From that moment on, reporters followed his
campaign and sought his comments. And their assessment of his
importance, reflected in that bounty of coverage, registered with
viewers and readers, who chose Cuomo over Koch in the September
primary.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of debates, political analysts and politicians said,
is not so much the reactions of the television viewers watching
them, who generally represent a tiny fraction of voters. The real
impact is the way debates define or explode existing images of
candidates among representatives of news organizations, whose daily
and weekly reporting reaches a much bigger audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debates have a profound impact on the people who cover them,''
said Maurice Carroll, a former political reporter who is now the
director of the Quinnipiac Polling Institute. ``It colors the way
they see candidates and what they broadcast and write the next
morning and every day that follows.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the debates last weekend between Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles
Schumer, the impact could be negligible, and that is not because of
the predictably small audiences who watched them. (Television
executives estimated that fewer than 300,000 people saw the first
debate, on Saturday night, and fewer than 250,000 saw the second
one, early Sunday afternoon.)
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the debates came too late in the race to alter
substantially its dynamics, and both candidates are veteran
politicians already well known to opinion makers. Moreover, they
caused no surprises: D'Amato and Schumer merely parroted the
messages they had been repeating in prepared remarks and paid
commercials for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But the candidates' cautious adherence to scripts was a tacit
acknowledgment of how closely reporters were watching, and how
loudly and persistently any miscalculation might echo in their
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say it is not the whole of a debate that
matters; it is the headlines atop newspaper stories and the sound
bites in television news segments that count.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're really fighting for is not two hours of attention
but 30 seconds on television news,'' said Nelson Warfield, a
Republican political consultant in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants labor mightily to try to influence what those 30
seconds _ or the first several paragraphs of a newspaper story _
will be.
</P>
<P>
   On the front end, they plant pithy gibes and compelling
anecdotes in a candidate's head and then suggest to reporters what
to watch for. On the back end, they instantly offer unsolicited
observations about the salient moments.
</P>
<P>
   In the minutes following the first debate between D'Amato and
Schumer, for example, a reporter for The New York Times who was
writing about the event received telephone messages from eight paid
consultants and political operatives who wanted to share their
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Warfield and other political consultants said television news
coverage was considered increasingly precious because local
newscasts tended to ignored all but what they considered the high
points of campaigns. And debates always rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``A debate has conflict, and TV loves conflict,'' said Mike
Murphy, a Republican media strategist.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Murphy said enterprising strategists try to stretch a debate
into three or four days of television news stories: the
preparation, the countdown, the big night, the morning after.
</P>
<P>
   In relatively tight races, like the one between D'Amato and
Schumer, debates have become largely tests of poise in which each
thoroughly rehearsed, painstakingly prepared candidate tries to
hammer home one or two essential points while steering clear of
gaffes and rooting for his or her opponent to carom into one.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how scripted each candidate's remarks are, a debate
creates more room, and more chance, for spontaneity than any stump
speech or formal interview.
</P>
<P>
   Consider President Gerald R. Ford's off-the-cuff comment in a
debate with Jimmy Carter in 1976 that Poland was not under Soviet
domination. It was a line repeated endlessly in news reports over
subsequent days, and political analysts said it contributed
considerably to Ford's image as somewhat bumbling _ intellectually,
as well as physically, clumsy.
</P>
<P>
   More often, however, the aftershocks of a debate are subtler.
The first debate of the Senate campaign in New York this year was a
case in point.
</P>
<P>
   It happened back in June, and the three Democrats vying for
their party's nomination _ Schumer, former congresswoman Geraldine
A. Ferraro and Mark Green, the New York City Public Advocate _
trudged all the way to the upstate town of Bolton Landing, N.Y., to
participate in it. News coverage was slim.
</P>
<P>
   But several reporters there said they were struck by how little
zest Ms. Ferraro brought to her performance. And they said that
impression helped to create one of the running themes of the
coverage of Ms. Ferraro that followed: that she was coasting on her
place in history as the only woman to get a major party's vice
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate was way the hell up in the middle of the sticks,''
Andrew Kirtzman, a political reporter for New York 1 News, a cable
news channel, recalled. ``And it wasn't broadcast live anywhere.
But she performed badly, and it wasn't long after that that she was
seen as this kind of giant headed for a fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirtzman and other reporters said that in that same debate,
Green carved out a niche as the election's spirited attack dog,
ignored only at his opponents' peril. Green said he experienced a
bounce in both news coverage and contributions after the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said the sort of bounce that Green felt that
he got _ and that Cuomo clearly did get in 1982 _ was precisely
what Gov. George Pataki, now seeking re-election to a second term,
is trying to deny his Democratic challenger, Peter Vallone, the New
York City Council Speaker. Pataki has repeatedly refused to debate
Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   In a grossly uneven race, a challenger can bridge some of the
gap, analysts said, simply by sharing a stage with a front-runner
or occupying the same visual frame. That tableau, shown on
television newscasts and in newspaper photographs, bestows an
equivalence of stature that voters may not have considered.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is far enough ahead in the polls that he can afford the
resentments of whatever small number of voters deemed his decision
unsportsmanlike, analysts said.

HISPANIC LEADERS ASSAIL VACCO OVER INTERVIEW

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Editors of a weekly newspaper say state Attorney
General Dennis Vacco told them early this week that it was hard to
prove the effectiveness of the death penalty because researchers do
not ``stand outside a bodega'' and ask ``the bandito'' if capital
punishment deterred him from crime.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the remarks, which circulated rapidly Wednesday,
produced strong condemnations of Vacco by many Hispanic civic
leaders and politicians, who said the comments betrayed a bias
against Hispanic New Yorkers. Vacco disputed that contention and
insisted that he had not used the word ``bandito.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over Vacco's remarks put him on the defensive
Wednesday just as he was trying to take political advantage of an
admission by his Democratic opponent, Eliot Spitzer, that he had
been less than forthright about his campaign financing.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco called a news conference at his midtown campaign
headquarters Wednesday afternoon to raise new questions about
Spitzer's campaign financing. But Vacco, a Republican, faced a
flurry of questions about his remarks on Monday to the editorial
board of the newspaper, The Jewish Week. Reports about the
comments, which are to be published in an issue of the newspaper
due out Thursday, were spread quickly Wednesday by Hispanic civic
leaders and politicians and by Spitzer's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the reinstatement of the death penalty in many states
had not caused murder rates to decline, Vacco told the editorial
board that it was hard to survey criminals, said Rob Goldblum, the
newspaper's managing editor. Then, according to Goldblum, Vacco
said, ``You don't stand outside a bodega and ask the bandito if he
would have killed someone if there was a death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Vacco said at the news conference that he had not used the word
``bandito,'' although he did acknowledge that he had used
``bodega'' and had often used the image in his public remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say it, I didn't say it,'' Vacco told reporters. ``I
was there with a member of my campaign staff. We took copious
notes. I did not use the word bandito. I have never used that word.
I have used that analogy innumerable times over the last four
years, have never used that word.''
</P>
<P>
   But Goldblum said that he and other editors of The Jewish Week,
which is based in Manhattan, stood by their report. He said that
the comments came at the end of the meeting, and that the newspaper
did not have a tape of the final section of the discussion. Vacco
said that a campaign aide had brought a tape recorder to the
session, but that it had malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   Some Hispanic civic leaders said they found Vacco's remarks
objectionable, regardless of whether he had merely used bodega or
had also used the word bandito, because they imply that people who
stand outside a Spanish grocery are likely to be criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't even realize the implications of his choice of
words,'' said Lorraine Cortes-Vazquez, president of the Hispanic
Federation, an association of 60 nonprofit agencies. ``The whole
sentiment is a disparaging one. It's such a poor reflection that he
has on the Latino community. You're not cavalier about the death
penalty, and you're not cavalier about 27 percent of the population
that you represent.''
</P>
<P>
   Vacco insisted that his comments were not biased. ``I didn't say
it, I didn't say it,'' he said, referring to the word bandito. ``So
how could it be a slur if I didn't say it?''
</P>
<P>
   He said, too, that bodega carried no ethnic connotations. ``What
is the difference between a bodega and a deli?'' he said. ``I've
used the two phrases interchangeably.''
</P>
<P>
   Vacco was asked what word he had used, if he had not said
bandito, but a campaign aide announced that the news conference was
over. Vacco did not answer the question.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Vacco raised several new questions about Spitzer's
campaign finances. Spitzer acknowledged Wednesday that he had
repeatedly misstated facts about his campaign financing. Spitzer,
who has taken out more than $9 million in bank loans to run for
attorney general in 1994 and again this year, has often said he
alone was paying off the loans.
</P>
<P>
   But he said for the first time earlier this week that his father
had lent him money late in 1994 to repay $4.3 million in bank
loans. The loan from his father may not violate state campaign
finance laws, but the acknowledgment represents a political
embarrassment for Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco said Wednesday that Spitzer had reported in disclosure
statements that he received more than $4 million in bank loans
earlier this month for this year's campaign. Vacco asked how
Spitzer had financed his campaign this year before obtaining the
loan.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, who was campaigning Wednesday in Buffalo, deflected
questions about his financing. ``I have revealed all the facts, and
the issue should be behind us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer tried to turn attention back to questions about Vacco's
fund-raising, particularly to large contributions from a Long
Island car-leasing company made after the attorney general's office
settled charges against the company. ``The question still remains:
Which company under investigation by the attorney general's office
has Dennis Vacco accepted contributions from?'' Spitzer said.

GOLF-CLUB MAKERS AIM FOR GREEN WITH NEW LINES OF BALLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- What's the big deal about golf balls, anyway?
After all, they're all round, white and covered with those cute
little dimples, aren't they?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is: plenty, if you're a golf-club manufacturer
looking for a way to inject some life into your company's revenue
stream.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that most manufacturers have just about reached
the edge of the technological envelope when it comes to clubs. And
today's equipment is so expensive that most players can't afford to
replace their clubs on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   Golf balls, though, disappear almost as often as socks in the
laundry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the golf industry, you are at the end of the technology
cycle,'' said Joe Teklits, an analyst at Ferris Baker Watts in
Baltimore. ``When you go through cycles, it's nice to have
something that is a regular seller.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the beauty of the ball industry and why at least three of
the game's most noted club makers -- Cobra Golf, Callaway Golf Co.
and Taylor Made Golf -- are eyeing a new field these days.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the Carlsbad, Calif.-based companies has a ball either
in the research-and-development lab or ready for market in an
attempt to grab a chunk of the annual $1 billion-plus industry.
</P>
<P>
   Cobra and Taylor Made declined to say how much they have
invested in the project, and officials at Callaway, which underwent
a management shake-up this week, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Cobra, it seems, carded a coup of sorts by hitting the market
first with its new line of Dista balls, which this week are being
shipped to retailers in some markets in Southern California and
Arizona. They will be introduced nationally at the golf industry's
big trade show in Orlando, Fla., in January.
</P>
<P>
   Cobra's ball comes in four models, including a women's version,
that all are geared to specific swing speeds. They will be marketed
to recreational golfers, not professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started with consumer research to identify some
opportunities in the golf-ball business where there might be a
gap,'' said Fren Haven, Cobra's project manager for the new ball.
``We saw a need for a distance golf ball that would have better
feel and fit a player's swing speed.''
</P>
<P>
   The balls will be priced in the high $30s to low $40s per dozen.
</P>
<P>
   Cobra partnered with the Acushnet Co., maker of the Titleist
ball, which has the biggest market share. Titleist is also used by
more professional players worldwide than any other ball.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, Cobra is not going to try to take market
share from Titleist.
</P>
<P>
   Haven said his company will target Spalding's brands, like the
Top Flite Strata ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view our business as one in which our job is to try and
help the recreational golfer . . . improve the way he plays and
enjoy the game at the end of the day,'' Haven said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor Made made a big capital bet on securing a share of this
lucrative market in July when it bought the industrial assets of
Hansberger Precision Golf, a Pontotoc, Miss.-based manufacturing
and testing facility that produced the Ram Tour Golf Ball.
</P>
<P>
   Terms were not disclosed, but the deal culminated a two-year
prototyping relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Colburn, Taylor Made's marketing manager for golf balls,
said the company is in the ``tweaking'' phase of development and
hopes to introduce its ball in time for next year's professional
golf season. But that will depend on when the plant is up and
running.
</P>
<P>
   The name and characteristics, though, are still a mystery,
though Colburn said some pros will use it on tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice market,'' he said of the ball business. ``People
keep having to replace their balls. We think we have a ball that
creates a consumer benefit they are not getting right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Milne, an analyst at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in San Francisco,
said the ball projects are important to all three companies,
especially Callaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be much more competitive in the ball market for
Callaway given their amount of capital investment,'' he said. ``And
if you are not first, you had better be coming in with something
that is different and innovative.''

MICROSOFT, AT&AMP;T RATED TOPS AMONG ONLINE PROVIDERS BY J.D. POWER

   LOS ANGELES -- AOL may be the biggest, but Microsoft Network is
the best national Internet service provider, according to a new
J.D. Power and Associates survey.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Power, best known for its annual ranking of automobiles
based on customer satisfaction questionnaires, has turned its
sights in recent years on other industries ranging from airlines to
telecommunications. Wednesday's study is the company's first
examining customer satisfaction in their ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   Based on responses from 5,234 households with Internet access,
the suburban Agoura Hills-based market research firm gave the nod
to Microsoft Network and AT&AMP;T's WorldNet for the No. 1 and No. 2
spots, respectively. Prodigy, Compuserve and America Online rounded
out the list of national providers. Together the companies
represent 52 percent of the online market, J.D. Power reported.
</P>
<P>
   Rankings were based on combined scores in five categories --
access, integrity of connection, value, additional services and
discounts, and technical support.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Power would not release actual scores for each Internet
company, but an AOL official said her company scored a 96, vs.
Microsoft's 106 points. And, not surprisingly, AOL quibbled with
its last-place ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have high customer satisfaction, and all this survey
says is that all five companies are pretty close,'' said Ann
Brackbill, a spokeswoman for the Dulles, Va.-based provider.

WHERE THE POLITICS IS NOT ACADEMIC 
AT ARTS AGENCY, PENTAGON DREAMS 
A BIT PART FOR GIULIANI
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAMES BARRON with Judith H. Dobrzynski   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marvin Kalb is moving back to Washington. Kalb was a
correspondent for CBS News and NBC News before he moved to
Cambridge, Mass., and a job with a mouthful of a title: director of
the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public
Policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   He will step down on July 1, he said Wednesday, and will take a
new job with a shorter title, as executive director of the center's
Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is an extraordinarily interesting place now to
explore the relationship of the presidency and the press,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Harvard, a search committee has been set up to find a
new executive director, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has decided that his replacement will be a
journalist, a decision Kalb called a ``great victory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're at a university and surrounded by faculty, and if the
director is a scholar as opposed to a practitioner, who then speaks
up for journalists?'' he said. ``I found that to be my special
responsibility, and I have enjoyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Arts Agency, Pentagon Dreams
</P>
<P>
   They had to strain to hear William J. Ivey, the soft-spoken new
chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, at a reception on
Tuesday organized by Randall Bourscheidt, the president of the
nonprofit Alliance for the Arts. But the arts administrators,
museum directors and authors liked what they managed to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been quoted as saying the NEA should be as important as
the Department of Defense,'' Ivey said. ``That budget would be
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the Pentagon's annual budget is $270 billion and
his agency's is $98 million.
</P>
<P>
   He told an audience that included Glenn D. Lowry, director of
the Museum of Modern Art, and Robert R. MacDonald, the director of
the Museum of the City of New York, that a budget request next year
of $150 million to $200 million ``would not be shocking.'' The next
budget, he said, would ``look different than any NEA budget of the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a dinner party given by Mary Sharpe Cronson, a trustee
of the New York State Council on the Arts, Ivey helped celebrate
the 52nd birthday of dancer Peter Martins. Kitty Carlisle Hart
stole the show: After everyone else had sung ``Happy Birthday'' off
key, she delivered a pitch-perfect solo rendition.
</P>
<P>
   A Bit Part For Giuliani
</P>
<P>
   ``What a good job you did of recreating my office,'' Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani said as he walked across the set of ``The Guiding
Light,'' the long-running soap opera. ``What do you want me to
do?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer was, stand in front of the make-believe desk and
officiate at a make-believe wedding.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor did not have to say much. The script called for three
or four lines, and they rolled by on a teleprompter just out of
camera range.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani officiated at the groom's fifth marriage and the
bride's third. The bride used to be married to the groom's brother,
who is now married to her sister (who is living happily off camera,
having been written out of the script).
</P>
<P>
   This was probably not news to the mayor. ``I told him about some
of the story lines,'' said his press secretary, Colleen Roche. She
videotapes the hourlong program every day and watches a week's
worth of episodes on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Will the new marriage last?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got the blessing of Giuliani, so it will,'' said Ms.
Roche. To which Renee Young, a CBS executive, added, ``At least
through sweeps week.''

CLINIC IN BUFFALO RESUMES ABORTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Canada)  (Eds: See also ABORTION-VESTS) 
(mk) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ This city's last remaining abortion clinic
resumed performing the procedure Wednesday morning, five days after
its primary doctor was killed by a sniper.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic's staff said they expected to be able to continue
their work through the rest of the week with the assistance of
doctors from around the country who have offered to fill in for Dr.
Barnett Slepian, who was slain at his home in Amherst, a Buffalo
suburb, on Friday night. The staff provided no further details,
citing security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been seeing patients today,'' said Melinda DuBois,
director for Buffalo Women's Gynecological Services, a clinic that
specializes in abortions in one of this city's poorer
neighborhoods. ``Abortions have been performed.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite rumors that anti-abortion protesters would attempt to
halt work at the clinic Wednesday, the authorities reported no
disturbances here. A handful of volunteers, men and women dressed
in bright yellow vests that identified them as ``patient escorts,''
spent much of the day accompanying women in and out of the
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to help,'' said Jim Heller, a construction worker
who arrived early in the morning to provide protection for the
clinic's staff and clients. ``If you feel strong about this issue,
you should be here to help. That is why I am here.''
</P>
<P>
   Local and federal law enforcement officials reported no progress
Wednesday in their search for the sniper, who fired at Slepian from
a wooded field outside the doctor's home.
</P>
<P>
   The National Abortion Federation, an organization that
represents 350 clinics, and American and Canadian Jewish groups
raised the possibility that anti-Semitism might have motivated the
sniper or snipers responsible for shooting five doctors in Canada
and the United States since 1994. Four of the five doctors, the
federation said, are Jewish, confirming a report in Wednesday's
Buffalo News.
</P>
<P>
   The four are Dr. Garson Romalis, who was wounded on Nov. 8,
1994; a doctor in the Rochester area whose identity has been
concealed and who sustained minor cuts on Oct. 28, 1997; Dr. John
Fainman, who was struck by a bullet in the right shoulder on Nov.
11, 1997, in Winnipeg, Canada, and Slepian, the only fatality. The
fifth victim, Dr. Hugh Short, who was hit in the right elbow on
Nov. 10, 1995, in Ancaster, Ontario, is not Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Britell, the federation's director of government
relations, said the possibility that the doctors' religion was more
than coincidence ``should be looked into,'' particularly because
some anti-abortion groups have equated abortions in America with
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that that is aimed at those physicians who happen to
be of Jewish descent,'' she said of the comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League,
said that while there was no evidence that the doctors were
attacked because they were Jewish _ there are a disproportionately
large number of Jewish doctors _ he was concerned about a strain of
anti-Semitism in one large anti-abortion group, Human Life
International.
</P>
<P>
   Foxman said that the group, which is based in Front Royal, Va.,
issued a 1993 report suggesting that Jews controlled the abortion
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Don Treshman, a spokesman for Human Life, acknowledged that the
group's founder, the Rev. Paul Marx, a Roman Catholic priest, had
made a statement several years ago that ``for some unknown reasons
a disproportionate number of abortionists are Jewish.'' But
Treshman said the statement was simply a ``startling observation''
and not anti-Semitic. He said his group condemned violence.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the clinic, a dark brown, brick building on Main Street
here, people continued to express frustration and loss. Karen
Jones, a 26-year-old mother of two, said Slepian's death was a huge
loss for the women in this poor end of town. But she said she was
glad to know that the clinic had resumed its work.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have been trying to shut the place down for
years,'' she said of anti-abortion protesters. ``But so long as
women need abortions, there will be abortions. Those can protest
all they want. It's not going to change things.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Clark, 27, expressed similar frustrations. She said women
would continue coming for abortions, as they have for many years,
despite the protests of anti-abortion groups that camp out here
almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women don't come here because they like having abortions,''
she said. ``They are here because they feel that they need to do
it. These people have no right to try and stop them. They should
just mind their own business.''

CARR, CROWE FIGHT TO MAKE THEIR POINT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Like a car with plugged fuel injectors, the Cal
State Northridge's men's basketball team was prone to stops, starts
and sputters. That's what happens when a team doesn't have a true
point guard.And, it's why the Matadors are expecting a dramatic
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Last season the Matadors had no point guard, just a guard
playing the point. This year they have Markus Carr and Jason Crowe,
both recruited as point guards. For two weeks they battled in
practice, and it will continue for a little more time.
</P>
<P>
   Carr, a 6-foot-1 redshirt freshman from Palmdale High, was
picked as the point guard last season until a knee injury wrecked
his year before it began. He's the favorite to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having Jason come in and compete with me every day is good
practice for me, and for him,'' Carr said.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe, a 6-4 transfer from American University, also spent last
year sitting on the sideline because of Division I transfer rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel, at this point, if I do what I'm supposed to do, I will
be the starter,'' Crowe said. ``Markus probably feels the same way.
He's a competitive kid who's not going to back down. We're very
competitive, but we have a good relationship off the court. We
chit-chat and hang out together.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Counting Crowe's eligibility: Braswell said CSUN will
petition the NCAA for another year of eligibility for Crowe. He's
listed as a junior but has only three semesters of eligibility
remaining, which must be used concurrently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to find out if there's a way he can get another
semester of eligibility,'' Braswell said. ``His clock runs out at
the end of the next semester. If that wasn't the case, I would hold
him out of (next fall) so he could play in January.''
</P>
<P>
   Braswell said the school is in the first stages of formulating
the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Before attending CSUN, Crowe attended Wayne State, then Los
Angeles Trade Technical College and American University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason's in the process of contacting the university where he
officially started because he actually dropped out of a couple
classes and he thought his enrollment was under full-time status.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Exhibition opener nears: Just two weeks after beginning
official practices, CSUN will get a better look at where it stands
with an exhibition game against the California All-Stars on Sunday
at 4 p.m.

BIG CITY COLUMN: NEED A RE-ELECTION ISSUE? JUST JAIL A TICKET
SCALPER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jerry Nahay always figured that he, like many of his
fellow ticket scalpers, might one day play a role in the
re-election campaign of a New York state attorney general. But it
never occurred to him that he could be the first to go to prison in
the process.
</P>
<P>
   Nahay, 41, spent more than a decade running a company on West
33rd Street called Tickets on Request. He and his wife, Janet
Rosenblatt, sold tickets to concerts, Broadway shows and sporting
events. They got in trouble for charging whatever the market would
bear, which makes them, depending on your viewpoint, either greedy
outlaws or capitalist martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most states, which permit consenting adults to buy
tickets the same way they buy anything else, New York forbids
brokers from charging more than 10 percent above a ticket's face
value. The law appalls many economists, who say the price controls
hurt consumers. But it appeals to New Yorkers who blame scalpers
for profiting from inflated prices. And since scalping is one of
the few crimes under the jurisdiction of the attorney general that
attracts press attention, it has long appealed to holders of that
office campaigning for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The last two attorneys general, Robert Abrams and G. Oliver
Koppell, issued a torrent of press releases heralding their
crusades against scalpers, and the current officeholder, Dennis
Vacco, has gone them one better. Besides fining Nahay and other
ticket brokers for the misdemeanor of overcharging, Vacco singled
out Nahay for the first felony prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general used a legal strategy that could be
described, depending on your viewpoint, either as creative or
Kafkaesque. He charged Nahay with a crime no one knew existed.
</P>
<P>
   The ``crime'' was failing to collect the state sales tax on the
surcharges that Nahay added to the tickets. This tax has never been
collected even by law-abiding brokers _ who limit mark-ups to 10
percent _ because the surcharge was considered a service charge
exempt from tax.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general, however, persuaded a judge to apply a
different standard to Nahay. Acting Justice Carol Berkman of State
Supreme Court ruled that a surcharge below 10 percent was exempt,
but a surcharge above that was taxable. Her opinion did not
elucidate how she came to this distinction, or how anyone else
could have been expected to divine it.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Nahay and his wife were convicted on two felony
counts of tax evasion, which carry a maximum sentence of four years
in prison. So far they are still at large _ the prosecution's
request that they be jailed immediately upon conviction was denied
_ while they await sentencing and proceed with appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Their conviction mystified state legislators, who have been
considering a bill to impose sales taxes on ticket surcharges.
Assemblyman Steven Sanders wrote in support of the Nahays.
``Frankly,'' he wrote, ``I was amazed to learn of their conviction
of an offense which has not yet been enacted into law.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general says his novel approach is necessary
because mere fines aren't enough to deter criminals like Nahay.
``The resounding verdict in this case,'' he said in a press release
announcing Nahay's conviction, ``signals our increasing success in
pursuing felony charges against ticket chiselers.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Vacco's crusade, Nahay now commutes from his
Upper East Side home to his company's new office in New Jersey,
where dozens of brokers have fled to escape New York's price
controls. Nahay's move to North Bergen, aside from making it more
convenient for New Jerseyans to buy tickets to Broadway shows and
Knicks games, has cost New York six jobs and the corporate taxes
that he formerly paid in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been happy to pay sales taxes in New York, too,
if anybody had told me to,'' Nahay said. ``I knew Vacco was looking
for ink, but I never imagined he'd invent a felony charge to throw
us in jail. In any other industry I'd be considered a good
businessman, but instead I get my life turned upside down by the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Nahay, who says the case has cost him $250,000, had been looking
forward to revenge next Tuesday: voting against Vacco. But this
week he gave that up. ``My lawyer just told me that I can't legally
vote,'' he said Wednesday. ``I'm now a convicted felon.''

MISSING PHONE EQUIPMENT MAY MEAN MILLIONS IN US WEST OVERCHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIANNE FLYNN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a federal audit of US West and other Baby Bells is
completed in a few weeks, it will show that telephone equipment is
missing. A lot of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   According to congressional regulators who have seen preliminary
audit results, the five regional Baby Bells have claimed that they
have $5 billion more in telephone equipment than investigators can
find.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how much of that $5 billion is US West's share,
but if it turns out to be even no more than one-fifth of the
federal estimates for all five companies, it could have a sizeable
impact on Arizona's telephone rates.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona sets utility prices by pegging the company's profit to a
fair rate of return on its investment. US West claims $30 billion
in investment, and if it is shown to be claiming $1 billion more
than it has invested, it could mean that Arizona customers had been
overcharged by millions of dollars for years.
</P>
<P>
   US West disputes the audit results that it has seen. Spokesman
Jim Roof says the methodology of the Federal Communications
Commission is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC investigated 33 switching offices, there are 225 in
Arizona, and determined that 18 percent of the items on the
company's equipment lists is missing, according to Roof.
</P>
<P>
   US West followed up the FCC audit with its own study, but found
that less than 2 percent of the items at more than 1,000 switching
stations didn't turn up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that's a pretty good margin of error,'' Roof said.
</P>
<P>
   US West also is concerned that the FCC hasn't been willing to
accept the additional data the phone company has offered, Roof
said.
</P>
<P>
   An FCC spokeswoman would not comment on the audit, saying it is
confidential until the full commission votes to make it public.
</P>
<P>
   The audit, expected by the end of this month, will be slightly
delayed, sources said. All sides, meanwhile, are anxiously awaiting
the results.
</P>
<P>
   Arizonans for Competition in Telephone Service, a US West
watchdog group of competing telephone firms, has been monitoring
its progress, spokesman Jon Poston said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be very concerned if a federal audit showed that any
telephone company serving Arizona was requiring its customers to
pay for non-existent equipment,'' Poston said. ``We don't know
whether that's true or not, but we'll be watching very carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are billions of dollars at stake for ratepayers,'' said
Gene Kimmelman, spokesman for the Consumers Union in Washington,
D.C. ``If there is equipment on the books that doesn't exist or
isn't being used to process phone calls, that needs to be
rectified.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is particularly ticklish for Arizonans now. US
West is scheduled to request an adjustment of rates by the end of
this year, although the company's not saying whether it will ask
for an increase in any portion of its prices. And because Arizona
is a state that determines prices by setting a fair rate of return,
or profit, on the total dollar amount of a utility company's
investment in providing telephone service, a federal challenge to
the company's investment claims could be disruptive to its rate
request.
</P>
<P>
   US West is allowed to earn 11.4 percent on its investment. If
that total investment amount were inflated by phantom equipment
costs, it would be earning more than the Arizona Corporation
Commission had authorized, all at the expense of its telephone
customers. &QL;

All those blenders, mixers, grinders and other appliances serve as

devices: spoons and spatulas, and salt and pepper shakers that look

called Dynamo, and red kale stands a good four feet over
grassy-green oak-leaf lettuce. By Ann Raver.

NEW JERSEY MOVES TO TAKE REINS OF TROUBLED HMO 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ In a move that highlighted regulatory questions
with health maintenance organizations, New Jersey officials have
moved to take over the operation of HIP Health Plan of New Jersey,
after it appeared to be sliding into insolvency and was
experiencing problems paying its health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   In taking the relatively drastic step to rescue the state's
fourth-largest HMO and to insure that its 194,000 clients would
continue to have health care coverage, Gov. Christie Whitman said
through a spokesman that it was also time for the state to explore
additional measures ``to create a safety net'' for health consumers
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   She said Wednesday that she would soon ask Legislative leaders
to look into the possibility of creating a ``guaranty fund'' for
insolvent health maintenance organizations, similar to funds that
handle claims against automobile and casualty insurers when they go
out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Winnie Comfort, a spokeswoman for the Department of Banking and
Insurance, which along with the state Department of Health and
Senior Services regulates HMOs, said that the move to take over HIP
was the first such move by the state under a year-old law
regulating the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Comfort said that state's concerns about HIP's operations
dated back many years but intensified in June when the quarterly
reports they are required to file showed them running a $9.5
million deficit.
</P>
<P>
   When the next quarter's reports showed the deficit growing to
$20 million, the state stepped in, she said. If approved by a judge
in Middlesex County, the county in which HIP's New Brunswick
headquarters is located, all contracts and assets will be frozen,
giving HIP time to reorganize.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest loser in the state's move to take over the
HMO is Pinnacle Health Enterprises, which last November purchased
HIP's 23 health centers, paid off much of its debt and, with state
approval, entered into a 20-year contract with the insurer to
exclusively provide all of the medical services for its members. In
exchange, Pinnacle was supposed to receive 91.5 percent of the
insurance premium revenue collected by HIP
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth H. Weixel, executive vice president of the PHP
Healthcare Corp., Pinnacle's parent company, said that PHP had
invested $140 million in the arrangement so far and stood to lose
all of it under the proposed takeover because the state was asking
a court to terminate the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at our legal remedies but we are going to fight
this,'' Weixel said.
</P>
<P>
   Pinnacle, which had revenues of $550 million last year, could be
required to continue to provide medical services for at least a
year under terms set by the state, and not by its contract with HIP
</P>
<P>
   Officials at HIP had no comment on the state move to takeover
their operations except to say that they were reviewing their
options.
</P>
<P>
   The state's action seems aimed at new organizations being
spawned by the growing managed care industry _ separate entities
that split medical care and provider recruitment from billing,
marketing and regulatory requirements. In the year since Pinnacle
started doing everything from providing doctors to paying hospitals
for HIP, state regulators have sought to monitor the company. But
under state law, direct authority is limited to the insurer, HIP,
not the health provider, Pinnacle.
</P>
<P>
   Jayne O'Connor, a spokesman for Whitman, said five states _
Alabama, Florida, Illinois, Vermont and West Virginia _ have
separate guaranty funds for HMOs. Nine other states, including New
York and Connecticut, require their health insurers to pool their
money in guaranty funds that cover all regulated insurers,
including casualty and property companies, in those states.

GENTLEMEN, START YOUR GRUMBLING

<TEXT>
<P>
   Now we know why they waited until late October to release the
first Bowl Championship Series poll: It gives college coaches only
half a season to complain about the results.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches would gratefully take a full season to question the
validity of the rankings, which determine which schools will play
in the Fiesta Bowl for the national championship on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   To no one's surprise, the first complaints came from Kansas
State coach and noted grumbler Bill Snyder. Snyder's Wildcats are
7-0 but fourth in the BCS rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the formula itself and I guess I just don't
understand what it's all about yet,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder was put off by the power ratings, which include
computerized formulas by the New York Times, USA Today and Seattle
Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Seattle Times? I mean, give me a break. Why is it the
Seattle Times as opposed to the Manhattan (Kan.) Mercury? What
makes the Seattle Times capable of selecting opponents for the
national championship?'' Snyder asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. It could be just out of ignorance on my part,
not knowing enough about it that makes it uncertain in my mind
whether it's good or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Snyder forgot to mention that if Kansas State had
played a tougher nonconference schedule, he wouldn't be wondering
why the Seattle Times plays a role in the BCS formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just confusing with all the different places that have a
role in the selection process, and I'm not sure if that's good, bad
or indifferent,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   At Ohio State, coach John Cooper seemed to think ignoring the
poll was the best route. Especially since the Buckeyes were
surprisingly ranked No.2 behind UCLA, although they remain No. 1 in
both top-25 polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have time to sit down and figure out all the rankings,
how they're determined and who's doing them,'' Ohio State coach
John Cooper said. ``I put more stock in the coaches poll and the AP
poll than I do anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody better tell Cooper that Ohio State could win the rest
of its games and conceivably finish out of the top two spots in the
BCS rankings.
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic that the Big Ten is seemingly hurt by the first BCS
poll. The conference sought the strength-of-schedule formula after
Penn State went 12-0 in 1994 and didn't win the national title.
</P>
<P>
   ```I don't believe in second-guessing. We knew it could
happen,'' Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany said. ``The odds were
small. You won't hear a complaint from me, I'll tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   __ All-Big-Ten Rose Bowl?: How does an Ohio State-Wisconsin Rose
Bowl sound this year?
</P>
<P>
   It's possible. If Wisconsin represents the Big Ten as champion,
and Ohio State should fall out of the top two spots in the BCS
rankings while UCLA stays there, the Rose Bowl conceivably could
pick Ohio State to replace the Pac-10 champs and have an All-Big
Ten matchup, as strange as that would be.
</P>
<P>
   If Ohio State and Wisconsin tie for the Big Ten title, the
Badgers go to Pasadena because they last reached the Rose Bowl in
1993. Ohio State represented the conference in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The teams do not play each other this season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bad timing: Imagine this. San Diego State ends a 12-year
drought and wins the WAC but then is denied an invitation to the
Holiday Bowl in its own backyard because of that game's new
selection procedure.
</P>
<P>
   It will match the Pac-10 Conference No. 2 with the highest
ranking of two choices _ the Big 12 No. 3 or the WAC champion. San
Diego State hasn't even received top-25 consideration while the Big
12 has had five or six teams ranked for most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ground attack: Check out the nation's top three rushing
offense leaders: 1. Air Force. 2. Navy. 3. Army.
</P>
<P>
   __ Two to go: Oklahoma's John Blake probably sealed his fate
with the Sooners' 41-26 loss at Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   It's only the seventh time in history the Sooners have lost to
Oklahoma State and Texas in the same season. The last three
Oklahoma coaches with 0-for-OSU-and-Texas seasons: Snorter Luster
(1944-45), Gomer Jones (1965) and John Blake (1997-98).
</P>
<P>
   Clemson coach Tommy West will probably join Blake out the door,
especially after the Tigers lost to Duke 28-23, assuring Clemson
(2-6) of a losing season.
</P>
<P>
   West is now 34-33 at Clemson, with a 21-17 mark in the ACC. This
will be the second losing season in five years for the Tigers, who
must win their remaining three games in order to avoid their worst
record in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   One coach who might survive _ believe it or not _ is Hawaii's
Fred vonAppen, 0-7 this season and 5-26 in two years on the island
of Oahu. Apparently he has job security because he was hired by his
old Linfield College teammate, Rainbows athletic director Hugh
Yoshida. And it was Yoshida who, 11 months ago, pushed through a
two-year contract extension for vonAppen, through 2000.
</P>
<P>
   __ Wise move: West Virginia lineman Jeremy Sherman probably made
the prudent decision when he selected the Mountaineers over his
second choice, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman is the great-great grandson of famed Union general
William Tecumseh Sherman, who is a reviled figure in the South, and
especially Georgia.

A DANCER'S HESITANT PAS DE DEUX WITH CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (mk) 
 By MIRTA OJITO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After 24 years with the New York City Ballet, the
last 14 as a principal dancer, Lourdes Lopez knows how to move her
lithe body gracefully. She understands harmony and movement, pacing
and breathing. Yet here she is, painfully stretching her calves,
puffing like a novice, sweat beads dampening her taut chest.
</P>
<P>
   One year into retirement, at 40, Ms. Lopez says her body is out
of shape. But these days, even if she can tame the body and still
arch her back just so, it is her mind that is playing tricks.
</P>
<P>
   For, no matter how hard she tries, she cannot get one thought
out of her mind: In less than a week she will be dancing in Cuba,
the country of her birth and of her adult obsessions. It is also
the country her parents fled in 1959, fearing for their lives. Ms.
Lopez's father had been a captain in the army led by Fulgencio
Batista, the dictator whom Fidel Castro and his bearded rebels
deposed in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lopez, who left Cuba in her mother's arms as a 10-month-old
baby, returned to Cuba for the first time in December as a cultural
reporter for WNBC-TV, Channel 4, for which she has been freelancing
since she left the ballet company. During that visit, she
interviewed Alicia Alonso, the grande dame of Cuban ballet whom Ms.
Lopez had long admired from afar.
</P>
<P>
   After the interview, Ms. Alonso asked her to return to Cuba to
perform during Havana's International Festival of Ballet, set to
begin next week. Ms. Lopez, who in the past had toyed with the idea
of dancing in Cuba but had always decided against it, quickly said
yes. She picked a ballet that she had always liked and that would
be easy on her knees and began rehearsing at Ballet Academy East, a
school on the Upper East Side where she also teaches.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, she says, she is training for the most important
role of her life; not as a dancer, but as a Cuban exile who, she
explains, wants to use her art to help build a bridge between her
two worlds, Cuba and the United States, and between her two
sentimental homes, the Cuba of her imagination and the country Cuba
has truly become.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want them to think of me as a dancer,'' she said,
admitting to insecurity about her audience's reaction. ``If I
wanted that I would have gone seven years ago when I could jump and
leap. Now, I want them to see me as a Cuban with a purpose. If I
were a doctor, I'd go and do surgery. But dancing is what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lopez says she felt a need to contribute in some way the day
she arrived in Havana a year ago. ``For the first time,'' she said,
``I felt I belonged somewhere. Before that trip, the dance
community was my only home. But when I got to Cuba, I said: `This
is it. This is home.' I cried every night in my hotel room. People
said it was stress, but I knew better. I can't tell you what
happened, but it changed my life.''

   Yet, Ms. Lopez says, she also realized she could not live in
Cuba. A divorced mother of an 8-year-old girl who lives in
Brooklyn, Ms. Lopez says she cannot imagine living with so many
scarcities and restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   She decided to accept Ms. Alonso's invitation now because she no
longer has anything to lose or to prove, she says. In the past, she
had always discarded the idea because she feared that it would
offend her parents and hurt her career. Some artists who have
performed in Cuba have been harshly criticized by exiles who do not
condone travel to the island while Castro is in power.

<P>
   ``Why can't I at least try to go around it and deal with the
people directly and help them in whatever small ways I can?'' she
asks. ``People like me are the only ones who can do it. We are the
last generation that deeply cares about Cuba and has the means to
actually do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The depth of Ms. Lopez's feelings for Cuba is unusual for a
woman who has lived nearly her entire life outside the island. She
grew up in Miami, where she began studying ballet at 5 because she
had flat feet and her doctor recommended exercise. Her problem was
corrected, but Ms. Lopez, who by then was in love with ballet, kept
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she was 14, Ms. Lopez had moved to New York with an
older sister to pursue her dancing career. Shortly after her 16th
birthday, she began dancing for New York City Ballet, where she
stayed until June of last year. Critics called her a dancer with
flair and intensity.
</P>
<P>
   For her trip to Cuba, she chose ``Pavane for a Dead Princess,''
a ballet created by George Balanchine for Patricia McBride, a
former colleague who has allowed Ms. Lopez to use it. Throughout
the piece, Ms. Lopez fingers a long scarf that sometimes hides her
face, seemingly in tears, as she raises her hands, imploring. Free
of the scarf for part of the performance, she soars, only to end as
she began, her head covered, her hands concealing tears.
</P>
<P>
   After rehearsal one day, Ms. Lopez was asked why she had picked
that ballet. She said that she had always liked it and it seemed
appropriate for this stage in her career. But a few days later Ms.
Lopez called to say that, as she rode in the subway on her way home
one night, the real reason why she had picked the piece all of a
sudden leapt into her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how it begins, a solitary figure center stage,
wrapped in a long veil?'' she asks. ``Well, it occurred to me that,
oddly enough, this ballet is like Cuba. Like Cuba, I'm raising my
hands to whatever, government or God, and I'm imploring. I'm
saying: `Do something. I'm isolated. I'm by myself, buried down
here.' But no one comes, and, in the end, I'm back under the wraps,
crying.''
