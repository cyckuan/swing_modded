Cargo ship blasts off for Mir; carries supplies and giant space
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A supply ship blasted off Sunday on a mission to
bring tons of cargo to the Mir space station. Among the items: a
giant space mirror designed to illuminate sun-starved northern
cities.
	   The Progress cargo ship was launched from the Baikonur
cosmodrome in Kazakstan at 7:14 a.m. Moscow time. The launch had
been delayed for 10 days until the cash-strapped Russian government
could afford it.
	   The Progress is scheduled to dock with the Mir on Tuesday
morning, bringing fuel, food, water, New Year's gifts and the
experimental space mirror.
	   It also will bring several kits of scientific equipment,
including a Russian-French device to be installed on Mir's exterior
by cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev in a Nov. 11
spacewalk.
	   The device is designed to collect data about meteorites when Mir
flies through a meteorite cloud in mid-November.
	   The space mirror, called the Znamya, or Banner, is expected to
be unfurled in February, when Progress is jettisoned from Mir.
	   The mirror, about 100 feet in diameter, is a membrane covered
with a metal layer that, in theory, should reflect sunlight onto
some of the chilly reaches of Russia during the long nights.
	   However, officials say the Znamya would only be visible in good
weather and to those who knew its precise position. They said it
would resemble a shooting star, not a large object such as the
moon.
	   It is expected to serve as an experimental prototype for larger
mirrors that might be sent up in the future.
	   The Progress launch, originally scheduled for Oct. 15, was
postponed because of funding problems that prevented the space
agency from buying the booster rocket, Soyuz-U, from its
manufacturer.

Volcano erupts in northern Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS date of last eruption; UPDATES with height of smoke
cloud, history of eruptions

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A volcano erupted in northern Japan on Sunday,
sending a column of smoke 1,200 meters (3,960 feet) into the sky,
the Japan Meteorological Agency said. No injuries or damage were
reported.
	   The 1,131-meter (3,732-foot) high Mount Komagatake erupted at
9:12 a.m. (0012 GMT), the agency said.
	   Four small volcanic tremors were recorded after the eruption and
the meteorological agency urged caution for those living near the
mountain.
	   National broadcaster NHK showed footage of a 700-meter-high
(2,310-feet-high) cloud of white smoke spewing from the volcano two
hours after the eruption. A light coating of volcanic ash covered
cars in the town of Shikabe, 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the
mountain.
	   The volcano last erupted in March 1996 without causing any
damage.
	   A major eruption in 1929 killed two people and an eruption in
1856 killed 20. Records also show that 700 people were killed in an
eruption in 1640, NHK said.
	   Mount Komagatake is 715 kilometers (447 miles) northeast of
Tokyo on Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island.

Garcia rallies to keep IBF junior lightweight title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN CURRAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ Bloodied but unbowed, unbeaten
IBF junior lightweight champion Roberto Garcia rallied to stop
Ramon Ledon in the fifth round Saturday to retain his title.
	   Ledon knocked down Garcia in the second and opened up a cut on
his head with an accidental head butt. He cut Garcia over the right
eye later, too.
	   But midway through the third round, Garcia (31-0) connected on a
solid right to Ledon's face, staggering him momentarily. From
there, he seemed to take over. He backed up Ledon and began tagging
him with right hands.
	   In the fourth, he landed another hard right to the head just
after a low blow by Ledon, prompting referee Eddie Cotton to step
in and warn Ledon. Garcia then knocked Ledon's mouthpiece to the
canvas, and Ledon himself moments after that with a right and a
left.
	   Garcia, 23, of Oxnard, Calif., stormed out of his corner for the
fifth and put Ledon away quickly. A left uppercut to the chin
momentarily froze Ledon where he stood, and Garcia delivered at
least six uncontested shots to put him down.
	   He got up, but not for long. Garcia unleashed a flurry of
punches after they resumed, finally knocking Ledon backwards and
onto the canvas 58 seconds into the fifth round of the scheduled
12-rounder.
	   ``I've been down, but it doesn't scare me,'' Garcia said. ``I
knew I was in good shape.''
	   It was the first loss for Ledon (12-1-1).
	   The fight was on the undercard of the David Reid-James Coker
junior middleweight fight Saturday at Trump Taj Mahal Casino
Resort.

Chinese activist applies to set up group seeking war compensation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Testing the limits of the Chinese government's
willingness to abide by a U.N. human rights treaty it signed this
month, an activist in the southern province of Fujian has applied
to form a group to seek war reparations from Japan, a rights group
reported Sunday.
	   Luo Jin, 40, applied on Thursday as required by law for
permission to form a Chinese Federation for Japanese Reparations,
but received no immediate reply, a dissident monitoring group in
Hong Kong reported.
	   A key U.N. rights treaty that China signed but has not yet
ratified includes a provision that calls for freedom of
association.
	   Luo was applying in accord with the treaty in an effort to
create a group to help people throughout the country seek redress,
the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in
China reported.
	   Emboldened by the government's willingness to sign the
International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights, other
activists have tried to register an opposition party called the
China Democracy Party. Police have detained at least 20 of them,
and authorities have turned down all applications.
	   The Chinese government relinquished claims to compensation from
Japan when it established diplomatic relations in 1972, but has not
officially prohibited individual victims of wartime atrocities from
seeking redress.
	   At the same time, the government has tried to restrain activists
leading campaigns for reparations. Beijing does not want to harm
its trade and diplomatic relations with Japan, and also fears
public criticism for failing to stand up to Tokyo.
	   Much of China suffered under Japan's 1931-45 occupation, and
millions of Chinese were killed.

Human rights group demands Mahathir resign after riots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS. EDITS throughout. Incorporates Malaysia-Protest
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A leading Malaysian human rights
group Sunday demanded Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's resignation
after police clashes with anti-government rioters erupted into
chaos.
	   An anti-government protest that lasted until after midnight
Saturday became a riot when hundreds of police fired water laced
with stinging pepper spray at thousands of demonstrators and
bombarded a mosque with tear gas.
	   More than 241 people were arrested in the rally that sprawled
through various parts of the capital for more than eight hours.
Injuries resulted on both sides, local newspapers reported.
	   ``The Prime Minister, who is also Home Minister, must accept
full responsibility for having totally mishandled the situation,''
said a statement issued by Suaram, a leading human rights group.
	   Mahathir, who has ruled for 17 years, is also charged with
running the police force.
	   ``He cannot ignore the legitimate discontent of the people. We
call upon the prime minister to resign so that a general election
may be held,'' the statement added.
	   Demonstrators have carried out a series of protests since ousted
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim was jailed last month.
Protesters demand political reforms, the end to Mahathir's rule and
Anwar's release.
	   Saturday's demonstration, however, marked a defiant turning
point as protesters turned violent against police, who have
declared all demonstrations in support of Anwar illegal.
	   The former heir apparent to Mahathir has pleaded innocent to
charges of graft and sexual misconduct and will stand trial
beginning Nov. 2.
	   The government has threatened to arrest demonstrators under the
country's dreaded Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite
detainment without trial.
	   At the afternoon demonstration on Saturday, protesters taunted
police in a downtown shopping district. Officers warned women and
children to get off the streets, which were packed with weekend
shoppers, then huge police trucks sprayed the crowd with powerful
jets of water laced with a pepper chemical.
	   It filled the streets with a blue foam and scattered thousands
of people, crying and coughing from the stinging chemical.
	   Police in civilian clothes, some wearing ski masks, chased
people through department stores and down side streets, grabbing
them and tossing them into waiting vans. Some were slapped, kicked
and wrestled to the ground.
	   Police dragged one middle-aged woman from a department store
after she shouted that they were cruel. A policewoman carried the
woman's eggs and vegetables while police pulled her into the
street. Her husband called out, ``Are you trying to kill my wife?''
	   Some of those detained Saturday were holding shopping bags and
it was unclear whether they were passers-by or had intended to join
the demonstration.
	   ``It's inhumane. We were here to collect curtain fabric,'' said
one woman who was afraid to give her name, her young daughter
clutching her arm and rubbing her stinging eyes.
	   Police followed protesters to a mosque where they had gathered
for evening prayers and to regroup. Police lobbed tear gas into the
building and protesters responded by chasing officers and pelting
them with stones. Others hurled bricks.
	   Rioters set fire to a pile of tires and debris dragged from
roadside garbage bins, creating a bonfire in the middle of one
street, the Star newspaper reported.
	   An Anwar supporter who asked not to be identified said the
afternoon protest turned ugly when police began arresting people at
random.
	   ``It's sheer frustration,'' he said.
	   Some 400 riot police surrounded the capital's Freedom Square to
ward off any gathering there.
	   Anwar has been denied bail and will begin trial on Nov. 2 on 10
counts of corruption and illegal homosexual acts. He has condemned
the charges as false and politically motivated.

Autissier takes the lead in the Around Alone sailing race

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Hauling in her sails and cutting east, Isabelle
Autissier of France surprised her competitors and snatched the lead
in the first leg of the Around Alone solo sailing race.
	   Autissier slipped past French compatriot Marc Thiercelin early
Saturday as other racers waffled over whether to keep heading south
along the Brazilian coast or shift east toward their destination of
Cape Town, South Africa.
	   Thiercelin put up a fight, however, and by late Saturday he had
cut Autissier's 20-mile (32-kilometer) lead to only three miles
(five kilometers).
	   ``It feels great to see my little boat's name at the top of the
list again,'' Autissier reported, seriously understating the power
of her sleek, 60-foot (18-meters) racing machine, ``PRB.''
	   She also cheered the return of steady, strong winds after weeks
skirting the doldrums of the Atlantic Ocean.
	   The 42-year-old Autissier, the only woman in the 13-boat fleet,
had fallen back earlier after running into rigging problems.
	   Mike Golding of Britain was third in the Class I _ for boats up
to 60 feet (18 meters) _ sailing 97 miles (156 kilometers) behind
Autissier.
	   The lead also changed Saturday in Class II, for boats up to 50
feet (15 meters), as Jean-Pierre Mouligne of France passed Brad Van
Liew of Santa Monica, California, and left him 33 miles (53
kilometers) behind. Mike Garside of Britain was third, 254 miles
(408 kilometers) back.
	   ``This will be a close boat race until the finish, based on the
abnormal and tricky weather to the south,'' Van Liew said in a
dispatch.
	   The fleet left Charleston, South Carolina, on Sept. 27 and the
leaders are on a pace to reach their first port of Cape Town around
Nov. 6-7.
	   The 27,000-mile (43,450-kilometer), four-leg journey is held
once every four years.

Singapore PM Goh: painful wage cuts are inevitable
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said Singaporeans
must brace themselves for harder times ahead, including inevitable
wage cuts, as the economy sinks further towards recession, reported
The Sunday Times.
	   ``I'm afraid we will have to do the necessary but painful
thing... I'm afraid we have to decide on cutting...your wages,''
Goh was quoted as saying at a community event on Saturday.
	   He said salary reductions and other business cost-cutting
measures were preferable to higher unemployment. He also urged
workers who might lose their jobs to prepare for retraining and
lower paying work.
	   Unemployment has already risen, and may grow to between 4 and 5
percent by year's end, roughly double the 2.3 percent figure in
June, according to recent statements by Manpower Minister Lee Boon
Yang.
	   In addition to pay cuts, Goh indicated that a long-expected cut
in contributions to Singapore's mandatory state-run pension fund
was also imminent.
	   Employees allocate 20 percent of their salary to this fund,
which is widely relied upon even before retirement for investments,
schooling costs, and mortgages, while employers match their
contribution with an additional 20 percent.
	   The Singapore National Employers Federation, a private
organization representing businesses in the city-state, want the
contribution slashed in half, reported the newspaper.
	   Stung by the economic crisis and facing its first recession
since the mid-80s, Singapore has been concentrating its efforts to
combat the slowdown on reducing business costs and regaining
competitiveness it has lost to its neighbors.
	   Prime Minister Goh also said Saturday that ministers, top civil
servants and corporate chiefs must take the lead in taking salary
cuts.
	   ``When they set the example, we hope others will accept the wage
reductions quite calmly, as a necessary way for us to overcome the
crisis, and to be competitive when the crisis is over,'' he was
quoted as saying.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Mike Richter stopped 35 shots, and the New
York Rangers held Eric Lindros without a goal for the first time in
five games in a 2-2 tie with the Philadelphia Flyers on Saturday.
	   Richter preserved the tie during a flurry of shots late in the
third period, and turned aside four good chances in overtime _
including two hard shots by John LeClair.
	   New York is unbeaten in four games after starting the season
0-4. But the Rangers squandered a 2-0 lead and managed only 13
shots against former teammate John Vanbiesbrouck.
	   The Rangers took a 2-0 lead on goals by John MacLean and Adam
Graves despite taking only 10 shots through two periods. LeClair
scored at 5:34 of the third, and Rod Brind'Amour tied it with a
power-play goal at 9:03.
 &UR; Maple Leafs 6, Penguins 4 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Mats Sundin had a goal and three assists as
resurgent Toronto beat Pittsburgh to improve to 5-1-1.
	   The Swedish star, who scored his fourth goal of the season on a
power play at 1:40 of the first period, has 17 goals and 18 assists
in 21 career games against the Penguins. The Maple Leafs are 2-0-1
in their last three games, including a 5-3 victory Friday night at
Detroit.
	   Derek King, Fredrik Modin, Tomas Kaberle, Igor Korolev and Kris
King also scored for Toronto. Martin Straka had two goals for
Pittsburgh, and Stu Barnes and Bobby Dollas added goals.
 &UR; Red Wings 3, Canadiens 0 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, Steve Yzerman's first goal of the season broke a
scoreless tie in the third period as Detroit beat Montreal.
	   Yzerman connected on a power play with 6:41 left. Larry Murphy
and Martin Lapointe also scored for the Red Wings. Chris Osgood
made 18 saves for his second shutout of the season.
 &UR; Devils 3, Bruins 1 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Chris Terreri, making his first
start since returning to New Jersey, made 20 saves in the Devils'
victory over Boston.
	   Terreri, reacquired from Chicago over the summer, made his first
start for New Jersey since Nov. 11, 1995.
	   Jay Pandolfo scored the game-winner midway through the second
period and Petr Sykora and Dave Andreychuk also scored for the
Devils. Sergei Samsonov scored for the Bruins.
 &UR; Hurricanes 3, Senators 1 &QC; 
	   In Kanata, Ontario, Ray Sheppard and Sami Kapanen scored on
Carolina's first two shots and Arturs Irbe made 27 saves for the
Hurricanes.
	   Keith Primeau added a power-play goal late in the first period
to help the Hurricanes (2-1-3) run their unbeaten string to four
games.
	   Vaclav Prospal had a second-period power-play goal for Ottawa.
 &UR; Islanders 5, Sabres 4 &QC; 
	   In Uniondale, New York, Claude Lapointe scored his second goal
of the game with 40.2 seconds left as New York beat Buffalo.
	   New York also got goals from Gino Odjick, Jason Dawe and Bryan
Smolinski. Tommy Salo, playing in his seventh straight game,
stopped 32 shots.
	   Buffalo rallied from a 4-0 deficit on goals by Curtis Brown,
Wayne Primeau, Dixon Ward and Brian Holzinger.
 &UR; Panthers 2, Capitals 2 &QC; 
	   In Washington, Calle Johansson scored at 6:21 of the third
period to give Washington a tie with Florida.
	   Florida's Jaroslav Spacek opened the scoring with his first
career goal, connecting on a power play in the first period. Joe
Juneau tied it late in the second, and Viktor Kozlov gave Florida a
2-1 lead early in the third.
 &UR; Blackhawks 5, Predators 4 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Tony Amonte scored two goals and Chad Kilger added
the game-winner in a 2:41 span late in the third period as Chicago
rallied to beat expansion Nashville.
	   Amonte, who has six goals, opened the flurry with 4:50 remaining
and tied it at 4 with 3:09 to go. Kilger put Chicago ahead with
2:09 left. Kilger also scored in the second period, and Christian
Laflamme had Chicago's other goal.
	   Scott Walker, Patrik Kjellberg, Sergei Krivokrasov and Blair
Atcheynum scored for the Predators.
 &UR; Stars 2, Sharks 1 &QC; 
	   In Dallas, Pat Verbeek and Jamie Langenbrunner scored power-play
goals and Dallas neutralized physical San Jose defenseman Bryan
Marchment.
	   Dallas improved to 5-0 at home and 5-1-1 overall behind a power

Nieuwendyk, Mike Modano and Greg Adams _ out of action for long
stretches.
	   Marco Sturm scored for the Sharks.
 &UR; Blues 4, Flames 3 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, Al MacInnis scored with 1.4 seconds to go as St.
Louis overcame a third-period lapse to beat Calgary.
	   The defenseman faked a slap shot and beat Ken Wreggett on a
change-of-pace effort. He leads the Blues with four goals in six
games. Calgary's Theoren Fleury and Valeri Bure scored in a span of
1:26 midway through the period to tie it.
	   St. Louis defenseman Chris Pronger had two goals, and Pavol
Demitra also scored for the Blues. Cale Hulse added a goal for
Calgary.
 &UR; Avalanche 6, Oilers 4 &QC; 
	   In Denver, Claude Lemieux scored his 300th and 301st career
goals and Bob Hartley earned his first NHL coaching victory as

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Cuban President Fidel Castro told top editors of
American newspapers on Saturday that he still distrusts U.S.
journalists and is not ready to let them open permanent bureaus on
the island.
	   ``Once they are established it is hard to remove them,'' Castro
told the top leadership of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors during a far-ranging meeting that lasted more than six
hours.
	   Granting permission for a bureau ``is a matter of confidence to
be built step by step,'' the editors quoted him as saying. ``We
have had a lot of experience with (American) journalists who are
biased.''
	   Nevertheless, Edward L. Seaton, ASNE president and editor of The
Manhattan (Kan.) Mercury, said he thought Castro listened to the
group's arguments for letting American journalists open offices in
the country. Currently, Cuba grants U.S. reporters work visas for a
week or two.
	   ``I think we got across quite well our message: that they need
to have print journalists from the United States in Cuba,'' said
Seaton. The ASNE has 870 members from newspapers across the United
States.
	   Currently, the only U.S. news organization that has Cuban
government approval to operate a permanent office in the country is
Cable News Network. CNN opened its Havana bureau, headed by
correspondent Lucia Newman, in March 1997.
	   The network is the first American news organization to operate a
bureau in the country since The Associated Press was expelled in
1969.
	   The 32-member ASNE delegation, made up of the board of directors
and other top leaders, arrived in Cuba on Wednesday and was
returning to the United States early Sunday.
	   During their four-day visit, the editors met with top government
leaders, including Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, Vice President
Carlos Lage and Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's parliament.
	   They also toured Havana and Matanzas province to the east, and
met with church leaders as well as opposition leaders.
	   Dressed in his traditional olive green fatigues, Castro also
spent about an hour talking specifically with two executives from
the Miami Herald: Douglas C. Clifton, executive editor and senior
vice president, and David Lawrence Jr., chairman of the Miami
Herald Publishing Co.
	   Castro criticized the newspaper's story about him based on the
statements of a Cuban woman living in Costa Rica who claimed that
he had been near death last year. The woman later turned out to be
a fraud.
	   But he praised the newspaper's coverage of a series of bombings
at Havana hotels and other tourist spots last year, especially its
investigative work in identifying a Salvadoran man who later was
arrested in the attacks.
	   In other comments, he criticized major league baseball
recruiters for ``stealing'' some of Cuba's best players and
maintained that Cuba had a lot better players than Orlando and
Livan Hernandez, half-brothers who defected and went on to play in
World Series. Orlando Hernandez plays for the New York Yankees and
Livian Hernandez for the Florida Marlins.
	   As for whether he ever would retire, he told the editors: ``I
have a moral obligation'' to continue as Cuba's leader, especially
during the country's current economic crisis.
	   The Castro government invited the ASNE to visit Cuba after top
leaders expressed interest in getting to know the country better.
The board also has visited Mexico, Russia, China and South Africa.
	   Castro's relationship with the ASNE dates back to shortly after
he took power in 1959. That year, the society invited him to speak
at a convention it held in Washington.

Jamaica prepares for Hurricane Mitch
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CAROLL ORR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaicans bought up canned food and
stacked sandbags, preparing Saturday for Hurricane Mitch as it
picked up strength on its slow trek over open waters in the western
Caribbean.
	   At 0300 GMT, Mitch was 190 miles (305 kilometers)
south-southwest of Kingston, heading north-northwest at 5 mph (8
kph). The National Hurricane Center in Miami said sustained winds
were at 120 mph (193 kph).
	   A hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, according to the
hurricane center. Because the storm was moving over warm water, it
likely would intensify, said meteorologist Andrew Shashay.
	   Eventually, Mitch was expected to veer northwest, but it
appeared the turn would come too late to spare Jamaica entirely.
Still, the hurricane's track could be far enough west to prevent
the strongest winds, those around the eye of the storm, from
crossing the island.
	   James Lewisfree of the hurricane center said high tides and
heavy rain could lead to flash floods and mudslides in Jamaica.
	   In Negril, on the western tip of the island where the
hurricane's impact was likely to be strongest, residents and
tourists stocked up on canned food, water, flashlights, batteries,
candles and other necessities.
	   At the Poinciana Beach Resort, sandbags were in place and the
ground floor was left empty in case a storm surge flooded the
hotel.
	   ``Experience has taught us well, so we don't take any chances,''
hotel manager Clive Miller said. ``If we're going to err, we err on
the side of too much caution.''
	   The Jamaica Defense Force was placed on alert and thousands of
schools and community centers were opened as shelters. Air Jamaica
on Saturday announced the cancellation of several Sunday flights.
	   Once past Jamaica, forecasters expected the hurricane to
threaten the Cayman Islands and Cuba. A hurricane watch was in
effect Saturday evening for eastern Cuba, from Camaguey to
Guantanamo.
	   Mitch formed a little more than a month after Hurricane Georges
cut through the Caribbean, killing more than 500 people before
drenching the Florida Keys and the Gulf Coast.

Typhoon Babs heads toward south China, flooding Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: PRECEDES Hong Kong, UPDATES throughout with damage in Taiwan,
and death toll in the Philippines.

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) - Typhoon Babs brought torrential rains and
caused landslides in Taiwan Sunday as the storm churned toward
south China after killing 139 people in the Philippines and leaving
hundreds of thousands homeless.
	   The Central Weather Bureau said at 11 a.m. (0300 GMT), the
typhoon was centered 150 kilometers (90 miles) south of Pratas
Island in the South China Sea. Packing sustained winds of 130
kilometers per hour (81 miles per hour), Babs was moving northwest
at nine kilometers (5.4 miles) per hour toward the south China.
	   Its outer fringes brought torrential rains to the whole island
of Taiwan, with eastern Hualien recording 500 millimeters (20
inches) of rain in a 24-hour period, weathermen said. Authorities
urged residents to evacuate their homes near flooded rivers.
	   In Taipei, the main Keelung River has swelled its banks, and one
third of Hsichih town was flooded in waste-high water, officials
said.
	   In eastern Ilan, a man was swept into the sea when fishing in
the rough waters. Nine people were injured when their van was hit
by rockslides in eastern Taitung, police said.
	   Several domestic airports were closed, and landslides had halted
traffic and trapped hundreds of people in mountains in central
Taiwan, they said.
	   In Hong Kong, authorities hoisted the No. 3 typhoon signal, a
warning to residents to take precautions as winds were expected to
intensify later in the day.
	   The government said it has opened up several shelters for those
seeking refuge from the storm and that more will be opened if
needed.
	   Red flags were raised at Hong Kong beaches to warn swimmers not
to enter the water because of rough seas. Fishing boats sought
shelter in the harbor.
	   In the Philippines, President Joseph Estrada has declared four
provinces and a city in the worst hit area on the southern tip of
Luzon under a state of calamity. Officials in calamity zones will
be able to use emergency funds and freeze prices of commodities
with little red tape.
	   Of the 139 deaths reported so far in the Philippines, 67 were
attributed to landslides on Catanduanes island where Babs first
landed on Thursday, the Office of Civil Defense said.
	   The worst landslides were in San Miguel, a coconut and
abaca-producing town along the Bato River, as residents attempted
to escape rapidly rising flood waters by climbing hills behind the
village.
	   Local officials said entire families died in the town, where
virtually every house was damaged. Residents began burying their
dead in two mass graves Saturday.
	   At least 37 other people were electrocuted or died in landslides
in nearby Camarines Sur province and another 102 people were
injured by flying debris in Sorsogon province, both located in the
impoverished Bicol region along the Philippines' eastern coast.
	   Nearly 400,000 people were forced out of their homes, disaster
relief officials said. Tens of thousands of others were stranded as
ports were shut and ships forbidden to sail.
	   Merly Lucas of the National Disaster Coordinating Council said
local authorities intensified relief work as weather cleared on
Sunday. Two air force C-130 cargo planes were flying food and
medicine to Bicol, she said.
	   Philippine weather forecasters said Sunday they were monitoring
a low pressure area over the Pacific, about 900 kilometers (558
miles) east of the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, that
could strengthen into a storm in two to three days.
	   If it develops into a storm, it would potentially hit the same
provinces ravaged by Babs, weather forecaster Ludy Alviar said.
	   Babs was the second devastating storm to hit the Philippines
this month. Two weeks ago, Super Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74
people in the northern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.

Jewish settlers block West Bank roads to protest Wye accord

<TEXT>
	   OFRA, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli settlers, angry over their
government's agreement to turn over parts of the West Bank to
Palestinians, blocked roads across the West Bank Sunday.
	   About 50 Israelis rushed past Israeli police and sat
cross-legged on the highway next to this settlement north of
Jerusalem, blocking traffic.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was flying home from
Washington as Jewish settlers, once his staunch supporters, took to
the streets to express their rejection of his agreement with their
Palestinian neighbors.
	   Israel's main opposition party, Labor, is gearing up for early
general elections, party leaders told Israel radio. They estimated
that elections would take place in four months. Netanyahu's term is
to expire in mid-2000.
	   Israeli politicians from most parties predicted political
turmoil in the wake of the signing of the agreement. ``This
government probably won't survive,'' said David Levy, who quit his
post as Netanyahu's foreign minister in January.
	   Twelve of Netanyahu's supporters in the parliament say they will
vote against him in upcoming no-confidence motions. Netanyahu has
only a one-seat majority. The moderate opposition Labor party,
which originated the peace process with the Palestinians, pledges
to back the accord in parliament and refrain from voting no
confidence in Netanyahu's government for two weeks.
	   ``I'm here to show that this is a sad day,'' said Natan El, 38,
an engineer, sitting in the middle of the main north-south highway
through the West Bank. ``We are in danger of losing our land, the
land we have returned to after 2000 years.'' Then police dragged
the settlers off the road, arresting seven.
	   There were similar demonstrations throughout the West Bank.
Police, with orders to keep the roads open, arrested 31 protesters,
according to Aharon Domb, head of the settlers' council. He said 20
settlers, including women and children, were injured in clashes
with police near the settlement of Kadumim. Police said two police
were lightly injured.
	   Israeli police were also on alert for possible attacks by
Palestinian extremists opposed to the accord, according to Israel
radio. At the same time, the Israelis allowed an extra 20,000
Palestinian workers from the West Bank and Gaza to enter Israel as
of Sunday morning, bringing the total to 54,000.
	   The settlers awoke to a new reality Sunday morning. ``We hoped
this moment would never come,'' said Shlomo Filber, a leader of the
settlers' movement. The agreement signed at the White House Friday
includes an Israeli handover of 13.1 percent of the West Bank to
Palestinian civilian control. That means some Jewish settlements
will be surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory, except for
access roads.
	   At Shiloh, one of the settlements likely to be isolated,
Israelis are frustrated, said Batya Medad. a teacher. She told the
Associated Press that settlers were disheartened by the previous.
moderate Israeli government's ``obvious joy'' at the difficulties
caused by the agreements with the Palestinians.
	   ``People are so badly scarred from the process and all the
anxiety we had to put up with,'' she said, ``that I don't think
people have the strength to react the way we once did.''
	   She said there is no chance that the agreement signed Friday
will result in peaceful relations between settlers and
Palestinians. ``This is taking away our security,'' she complained.
``This is not peace. This is the total opposite of peace. This is
endangering innocent citizens.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police have uncovered 37 producers of illegal
alcohol in Russia's Far East so far in 1998, a news agency reported
Sunday.
	   In the course of their operations, officials seized over 50,000
bottles of unlicensed alcohol, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Russia's alcohol industry is rife with fake spirits and illegal
imports, and the profit on about half of Russia's alcohol escapes
tax each year.
	   In addition, hundreds of people die each year in Russia after
drinking concoctions passed off as alcohol, but which contain
poisonous substances.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 50 people have contracted malaria so far
this year in the northwestern city of St. Petersburg, a news agency
reported Sunday.
	   In all 53 cases, the malaria was brought in from outside Russia,
mostly from the central Asian republics of Tajikistan and
Azerbaijan, the ITAR-Tass news agency said, citing an unidentified
official from the State Epidemiologic Inspectorate.
	   Malaria, spread by mosquitoes that breed in pools of stagnant
water, can cause severe chills and fever and is sometimes fatal.

China reports exports far below year's target
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The Asian financial crisis will slash China's
export growth this year from a projected 10 percent to as little as
4 percent, an official newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The ``most optimistic'' estimate for export growth would be 6
percent, but 4 to 5 percent would be ``quite satisfying'' given the
slowdown of world trade, the Business Weekly quoted Qin Xuanren,
deputy secretary-general of the International Trade Association of
China, as saying.
	   The decline in exports has put China's ability to meet its
overall economic growth target of 8 percent in question. Exports
last year surged 20.9 percent from the previous year to dlrs 182.7
billion and contributed to 20.6 percent of 1997's 8.8 percent
growth.
	   Qin predicted China's exports would increase in the fourth
quarter to about dlrs 54 billion. For the first nine months,
China's exports were up 3.9 percent from a year earlier to dlrs
134.13 billion.
	   Chinese government economists continue to predict the 8 percent
overall growth target will be met, despite slumping exports.
	   The Business Weekly said government leaders were sticking to the
8 percent prediction ``because they believed confidence was vital
in time of difficulties to maintain the momentum of foreign capital
influx and avoid public unease.''
	   The government has increased spending on infrastructure
construction as a means of generating demand. High growth is
necessary for China to create jobs for millions of workers laid off
in the reform of debt-ridden state companies.

Southern province to inject capital into cash-strapped
</HEADLINE>
conglomerate &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A southern provincial government has pledged to
inject funds and assets to rescue a cash-strapped conglomerate,
signaling China's determination to rebuild debt-ridden investment
companies, Hong Kong newspapers reported Sunday.
	   News reports said Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji had given the green
light for the Guangdong government to inject capital into Guangdong
Enterprises (Holdings), the parent of Hong Kong-listed Guangdong
Investment, the province's flagship in the territory.
	   Quoting an unnamed official with the province's securities
regulatory commission, the Hong Kong Standard reported that the
initial injection would be 3 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
385 million)
	   Guangdong Enterprises, the second investment arm of the
Guangdong provincial government, sits at the center of a tangled
web of companies with investments in a variety of industries,
including brewing, textiles, construction and food, the South China
Morning Post said.
	   Early this month, the collapse of Guangdong International Trust
and Investment Corp., also known as Gitic, the province's main
investment arm, exposed the deep-rooted problems plaguing China's
financial sector.
	   China so far has managed to prevent the regional economic
turmoil from undoing its own financial system _ largely by
preventing outflows of capital through the limited convertibility
of its currency.

Waugh brothers extend Australia's lead to 230

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan hit back with two wickets in
the first session before Mark and Steve Waugh stretched Australia's
lead beyond 200-mark at lunch on Sunday, the fourth day of the
third and decisive cricket Test.
	   Resuming at the overnight total of 130 for one, Australia was
202 for three at lunch with Mark batting on 29 and Steve not out on
27. With a 28-run first innings lead over Pakistan, the visitors
now have an overall lead of 230 with seven second innings wickets
in hand. The Waughs have put on 50 runs for the third wicket in 70
minutes.
	   Australia's captain Mark Taylor, who was 64 overnight, added
another four runs before he was bowled by off-spinner Arshad Khan
in the fifth over of the day. Taylor put on 109 runs for the second
wicket with Justin Langer in 191 minutes and hit six fours in his
194-ball 68 runs knock.
	   Langer was out when he tried to take a needless run off Ijaz
Ahmed's strong throw from square leg.
	   Langer made 51 with the help of three fours in his 222 minutes
at the wicket.
	   Khan, who bowled 10 overs on Sunday morning, has picked up two
wickets for 65.

Bomb explosion wounds head of Chechnya's anti-kidnapping division
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A bomb destroyed the car of Chechnya's top
anti-kidnapping official Sunday, seriously injuring him and two of
his bodyguards on the day he was to launch a major offensive in the
breakaway republic.
	   Shadid Bargishev lost both his legs and was in critical
condition along with two bodyguards after the bomb exploded outside
the anti-kidnapping department office in the Chechen capital of
Grozny, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   All three were taken to a hospital, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The explosion came on the same day officials in Chechnya had
promised to launch a large-scale operation to release hostages held
in the region.
	   A number of hostages have been freed recently from Chechnya,
including 24 Russian soldiers and an English couple. Most of the
releases have been facilitated through the help of Russian
financier Boris Berezovsky, though the extent of his involvement
has been unclear.
	   More than 100 people are still being held, including three
Britons, a New Zealander and a Turk, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Chechnya, where rebels fought a bloody independence war against
Russia in 1994-96, conducts its own affairs and has seen a sharp
rise in violent crime and hostage-taking, usually by criminal gangs
for ransom.

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Stuart Bouvier shot a closing 70
Sunday to overhaul faltering Presidents Cup player Craig Parry and
post his first win in eight years on the Australian PGA tour.
	   The 29-year-old Bouvier, a national amateur champion 10 years
ago, won the South Australian Open at 6-under 282 at the Kooyonga
Golf Club course.
	   He was two clear of fellow Australian Parry, who will play in
the Presidents Cup against the United States in December, and
another Australian, Stephen Allan.
	   Parry held the third-round lead but stumbled to a 75 Sunday
while Allan had a 71. There were seven players tied for 4th on 285.
	   Robin Byrd, of the United States, closed with 73 to finish in a
three-way tie for 16th while Frenchman Jean-Louis Guepy had a 75 to
finish tied for 37th.

Kosovo rebels demoralized, disheartened after Serb victories
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS. &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAJRAM CURRI, Albania (AP) _ Imer Habibi kept fighting when his
relatives fled their Kosovo homes, when comrades fell in battle and
when Serbs razed his village. When fellow rebels sold their weapons
and left for jobs abroad, he started having doubts.
	   ``I can't blame anybody for leaving,'' said Habibi, 20, who fled
here two weeks ago after a bullet pierced his right hand. ``We
don't really have any weapons to fight the Serbs anyway. If we
don't have some major success in the next month, I don't think I
can ever go back.''
	   Three months ago, about 3,000 Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas
were gathered in northern Albania. From there, they launched
attacks against Serbian forces in their fight for independence for
Kosovo, a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic.
	   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people are Albanian, and
most want independence or self-rule.
	   But after a series of crushing defeats, the rebel force has
dwindled to a few bands scattered over northern Albania, according
to guerrillas and Western officials based here.
	   Many rebels have grown discouraged and returned to jobs in
Western Europe, which they left when Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic launched his brutal crackdown Feb. 28 on ethnic Albanian
separatists in Kosovo.
	   So many rebels have sold their rifles to finance trips abroad
that the price of Kalashnikov assault rifles here has dropped from
$180 in August to $120 today.
	   Gone is the bravado of a few months ago, after a wave of early
guerrilla victories in Kosovo attracted thousands of recruits from
ethnic Albanian communities in Western Europe.
	   ``I don't know if our men will be back,'' said a guerrilla
commander who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We're not fighting
here anymore. Our job now is to try to protect any refugees that
cross the border.''
	   Those who remain say it is too dangerous to mount operations
across the border because Serb forces have bolstered their
defenses. Soon, snowfalls in the mountains that tower along the
border will seal off the few remaining infiltration routes until
spring.
	   Maj. Bajram Gostureji, commander of an Albanian government
border patrol unit, estimated that the number of Serb troops across
the frontier had increased from a few hundred to more than 1,500.
	   ``The border is tenser than ever,'' Gostureji said. ``Only last
year, I used to chat with the Serb border guards and lend them
cigarettes. Now, they shoot at us whenever they see us.''
	   In their concrete barracks, the KLA commander and a handful of
his men squat on milk crates, eating macaroni, drinking an orange
soft drink and complaining of crushing boredom.
	   Unlike their comrades still fighting in Kosovo, they sport
neatly pressed and washed green fatigue uniforms and polished
boots, signs of spare time.
	   Western officials here say it is premature to declare an end to
the Kosovo rebellion. One official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that if the U.S.-led peace process fails to improve
the lot of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, rebel ranks could swell
again after winter ends.
	   ``If the situation in Kosovo remains the same over the winter,
we'll probably have a lot of the guerrillas coming back in the
spring,'' the official said. ``A lot of them went back to their
homes in western Europe to make money or to study.''
	   He also said NATO airstrikes against Serb-dominated Yugoslavia
could reverse guerrilla fortunes and encourage young Albanians to
resume the fight. The Americans and Europeans, however, oppose the
KLA's goal of independence.
	   They want the rebels to endorse negotiations between Milosevic
and ethnic Albanian moderates for self-rule within the Yugoslav
federation.
	   Meanwhile, the Albanians say the gradual disappearance of the
Kosovo rebels has not led to a reduction of tensions along the
border.
	   ``When the KLA was here, the Serbs were more afraid to shoot
into Albanian territory,'' Gostureji said. ``Now, it seems they
want us to empty the area along our border to make sure the KLA
never comes back.''

Officials: Muslim extremists planning to bomb oil depot, power
</HEADLINE>
barge &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Government troops have secured at
least two oil depots and a power barge that Muslim extremists plan
to bomb in two southern Philippine provinces, officials said
Sunday.
	   Military and police officials said the Abu Sayyaf rebel group
was planning attacks on the oil depots of Caltex Philippines Inc.
in the provinces of Basilan and Zamboanga del Sur.
	   A floating power barge of the state-run National Power Corp.,
which supplies power to parts of Basilan, was another target, the
officials said.
	   Zamboanga del Sur police chief Carlito Tabaculde said government
troops have secured the Caltex depot in the provincial town of Naga
in recent weeks due to the threat. He did not say when the rebels
planned to attack, or how authorities learned of the plan.
	   He said he has received reports that Caltex was planning to shut
down the depot due to security concerns.
	   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller but more violent of two Muslim
rebel groups still at war with the Manila government in an attempt
to establish an independent Islamic state in the southern
Philippine region of Mindanao.
	   It has been linked to several recent kidnappings in Mindanao,
including those of an Italian missionary priest, the family of a
Taiwanese businessman and a group of Hong Kong and Malaysian
traders.
	   Authorities suspect the rebel group has links with Saudi Arabian
dissident Osama Bin Laden, who has been blamed in the bombings of
the U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in August.
	   The Abu Sayyaf has about 200 armed members, scattered in
Basilan, Zamboanga and nearby Sulu province, the military says.

Iran says new peace agreement denies Palestinian rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran condemned the new Palestinian-Israeli
peace deal, saying that it does not address Palestinian rights and
that Israel likely will never live up to the US.-broke red
agreement.
	   In Iran's first comments on the pact, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mahmoud Mohammadi said it would also cause a rift between
Palestinians, many of whom oppose it.
	   ``It would only entail a widening gap between the Palestinians
themselves, and would in the end, turn out to the advantage of''
Israel,'' Mohammadi said.
	   In comments carried by the official Islamic Republic News Agency
Saturday night, Mohammadi said Israel ``was not to be trusted'' to
stick to the agreement, which anyway would ``never guarantee the
denied rights of the Palestinians.''
	   Tehran does not recognize Israel and believes it was created on
land belonging to the Palestinians.
	   Under the deal signed Friday, Israel has agreed to withdraw
troops from additional West Bank land in exchange for guarantees
that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will clamp down stringently
on Palestinian extremists.
	   Mohammadi accused both Israel and the United States of
attempting to trample Palestinians' rights and bring Jerusalem
under Israel's absolute rule.
	   Iran has often condemned Israel's attempts to make Jerusalem its
capital. Jerusalem, which houses Islam's third holiest site, the
al-Aqsa mosque, is holy to Christians, Muslims and Jews.
	   The Iran News newspaper on Sunday accused U.S. President Bill
Clinton of having worked hard to win the agreement between Israel
and the Palestinians to deflect attention from the Monica Lewinsky
sex and lies scandal.
	   It also criticized the U.S. decision to allow Central
Intelligence Agency involvement in areas under Palestinian control,
saying they would only be doing Israel's bidding.
	   ``There is no justification for an American intelligence agency
to interfere in the internal affairs of Palestine, especially ...
the power of life or death over Palestinian citizens,'' said the
paper, which is close to the Foreign Ministry.
	   It added: ``The 50-year history of U.S.-Israeli relations proves
that Americans will go to any lengths to protect even the smallest
interests of their Israeli allies.''

At least 20 arrests as Jewish settlers protest peace accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with details from protests, arrest of
Hamas leader &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OFRA, West Bank (AP) _ Jewish settlers protesting the new peace
accord staged road-blocking protests across the West Bank on
Sunday. Police said at least 20 settlers were arrested and two
police officers were hurt.
	   Near the settlement of Ofra north of Jerusalem, about 50
settlers and their supporters rushed past Israeli police and sat
cross-legged on the highway. Some settlers wrapped in prayer shawls
held morning prayers at the roadside.
	   There were similar demonstrations throughout the West Bank.
Police also said settlers burned tires at the Karme Tsur settlement
north of Hebron.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was flying home from
Washington as the settlers, once his staunch supporters, took to
the streets to express anger over his agreement to turn more West
Bank land over to the Palestinians in exchange for security
concessions.
	   ``I'm here to show that this is a sad day,'' said Natan El, 38,
an engineer, sitting in the middle of the main north-south highway
through the West Bank. ``We are in danger of losing our land, the
land we have returned to after 2,000 years.''
	   Meanwhile, Israel's main opposition Labor party is gearing up
for early general elections, party leaders told Israel radio. They
estimated that elections would take place in four months.
Netanyahu's term is to expire in mid-2000.
	   Israeli politicians from most parties predicted political
turmoil in the wake of the signing of the agreement. ``This
government probably won't survive,'' said David Levy, who quit his
post as Netanyahu's foreign minister in January.
	   Twelve of Netanyahu's supporters in the parliament say they will
vote against him in upcoming no-confidence motions. Netanyahu has
only a one-seat majority.
	   The moderate Labor party, which originated the peace process
with the Palestinians, pledges to back the accord in parliament and
refrain from voting no confidence in Netanyahu's government for two
weeks.
	   Sunday's protests marked the first major action by the settlers
since the signing of the accord, which came during the Jewish
Sabbath.
	   With orders to keep the roads open, police arrested 31
protesters, according to Aharon Domb, head of the settlers'
council. The police said more than 20 had been arrested but could
not provide a precise figure.
	   Domb also said 20 settlers, including women and children, were
injured in clashes with police near the settlement of Kadumim.
Police could not confirm any settler injuries, but said two police
were slightly hurt.
	   Israeli police were also on alert for possible attacks by
Palestinian extremists opposed to the accord, according to Israel
radio.
	   At the same time, Israel allowed an extra 20,000 Palestinian
workers from the West Bank and Gaza Strip to enter Israel as of
Sunday morning, bringing the total to 54,000.
	   In recent weeks, Israel has gradually been raising the number of
workers allowed in after imposing strict closures of the
Palestinian lands during a string of Jewish holidays.
	   Settler leader Pinchas Wallerstein, who met with Netanyahu
during the talks at a Maryland retreat in an effort to lobby him
against signing an agreement, said he hoped the demonstrations
would sway Israeli public opinion.
	   ``The intention is to wake up the nation. If we do that we will
succeed. There is no doubt this is a dangerous agreement,''
Wallerstein said as he sat in the middle of the highway.
	   The agreement signed at the White House Friday calls for an
Israeli handover of 13.1 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian
civilian control. That means some Jewish settlements will be
surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory, except for access
roads.
	   ``We hoped this moment would never come,'' said Shlomo Filber, a
leader of the settlers' movement.
	   In a another development, Palestinian security arrested Sheik
Hamed Betawi, a Hamas leader from the West Bank town of Nablus.
According to his family, Betawi, 55, is being held in a Nablus
prison.
	   During the past several weeks, more than two dozen Hamas
activists have been arrested.

	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ The start of the men's season opening
World Cup race was postponed 45 minutes Sunday, due to heavy winds
and snow.
	   The start of the giant slalom, originally scheduled for 0845GMT,
was pushed back to 0930GMT.
	   Winds of over 100 km/hr (62 miles/hr) blowing at the top of the
course knocked down the start hut. Organizers were frantically
attempting to re-erect the hut as well as clear the course of the
rapidly falling snow.
	   Race officials said they were optimistic the race would take
place.

paper, which is close to the Foreign Ministry.
	   It added: ``The 50-year history of U.S.-Israeli relations proves
that Americans will go to any lengths to protect even the smallest
interests of their Israeli allies.''

Arafat briefs Mubarak on new peace deal with Israel,
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat briefed
Egypt's president Sunday on the new peace agreement he reached with
Israel after marathon U.S.-mediated negotiations.
	   Neither Arafat nor President Hosni Mubarak spoke to reporters
after the meeting at the Unity presidential palaces in Cairo. The
two met alone briefly, then were joined by aides. The session
lasted one hour and 15 minutes.
	   The agreement, signed Friday, requires Israel to withdraw from
an additional 13 percent of West Bank land in exchange for Arafat
clamping stringent security measures on Palestinian militants to
prevent attacks on Israelis.
	   Many in the Arab world have criticized the pact as geared too
much toward Israel's security demands and too little toward
Palestinian rights.
	   Mubarak, who in the past has mediated between Israel and the
Palestinians, cautiously welcomed the agreement but questioned
whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would live up to
it.
	   In remarks Saturday, Mubarak accused Netanyahu of failing to
implement past peace deals. Of the six points in the 1997 Hebron
accord, he said, ``only two points were implemented while the other
four were ignored.''
	   Arafat left for the Gaza Strip after the meeting, saying nothing
to reporters at Cairo airport.

Sato wins Bridgestone Open in playoff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHIBA, Japan (AP) _ Nobuhito Sato sank consecutive three-meter
(10-foot) birdie putts on the final regulation hole and the first
extra hole Sunday to beat Tateo ``Jet'' Ozaki in the Bridgestone
Open.
	   The 18th-hole birdie tied the two at 13-under-par 275, and the
next one clinched the 21.6 million yen (dlrs 183,000) first prize
in the 120 million yen (dlrs 1 million) tournament when Ozaki
parred the hole again.
	   It was the 28-year-old Sato's second victory on the Japan PGA
Tour. He won the JCB Classic Sendai in June last year.
	   He caught up Sunday with a 2-under 70 with birdies on Nos. 2, 4,
11 and 18 and bogeys on Nos. 1 and 5.
	   Ozaki, seeking his 15th career victory but first in five years
and seven months, shot a 70 with birdies on Nos. 5 and 15 and
bogeys on Nos. 1 and 11.
	   That sent the two back to the 572-yard, par-5 18th hole to start
a sudden death playoff.
	   ``I couldn't believe that I sank the birdie putt (in the
playoff),'' said Sato. ``I was lucky.''
	   Ozaki received 10.8 million yen (dlrs 92,000).
	   Taichi Tejima shot a 67 and placed third at 277. Carlos Franco
of Paraguay shot the day's best score, a 66, and ended fourth at
280.
	   Tied for fifth at 281 were American Brandt Jobe, the
Philippines' Frankie Minoza, Australian Steven Conran and three
Japanese _ Shigeki Maruyama, Toru Suzuki and Shingo Katayama.
	   Suzuki and Katayama shot 70, Jobe and Maruyama 71, Minoza 82 and
Conran 73 Sunday on the 7,151-yard, par-72 Sodegaura Country Club
Sodegaura course.
	   ``Jet'' Ozaki's elder brother, Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, the
defending champion and current Japan PGA earnings leader, shot a 72
and tied for 14th at 283 with American Brian Watts, Australian
Anthony Gilligan and six other Japanese.
	   Watts shot 67 and Gilligan 69.
	   American Lee Janzen, the 1993 and 1998 U.S. Open champion, shot
71 and tied for 39th with five Japanese at 287.

At least 20 arrests as Jewish settlers protest peace accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with details from protests, arrest of
Hamas leader &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OFRA, West Bank (AP) _ Jewish settlers blocked roads across the
West Bank on Sunday to protest the new Middle East peace accord.
Police said at least 20 settlers were arrested and two police
officers were hurt.
	   About 50 settlers and their supporters rushed past Israeli
police and sat cross-legged on a highway near the settlement of
Ofra, north of Jerusalem. Some settlers wrapped in prayer shawls
held morning prayers at the roadside.
	   There were similar demonstrations throughout the West Bank.
Police also said settlers burned tires at the Karme Tsur settlement
north of Hebron.
	   The agreement signed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and President Clinton at the White
House on Friday calls for an Israeli handover of 13.1 percent of
the West Bank to Palestinian civilian control. That means some
Jewish settlements will be surrounded by Palestinian-controlled
territory, except for access roads.
	   Israeli politicians from most parties predicted political
turmoil in the wake of the signing. ``This government probably
won't survive,'' said David Levy, who quit his post as Netanyahu's
foreign minister in January.
	   Twelve of Netanyahu's supporters in parliament say they will
vote against him in upcoming no-confidence motions. Netanyahu has
only a one-seat majority.
	   Israel's opposition Labor Party is gearing up for early general
elections, party leaders told Israel radio. They estimated that
elections would take place in four months.
	   The Labor party, which originated the peace process with the
Palestinians, has pledged to back the accord in parliament and
refrain from voting no confidence in Netanyahu's government for two
weeks.
	   Sunday's protests marked the first major action by the settlers
since the signing of the accord, which came during the Jewish
Sabbath.
	   Police arrested 31 protesters, according to Aharon Domb, head of
the settlers' council. Police said more than 20 had been arrested
but could not provide a precise figure.
	   Domb also said 20 settlers, including women and children, were
injured in clashes with police near the settlement of Kadumim.
Police could not confirm any settler injuries, but said two police
were slightly hurt.
	   Israeli police were also on alert for possible attacks by
Palestinian extremists opposed to the accord, according to Israel
radio.
	   Meanwhile, Israel allowed an additional 20,000 Palestinian
workers from the West Bank and Gaza Strip to enter Israel beginning
Sunday morning, bringing the total to 54,000.
	   In another development, Palestinian security arrested Sheik
Hamed Betawi, a Hamas leader from the West Bank town of Nablus.
According to his family, Betawi, 55, is being held in a Nablus
prison.
	   During the past several weeks, more than two dozen Hamas
activists have been arrested.

Number of Saudi women in work force expected to jump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A Saudi economist on Sunday forecast
that women would make up 7.4 percent of the public sector work
force by the year 2000, up from the current 0.5 percent.
	   Nada al-Fayez, one of the country's leading female economists,
said the reason for the predicted increase was the government's
efforts to replace expatriate women with Saudi women.
	   ``By the year 2000, a large number of foreign female workers
will be replaced by Saudi women,'' al-Fayez told The Associated
Press.
	   According to Planning Ministry figures, there are currently
275,700 women working in the public sector, which hires the bulk of
women. About half of them are Saudi.
	   Al-Fayez said that most of the jobs would still be in the
traditional female sectors of teaching and nursing.
	   Because women are banned from mingling with men in this strict
Muslim nation, work opportunities for women are severely limited.
	   Informal surveys show that almost 50 percent of Saudi female
university graduates are unable to find jobs.
	   The petrol boom of the mid-1970s brought millions of foreigners
looking for work to Saudi Arabia. The expatriates, mostly from the
Indian subcontinent, the Philippines, Egypt, Syria and Lebanon,
worked for lower wages than their Saudi counterparts.
	   But because of high levels of unemployment among the national
work force, Saudi Arabia has embarked on a ``Saudization'' policy
which aims at reducing reliance on foreigners and forcing
businesses to hire a minimum number of Saudis.

Russian parliament speaker arrives in Beijing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The speaker of the Russian parliament and a
parliamentary delegation arrived in Beijing Sunday for a six-day
visit.
	   Gennady Seleznyov, the Communist speaker of the lower house of
parliament, the State Duma, is expected to meet with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin; Li Peng, the chairman of the legislature,
who is No. 2 in the Communist hierarchy after Jiang; and Premier
Zhu Rongji.
	   Seleznyov and his group also plan to visit Shanghai, Shenzhen
and Hong Kong, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   China and Russia were once fierce rivals, but have built warm
ties in recent years. The two countries have signed agreements to
reduce troops along their border, and Russia has become the chief
supplier of high-tech hardware to China's military.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran condemned the new Palestinian-Israeli
peace deal, saying it does not address Palestinian rights and that
Israel likely will not live up to the U.S.-brokered agreement.
	   In Iran's first comments on the pact, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mahmoud Mohammadi said it would also cause a rift between
Palestinians, many of whom oppose it.
	   ``It would only entail a widening gap between the Palestinians
themselves, and would in the end, turn out to the advantage of
Israel,'' Mohammadi said.

Hungarians will be in the new government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZVOLEN, Slovakia (AP) _ The congress of the second largest
opposition party approved late on Saturday the participation of
ethnic Hungarians in the future coalition government, media
reported Sunday.
	   The Party of the Democratic Left has been the only one of the
four opposition parties so far to oppose participation of the
Hungarian Coalition Party in the new government.
	   The party's congress in this central Slovak town put an end to
lengthy speculations about whether the former Communist Party would
accept the Hungarians as coalition partners. Party chief Jozef
Migas was reelected for the next two years.
	   The new Slovak parliament is to convene next Thursday for the
first time after parliamentary elections last month in which the
hitherto ruling Movement for a Democratic Party of outgoing Prime
Minister Vladimir Meciar emerged the strongest party but lost too
many votes to be able to form a new government.
	   Migas is a likely candidate for the post of chairman of the
Slovak parliament. His party nominated six candidates for
ministerial posts.
	   The four opposition parties are expected to sign a coalition
agreement on Tuesday. Their coalition government will have the
support of 93 deputies parliament, enough to enact constitutional
laws.

Philippine government fixing computers to fight `millennium bug'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government has started
to fix government computer systems to protect them from the
potentially disastrous impact of the ``millennium bug'' in the year
2000, officials said Sunday.
	   Because of limited funds and time, however, repairs initially
could cover only computers used in the power and utility
industries, telecommunications and transportation, health care and
insurance, said presidential consultant Amable Aguiluz IV.
	   Other computers would be fixed as soon as funds, possibly some
donated by private companies, become available, Aguiluz said in a
statement.
	   The bug could cause computers that are set to read only the last
two digits of a year to malfunction when the calendar changes to
2000. Those that aren't fixed may not be able to sort dates,
calculate transactions or perform other operations.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada has ordered officials to
undertake a comprehensive audit of computer systems in all
government offices to determine whether they are susceptible to the
bug.
	   Next year, the Philippines will be host to an international
conference to find ways of managing problems that might be caused
by the bug.

Men's opening World Cup race delayed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ Heavy winds and snow forced race
officials to further delay the start of the men's season opening
World Cup race Sunday.
	   Originally set at 0845GMT, the start of the giant slalom was
pushed back 45 minutes then another 30 minutes to 1000GMT.
	   Winds of over 100 km/hr (62 miles/hr) blowing at the top of the
course demolished the start hut overnight and workers were
frantically attempting to re-erect the structure.
	   While organizers said that the heavy snow which fell overnight
had been cleared and the course conditions were satifactory, high
winds were still making the start impossible.
	   Spectators and fans awaited in the finish area in the blustery,
wetter conditions, as race officials announced the delay.

	   SAIGOMURA, Japan (AP) _ Michiko Hattori, the 1985 U.S. amateur
champion, shot a one-under-par 71 Sunday and won the 70 million yen
(dlrs 588,000) Hisako Higuchi Kibun Classic golf tournament by two
strokes.
	   It was the 30-year-old Hattori's fourth victory this season and
11th in her career.
	   Hattori started Sunday's final round tied with South Koreans Han
Hee-won and Kim Man-soo and Japan's Chitose Furukawa.
	   She shot two birdies and one bogey, and finished the 54-hole
tournament at 4-under 212.
	   Han shot a 73 and tied for second at 214 with Kaori Harada, who
shot the day's best score of 67 on the 6,290-yard, par-72 Green
Briar West Village course in northern Japan.
	   Hattori collected 12.6 million yen (dlrs 106,000), and Han and
Harada 5.53 million yen (dlrs 46,000) each.
	   Kim shot a 74 and placed fourth at 215. Yoko Inoue followed at
216 after a 72 Sunday.
	   Marnie McGuire of New Zealand and Huang Yu-chen of Taiwan shared
sixth at 217. McGuire shot 71 and Huang 73 Sunday.
	   Furukawa slipped to a 77 and fell from a share of the lead to an
eighth-place tie at 218 with Mayumi Murai, who shot 70.

Jamaica prepares for Hurricane Mitch
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: At 0900 GMT, Mitch was centered 210 miles (335 kilometers)
southwest of Kingston, Jamaica. Adds danger to eastern Cuba. &QL; 
 &UR; By CAROLL ORR &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ An increasingly dangerous Hurricane
Mitch gained strength Saturday as it slowly crawled toward Jamaica
over open waters in the western Caribbean.
	   At 0900 GMT, Mitch was located about 210 miles (335 kilometers)
south-southwest of Kingston and its west-northwest movement had
slowed to 7 mph (11 kph). The National Hurricane Center in Miami
said sustained winds had increased to an estimated 125 mph (205
kph) and hurricane-force winds extended 60 miles (95 kilometers)
from the center.
	   ``It's moving over warm water so we are forecasting it to
intensify,'' said Andrew Shashay, a meteorologist at the hurricane
center.
	   Forecasters predicted Mitch would eventually veer to the
northwest, but it appeared the change of direction would come too
late to spare Jamaica entirely. But the hurricane's track could be
far enough west to prevent the strongest winds, those around the
eye of the storm, from crossing the island.
	   In Negril, on the western tip of the island where the effects of
the hurricane were likely to be strongest, residents and tourists
took precautions.
	   At the Poinciana Beach Resort, sandbags were put in place and
the ground floor was left empty in case a storm surge from Mitch
flooded the hotel.
	   ``Experience has taught us well so we don't take any chances,''
said hotel manager Clive Miller. ``If we're going to err, we err on
the side of too much caution.''
	   Under cloudy skies Saturday afternoon, stores did brisk business
as people stocked up on canned food, water, flashlights, batteries,
candles and other necessities.
	   The Jamaica Defense Force was placed on alert and the government
Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management urged
residents to complete their preparations before nightfall.
Thousands of schools and community centers were opened as shelters.
	   Numerous weekend events were postponed, including the
International Marlin Tournament, a sportfishing event held annually
for the past 40 years in Port Antonio. Air Jamaica on Saturday
announced the cancellation of several of its Sunday flights.
	   Once past Jamaica, the slow-moving hurricane was likely to
threaten the Cayman Islands and Cuba, forecasters said.
	   Mitch formed a little more than a month after Hurricane Georges
stormed through the Caribbean, killing more than 500 people before
drenching the Florida keys and the U.S. Gulf coast.
	   Jamaica has not been directly hit by a hurricane for a decade.
In 1988, Hurricane Gilbert slammed into the island with torrential
rains and gusts as high as 145 mph (235 kph), killing 45 people.
	   People living in eastern Cuba were also warned to be on alert,
with Mitch expected to affect the area from Camaguay to Guantanamo.

<TEXT>
	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ Bad weather further delayed the start of
the men's season opening World Cup giant slalom Sunday.
	   Originally set at 0845GMT, heavy winds and snow forced officials
to push back the start of the race to 1030GMT.
	   Workers were frantically trying to repair the start hut which
was demolished overnight by winds of over 100 km/hr (62 miles/hr)
blowing at the top of the course.
	   While officials said that the heavy snow which fell overnight
had been cleared and course conditions were satifactory, high winds
were still making the start impossible.
	   Spectators and fans awaited in the finish area in the driving
sleet as race officials announced the delay.

Laos grapples with downside of capitalism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) _ Laos, one of Asia's poorest countries, is
suffering its worst financial downturn since it shifted from a
centrally run economy to a market-oriented system about a decade
ago.
	   ``Laos has, since mid-1997, experienced the highest exchange
rate depreciation and highest rate of inflation in Asia,'' Wayne
Camard, the International Monetary Fund's representative to Laos,
said earlier this month.
	   Laos' currency, the kip, has lost more than half its value over
the past 18 months, and inflation has virtually double prices over
the past year, demonstrating that even a small, non-industrialized
economy is not immune to the regional economic contagion.
	   After Maoist-style agrarian socialism in the late 1970s and the
early 1980s left the economy stagnant, Laos moved back toward
capitalism in 1986 with its ``New Economic Mechanism.''
	   It loosened certain market mechanisms and encouraged foreign
investment while maintaining strict one-party political control.
	   The nation's gross domestic product grew by an average 6.9
percent from 1993 to 1997, with that success based on the ``twin
pillars'' of tight fiscal policies and strong inflows of foreign
investment, Camard said.
	   ``The Asian crisis has knocked down both of these pillars,'' the
English-language Vientiane Times quoted him saying at a seminar for
local business leaders.
	   As the kip fell, so did central bank reserves, from dlrs 143
million at the end of 1997 to dlrs 122 million now.
	   A distorted economic landscape, meanwhile, may be pushing many
businesses close to bankruptcy.
	   So far this year, the Anglo-Dutch petroleum giant Royal Dutch
Shell has posted losses in excess of dlrs 1 million, owing largely
to foreign exchange liquidity problems and a government-directed
policy forcing suppliers to subsidize gasoline that is sold at a
price that is half that charged in neighboring Thailand.
	   Camard, calling for structural reform, said one solution lies in
allowing prices to send corrective signals through the economy.
	   Forcing Laotians to pay the true cost for public utilities would
put a halt to the country ``living beyond its means,'' he said.
	   But such a concept could be difficult to implement in a country
with a per capita annual income of about dlrs 300, and where the
average civil servant is paid a monthly wage of roughly dlrs 10.
	   The high level of inflation is already biting deeply into
people's purchasing power, noted World Bank liaison officer Linda
Schneider, speaking at the same seminar.
	   ``The most widespread and noticeable effect of the crisis has
been on prices, particularly for basic commodities on which most of
the population, especially the poor, depend for survival,''
Schneider said.
	   Fixed-wage civil servants and those without land to produce food
for themselves have been hardest hit.
	   Policy makers are offering mixed signals in the fight against
inflation.
	   Prime Minister Sisavath Keobounphanh suggested taxing companies
in foreign currencies rather that local kip, the Vientiane Times
reported.
	   ``This is precisely what the government should not do,'' said
IMF representative Camard, explaining that it would send the wrong
signal to international investors and Laotian citizens about the
government's confidence in its own currency.
	   ``The fund stood ready to initiate structural adjustments
wherever the Laotian authorities were,'' Camard said.
	   More promising, in the eyes of Camard and other economists, is a
currency reform announced Oct. 16 by the Bank of Laos' economic
research director, Dethphouvang Moularat.
	   He said that in the first quarter of 1999, Laos will switch from
its current managed-float exchange rate to a market-determined
inter-bank exchange rate.

<TEXT>
	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ The European Union leaders planned
to wrap up a summit Sunday with a pledge to end by next Spring
months of fruitless talks about reforming the EU ahead of its
enlargement.
	   The impetus to crank the slow-as-molasses reform drive into high
gear came on Saturday from Gerhard Schroeder.
	   The incoming German chancellor set a five-month timetable to
amend the EU charter so the now 15-member union can admit a dozen
newcomers and not choke on its own red tape.
	   Reforms touch on cutting subsidies to farmers, revamping EU
finances and giving the union a stronger defense and foreign policy
profile.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair outlined his views on a new
defense role for Europe, to prevent a recurrence of the EU's
``dithering and disunity'' over Kosovo.
	   Schroeder's center-left coalition takes office Tuesday, ending
16 years of Helmut Kohl's conservative christian democratic rule.
	   His debut here and that of Massimo D'Alema, an ex-communist
sworn in last week as Italian premier, gives the line-up of the
West European leaders a stronger leftist tint.
	   The EU leaders agreed emphasis should be put on sustaining
Europe's growth through the current world economic crisis.
	   ``Reducing unemployment is the most important single question
for the people of Europe,'' Schroeder said Saturday. The EU's ranks
of the unemployed total 18 million.
	   On Jan. 1, Germany assumes the EU presidency and must bring
months of debate about reforming the EU to a conclusion.
	   Sweeping and painful reforms must be adopted in the EU budget
and new decision-making rules must be written to update archaic
ones dating back to the 1950s when there were six members. These
issues have been around for many months without an agreement.
	   Schroeder urged his partners to settle on ``a draft package of
solutions'' at a mid-December summit in Vienna, adding, ``I do not
exclude calling a special summit at the end of February to move
matters forward.''
	   The reform talks have so far been fruitless because of the scope
of proposals: farm subsidy cuts of up to 30 percent, more majority
voting eroding national sovereignty and overhauling the budget to
end complaints from Germany, Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands
they pay too much for EU membership.
	   Blair overturned the policy of his Conservative predecessors by
calling for the EU to develop its own defense capability to tackle
wildfire conflicts on its doorstep like Kosovo or Bosnia without
having to rely on U.S. support.
	   Rudolf Scharping, who takes over as German defense minister
Tuesday, said he had already had talks with his British and French
counterparts to discuss Blair's ideas.
	   On economic measures, some leaders urged the launch of ``New
Deal'' type public works projects to create jobs and called on
central bankers to boost business by cutting interest rates.
	   Schroeder said Germany's Social Democratic and Green coalition
partners ``have made the fight against unemployment the central
point of our European policy,'' Schroeder said. ``Priority must go
to Europe-wide coordination of economic, financial and social
policies.''
	   To boost the economy, Scharping said EU governments should enter
into ``a dialogue'' with central bank governors to convince them to
decrease rates.
	   Central banks in the EU's core economies, notably Germany and
France, have resisted that so far, claiming they are already among
the world's lowest.
	   Although the leaders rallied behind the call for more growth,
there was less unity over how to do it. French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin revived a plan for the EU to raise loans to finance
public works projects such as trans-continental road and rail
links.

Vicious cycle of low-level violence threatens Kosovo agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Serb police outpost is attacked.
Men die. An ethnic Albanian village is shelled in revenge.
Civilians flee. Fear is everywhere. And the cycle begins again.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army says it is protecting ethnic
Albanian villagers from vicious attacks by police bent on driving
them from the southern Serbian province. Serb-led Yugoslav forces
say they are responding to ethnic Albanian provocations.
	   The low-level daily violence in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province
grinds on. And the American-led international effort to stop the
conflict, which has killed hundreds and driven nearly 300,000 from
their homes, has no mechanism for dealing with this kind of
violence.
	   The Kosovo peace agreements do not require the Serbs to pull all
their forces out of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians greatly
outnumber Serbs. The agreements do not bar the Serbs from fighting
in self-defense.
	   If one side or another goes too far, the ultimate threat, NATO
airstrikes, would probably be a disproportionate response. In any
case, air power would be useful only against the Serbs. There is no
effective means of punishing the KLA, which is scattered in rural
strongholds.
	   Western diplomats close to the negotiations concede a certain
level of violence will have to be tolerated. There are bound to be
infractions of the cease-fire, they say. The question is how many
and how serious.
	   What cannot be tolerated are violations that interfere with the
political process of resolving the ethnic Albanians' grievances.
	   The KLA, beaten back but not defeated by a combination of Serb
military forces and police in seven months of fighting, has been
displaying a new aggressiveness and a certain cockiness _ strutting
defiantly through some villages in full uniform, practically under
the noses of Serb forces.
	   It is difficult to apportion blame for the almost daily
breakdowns in the cease-fire. But the Albanians realize that they
face no real sanctions from the international community and that
the Serbs are under new constraints.
	   ``When we announced a cease-fire, we never said it was a total
cease-fire,'' said KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi. ``They shell our
civilians and attack us, so this is our response.''
	   Veljko Odalovic, the Serb regional governor, insists the
struggle against what he calls terrorism is the legitimate right of
the state.
	   ``It's clear the terrorists want to provoke new conflicts and to
involve large numbers of police and army where they can, and the
international community knows that,'' he said. ``If that is the
case, and our right to respond is restricted ... then one has to
ask, who is supporting terrorism?''
	   Adem Demaci, the political representative of the KLA, said the
provocation claim is false.
	   ``The regime does not want peace in Kosovo,'' he said. ``There
has not been a single day ... without Serb forces undertaking some
action and blaming it on the KLA, saying it was violating the
cease-fire. They (the Serbs) are not withdrawing, they have been
digging in.''
	   Key to the international effort is the return of ethnic Albanian
civilians to their villages and homes. So far, despite Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's pledge to cooperate in their return,
only a trickle have returned.
	   Counting is complicated by the fact that many people go into the
villages during the day, but leave again at night. Farmers can be
seen doing their autumn plowing, but instead of going home at the
end of the day they return to makeshift camps in the forest or in
the mountains.
	   The return mechanism is simple _ repeated again and again by
refugees in camps all over Kosovo: As long as there are Serb police
in the villages, the people will not go back.
	   There are still 14,000 Serb police in Kosovo, according to NATO
_ more than double the 6,500 estimated to have been there before
Milosevic's crackdown began Feb. 28. About 11,000 Yugoslav soldiers
remain, above the 8,000-9,000 normally stationed in the province.
	   No one is suggesting all the Serbs forces leave the province.
Some are needed to keep the KLA from going on the offensive and
regaining territory.
	   Traveling through the Kosovo countryside, the police presence is
apparent. One abandoned Albanian village after another has
policemen living in it, sometimes just a few camping out in a
damaged building, sometimes more.
	   Under the Oct. 12 peace agreement, the 54-nation Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe is to send roughly 2,000
unarmed monitors into the field to verify that Yugoslavia keeps its
commitments.
	   Some seasoned observers say privately that's far too many.
	   The plan is for these new observers to stay overnight in
villages, building refugees' confidence and encouraging them to
return.
	   But regardless of their numbers or actions, it is difficult to
see what influence the ``verifiers'' can have on the daily
low-level violence, short of physically standing in the way of the
gunfire.

Typhoon Babs heads toward south China, flooding Taiwan

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Typhoon Babs brought torrential rains and
landslides to Taiwan Sunday as it churned toward south China after
killing 139 people in the Philippines and leaving hundreds of
thousands homeless.
	   The Central Weather Bureau said that at 3 p.m. (0700 GMT), the
typhoon was centered 120 kilometers (72 miles) southwest of Pratas
Island in the South China Sea. Packing sustained winds of 130 kph
(81 mph), Babs was moving northwest at 9 kph (5.4 mph) toward south
China.
	   Its outer fringes brought torrential rains to the whole island
of Taiwan, with Hualien and several other eastern towns recording
more than 500 millimeters (20 inches) of rain in 24 hours,
weathermen said. Authorities evacuated hundreds of people from
their homes near flooded rivers.
	   In Taipei, the main Keelung River has swelled its banks.
One-third of Hsichih town was flooded in waist-high water, and much
of nearby Wutu was also flooded. Rescuers used rubber boats and
trucks to evacuate residents from apartment blocks, officials said.
	   In eastern Ilan, a man was swept into the sea while fishing in
the rough waters. Nine people were injured when their van was hit
by rockslides in eastern Taitung, police said.
	   Several domestic airports were closed, and landslides had halted
traffic and trapped hundreds of people in mountains in central
Taiwan, they said.
	   In Hong Kong, authorities hoisted the No. 3 typhoon signal, a
warning to residents to take precautions as winds were expected to
intensify later in the day.
	   The government said it has opened up several shelters for those
seeking refuge from the storm and that more will be opened if
needed.
	   Red flags were raised at Hong Kong beaches to warn swimmers not
to enter the water because of rough seas. Fishing boats sought
shelter in the harbor.
	   In the Philippines, President Joseph Estrada has declared four
provinces and a city in the worst hit area on the southern tip of
Luzon under a state of calamity. Officials in calamity zones will
be able to use emergency funds and freeze prices of commodities
with little red tape.
	   Of the 139 deaths reported so far in the Philippines, 67 were
attributed to landslides on Catanduanes Island, where Babs first
landed Thursday, the Office of Civil Defense said.
	   The worst landslides were in San Miguel, a coconut- and
abaca-producing town along the Bato River, as residents attempted
to escape rapidly rising floodwaters by climbing hills behind the
village.
	   Local officials said entire families died in the town, where
virtually every house was damaged. Residents began burying their
dead in two mass graves Saturday.
	   At least 37 other people were electrocuted or died in landslides
in nearby Camarines Sur province and another 102 people were
injured by flying debris in Sorsogon province, both in the
impoverished Bicol region along the Philippines' eastern coast.
	   Nearly 400,000 people were forced out of their homes, disaster
relief officials said. Tens of thousands of others were stranded as
ports were shut and ships forbidden to sail.
	   Merly Lucas of the National Disaster Coordinating Council said
local authorities intensified relief work as weather cleared
Sunday. Two air force C-130 cargo planes were flying food and
medicine to Bicol, she said.
	   Philippine weather forecasters said Sunday they were monitoring
a low pressure area over the Pacific, about 900 kilometers (558
miles) east of the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, that
could strengthen into a storm in two to three days.
	   If it develops into a storm, it would potentially hit the same
provinces ravaged by Babs, weather forecaster Ludy Alviar said.
	   Babs was the second devastating storm to hit the Philippines
this month. Two weeks ago, Super Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74
people in the northern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.

<TEXT>
	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ Heavy winds and snow forced race
officials to further delay the start of the men's season opening
World Cup race Sunday.
	   Originally set at 0845GMT, the start of the giant slalom was
delayed more than two hours to 1100GMT.
	   Course workers were frantically attempting to re-erect the start
hut which was destroyed overnight by winds of over 100 km/hr (62
miles/hr) blowing at the top of the course.
	   While organizers said that the heavy snow which fell overnight
had been cleared and the course conditions were satifactory, high
winds were still making the start impossible.
	   Spectators and fans awaited in the finish area in the driving
sleet and blustery conditions.

Human rights group demands Mahathir resign after riots

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A leading Malaysian human rights
group demanded Sunday that Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad resign
after police clashes with anti-government rioters erupted into
chaos.
	   An anti-government protest that lasted until after midnight
Saturday became a riot when hundreds of police shot water laced
with stinging pepper spray at thousands of demonstrators and
bombarded a mosque with tear gas.
	   More than 241 people were arrested in the rally that spread
through various parts of the capital for more than eight hours.
Injuries resulted on both sides. Calm had returned to the capital
by Sunday.
	   ``The prime minister, who is also home minister, must accept
full responsibility for having totally mishandled the situation,''
said a statement issued by the human rights group Suaram.
	   Mahathir, who has ruled for 17 years, is also in charge of the
police force.
	   ``He cannot ignore the legitimate discontent of the people. We
call upon the prime minister to resign so that a general election
may be held,'' the statement added.
	   Demonstrators have staged a series of protests since ousted
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim was jailed Sept. 20. Protesters
demand political reforms, an end to Mahathir's rule and Anwar's
release.
	   Saturday's demonstration, however, marked a defiant turning
point as protesters turned violent against police, who have
declared all demonstrations in support of Anwar illegal.
	   The former heir apparent to Mahathir has pleaded innocent to 10
charges of graft and sexual misconduct and will stand trial
beginning Nov. 2. Anwar, who has been denied bail, has condemned
the charges as false and politically motivated.
	   The opposition leader of parliament, Lim Kit Siang, in a
statement issued Sunday, called for an independent investigation
into Saturday's violence, saying it was sparked by ``very cruel
police handling of unarmed and peaceable people.''
	   Meanwhile, a senior Cabinet minister warned that continued
rioting could not be tolerated, given the May riots in Indonesia
that led to ex-President Suharto's ouster.
	   ``Demonstrations in Malaysia have now entered a dangerous phase
with the use of force,'' Education Minister Najib Tun Razak was
quoted as saying by the Bernama news agency. He urged authorities
to be firm with protesters in the name of maintaining order.
	   The government has threatened to arrest demonstrators under the
country's dreaded Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite
detention without trial.
	   At the afternoon demonstration Saturday, protesters taunted
police in a downtown shopping district. Officers warned women and
children to get off the streets, which were packed with weekend
shoppers. Then huge police trucks sprayed the crowd with powerful
jets of water laced with a pepper chemical.
	   It filled the streets with a blue foam and scattered thousands
of people, crying and coughing from the stinging chemical.
	   Police in civilian clothes, some wearing ski masks, chased
people through department stores and down side streets, grabbing
them and tossing them into waiting vans. Some were slapped, kicked
and wrestled to the ground.
	   Some of those detained Saturday were holding shopping bags and
it was unclear whether they were passers-by or had intended to join
the demonstration.
	   Police followed protesters to a mosque where they had gathered
for evening prayers and to regroup. Police lobbed tear gas into the
building and protesters responded by chasing officers and pelting
them with stones. Others hurled bricks.
	   Rioters set fire to a pile of tires and debris dragged from
roadside garbage bins, creating a bonfire in the middle of one
street, the Star newspaper reported.
	   An Anwar supporter who asked not to be identified said the
afternoon protest turned ugly when police began arresting people at
random.
	   ``It's sheer frustration,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ The European Union leaders planned
to wrap up a summit Sunday with a pledge to end by next Spring
months of fruitless talks about reforming the EU ahead of its
enlargement.
	   The impetus to crank the slow-as-molasses reform drive into high
gear came on Saturday from Gerhard Schroeder.
	   The incoming German chancellor set a five-month timetable to
amend the EU charter so the now 15-member union can admit a dozen
newcomers and not choke on its own red tape.
	   Reforms touch on cutting subsidies to farmers, revamping EU
finances and giving the union a stronger defense and foreign policy
profile.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair outlined his views on a new
defense role for Europe, to prevent a recurrence of the EU's
``dithering and disunity'' over Kosovo.
	   Schroeder's center-left coalition takes office Tuesday, ending
16 years of Helmut Kohl's conservative christian democratic rule.
	   His debut here and that of Massimo D'Alema, an ex-communist
sworn in last week as Italian premier, gives the line-up of the
West European leaders a stronger leftist tint.
	   The EU leaders agreed emphasis should be put on sustaining
Europe's growth through the current world economic crisis.
	   ``Reducing unemployment is the most important single question
for the people of Europe,'' Schroeder said Saturday. The EU's ranks
of the unemployed total 18 million.
	   On Jan. 1, Germany assumes the EU presidency and must bring
months of debate about reforming the EU to a conclusion.
	   Sweeping and painful reforms must be adopted in the EU budget
and new decision-making rules must be written to update archaic
ones dating back to the 1950s when there were six members. These
issues have been around for many months without an agreement.
	   Schroeder urged his partners to settle on ``a draft package of
solutions'' at a mid-December summit in Vienna, adding, ``I do not
exclude calling a special summit at the end of February to move
matters forward.''
	   The reform talks have so far been fruitless because of the scope
of proposals: farm subsidy cuts of up to 30 percent, more majority
voting eroding national sovereignty and overhauling the budget to
end complaints from Germany, Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands
they pay too much for EU membership.
	   Blair overturned the policy of his Conservative predecessors by
calling for the EU to develop its own defense capability to tackle
wildfire conflicts on its doorstep like Kosovo or Bosnia without
having to rely on U.S. support.
	   Rudolf Scharping, who takes over as German defense minister
Tuesday, said he had already had talks with his British and French
counterparts to discuss Blair's ideas.
	   On economic measures, some leaders urged the launch of ``New
Deal'' type public works projects to create jobs and called on
central bankers to boost business by cutting interest rates.
	   Schroeder said Germany's Social Democratic and Green coalition
partners ``have made the fight against unemployment the central
point of our European policy,'' Schroeder said. ``Priority must go
to Europe-wide coordination of economic, financial and social
policies.''
	   To boost the economy, Scharping said EU governments should enter
into ``a dialogue'' with central bank governors to convince them to
decrease rates.
	   Central banks in the EU's core economies, notably Germany and
France, have resisted that so far, claiming they are already among
the world's lowest.
	   Although the leaders rallied behind the call for more growth,
there was less unity over how to do it. French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin revived a plan for the EU to raise loans to finance
public works projects such as trans-continental road and rail
links.

Arafat wants accurate, faithful implementation of peace deal

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Sunday
he hoped the new Israeli-Palestinian peace accord would be
``accurately and faithfully'' implemented to truly push forward the
Middle East peace process.
	   Arafat's comment, made at Cairo airport after briefing President
Hosni Mubarak on the accord, reflects Arab skepticism that Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will live up to the agreement to
withdraw from a further 13 percent of West Bank land.
	   The Palestinian leader met with Mubarak at the Unity
presidential palace in Cairo. The two talked briefly alone, then
were joined by aides. The session last one hour and 15 minutes.
	   Neither Arafat nor Mubarak spoke to reporters after the meeting,
but Arafat later told reporters just before he departed for Algeria
that the implementation of the deal was what counted.
	   He expressed hope that the agreement would be ``accurately and
faithfully implemented so that we can say that we have pushed
forward the peace process and protected the peace of the courageous
people.''
	   Arafat said he was leaving for Algeria, Morocco and Saudi Arabia
on ``quick visits ... aimed at discussing with the Arab leaders the
recent developments.''
	   The agreement, signed Friday after marathon U.S.-mediated
negotiations, call for Arafat to clamp stringent security measures
on Palestinian militants to prevent attacks on Israelis in exchange
for the Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   Many in the Arab world have criticized the pact as geared too
much toward Israel's security demands and too little toward
Palestinian rights.
	   Mubarak, who in the past has mediated between Israel and the
Palestinians, has cautiously welcomed the agreement but also
questioned whether Netanyahu would implement all its parts.
	   In remarks Saturday, he accused Netanyahu of failing to live up
to past peace deals. Of the six points in the 1997 Hebron accord,
he said, ``only two points were implemented while the other four
were ignored.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ By a lopsided margin, Israelis support the new
agreement with the Palestinians, according to a poll published by
an Israeli newspaper Sunday.
	   The accord was signed Friday at the White House by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
Its main points are a partial Israeli pullback in the West Bank and
increased Palestinian security measures.
	   Asked their opinion about the agreement, 74 percent of the
Israelis polled said they supported it, while 18 percent were
opposed. Eight percent expressed no opinion. The poll appeared in
the Israeli daily Yediot Aharonot.
	   Netanyahu faces a political battle to get the agreement through
his Cabinet and parliament. Many of the hardliners who backed
Netanyahu when he was elected in 1996 oppose the accord, while his
moderate political opponents support it.
	   The poll of 505 Israeli adults was conducted by the local Dahaf
agency. It said the margin of error was 4.5 percentage points.

	   ZVOLEN, Slovakia (AP) _ The congress of the second largest
opposition party approved late on Saturday the participation of
ethnic Hungarians in the future coalition government, media
reported Sunday.
	   The Party of the Democratic Left has been the only one of the
four opposition parties so far to oppose participation of the
Hungarian Coalition Party in the new government.
	   The Democratic Left was afraid that once in the government, the
Hungarians might call for regional autonomy of the 550,000-strong
Hungarian minority and other contentious issues. Support by the
Hungarians in parliament will allow the new government to enact
constitutional laws.

in elections for a clergy-based assembly that oversees the

	   The results came as no surprise since most moderates had been
dropped from the ballot in advance of Friday's election by a
council that reviews candidates's eligibility and is dominated by
hard-liners.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's conservatives won a decisive victory
in elections for a clergy-based assembly that oversees the
country's supreme leader, official results showed Sunday.
	   The results came as no surprise since most moderates had been
dropped from the ballot in advance of Friday's election by a
council that reviews candidates's eligibility and is dominated by
hard-liners.
	   The results showed that only about 18 million of the 38.5
million eligible voters had bothered to cast ballots.

Chirac, Jospin down; majority demand more in education crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Student discontent, retiree rage, stubborn
unemployment, and transit strikes sparked by youth violence are
finally taking their toll on the once-lofty approval ratings of
France's leaders.
	   A poll published Sunday indicates a sharp drop in the ratings of
both conservative President Jacques Chirac and Socialist Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin.
	   Another survey had most French saying Jospin's education
minister has not done enough to improve aging and overcrowded high
schools, whose students plan to protest nationwide again next
month.
	   ``Chirac-Jospin: the fall'' headlined the Journal de Dimanche in
reporting Chirac's rating in October dropped six points to 56
percent.
	   Jospin, whose ratings once topped 70 percent since he took
office in June last year, got a 54 percent approval rating, down
seven points, according to the IFOP agency poll.
	   Both leaders had profited from France's summer World Cup soccer
victory and from economic growth. But unemployment leveled off at
11.8 percent and the French stock market suffered from the world
financial crisis.
	   Hundreds of thousands of students demonstrated in recent weeks
for more school aid and transit workers staged crippling strikes to
demand more police to fight rising youth violence. Tens of
thousands of retirees marched last week against plans to control
rising state pension costs.
	   The government, meanwhile, is trying to keep the deficit within
3 percent of the gross domestic product, as required by the euro
single currency that takes effect at the end of the year.
	   The Chirac-Jospin poll, conducted Oct. 15-23, surveyed a
nationally representative sampling of 1,850 adults. No margin of
error was given, but polls of that magnitude in France usually
carry an error margin of plus or minus 2-3 percent.
	   Another survey said 55 percent of the French believe Education
Minister Claude Allegre last week failed to adequately answer
demands by students, who plan another nationwide protest Nov. 5.
	   The disapproval widened to 63 percent among the 15-24 age group,
according to the poll, also conducted by IFOP for the Journal de
Dimanche.
	   That poll, conducted after Allegre announced the new measures
Wednesday, surveyed 1,002 people, a nationally representative group
age 15 and above, with a margin of error of 2-3 percent.
	   Allegre said he will hire thousands more personnel, cut class
sizes to 35 by next fall, boost security and make 4 billion francs
(dlrs 730 million) in no-interest loans for regions to rebuild
their schools.
	   He unveiled the measures a day after nearly 300,000 students
protested and after 500,000 took to the streets the week before.
	   Students demand the government hire more teachers, buy more
classroom equipment like computers and reform curricula to better
prepare them for the job market.

Hard-liners win national elections for key Iranian assembly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs, RAISES results, idea of a blow to the moderates,
ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By SCHEHEREZADE FARAMARZI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's conservatives won a decisive victory
in elections for a clergy-based assembly that oversees the
country's supreme leader, official results showed Sunday.
	   The results were expected since most moderates had been dropped
from the ballot in advance of Friday's election by a council that
reviews candidates's eligibility and is dominated by hard-liners.
	   The hard-liners won at least 54 places on the 86-seat Assembly
of Experts and the moderates only 13.
	   Sixteen seats went to candidates whose political affiliation was
unclear _ but who probably lean toward the hard-line camp _ and
three to declared independents, who are believed to be closer the
moderates.
	   The outcome is a blow to moderates who had hoped to use the
Assembly of Experts to curb the absolute powers of the supreme
leader and broaden social and political freedoms for the average
Iranian.
	   In the capital, Tehran, moderate former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani led the polls with 1,682,882 votes. Behind him was
hard-liner Ali Meshkini, the current head of the Assembly of
Experts, with 1,240,524 votes.
	   Hard-liners won 11 of the 16 seats in Tehran and moderates only
five. Among the hard-liners who won in the capital were Mohammad
Yazdi, head of the powerful judiciary, and Ahmad Jannati, who leads
the council that vetted the candidates.
	   The results showed that only about 18 million of the 38.5
million eligible voters had bothered to cast ballots.
	   The official media had reported crowded polling stations and a
massive turnout, but visits to Tehran stations showed many nearly
empty and calls to other parts of the country produced similar
reports.
	   Many Iranians said they stayed away to protest the dropping of
most progressive theologians by the conservative-dominated Council
of Guardians. The council reviewed a list of 396 applicants and
allowed only 167 to run.
	   Friday's voter turnout was in sharp contrast to last year's
presidential elections, when some 30 million cast ballots, 20
million of whom voted for President Mohammad Khatami, who has
presented the biggest challenge to the conservatives since the 1979
Islamic revolution.
	   Some moderate leaders had said in advance they did not expect to
win the balloting but still hoped to use the assembly to focus on
the growing powers granted to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, the country's top Shiite Muslim cleric.
	   The hard-liners want to maintain Khamenei's absolute authority
and have battled Khatami's efforts to grant more freedom to the
press and the arts and reduce Islamic strictures on the average
citizen.

Poisoning of Angolan general discounted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Prelimnary autopsy results
indicate a top Angolan general died of cerebral malaria and not of
poisoning as hardline members of his former rebel group have
claimed.
	   Gen. Arlindo Chenda Pena, a former commander of Angola's UNITA
rebels who later joined the government under a 1994 peace accord,
died at a South African hospital on Oct. 19 at age 42. He had
arrived from Angola already in critical condition.
	   Both UNITA hardliners and dissidents who have split with the
rebel movement claimed Pena was poisoned, but preliminary
post-mortem results indicate cerebral malaria killed him, The
Sunday Indepednent reported.
	   Lab tests for final autopsy results won't be completed for
another two weeks, the Johannesburg newspaper said.

At least 20 arrests as Jewish settlers protest peace accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting of Jewish settler leaders, TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OFRA, West Bank (AP) _ Jewish settlers protesting the new peace
accord staged road-blocking protests across the West Bank on
Sunday. Police said at least 20 settlers were arrested and two
police officers were hurt.
	   Near the settlement of Ofra north of Jerusalem, about 50
settlers and their supporters rushed past Israeli police and sat
cross-legged on the highway. Some settlers wrapped in prayer shawls
held morning prayers at the roadside.
	   There were similar demonstrations throughout the West Bank.
Police also said settlers burned tires at the Karme Tsur settlement
north of Hebron.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was flying home from
Washington as the settlers, once his staunch supporters, took to
the streets to express anger over his agreement to turn more West
Bank land over to the Palestinians in exchange for security
concessions.
	   ``I'm here to show that this is a sad day,'' said Natan El, 38,
an engineer, sitting in the middle of the main north-south highway
through the West Bank. ``We are in danger of losing our land, the
land we have returned to after 2,000 years.''
	   Meanwhile, Israeli politicians from most parties predicted
political turmoil in the wake of the signing of the agreement.
``This government probably won't survive,'' said David Levy, who
quit his post as Netanyahu's foreign minister in January.
	   Twelve of Netanyahu's supporters in the parliament say they will
vote against him in upcoming no-confidence motions. Netanyahu has
only a one-seat majority.
	   The moderate opposition Labor party, which originated the peace
process with the Palestinians, pledges to back the accord in
parliament and refrain from voting no confidence in Netanyahu's
government for two weeks.
	   Sunday's protests marked the first major action by the settlers
since the signing of the accord, which came during the Jewish
Sabbath.
	   With orders to keep the roads open, police arrested 31
protesters, according to Aharon Domb, head of the settlers'
council. The police said more than 20 had been arrested but could
not provide a precise figure.
	   Domb also said 20 settlers, including women and children, were
injured in clashes with police near the settlement of Kadumim.
Police could not confirm any settler injuries, but said two police
were slightly hurt.
	   Israeli police were also on alert for possible attacks by
Palestinian extremists opposed to the accord, according to Israel
radio.
	   The agreement signed at the White House Friday calls for an
Israeli handover of 13.1 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian
civilian control. That means some Jewish settlements will be
surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory, except for access
roads.
	   ``We hoped this moment would never come,'' said Shlomo Filber, a
leader of the settlers' movement.
	   Leaders of the settler council, including mayors of the various
West Bank regions, met at the movement's Jerusalem headquarters to
talk strategy. Settler spokeswoman Yehudit Tayar they were
discussing whether and how to try to bring down the government.
	   ``As diligently as we worked to elect Mr Netanyahu to office,
there is a very good chance that we might do the same even more
diligently to see that the government topple,'' Tayar told The
Associated Press.
	   In a another development, Palestinian security arrested Sheik
Hamed Betawi, a Hamas leader from the West Bank town of Nablus.
According to his family, Betawi, 55, is being held in a Nablus
prison. During the past several weeks, more than two dozen Hamas
activists have been arrested.

Twenty-Two candidates run for Bucharest mayor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ One woman and 21 men were running
Sunday for mayor of this crowded city of 3 million, plagued by
housing problems, pollution and poor infrastructure.
	   To win, a candidate needs to secure 50 percent of the vote;
failing that there will be a second round next week.
	   Turnout was expected to be low with many people indicating they
have lost confidence in the power of authorities to do something
for the benefit of ordinary people.
	   Polls opened at 6 a.m. (0400 GMT) and will close at 9 p.m. (1900
GMT). Polling will be extended to midnight if 50 percent of the 1.7
million voters, needed to make the election valid, do not cast a
ballot.
	   ``An enormous amount needs to be done. Bucharest still looks
untended, mediocre and Balkan,'' said Cornel Nistorescu, director
of the daily Evenimentul Zilei.
	   Sunday's ballot became necessary when Bucharest's last elected
mayor Victor Ciorbea became prime minister in 1996. He resigned
from that job in April, quitting the post of mayor at the same
time.
	   Despite the absence of reliable opinion polls, incumbent mayor
Viorel Lis, who was Ciorbea's deputy, is thought to have the best
chance of winning.
	   His main competitors are Sorin Oprescu, head of Bucharest's
Municipal Hospital, and Alexandru Sassu, minister for relations
with parliament.

Typhoon Babs heads toward south China, flooding Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES death toll in Philippines; TRIMS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Typhoon Babs brought torrential rains and
landslides to Taiwan and lashed Hong Kong with strong winds Sunday
after killing more than 150 people in the Philippines and leaving
hundreds of thousands homeless.
	   The Central Weather Bureau said that at 3 p.m. (0700 GMT), the
typhoon was centered 120 kilometers (72 miles) southwest of Pratas
Island in the South China Sea. Packing sustained winds of 130 kph
(81 mph), Babs was moving northwest at 9 kph (5.4 mph) toward south
China.
	   Its outer fringes brought torrential rains to the whole island
of Taiwan, with Hualien and several other eastern towns recording
more than 500 millimeters (20 inches) of rain in 24 hours,
weathermen said. Authorities evacuated hundreds of people from
their homes near flooded rivers.
	   In Taipei, the main Keelung River has swelled its banks.
One-third of Hsichih town was flooded in waist-high water, and much
of nearby Wutu was also flooded. Rescuers used rubber boats and
trucks to evacuate residents from apartment blocks, officials said.
	   In eastern Ilan, a man was swept into the sea while fishing in
the rough waters. Nine people were injured when their van was hit
by rockslides in eastern Taitung, police said.
	   Several domestic airports were closed, and landslides had halted
traffic and trapped hundreds of people in mountains in central
Taiwan, they said.
	   In Hong Kong, authorities hoisted the No. 3 typhoon signal, a
warning to residents to take precautions as winds were expected to
intensify later in the day.
	   The government said it has opened up several shelters for those
seeking refuge from the storm and that more will be opened if
needed.
	   Red flags were raised at Hong Kong beaches to warn swimmers not
to enter the water because of rough seas. Fishing boats sought
shelter in the harbor.
	   In the Philippines, President Joseph Estrada has declared four
provinces and a city in the worst hit area on the southern tip of
Luzon under a state of calamity. Officials in calamity zones will
be able to use emergency funds and freeze prices of commodities
with little red tape.
	   The Philippine government's Office of Civil Defense said the
death toll from Babs has risen to 151. The fatalities included 71
people who died in landslides in hard-hit Catanduanes island and 41
people who drowned, were electrocuted or died in landslides in
nearby Camarines Sur province.
	   Local officials said entire families died in San Miguel town in
Catanduanes, where virtually every house was damaged. Residents
began burying their dead in two mass graves Saturday.
	   Nearly 400,000 people were forced out of their homes, disaster
relief officials said. Tens of thousands of others were stranded as
ports were shut and ships forbidden to sail.
	   Babs was the second devastating storm to hit the Philippines
this month. Two weeks ago, Super Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74
people in the northern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.
	   Philippine weather forecasters said Sunday they were monitoring
a low pressure area over the Pacific, about 900 kilometers (558
miles) east of the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, that
could strengthen into a storm in two to three days.

Once again, Nebraska rallies to beat Missouri
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Arizona-Northeast Louisiana &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   For the second straight year, the Nebraska-Missouri game came
down to the final play. This time, however, the Cornhuskers didn't
need a miracle catch to win.
	   Seventh-ranked Nebraska rallied to beat No. 19 Missouri 20-13
Saturday behind two second-half touchdown runs by backup
quarterback Monte Christo.
	   The Cornhuskers (7-1, 3-1 Big 12), who trailed 13-3 in the
second quarter, came back to take a 20-13 lead on Christo's 3-yard
keeper with 10:27 left in the game. But Christo, who came off the
bench to replace ailing starter Bobby Newcombe, also gave Missouri
(5-2, 3-1) a final chance by fumbling a snap as Nebraska tried to
run out the clock.
	   After taking over near midfield with 1:38 remaining, Missouri
drove to Nebraska's 22 with nine seconds left. Corby Jones then
threw to John Dausman, who let the ball go through his hands in the
end zone.
	   ``It looked like it had the possibility to get caught,''
Nebraska coach Frank Solich said. ``We had so many bad things
happen to us, I thought a good thing might happen. That was one.''
	   Missouri had time for one more play, but Jones was sacked by
Eric Johnson sacked to end the game. It was Nebraska's 47th
straight home victory and its 20th consecutive win over Missouri.
	   Last year at Missouri, Nebraska tied it on the final play of
regulation when Matt Davison caught a pass in the end zone after it
was kicked by teammate Shevin Wiggins. The Huskers went on to win
in overtime 45-38.
	   In other Top 25 games, it was No. 1 Ohio State 36, Northwestern
10; No. 2 UCLA 28, California 16; No. 3 Tennessee 35, Alabama 18;
No. 4 Kansas State 52, Iowa State 7; No. 6 Florida State 34, No. 20

20, Army 17; No. 22 Tulane 52, Rutgers 24; No. 23 Virginia Tech 41,
Alabama-Birmingham 0; and LSU 41, No. 24 Mississippi State 6.
	   In non-Top 25 games:
	   _ Emporia State's Brian Shay became college football's career
rushing leader when he gained 213 yards in a 56-24 victory over
Central Missouri State. Shay's broke the career mark of 6,320 yards
by Johnny Bailey of Texas A-and-I (now Texas A-and-M-Kingsville)
from 1986-1989.
	   _ Ricky Williams became the leading scorer in NCAA Division I
history, scoring two touchdowns in the last 2:03 as Texas rallied
to beat Baylor 30-20. Williams, who rushed for 259 yards, also
moved up to second place on the Division I rushing list behind
Pittsburgh's Tony Dorsett.
	   _ Auburn, playing one day after the resignation of coach Terry
Bowden, snapped a four-game losing streak with a 32-17 win over
Louisiana Tech.
 &UR; No. 1 Ohio St. 36, Northwestern 10 &QC; 
	   At Evanston, Illinois, David Boston broke an Ohio State record
with his 27th and 28th career touchdowns catches as the Buckeyes
beat Northwestern for the 21st straight time.
	   Joe Germaine had his third straight 300-yard game, throwing for
342 yards and three TDs. The Buckeyes (7-0, 4-0 Big Ten) held
Northwestern (2-6, 0-5) to 48 yards rushing and 11 first downs.
 &UR; No. 2 UCLA 28, California 16 &QC; 
	   At Berkeley, California, Cade McNown threw for two touchdowns
and Jermaine Lewis ran for one and passed for another on a halfback
option as UCLA won its 16th straight game.
	   McNown completed 15 of 27 passes for 182 yards and also
scrambled for 57 yards. The Bruins (6-0, 4-0 Pac-10) are off to
their best start since opening 7-0 in 1988.
 &UR; No. 3 Tennessee 35, Alabama 18 &QC; 
	   At Knoxville, Tennessee, Peerless Price's 100-yard kickoff
return and a sturdy running game gave Tennessee its fourth straight
win over Alabama.
	   Tennessee (6-0, 4-0 SEC) put together three long scoring drives
to go with Price's return and the defense made it stand up against
the Crimson Tide (4-3, 2-3).
 &UR; No. 4 Kansas St. 52, Iowa St. 7 &QC; 
	   At Manhattan, Kansas, Michael Bishop threw three TD passes
before limping to the sideline and Eric Hickson broke Kansas State
records for career rushing yards and rushing touchdowns.
	   Bishop, who leads the Big 12 in total offense, was favoring his
right leg when he went out with 13 minutes remaining in the third
quarter. He wound up with 270 yards in total offense, including 216
yards passing, as the Wildcats (7-0, 4-0 Big 12) stretched their
school-record winning streak to 15.
 &UR; No. 6 Florida St. 34, No. 20 Georgia Tech 7 &QC; 
	   At Atlanta, Peter Warrick caught two TD passes and scored on a
16-yard reverse as Florida State created a three-way tie for the
ACC lead.
	   The Seminoles (7-1, 4-1) turned a close game into a rout with a
24-point fourth quarter, which included a 60-yard TD run by
Laveranues Coles. The nation's top-ranked defense shut down a Tech
team that had scored 40 points in five straight games. The Yellow
Jackets (5-2, 4-1) fell into a tie for the league lead with Florida
State and Virginia.
 &UR; No. 8 Texas A-and-M 17, No. 25 Texas Tech 10 &QC; 
	   At College Station, Texas, holder Shane Lechler threw an 8-yard
TD pass to Daniel Campbell on a fake field goal to help Texas
A-and-M (7-1, 4-0 Big 12) beat Texas Tech (6-2, 3-2).
 &UR; No. 9 Wisconsin 31, Iowa 0 &QC; 
	   Ron Dayne ran for 164 yards and a touchdown as Wisconsin won in
Iowa City for the first time since 1974. Wisconsin (8-0, 5-0 Big
Ten) won its eighth straight game in one season for the first time
since 1901. 
 &UR; No. 11 Georgia 28, Kentucky 26 &QC; 
	   At Lexington, Kentucky, Georgia quarterback Quincy Carter ran
for 114 yards and passed for 147 and the Bulldogs (6-1, 4-1 SEC)
held on as Kentucky missed a last-second field goal attempt.
	   Kentucky (5-3, 2-3) had a chance to win when Seth Hanson lined
up for a 49-yard field goal try with 10 seconds left. But Jimmy
Haley's snap went awry and holder Matt Mumme couldn't place the
ball.
 &UR; No. 12 Oregon 17, Southern California 13 &QC; 
	   At Eugene, Oregon, quarterback Akili Smith sprinted 62 yards for
a touchdown early in the fourth quarter to lead Oregon.
	   Smith also threw a 55-yard TD pass to Tony Hartley in the third
quarter for Oregon (6-1, 3-1 Pac-10), which rebounded from an
overtime loss to UCLA last week.
 &UR; Miami 34, No. 13 West Virginia 31 &QC; 
	   At Morgantown, West Virginia, Scott Covington hit Daryl Jones
with a 3-yard touchdown pass with 1:37 left to give Miami the
victory.
	   West Virginia (4-2, 1-1 Big East) had a chance to force
overtime, but Jay Taylor missed a 53-yard field attempt. Edgerrin
James scored three touchdowns for Miami (4-2, 2-1), which beat a
ranked team for the first time since 1996.
 &UR; No. 14 Arizona 45, Northeast Louisiana 7 &QC; 
	   At Tucson, Arizona, Keith Smith threw two touchdown passes to
Dennis Northcutt and ran for a third score, all in the first 15:07.
	   The Wildcats (7-1) scored touchdowns on five of their first six
possessions against the overmatched Indians (2-5), who have been
outscored 149-24 in road games against Kansas State, Florida and
Arizona.
 &UR; No. 16 Virginia 23, North Carolina St. 13 &QC; 
	   At Charlottesville, Virginia, Thomas Jones rushed for 117 yards
and two touchdowns for Virginia (6-1, 4-1 ACC).
	   The Wolfpack (4-3, 2-2) lost for the first time in three games
against ranked teams despite getting 202 rushing yards from
freshman Ray Robinson.
 &UR; Kansas 33, No. 17 Colorado 17 &QC; 
	   At Lawrence, Kansas, David Winbush rushed for a career-high 268
yards, the most ever allowed by Colorado (6-2, 3-2 Big 12), and
scored three touchdowns.
	   Tim Bowers scored on a 48-yard fumble return for Kansas (2-5,
1-5), which broke a 10-game losing streak against ranked teams.
 &UR; No. 18 Notre Dame 20, Army 17 &QC; 
	   At South Bend, Indiana, Jim Sanson kicked a career-best 48-yard
field goal with 1:06 left to lift Notre Dame (5-1).
	   Johnny Sanders sealed the win when he intercepted a pass by
Johnny Goff at the Irish 37 with eight seconds left. Army (2-5)
tied the game 17-17 on Craig Stucker's 19-yard TD run with 10
minutes left.
 &UR; No. 22 Tulane 52, Rutgers 24 &QC; 
	   At Piscataway, New Jersey, Shaun King threw four TD passes and
ran for two scores as Tulane improved to 6-0 for the first time
since 1973.
	   King guided the Green Wave to five touchdowns and a field goal
on their six first-half possessions against Rutgers (3-4). He
finished 23-of-27 for 320 yards and carried 10 times for 31 yards.
 &UR; No. 23 Virginia Tech 41, Alabama-Birmingham 0 &QC; 
	   At Birmingham, Alabama, Lamont Pegues rushed for 127 yards and a
touchdown and Virginia Tech used a dominating defense to rebound
from its shocking loss to Temple.
	   Tech (6-1) allowed only 94 yards in its third shutout of the
season and second straight against UAB (2-5), which never crossed
midfield.
 &UR; LSU 41, No. 24 Mississippi St. 6 &QC; 
	   At Baton Rouge, Louisiana., Kevin Faulk became LSU's career
rushing leader and scored three touchdowns as the Tigers (4-3, 2-3
SEC) snapped a three-game losing streak.
	   Faulk rushed for 123 yards to boost his career total to 4,079,
breaking the school record of 4,050 by Dalton Hilliard. Mississippi
State (5-2, 3-1) has lost seven in a row to LSU.

Hard-liners win national elections for key Iranian assembly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs, RAISES results, idea of a blow to the moderates,
ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By SCHEHEREZADE FARAMARZI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's conservatives won a decisive victory
in elections for a clergy-based assembly that oversees the
country's supreme leader, official results showed Sunday.
	   The results were expected since most moderates had been dropped
from the ballot in advance of Friday's election by a council that
reviews candidates's eligibility and is dominated by hard-liners.
	   The hard-liners won at least 54 places on the 86-seat Assembly
of Experts and the moderates only 13.
	   Sixteen seats went to candidates whose political affiliation was
unclear _ but who probably lean toward the hard-line camp _ and
three to declared independents, who are believed to be closer to
the moderates.
	   The outcome is a blow to moderates who had hoped to use the
Assembly of Experts to curb the absolute powers of the supreme
leader and broaden social and political freedoms for the average
Iranian.
	   In the capital, Tehran, moderate former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani led the polls with 1,682,882 votes. Behind him was
hard-liner Ali Meshkini, the current head of the Assembly of
Experts, with 1,240,524 votes.
	   Hard-liners won 11 of the 16 seats in Tehran and moderates only
five. Among the hard-liners who won in the capital were Mohammad
Yazdi, head of the powerful judiciary, and Ahmad Jannati, who leads
the council that vetted the candidates.
	   The results showed that only about 18 million of the 38.5
million eligible voters had bothered to cast ballots.
	   The official media had reported crowded polling stations and a
massive turnout, but visits to Tehran stations showed many nearly
empty and calls to other parts of the country produced similar
reports.
	   Many Iranians said they stayed away to protest the dropping of
most progressive theologians by the conservative-dominated Council
of Guardians. The council reviewed a list of 396 applicants and
allowed only 167 to run.
	   Friday's voter turnout was in sharp contrast to last year's
presidential elections, when some 30 million cast ballots, 20
million of whom voted for President Mohammad Khatami, who has
presented the biggest challenge to the conservatives since the 1979
Islamic revolution.
	   Some moderate leaders had said in advance they did not expect to
win the balloting but still hoped to use the assembly to focus on
the growing powers granted to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, the country's top Shiite Muslim cleric.
	   The hard-liners want to maintain Khamenei's absolute authority
and have battled Khatami's efforts to grant more freedom to the
press and the arts and reduce Islamic strictures on the average
citizen.

Israel allows more Palestinian workers to enter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel on Sunday allowed 20,000 more
Palestinian workers from the West Bank and Gaza Strip to enter
Israel, bringing the total to 54,000.
	   The step takes the the Palestinian workforce in Israel back to
nearly full strength. About 60,000 Palestinians have permits to
work in Israel.
	   In recent weeks, Israel has gradually raised the number of
Palestinian workers allowed in, after imposing strict closures of
the Palestinian lands during recent Jewish holidays.
	   Israel had sealed its border with the West Bank and Gaza on
Sept. 20, just before the start of the Jewish holidays, which began
with the New Year, followed by Yom Kippur and Sukkot, or the Feast
of the Tabernacles.
	   That followed warnings by the Islamic militant group Hamas that
it would carry out major attacks or kidnap Israeli soldiers.
	   Closures cause extensive economic hardship in the Palestinian
areas, where unemployment is high. Palestinian leaders and human
rights groups have condemned the practice as collective punishment.

British teen-ager killed in suspected hit-and-run accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ A British teen-ager has been killed in
what police suspect is a hit-and-run accident, the Gulf Daily News
reported.
	   Gregor Lowe, 17, was found dead early Friday near the town of
Budaiya, some 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) southwest of the capital
Manama, with broken knees and a head injury, the English-language
newspaper said.
	   British Embassy spokeswoman Caroline Alcock said that the
embassy had been notified of Lowe's death and that an autopsy was
to be carried out.
	   The newspaper did not say where Lowe was from in Britain, and
the embassy also did not have that information.
	   There are about 5,500 Briton living and working in Bahrain.

Human rights group demands Mahathir resign after riots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mahathir comments, grafs 18-20 &QL; 
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A leading Malaysian human rights
group demanded Sunday that Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad resign
after police clashes with anti-government rioters erupted into
chaos.
	   An anti-government protest that lasted until after midnight
Saturday became a riot when hundreds of police shot water laced
with stinging pepper spray at thousands of demonstrators and
bombarded a mosque with tear gas.
	   More than 241 people were arrested in the rally that spread
through various parts of the capital for more than eight hours.
Injuries resulted on both sides. Calm had returned to the capital
by Sunday.
	   ``The prime minister, who is also home minister, must accept
full responsibility for having totally mishandled the situation,''
said a statement issued by the human rights group Suaram.
	   Mahathir, who has ruled for 17 years, is also in charge of the
police force.
	   ``He cannot ignore the legitimate discontent of the people. We
call upon the prime minister to resign so that a general election
may be held,'' the statement added.
	   Demonstrators have staged a series of protests since ousted
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim was jailed Sept. 20. Protesters
demand political reforms, an end to Mahathir's rule and Anwar's
release.
	   Saturday's demonstration, however, marked a defiant turning
point as protesters turned violent against police, who have
declared all demonstrations in support of Anwar illegal.
	   The former heir apparent to Mahathir has pleaded innocent to 10
charges of graft and sexual misconduct and will stand trial
beginning Nov. 2. Anwar, who has been denied bail, has condemned
the charges as false and politically motivated.
	   The opposition leader of parliament, Lim Kit Siang, in a
statement issued Sunday, called for an independent investigation
into Saturday's violence, saying it was sparked by ``very cruel
police handling of unarmed and peaceable people.''
	   Meanwhile, a senior Cabinet minister warned that continued
rioting could not be tolerated, given the May riots in Indonesia
that led to ex-President Suharto's ouster.
	   ``Demonstrations in Malaysia have now entered a dangerous phase
with the use of force,'' Education Minister Najib Tun Razak was
quoted as saying by the Bernama news agency. He urged authorities
to be firm with protesters in the name of maintaining order.
	   The government has threatened to arrest demonstrators under the
country's dreaded Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite
detention without trial.
	   At the afternoon demonstration Saturday, protesters taunted
police in a downtown shopping district. Officers warned women and
children to get off the streets, which were packed with weekend
shoppers. Then huge police trucks sprayed the crowd with powerful
jets of water laced with a pepper chemical.
	   It filled the streets with a blue foam and scattered thousands
of people, crying and coughing from the stinging chemical.
	   Police in civilian clothes, some wearing ski masks, chased
people through department stores and down side streets, grabbing
them and tossing them into waiting vans. Some were slapped, kicked
and wrestled to the ground.
	   Some of those detained Saturday were holding shopping bags and
it was unclear whether they were passers-by or had intended to join
the demonstration.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir accused rioters of using women and
children as shields.
	   ``Don't blame the government if children are burned during the
rioting as the authorities have discovered `Molotov cocktails' and
kerosene at the scene,'' he said Sunday.
	   ``The groups calling themselves reformists seeking to uphold
justice are the ones who are breaking the law,'' he said.
	   Police followed protesters to a mosque where they had gathered
for evening prayers and to regroup. Police lobbed tear gas into the
building and protesters responded by chasing officers and pelting
them with stones. Others hurled bricks.
	   Rioters set fire to a pile of tires and debris dragged from
roadside garbage bins, creating a bonfire in the middle of one
street, the Star newspaper reported.
	   An Anwar supporter who asked not to be identified said the
afternoon protest turned ugly when police began arresting people at
random.
	   ``It's sheer frustration,'' he said.

At least 20 arrests as Jewish settlers protest peace accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting of Jewish settler leaders, TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OFRA, West Bank (AP) _ Jewish settlers protesting the new peace
accord staged road-blocking protests across the West Bank on
Sunday. Police said at least 20 settlers were arrested and two
police officers were hurt.
	   Near the settlement of Ofra north of Jerusalem, about 50
settlers and their supporters rushed past Israeli police and sat
cross-legged on the highway. Some wrapped in prayer shawls held
morning prayers at the roadside.
	   There were similar demonstrations throughout the West Bank.
Police also said settlers burned tires at the Karme Tsur settlement
north of Hebron.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was flying home from
Washington as the settlers, once his staunch supporters, took to
the streets to express anger over his agreement to turn more West
Bank land over to the Palestinians in exchange for security
concessions.
	   ``I'm here to show that this is a sad day,'' said Natan El, 38,
an engineer, sitting in the middle of the main north-south highway
through the West Bank. ``We are in danger of losing our land, the
land we have returned to after 2,000 years.''
	   Meanwhile, Israeli politicians from most parties predicted
political turmoil in the wake of the signing. ``This government
probably won't survive,'' said David Levy, who quit his post as
Netanyahu's foreign minister in January.
	   Twelve of Netanyahu's supporters in the parliament say they will
vote against him in upcoming no-confidence motions. Netanyahu has
only a one-seat majority.
	   The moderate opposition Labor party, which originated the peace
process with the Palestinians, pledges to back the accord in
parliament and refrain from voting no confidence in Netanyahu's
government for two weeks.
	   Sunday's protests marked the first major action by the settlers
since the signing, which came during the Jewish Sabbath.
	   With orders to keep the roads open, police arrested 31
protesters, according to Aharon Domb, head of the settlers'
council. Police said more than 20 had been arrested.
	   Domb also said 20 settlers, including women and children, were
injured in clashes with police officers near the settlement of
Kadumim. Police could not confirm any settler injuries, but said
two police were slightly hurt.
	   The agreement signed at the White House Friday calls for an
Israeli handover of 13.1 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian
civilian control. That means some Jewish settlements will be
surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory, except for access
roads.
	   Leaders of the settler council, including mayors of the various
West Bank regions, met at the movement's Jerusalem headquarters to
talk strategy. Settler spokeswoman Yehudit Tayar they were
discussing whether and how to try to bring down the government.
	   ``As diligently as we worked to elect Mr Netanyahu to office,
there is a very good chance that we might do the same even more
diligently to see that the government topples,'' Tayar told The
Associated Press.
	   In another development, Palestinian security arrested Sheik
Hamed Betawi, a Hamas leader from the West Bank town of Nablus.
According to his family, Betawi, 55, is being held in a Nablus
prison. During the past several weeks, more than two dozen Hamas
activists have been arrested.

Yeltsin to discuss trade, economic help during trip to Austria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin will meet with
international lenders, sign economic agreements, and discuss NATO
expansion during a one-day visit to Austria this week.
	   Yeltsin, dogged by health problems that forced him to cancel a
visit to Malaysia later this year, will meet with Austrian
Chancellor Viktor Klima, the present holder of the rotating
European Union chairmanship.
	   The two are expected to discuss security issues, including the
recent Middle East peace agreement and the crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in Yugoslavia's Kosovo Province.
	   The 67-year-old Yeltsin's trip had originally been announced as
a two-day visit. His latest illness, described as a respiratory
infection, forced him to cut short a visit to Central Asia last
week, and he has spent much of his time since then in country
residences.
	   Accompanied by high level officials, among them Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov, Yeltsin will
also meet with International Monetary Fund and World Bank officials
to debate economic assistance to Russia.
	   So far the IMF has been reluctant to release the next part of a
22.6 billion dollar loan package created for Russia earlier this
summer.
	   Russian delegates will sign a number of economic agreements that
should bring dlrs 600 million in direct investment to Russia, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The agreements include joint venture contracts, a program to
train Russian managers abroad and create ecologically safe sewage
systems in one Russian city.
	   Yeltsin has been weakened by recurring health problems in recent
years, including heart bypass surgery in 1996. He has kept an
increasingly low political profile, going to the Kremlin two or
three days a week.
	   The president and his doctors insist that Yeltsin will serve out
the less than two years that remain of his term, and they deny that
he has serious health problems.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Traffic in central Madrid came to halt
Sunday as some 2,000 sheep were herded throught the city as part of
an annual procession to highlight the need to protect Spain's
ancient transhumance routes.
	   With bleating interspersed with the tinkling of bells making a
welcome substitute from the customary car horns of this busy city,
dozens of people lined the sidewalks as the merinos trotted through
Alcala street, the central Puerta del Sol square and out to the
Casa de Campo parkland on the city's southwestern outskirts.
	   The herding, staged each October for the past five years, is to
highlight the need for national and local authorities to protect
Spain's 125,000 kilometers (78,000 miles) of transhumance routes,
some of them dating back 800 years.
	   Shepherds and ecologists claim many of the paths have been
destroyed by the spread of cities and towns.
	   Madrid's lies along two of the north-south transhumance routes.
	   On Monday, the flock will continue its march to the more
temperate southwestern pastures of Extremadura after spending the
summer months in the cooler northern region of Leon.

Once again, Nebraska rallies to beat Missouri
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to add dateline
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Arizona-Northeast Louisiana &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ For the second straight year, the
Nebraska-Missouri game came down to the final play. This time,
however, the Cornhuskers didn't need a miracle catch to win.
	   Seventh-ranked Nebraska rallied to beat No. 19 Missouri 20-13
Saturday behind two second-half touchdown runs by backup
quarterback Monte Christo.
	   The Cornhuskers (7-1, 3-1 Big 12), who trailed 13-3 in the
second quarter, came back to take a 20-13 lead on Christo's 3-yard
keeper with 10:27 left in the game. But Christo, who came off the
bench to replace ailing starter Bobby Newcombe, also gave Missouri
(5-2, 3-1) a final chance by fumbling a snap as Nebraska tried to
run out the clock.
	   After taking over near midfield with 1:38 remaining, Missouri
drove to Nebraska's 22 with nine seconds left. Corby Jones then
threw to John Dausman, who let the ball go through his hands in the
end zone.
	   ``It looked like it had the possibility to get caught,''
Nebraska coach Frank Solich said. ``We had so many bad things
happen to us, I thought a good thing might happen. That was one.''
	   Missouri had time for one more play, but Jones was sacked by
Eric Johnson sacked to end the game. It was Nebraska's 47th
straight home victory and its 20th consecutive win over Missouri.
	   Last year at Missouri, Nebraska tied it on the final play of
regulation when Matt Davison caught a pass in the end zone after it
was kicked by teammate Shevin Wiggins. The Huskers went on to win
in overtime 45-38.
	   In other Top 25 games, it was No. 1 Ohio State 36, Northwestern
10; No. 2 UCLA 28, California 16; No. 3 Tennessee 35, Alabama 18;
No. 4 Kansas State 52, Iowa State 7; No. 6 Florida State 34, No. 20

20, Army 17; No. 22 Tulane 52, Rutgers 24; No. 23 Virginia Tech 41,
Alabama-Birmingham 0; and LSU 41, No. 24 Mississippi State 6.
	   In non-Top 25 games:
	   _ Emporia State's Brian Shay became college football's career
rushing leader when he gained 213 yards in a 56-24 victory over
Central Missouri State. Shay's broke the career mark of 6,320 yards
by Johnny Bailey of Texas A-and-I (now Texas A-and-M-Kingsville)
from 1986-1989.
	   _ Ricky Williams became the leading scorer in NCAA Division I
history, scoring two touchdowns in the last 2:03 as Texas rallied
to beat Baylor 30-20. Williams, who rushed for 259 yards, also
moved up to second place on the Division I rushing list behind
Pittsburgh's Tony Dorsett.
	   _ Auburn, playing one day after the resignation of coach Terry
Bowden, snapped a four-game losing streak with a 32-17 win over
Louisiana Tech.
 &UR; No. 1 Ohio St. 36, Northwestern 10 &QC; 
	   At Evanston, Illinois, David Boston broke an Ohio State record
with his 27th and 28th career touchdowns catches as the Buckeyes
beat Northwestern for the 21st straight time.
	   Joe Germaine had his third straight 300-yard game, throwing for
342 yards and three TDs. The Buckeyes (7-0, 4-0 Big Ten) held
Northwestern (2-6, 0-5) to 48 yards rushing and 11 first downs.
 &UR; No. 2 UCLA 28, California 16 &QC; 
	   At Berkeley, California, Cade McNown threw for two touchdowns
and Jermaine Lewis ran for one and passed for another on a halfback
option as UCLA won its 16th straight game.
	   McNown completed 15 of 27 passes for 182 yards and also
scrambled for 57 yards. The Bruins (6-0, 4-0 Pac-10) are off to
their best start since opening 7-0 in 1988.
 &UR; No. 3 Tennessee 35, Alabama 18 &QC; 
	   At Knoxville, Tennessee, Peerless Price's 100-yard kickoff
return and a sturdy running game gave Tennessee its fourth straight
win over Alabama.
	   Tennessee (6-0, 4-0 SEC) put together three long scoring drives
to go with Price's return and the defense made it stand up against
the Crimson Tide (4-3, 2-3).
 &UR; No. 4 Kansas St. 52, Iowa St. 7 &QC; 
	   At Manhattan, Kansas, Michael Bishop threw three TD passes
before limping to the sideline and Eric Hickson broke Kansas State
records for career rushing yards and rushing touchdowns.
	   Bishop, who leads the Big 12 in total offense, was favoring his
right leg when he went out with 13 minutes remaining in the third
quarter. He wound up with 270 yards in total offense, including 216
yards passing, as the Wildcats (7-0, 4-0 Big 12) stretched their
school-record winning streak to 15.
 &UR; No. 6 Florida St. 34, No. 20 Georgia Tech 7 &QC; 
	   At Atlanta, Peter Warrick caught two TD passes and scored on a
16-yard reverse as Florida State created a three-way tie for the
ACC lead.
	   The Seminoles (7-1, 4-1) turned a close game into a rout with a
24-point fourth quarter, which included a 60-yard TD run by
Laveranues Coles. The nation's top-ranked defense shut down a Tech
team that had scored 40 points in five straight games. The Yellow
Jackets (5-2, 4-1) fell into a tie for the league lead with Florida
State and Virginia.
 &UR; No. 8 Texas A-and-M 17, No. 25 Texas Tech 10 &QC; 
	   At College Station, Texas, holder Shane Lechler threw an 8-yard
TD pass to Daniel Campbell on a fake field goal to help Texas
A-and-M (7-1, 4-0 Big 12) beat Texas Tech (6-2, 3-2).
 &UR; No. 9 Wisconsin 31, Iowa 0 &QC; 
	   Ron Dayne ran for 164 yards and a touchdown as Wisconsin won in
Iowa City for the first time since 1974. Wisconsin (8-0, 5-0 Big
Ten) won its eighth straight game in one season for the first time
since 1901. 
 &UR; No. 11 Georgia 28, Kentucky 26 &QC; 
	   At Lexington, Kentucky, Georgia quarterback Quincy Carter ran
for 114 yards and passed for 147 and the Bulldogs (6-1, 4-1 SEC)
held on as Kentucky missed a last-second field goal attempt.
	   Kentucky (5-3, 2-3) had a chance to win when Seth Hanson lined
up for a 49-yard field goal try with 10 seconds left. But Jimmy
Haley's snap went awry and holder Matt Mumme couldn't place the
ball.
 &UR; No. 12 Oregon 17, Southern California 13 &QC; 
	   At Eugene, Oregon, quarterback Akili Smith sprinted 62 yards for
a touchdown early in the fourth quarter to lead Oregon.
	   Smith also threw a 55-yard TD pass to Tony Hartley in the third
quarter for Oregon (6-1, 3-1 Pac-10), which rebounded from an
overtime loss to UCLA last week.
 &UR; Miami 34, No. 13 West Virginia 31 &QC; 
	   At Morgantown, West Virginia, Scott Covington hit Daryl Jones
with a 3-yard touchdown pass with 1:37 left to give Miami the
victory.
	   West Virginia (4-2, 1-1 Big East) had a chance to force
overtime, but Jay Taylor missed a 53-yard field attempt. Edgerrin
James scored three touchdowns for Miami (4-2, 2-1), which beat a
ranked team for the first time since 1996.
 &UR; No. 14 Arizona 45, Northeast Louisiana 7 &QC; 
	   At Tucson, Arizona, Keith Smith threw two touchdown passes to
Dennis Northcutt and ran for a third score, all in the first 15:07.
	   The Wildcats (7-1) scored touchdowns on five of their first six
possessions against the overmatched Indians (2-5), who have been
outscored 149-24 in road games against Kansas State, Florida and
Arizona.
 &UR; No. 16 Virginia 23, North Carolina St. 13 &QC; 
	   At Charlottesville, Virginia, Thomas Jones rushed for 117 yards
and two touchdowns for Virginia (6-1, 4-1 ACC).
	   The Wolfpack (4-3, 2-2) lost for the first time in three games
against ranked teams despite getting 202 rushing yards from
freshman Ray Robinson.
 &UR; Kansas 33, No. 17 Colorado 17 &QC; 
	   At Lawrence, Kansas, David Winbush rushed for a career-high 268
yards, the most ever allowed by Colorado (6-2, 3-2 Big 12), and
scored three touchdowns.
	   Tim Bowers scored on a 48-yard fumble return for Kansas (2-5,
1-5), which broke a 10-game losing streak against ranked teams.
 &UR; No. 18 Notre Dame 20, Army 17 &QC; 
	   At South Bend, Indiana, Jim Sanson kicked a career-best 48-yard
field goal with 1:06 left to lift Notre Dame (5-1).
	   Johnny Sanders sealed the win when he intercepted a pass by
Johnny Goff at the Irish 37 with eight seconds left. Army (2-5)
tied the game 17-17 on Craig Stucker's 19-yard TD run with 10
minutes left.
 &UR; No. 22 Tulane 52, Rutgers 24 &QC; 
	   At Piscataway, New Jersey, Shaun King threw four TD passes and
ran for two scores as Tulane improved to 6-0 for the first time
since 1973.
	   King guided the Green Wave to five touchdowns and a field goal

finished 23-of-27 for 320 yards and carried 10 times for 31 yards.
 &UR; No. 23 Virginia Tech 41, Alabama-Birmingham 0 &QC; 
	   At Birmingham, Alabama, Lamont Pegues rushed for 127 yards and a
touchdown and Virginia Tech used a dominating defense to rebound
from its shocking loss to Temple.
	   Tech (6-1) allowed only 94 yards in its third shutout of the
season and second straight against UAB (2-5), which never crossed
midfield.
 &UR; LSU 41, No. 24 Mississippi St. 6 &QC; 
	   At Baton Rouge, Louisiana., Kevin Faulk became LSU's career
rushing leader and scored three touchdowns as the Tigers (4-3, 2-3
SEC) snapped a three-game losing streak.
	   Faulk rushed for 123 yards to boost his career total to 4,079,
breaking the school record of 4,050 by Dalton Hilliard. Mississippi
State (5-2, 3-1) has lost seven in a row to LSU.

Report: Opposition official kidnapped in Gabon

<TEXT>
	   LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) _ An official of Gabon's main opposition
party, the Assembly of Lumberjacks, was kidnapped in the capital
overnight by men claiming to be security agents, a private radio
station reported Sunday.
	   Gen. Simon Letomatome, political adviser to the party was seized
late Friday night at his home in the working class suburb of
Cocotier, the party was cited as saying in a statement to
Libreville-based Africa No. 1 Radio.
	   The party, which is led by a Roman Catholic Priest, Rev. Paul
Mba Abessole, accuses President Omar Bongo's government of
corruption and mismanagement.
	   Bongo, who has ruled this oil-rich central African country for
more than three decades, agreed to legalize political opposition
parties only after fierce pro-democracy protests in the early
1990s. Bongo won 1993 elections with a 51 percent majority over the
second-place Assembly of Lumberjacks.
	   Elections are planned again for December.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Four years after the end of
apartheid, a black has for the first time joined South Africa's
national rugby squad _ a sport dominated by Afrikaner descendants
of Dutch settlers.
	   Owen Nkumane, who plays for the local Golden Lions team, was
named to the world-champion Springbok squad for next month's tour
to the United Kingdom.
	   ``I am still shocked. I really can't believe it,'' Nkumane told
the South African Press Association after he was named to the squad
on Saturday along with 35 other players.
	   Nkumane, 23, was also the first black to play for the Golden
Lions.
	   Springbok Coach Nick Mallett said the ball was now in Nkumane's
court.
	   ``It's a good chance to see what he can do in good company.
Let's wait and see what he can do,'' Mallett said.
	   Former Springbok prop Balie Swart said Nkumane will have to win
the respect of his teammates.
	   ``Now that he is a Springbok all the other guys will be trying
to shoot him down and he will have to show he's got what it
takes,'' Swart was quoted as saying in the Sunday Times, a
Johannesburg newspaper.
	   Rugby, a bastion of whites who ruled under apartheid, has been
undergoing transformation along with the rest of South Africa since
white rule ended with the country's first all-race elections in
1994.
	   President Nelson Mandela cheered the Springboks on to their 1995
World Cup victory, using the team as a symbol of reconciliation.
But when he named a committee to investigate allegations of racism,
corruption and nepotism in the South African Rugby Football Union,
the group tried to block the probe.
	   SARFU President Loius Luyt resigned as a result of the
confrontation. On Sept. 1, the union elected its first black
president, Silas Nkanunu. A handful of mixed-race players have
previously played for the Springboks.
	   Racial barriers have also been broken in cricket, another sport
favored mostly by whites.
	   On Jan. 16, paceman Makhaya Ntini became the first black player
to represent South Africa in an international cricket test.

Iraq derides U.S. funding aimed at toppling Saddam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An official Iraqi newspaper on Sunday
derided a U.S. Congress proposal to spend dlrs 97 million to try to
topple President Saddam Hussein and said the move should be
condemned by the United Nations.
	   The daily Al-Thawra, paper of the ruling Baath Party, raised the
question of how Washington would react if Iraq adopted a measure
directed at U.S. leaders similar to the bill passed by both the
U.S. House and Senate in early October.
	   ``Would the American administration accept this?'' the paper
asked.
	   ``The American administration would not only refuse such
behavior, it would even complain to the Security Council ... and
consider Iraq's move an act of terrorism,'' said the paper.
	   The U.S. measure, which would fund Iraqi opposition groups, has
not yet been approved by the White House. It has been criticized as
a misstep or waste of money by some in the American intelligence
community and even some Iraqi opposition groups.
	   Al-Thawra said the move should be condemned by the U.N. Security
Council and the Arab League. On Oct. 20, the Iraqi government sent
a letter to the Security Council asking it to stop ``illegal U.S.
acts'' against Iraq, listing among them the effort to topple
Saddam.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Four years after the end of
apartheid, a black has for the first time joined South Africa's
national rugby squad _ a sport dominated by Afrikaner descendants
of Dutch settlers.
	   Owen Nkumane, who plays for the local Golden Lions team, was
named to the world-champion Springbok squad for next month's tour
to the United Kingdom.
	   ``I am still shocked. I really can't believe it,'' Nkumane told
the South African Press Association after he was named to the squad
on Saturday along with 35 other players.
	   Nkumane, 23, was also the first black to play for the Golden
Lions.
	   Springbok Coach Nick Mallett said the ball was now in Nkumane's
court.
	   ``It's a good chance to see what he can do in good company.
Let's wait and see what he can do,'' Mallett said.
	   Former Springbok prop Balie Swart said Nkumane will have to win
the respect of his teammates.
	   ``Now that he is a Springbok all the other guys will be trying
to shoot him down and he will have to show he's got what it
takes,'' Swart was quoted as saying in the Sunday Times, a
Johannesburg newspaper.
	   Rugby, a bastion of whites who ruled under apartheid, has been
undergoing transformation along with the rest of South Africa since
white rule ended with the country's first all-race elections in
1994.
	   President Nelson Mandela cheered the Springboks on to their 1995
World Cup victory, using the team as a symbol of reconciliation.
But when he named a committee to investigate allegations of racism,
corruption and nepotism in the South African Rugby Football Union,
the group tried to block the probe.
	   SARFU President Loius Luyt resigned as a result of the
confrontation. On Sept. 1, the union elected its first black
president, Silas Nkanunu. A handful of mixed-race players have
previously played for the Springboks.
	   Racial barriers have also been broken in cricket, another sport
favored mostly by whites.
	   On Jan. 16, paceman Makhaya Ntini became the first black player
to represent South Africa in an international cricket test.

Palestinian factional fighting injures at least one
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ In a rare outbreak of fighting
between Palestinian groups, about 100 members of Yasser Arafat's
Fatah faction battled Palestinian security forces, throwing rocks
and firing in the air.
	   At least one man was shot and wounded. The center of the West
Bank town of Ramallah was a chaotic scene, with burning tires and
overturned trash cans. Shops were quickly shuttered and the area
was closed off.
	   The injured man was taken to Ramallah hospital with a gunshot
wound to the head.
	   A senior Fatah official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the confrontation was apparently sparked by a search Saturday
night of Fatah headquarters by members of Palestinian intelligence.
	   The searchers looked through files and seized weapons, the
official said.
	   Police in riot gear moved in to try to break up the fighting,
firing tear gas. The clash, near Palestinian Authority
headquarters, was in a Palestinian-controlled area, and Israeli
troops were not involved.

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The Red Crescent society
brought Dolphins to this Gulf emirate for the first time Sunday,
hoping to raise money for needy children by entertaining other
youngsters and their parents.
	   The dolphins flown in from Italy _ Pele, Aida and Elena _ were
to perform daily for two months starting Sunday in a tent seating
800 people. The one-hour show will then move to the cities of Al
Ain and Dubai.
	   ``We will give away tickets to orphans and handicapped children,
but the money raised will go towards our work in the country and
abroad,'' said Red Crescent Society official Nabil Zahra.
	   The Red Crescent, the Muslim equivalent of the Red Cross, hopes
the show will raise dlrs one million. It will charge 25 dirhams
(dlrs 7) for each child attending with school classes and from 35
to 100 dirhams (dlrs 9.5-27) for other tickets.
	   The Emirates Red Crescent helps orphans, handicapped children
and needy families. It has been active in Iraq and, more recently,
in war-torn Kosovo where it sponsors orphans and has flown in food
and medicine.

<TEXT>
	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ Austrian skiers clocked the four fastest
times in the first leg of the men's World Cup season opening giant
slalom Sunday, with Hermann Maier in the lead.
	   The double Olympic champion covered the 368-meter (1,207 foot)
wind-swept Rettenbach course in 1 minute 5.12 seconds, almost a
full second ahead of his closest contender, teammate Stefan
Eberharter.
	   Compatriots Heinz Schilchegger and Josef Strobl had the next
best times, setting up an all Austrian sweep of the podium.
	   With Eberharter trailing him by a substantial .87 seconds,
anything short of a fall would almost guarantee Maier his first win
of the season.
	   Schilchegger negotiated the 45 gates in 1:06.14, edging teammate
Josef Strobl by .01.
	   Italy's Patrick Holzer clocked the fifth fastest time of
1:06.25, ahead of two-time World Cup champion Michael Von
Gruenigen, 1.36 seconds adrift.
	   Strong winds and heavy snow had forced race officials to delay
the start of the race by more than two hours, while workers cleared
the course and re-erected the start hut, which had been blown down
overnight.

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ About 100 members of Yasser Arafat's
Fatah political faction battled Palestinian security forces Sunday,
throwing rocks and firing shots into the air. At least one man was
seriously wounded.
	   The fighting, a rare show of open conflict between Arafat's
followers, was sparked by a move by Palestinian military
intelligence to seize unlicensed weapons. A Palestinian crackdown
on illegal arms is one of the provisions of the peace accord signed
Friday in Washington.
	   Police in riot gear moved in to try to break up the fighting,
firing tear gas. The clash, in front of Palestinian Authority
headquarters, was in a Palestinian-controlled area, and Israeli
troops were not involved.
	   The center of the West Bank town of Ramallah, the seat of the
Palestinian legislature and site of many government ministries, was
a chaotic scene, with burning tires and overturned trash cans
littering the main downtown street. Merchants quickly shuttered
their shops and the area was closed off.
	   The injured man was taken to Ramallah hospital with a gunshot
wound to the head, the hospital said.
	   A senior Fatah official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the confrontation came after search Saturday night of Fatah
headquarters by members of Palestinian intelligence. The searchers
seized unlicensed weapons and looked through files, the official
said.
	   ``Today we came out to show them they can't do this to us,''
said Fatah member Ismail Abu Sneid, 22, ``And the response was,
they shot one of us, and this is something we are not going to let
pass.''

U.N. envoy in the Emirates to discuss Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ U.N. envoy Lakhdar
Brahimi on Sunday briefed Emirates President Sheik Zayed bin Sultan
Al Nahyan on efforts to ensure peace between Afghanistan's Taliban
rulers and Iran, the Emirates News Agency reported.
	   The Emirates, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are the only states to
have recognized the Taliban militia as Afghanistan's government.
Saudi Arabia, though, last month expelled the Afghan charge
d'affaires and recalled its representative from Kabul.
	   Brahimi told Sheik Zayed of his recent visit to Afghanistan,
which led to the release of 26 Iranian prisoners. He said earlier
this month that the threat of war between the Taliban and Iran had
passed. He also visited Pakistan and Iran.
	   Tensions arose following the slaying of Iranian diplomats by
Taliban forces in a northern Afghan city in August. Iran demanded
punishment for the killers and sent more than 200,000 troops to its
border with Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban, who control 90 percent of Afghanistan, accuses Iran
of supporting the northern-based opposition alliance.

Singapore junior high American football team scores 68, and loses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ When a three-hour junior high championship
football game ended at the Singapore American School _ after 18
lead turnovers _ the Grizzlies had a 68 on the scoreboard.
	   ``I never thought that with scoring 68 you could even lose,''
said coach Martin Sauer. ``I thought people would be coming from
all over the world asking, `How'd you do it?'''
	   But the Grizzlies did lose Saturday.
	   Their opponents, the Cougars, scored 74 in a game that produced
19 touchdowns, awesome offense by both sides, and not much
tackling.
	   The Grizzlies' top scorer was Jacob McMillan, an eighth grader.
He scored five touchdowns in the championship game, and 30 during
the five-game season. Another three members of the multinational
Grizzlies team scored two touchdowns apiece.
	   The winning Cougars ``were probably similar to us. They might
have had two players who scored the majority,'' said Sauer, 44, who
is the Asia-Pacific supply chain director for British-based Burmah
Castrol Pte. Ltd.
	   The rules call for everyone to play. There are only a dozen or
so boys on each team, and eight play at a time, so they switch from
offense to defense.
	   Last year, when the Grizzlies lost the championship game by a
field goal in the last 10 seconds, they were pretty furious. A few
helmets hit the ground.
	   ``At the end of this game, the guys were glad it was over,''
said Sauer. ``They just looked up at the scoreboard, kind of like,
`Wow, what a game.'''

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   OFRA, West Bank (AP) _ Jewish settlers protesting the new peace
accord blocked roads across the West Bank in Sunday protests, that
injured two police officers. Police arrested at least 20 settlers.
IN one such demonstration near the settlement of Ofra north of
Jerusalem, about 50 settlers and their supporters _ some wrapped in
prayer shawls _ rushed past Israeli police and sat cross-legged on
the highway. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was flying
home from Washington as the settlers, once his staunch supporters,
took to the streets to express anger over his agreement to turn
more West Bank land over to the Palestinians in exchange for
security concessions. Meanwhile, Israeli politicians from most
parties predicted political turmoil in the wake of the signing.
``This government probably won't survive,'' said David Levy, who
quit his post as Netanyahu's foreign minister in January.
(ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's conservatives won a decisive victory
in elections for a clergy-based assembly that oversees the
country's supreme leader, official results showed Sunday. The
results were expected since most moderates had been dropped from
the ballot in advance of Friday's election by a council that
reviews candidates' eligibility and is dominated by hard-liners.
The hard-liners won at least 54 places on the 86-seat Assembly of
Experts and the moderates only 13. The outcome is a blow to
moderates who had hoped to use the Assembly of Experts to curb the
absolute powers of the supreme leader and broaden social and
political freedoms for the average Iranian. (IRAN-ELECTIONS)
	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
has called on Basques to shun the pipe dreams of
independence-minded candidates as they vote Sunday in the first
regional elections free of separatist violence. With the northern
region enjoying a five-week respite from violence thanks to a
cease-fire by the armed separatist group ETA, attention is focused
on whether the truce will propel pro-independence parties to
electoral gains. Aznar is hoping a strong turnout will benefit his
party and other groups that do not want a separate homeland for the
Basques. Such a victory would give him more clout in the Basque
country to seek a lasting settlement to one of Western Europe's
last regional conflicts. The 1.8 million voters in the three Basque
provinces will have 11 hours to vote Sunday.
(SPAIN-BASQUE-ELECTION)
	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ The European Union leaders planned
to wrap up a summit Sunday with a pledge to conclude by Spring
months of fruitless talks about reforming the EU before its
enlargement. The impetus to crank the slow-as-molasses reform drive
into high gear came on Saturday from Gerhard Schroeder. The
incoming German chancellor set a five-month timetable to amend the
EU charter so the now 15-member union can admit a dozen newcomers
and not choke on its own red tape. Priorities include cutting
subsidies to farmers, revamping EU finances and giving the union a
stronger defense and foreign policy profile. (EU-SUMMIT)
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Typhoon Babs brought torrential rains and
landslides to Taiwan and lashed Hong Kong with strong winds Sunday
after killing more than 150 people in the Philippines and leaving
hundreds of thousands homeless. Packing sustained winds of 130 kph
(81 mph), Babs was moving northwest at 9 kph (5.5 mph) toward south
China on Sunday afternoon. Its outer fringes brought torrential
rains to the whole island of Taiwan, with Hualien and several other
eastern towns recording more than 50 centimeters (20 inches) of
rain in 24 hours, weathermen said. Authorities evacuated hundreds
of people from their homes near flooded rivers. In Taipei, the main
Keelung River has swelled its banks. (PACIFIC-TYPHOON)

Israeli diplomat: Jordan, Israel achieved much in four-year peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and Israel have made considerable
progress in building political and economic ties in four years of
peace, but the two states still need to do more, Israeli Ambassador
Oded Eran said Sunday.
	   ``We have achieved a lot in the past four years, and we're on
the right track,'' Eran told reporters on the eve of the
anniversary of the 1994 peace treaty that ended five decades of
belligerence between the two Middle East neighbors.
	   Citing official Israeli figures, he said trade in the first six
months of this year grew to dlrs 20 million, or 60 percent more
than in the first half of 1997.
	   He said that several joint ventures in textiles employed
thousands of Jordanian workers and that medium-tech Israeli firms
are seeking to set up offices in Jordan to take advantage of
cheaper labor.
	   But he added that much can still be done to bolster cooperation
in tourism, trade and transportation.
	   ``I admit that there is a lot to be done,'' Eran said.
	   He said many Jordanian firms were still hesitant to deal with
Israel because of a public opposition to normalizing ties until a
final peace is reached with Palestinians.
	   ``If the majority of us wants to get true peace, there is no
other way but to normalize relations,'' Eran said. ``Normalization
does not mean forgetfulness or that those involved give up their
claims.''
	   The majority of Jordan's 3.8 million people are Palestinian in
origin, and many still blame the Israelis for displacing their
families with the 1948 founding of the Jewish state.
	   Despite sentiment against normalization, Israel's relations with
Jordan are ``more rewarding'' than with Egypt, Eran added.
	   ``We signed a peace treaty with Egypt 20 years ago, but many
aspects of it were not implemented, and I don't think it was the
fault of Israel,'' he said. Egypt has been slow to move beyond
formal relations until the Palestinian problem is resolved.
	   Jordan and Egypt are the two Arab countries at peace with
Israel. Jordan's King Hussein is highly regarded in Israel because
of his fervent support for peace. He took part in negotiating the
Israeli-Palestinian pact at the Wye Plantation outside Washington
last week.

University students strike; 30 arrested, 2 hurt

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Police police broke up student demonstrations
outside several Israeli universities Sunday as students protested
high tuition fees. Thirty demonstrators were arrested and two
police officers were hurt.
	   The new term was to have begun Sunday, but the students declared
an open-ended strike, protesting tuition rates they say force them
to work full-time jobs to pay.
	   During a demonstration at Tel Aviv University, a car jumped a
curb and hit two policemen, injuring one. The police commander said
it was an intentional attempt to run the officers down.
	   In Jerusalem, police on horseback and others swinging clubs
broke up a demonstration near Hebrew University.
	   Jerusalem police commander Yair Yitzhaki said the protests were
illegal because students did not get a permit. He also said police
intervened only when students tried to block an intersection
leading to a hospital.
	   Police said a total of 30 students were arrested during
demonstrations in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and the southern desert town
of Beersheba.
	   The university students complained they pay tuition of about
dlrs 3,000 per year while Orthodox Jewish rabbinical students pay
none. The Orthodox students also get a government stipend and are
not drafted into the army.
	   Most Israeli students start university after finishing
compulsory army service, which is three years for men and two years
for women.

Basque voters seek peace after years of separatist strife

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Eager to end decades of separatist
violence, voters in the Basque country flocked to the polls Sunday
to choose between pro-independence nationalists and mainstream
parties that want it to remain part of Spain.
	   Turnout was expected to be high among 1.8 million registered
voters despite chilly, rainy weather in much of this picturesque,
wealthy region of northern Spain.
	   With Basques enjoying a five-week-old respite from violence
thanks to a cease-fire by the armed separatist group ETA, attention
is focused on whether the truce will propel pro-independence
parties to electoral gains.
	   ``The future of Euskadi is at stake,'' said Carlos Iturgaiz, the
candidate in Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's center-right
Popular Party to be Basque regional president. He was using the
Basque word for the region.
	   Voters are renewing the 75-seat legislature, which in turn will
elect the president. It is the sixth such election since Spain
granted the Basque country a broad degree of autonomy 19 years ago.
	   Following the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, Spain
was divided into 17 autonomous regions although the Madrid
government still controls most strategic powers, such as foreign
affairs and defense.
	   Aznar is hoping heavy turnout will give his party and other
non-nationalist groups more clout in the Basque country to seek a
lasting settlement to one of Western Europe's last regional
conflicts without splitting Spain.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968. It began its
truce Sept. 18 making this the first regional election held without
a threat of violence.
	   Polling stations were to close at 8:00 p.m. and final results
are expected by midnight.
	   The moderate Basque Nationalist Party, which helped negotiate
the cease-fire, is expected to remain the largest party in the
legislature but to fall short of an outright majority. It would
then need allies to form a coalition government.
	   A key question is how much support the cease-fire will attract
for the third-placed, pro-ETA Herri Batasuna party, which is
fielding candidates under a new coalition called Euskal
Herritarrok.
	   Aznar says there can be no peace process until ETA accepts the
results of the elections and renounces violence for good.
	   Although ETA has called cease-fires before, many Spaniards see
this one as the best opportunity in years to end the conflict.
	   In Vitoria, the clean, handsome town that serves as the seat of
the Basque government, people braved the cold to vote in polling
stations guarded by Basque police donning bright red coats and
berets and shiny white truncheons.
	   Many said they could not remember an election which so clearly
pitted the nationalist and non-nationalist camps against each other
so fiercely. They also said that with the ETA ceasefire, regardless
of who wins, Basques will now feel freer to speak their minds.
	   ``People will be able to discuss things more openly. The
election opens a whole new range of possibilities,'''' said Ignacio
Martinez, a 40-year-old teacher who said he voted for Euskal
Herritarrok, which means `We the Basque People.'
	   Others felt a lasting peace was still far off.
	   ``This alone is not going to solve anything. It is important,
but it is just a step,'' said a 24-year-old man who gave his name
only as Alfonso.
	   Some had no qualms about stating their ultimate goal.
	   ``I want independence,'' said a man in his 60s who, like many
people, refused to be identified. ``Like me there are many,'' he
said with a sly smile.

Report: Security to be increased for top trio of Cabinet ministers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Shin Bet security service has ordered
extra protection for three top ministers closely involved in the
negotiations that led to the new Mideast peace accord, Israel radio
reported Sunday.
	   The Shin Bet is concerned that Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon,
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, and Trade Minister Natan
Sharansky, who were scheduled to return from the Washington Sunday,
would become targets of right-wing extremists who have sharply
denounced the agreement, the report said.
	   Israel's extreme right-wing rejects the hand over of any land to
the Palestinians. The American-brokered agreement, which was signed
at the White House Friday, ensures that Israel will withdraw from
another 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Shin Bet has been on especially high alert for threats against
top officials following the assassination three years ago of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin at a peace rally in Tel Aviv by an
ultra-nationalist Jew.

After U.N. resolution, OSCE sets up Kosovo Verification Mission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROLAND PRINZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Only hours after endorsement by the U.N.
Security Council, international officials Sunday formally
established a team to verify compliance with the Kosovo peace
agreement.
	   A U.N. Security Council resolution adopted late Saturday
endorsed the agreement to allow 2,000 unarmed monitors to patrol
Kosovo and to let NATO verify from the air that fighting stopped.
	   In it, the Security Council demanded that Yugoslavia abide by
the accord to end fighting in Kosovo and said action may be needed
to ensure the safety of the international monitors.
	   At 10:00 a.m. (0900 GMT), the permanent council of the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe adopted a
decision to establish formally the Kosovo Verification Mission
(KVM).
	   The decision resulted from the deal struck Oct. 12 by U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. That
was followed by an agreement on the stationing of foreign monitors
OSCE Chairman Bronislaw Geremek reached with the Belgrade
government on Oct. 16.
	   Under the decision, the verification mission, headed by William
Walker of the United States, will be established for one year with
the possibility of extensions, an OSCE released said.
	   The revised draft of Saturday's Security Council resolution
deleted reference to international organizations taking
``appropriate steps'' to ensure compliance with the agreement and
instead demanded Yugoslavia implement the accord fully and
promptly. The draft affirmed that action may be needed to protect
the monitors.
	   It also demanded that both sides in the Kosovo dispute cooperate
with verifiers and start talks on a political solution.
	   In a statement delivered to Sunday's meeting, American
Ambassador David T. Johnson said the verification mission is ``a
critical part of a package that _ if fully implemented by Belgrade
_ can create the environment in which a peaceful solution for
Kosovo can be found.
	   ``It is essential that the Kosovo Albanians and the Belgrade
authorities now take full advantage of the opportunities being
created and reach agreement promptly on a durable settlement'' for
the strife-torn Serbian province, he added.
	   Last Thursday, the OSCE permanent council met in Vienna to work
out details for the Kosovo mission, but waited with a final
decision for the Security Council resolution.
	   Walker, the American mission head, said there was concern among
the would-be contributors about the safety of personnel, especially
from countries whose nationals were taken hostage by Bosnian Serbs
during the 1992-95 Bosnian war.
	   Under the agreement, the Yugoslav government guarantees the
safety of the verifiers.
	   Speaking also Thursday, Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy
said his government was ready to provide 50-100 personnel but did
not want to rely exclusively on Milosevic for their safety.
Axworthy suggested that armed bodyguards accompany verifiers.

Mary Pierce beats Monica Seles in Kremlin Cup final

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Mary Pierce upset Monica Seles 6-6 (7-2), 6-3 at
the dlrs 1 million Kremlin Cup on Sunday, winning her third tour
title of the year.
	   Seles, who had beaten Pierce five times in their last six
matches, could not keep up with her opponent's hard hitting serves
and fierce cross-court baseline shots on the Supreme carpet
surface.
	   Second-seeded Seles came out strong, breaking Pierce in the
second game. But the Frenchwoman, down 0-3, broke back in the fifth
on a Seles unforced error.
	   The two then traded hard-hitting baseline shots that just caught
the corners, going to a tiebreaker, where Pierce's serves were too
much for Seles.
	   The American hit more shots into the net after mostly error-free
play over the rest of the tournament, and Pierce wrapped up the set
after jumping ahead 6-1.
	   The second set saw more of Pierce's hard hitting, and Seles,
ranked sixth on the WTA tour, began looking tired halfway through.
She lost serve to Pierce in the sixth game, but still managed to
fend off match point in the next.
	   The one break was all Pierce needed. She held on for the 6-3
win, hammering an ace past the 24-year-old Seles and keeping her to
no points in the last game.
	   Pierce, ranked No. 11 on the WTA tour, did not have an easy road
to the final. She upset top-seed Venus Williams in the semifinal,
coming back from a set down, and crawled back from a 2-5 deficit to
win 7-5 against Magui Serna Friday.
	   Pierce will return to the top eight with the win, for which she
gets 260 points and prize money of dlrs 165,000. It was her third
title of the year, after wins at the Paris Indoors and at Amelia
Island.

Fighting among Arafat followers leaves at least one seriously hurt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ About 100 members of Yasser Arafat's
Fatah political faction battled Palestinian security forces Sunday,
throwing rocks and firing shots into the air. At least one man was
seriously wounded.
	   The fighting, a rare show of open conflict between Arafat's
followers, was sparked by a move by Palestinian military
intelligence to seize unlicensed weapons. A Palestinian crackdown
on illegal arms is one of the provisions of the peace accord signed
Friday in Washington.
	   Police in riot gear moved in to try to break up the fighting,
firing tear gas. The clash, in front of Palestinian Authority
headquarters, was in a Palestinian-controlled area. Israeli troops
were not involved.
	   The center of the West Bank town of Ramallah, the seat of the
Palestinian legislature and site of many government ministries, was
chaotic, with burning tires and overturned trash cans littering the
main downtown street. Merchants quickly shuttered their shops and
the area was closed off.
	   The injured man was taken to Ramallah hospital with a gunshot
wound to the head, the hospital said.
	   A senior Fatah official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the confrontation came after a search Saturday night of Fatah
headquarters by members of Palestinian intelligence. The searchers
seized unlicensed weapons and looked through files, the official
said.
	   ``Today we came out to show them they can't do this to us,''
said Fatah member Ismail Abu Sneid, 22, ``And the response was,
they shot one of us, and this is something we are not going to let
pass.''

Israeli diplomat: Jordan, Israel achieved much in four-year peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and Israel have made considerable
progress in building political and economic ties in four years of
peace, but the two states still need to do more, Israeli Ambassador
Oded Eran said Sunday.
	   ``We have achieved a lot in the past four years, and we're on
the right track,'' Eran told reporters on the eve of the
anniversary of the 1994 peace treaty that ended five decades of
belligerence between the two Middle East neighbors.
	   Citing official Israeli figures, he said trade in the first six
months of this year grew to dlrs 20 million, or 60 percent more
than in the first half of 1997.
	   He said that several joint ventures in textiles employed
thousands of Jordanian workers and that medium-tech Israeli firms
are seeking to set up offices in Jordan to take advantage of
cheaper labor.
	   But he added that much can still be done to bolster cooperation
in tourism, trade and transportation.
	   He said many Jordanian firms were still hesitant to deal with
Israel because of a public opposition to normalizing ties until a
final peace is reached with Palestinians.
	   ``If the majority of us wants to get true peace, there is no
other way but to normalize relations,'' Eran said. ``Normalization
does not mean forgetfulness or that those involved give up their
claims.''
	   The majority of Jordan's 3.8 million people are of Palestinian
origin, and many still blame the Israelis for displacing their
families with the 1948 founding of the Jewish state.

<TEXT>
	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ Austrian skiers clocked the four fastest
times in the first round of the men's World Cup season opening
giant slalom, with Hermann Maier in the lead Sunday.
	   The double Olympic champion covered the 368-meter (1,207-foot)
wind-swept Rettenbach course in 1 minute 5.12 seconds, almost a
full second ahead of his closest contender, teammate Stefan
Eberharter.
	   Compatriots Heinz Schilchegger and Josef Strobl had the next
best times, setting up an all Austrian sweep of the podium.
	   With Eberharter trailing him by a substantial 0.87 seconds,
anything short of a fall would almost guarantee Maier his first win
of the season.
	   Schilchegger negotiated the 45 gates in 1:06.14, edging teammate
Josef Strobl by 0.01.
	   Italy's Patrick Holzer clocked the fifth fastest time of
1:06.25, ahead of two-time World Cup champion Michael Von
Gruenigen, 1.36 seconds adrift.
	   Strong winds and heavy snow had forced race officials to delay
the start of the race by more than two hours, while workers cleared
the course and re-erected the start hut, which had been blown down
overnight.

University students strike; 30 arrested, 2 hurt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Police broke up student demonstrations outside
several Israeli universities Sunday as students protested high
tuition fees. Thirty demonstrators were arrested and two police
officers were hurt.
	   The new term was to have begun Sunday, but the students declared
an open-ended strike, protesting tuition rates they say force them
to work full-time jobs to pay.
	   During a demonstration at Tel Aviv University, a car jumped a
curb and hit two policemen, injuring one. The police commander said
it was an intentional attempt to run the officers down.
	   In Jerusalem, police on horseback and others swinging clubs
broke up a demonstration near Hebrew University.
	   Jerusalem police commander Yair Yitzhaki said the protests were
illegal because students did not get a permit. He also said police
intervened only when students tried to block an intersection
leading to a hospital.
	   Police said a total of 30 students were arrested during
demonstrations in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and the southern desert town
of Beersheba.
	   The university students complained they pay tuition of about
dlrs 3,000 per year while Orthodox Jewish rabbinical students pay
none.

German says first nuclear plants to close by 2002
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Also moved Saturday on European circuits &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's designated environment minister
expects the new government to start closing the nation's 19 nuclear
power plants during its four-year term, a magazine has reported.
	   Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats have
agreed with their junior coalition partner, the environmentalist
Greens, to move the country toward scrapping nuclear power but has
set no timetable.
	   As a first step, the government plans shutdown negotiations with
the power industry, which has threatened to sue for billions of
marks (dollars) in damages if the administration closes nuclear
plants without its consent.
	   Juergen Trittin, a Green in line to be environment minister,
appeared to predict quick progress in an interview with Focus
magazine, released Saturday.
	   ``I expect that a series of nuclear power plants will be shut
down during this legislative term,'' which runs for four years, he
was quoted as saying.
	   Werner Mueller, a Schroeder adviser on energy policy who will
become economics minister, said he backs the government's plans
because most Germans oppose nuclear power.
	   ``I don't see the necessity for atomic power nowadays,'' he told
Focus.
	   Still, he stressed that the plan could succeed only in consensus
with utility companies. Mueller told Focus that he discussed the
government's plans with utility executives over the past week.
	   Schroeder's new government is to be sworn in Tuesday, a month
after the Social Democrats' victory in Sept. 27 elections.

Report: Security to be increased for top trio of Cabinet ministers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Shin Bet security service has ordered
extra protection for three top ministers closely involved in the
negotiations that led to the new Mideast peace accord, Israel radio
reported Sunday.
	   The Shin Bet is concerned that Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon,
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, and Trade Minister Natan
Sharansky, who were scheduled to return from the Washington on
Sunday, would become targets of right-wing extremists who have
sharply denounced the agreement, the report said.
	   Israel's extreme right-wing rejects the hand over of any land to
the Palestinians. The American-brokered agreement, which was signed
at the White House on Friday, ensures that Israel will withdraw
from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Shin Bet has been on especially high alert for threats against
top officials following the assassination three years ago of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin at a peace rally in Tel Aviv by an
ultra-nationalist Jew.

Vienna ex-mayor suspected as communist-era spy

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Helmut Zilk, a former mayor of Vienna,
was rejected for a Czech Republic medal of honor because of
suspicions that he was a communist spy, a German newspaper
reported.
	   Zilk, 71, allegedly spied for the communist government of the
former Czechoslovakia during the 1960s and `70s. He denied the
accusation, which the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper on Saturday
quoted him as calling ``complete nonsense.''
	   The suspicion surfaced after Zilk, 71, was nominated for the
order of the White Lion because of serious injuries he received
from a letter bomb. Zilk lost part of his hand in the December 1993
explosion, which happened during one of his terms as mayor of the
Austrian capital.
	   Czech President Vaclav Havel withdrew the honor after a source
claimed that Zilk spied for the Czech communist secret service and
provided information that led to several convictions. Zilk also
signed a declaration of loyalty to the Czech communist government,
the source claimed.
	   Ivan Medek, a Czech government official, did not identify the
source but told the newspaper that the information on Zilk was
``absolutely reliable.''
	   Zilk would have received the Czech medal next Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   MUENSTER, Germany (AP) _ Kings, queens and heads of state from
across Europe this weekend celebrated the 350th anniversary of the
Treaty of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years War and marked
the beginning of modern Europe.
	   Royalty including Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and King Juan
Carlos of Spain walked up a red carpet Saturday to the Muenster
city hall, where the treaty was settled on Oct. 24, 1648. One by
one, representatives from 20 European nations signed a guest book
before eating lunch and hearing speeches.
	   Outside, the ``common folk'' paraded in the streets in
celebration.
	   Horse-drawn carriages rolled over cobblestone streets. Children
dressed as gnomes pulled a wagon carrying a garden gnome. One
parade group dressed as cows in black-and-white spotted suits with
pink rubber gloves as udders.
	   The Treaty of Westphalia ended an era of religious war between
Roman Catholics and Protestants, fought mostly in Germany. It also
recognized for the first time the sovereignty of the German states,
the Netherlands and the Swiss confederation.
	   Hailing the treaty as a milestone of modern diplomacy, German
President Roman Herzog called it ``the start of a new European
epoch'' and ``the first example of cooperation including nearly all
European states.''
	   But even now, he said, the celebrations were dampened by the war
in Kosovo, the Yugoslav province where Serb forces have been
fighting a secessionist ethnic Albanian majority.
	   ``Practically in front of our door, in former Yugoslavia,
brutality is happening that recalls the atrocities of the Thirty
Years War,'' Herzog said. ``We must not accept death and expulsions
in Kosovo as something normal for Europe.''
	   He urged Europeans to work toward a common understanding of
history, culture and foreign policy.
	   Also attending the ceremony were representatives from Austria,
Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France,
Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Norway,
Poland, Sweden, Switzerland and the Vatican.

30 touchdowns included five-game season and championship. CLARIFIES

championship game &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ When a three-hour junior high championship
football game ended at the Singapore American School _ after 18
lead turnovers _ the Grizzlies had a 68 on the scoreboard.
	   ``I never thought that with scoring 68 you could even lose,''
said coach Martin Sauer. ``I thought people would be coming from
all over the world asking, `How'd you do it?'''
	   But the Grizzlies did lose Saturday.
	   Their opponents, the Cougars, scored 74 in a game that produced
19 touchdowns, awesome offense by both sides, and not much
tackling.
	   The Grizzlies' top scorer was Jacob McMillan, an eighth grader.
He scored five touchdowns in the championship game, and another 25
during the five-game season.
	   Another three members of the multinational Grizzlies team scored
two touchdowns apiece during the championship.
	   The winning Cougars ``were probably similar to us. They might
have had two players who scored the majority,'' said Sauer, 44, who
is the Asia-Pacific supply chain director for British-based Burmah
Castrol Pte. Ltd.
	   The rules call for everyone to play. There are only a dozen or
so boys on each team, and eight play at a time, so they switch from
offense to defense.
	   Last year, when the Grizzlies lost the championship game by a
field goal in the last 10 seconds, they were pretty furious. A few
helmets hit the ground.
	   ``At the end of this game, the guys were glad it was over,''
said Sauer. ``They just looked up at the scoreboard, kind of like,
`Wow, what a game.'''

Vienna ex-mayor suspected as communist-era spy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote from Zilk in graf 3.

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Helmut Zilk, a former mayor of Vienna,
was rejected for a Czech Republic medal of honor because of
suspicions that he was a communist spy, a German newspaper
reported.
	   Zilk, 71, allegedly spied for the communist government of the
former Czechoslovakia during the 1960s and `70s. He denied the
report, published Saturday in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
	   ``I consider the accusations absolute nonsense,'' he told
state-run Czech TV Saturday. ``I had nothing to do with the secret
police in Czechoslovakia.''
	   The suspicion surfaced after Zilk was nominated for the order of
the White Lion because of serious injuries he received from a
letter bomb. Zilk lost part of his hand in the December 1993
explosion, which happened during one of his terms as mayor of the
Austrian capital.
	   Czech President Vaclav Havel withdrew the honor after a source
claimed that Zilk spied for the Czech communist secret service and
provided information that led to several convictions. Zilk also
signed a declaration of loyalty to the Czech communist government,
the source claimed.
	   Ivan Medek, a Czech government official, did not identify the
source but told the newspaper that the information on Zilk was

Pakistan's Islamic leaders urge boycott of western products
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Thousands of chanting supporters of
an orthodox Islamic party vowed Sunday to boycott western food
products and food chains in a bid to fight the influence of western
culture in Pakistan, where they are demanding a pure Islamic
society.
	   ``Can't we live without Pepsi, Coke and Fanta? . . . Are they so
essential for us?'' Qazi Hussain Ahmed, the chief of
Jamaat-e-Islami, asked thousands of his supporters gathered outside
the white marble Faisal Mosque on the final day of a three-day
meeting.
	   The Jamaat-e-Islami, or the Islamic Party, held its meeting to
mobilize support for the enforcement of a true Islamic system in
the country based on the teachings of the Koran _ the Muslim holy
book.
	   ``I have not sipped a drop of these drinks since Pakistan
conducted nuclear tests (in May). I ask you to boycott Pepsi, Coke
and Fanta. . . They are now forbidden for us,'' Ahmed said. His
followers responded with loud shouts of approval.
	   He also railed against local fast food outlets, such as the
U.S.-based McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
	   Jamaat, which boycotted elections in 1997, is a small, but
influential party, considered the bulwark of an Islamic revivalists
movement.
	   Ahmed also urged a boycott of Indian movies, which are extremely
popular in Pakistan.
	   ``Swear today that you won't watch Indian movies from today nor
allow any one to see them. . . we will expel the Indian culture out
of this country,'' he said.
	   Many people worry that Ahmed's call to stop others from
patronizing western outlets or attending Indian movies, which are
shown throughout the country, could result in violence. In recent
months there have been the occasional attack on Kentucky Fried
Chicken outlets in Karachi.
	   Ahmed also railed against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's
government for runaway corruption and mismanagement.
	   ``Nawaz Sharif is insincere in enforcing Islam. . . he has
curtailed the powers of president, destroyed the institution of
judiciary and now his policies are creating uncertainty in the
army,'' he said.
	   Ahmed also urged the army to adopt more Islamic ways.
	   Earlier this month, Sharif forced the powerful Army Chief Gen.
Jehangir Karamat to resign.

Australia set to win first series in Pakistan in 39 years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with play until stumps. CHANGES overline &QL; 
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Australia brightened its chances of
recording its first series victory in Pakistan in 39 years winding
up play at stumps Sunday with a massive 419-run victory target for
Pakistan in the final Test of the three-part series.
	   The visitors, backed by Mark Waugh's brilliant 117, were
dismissed for 390 in their second innings in the last over of play
Sunday on the fourth day of the Test.
	   Pakistan, which conceded a 28-run first innings lead and are 1-0
down in the three-match series, needs 419 in a minimum 90 overs
left in the game.
	   If Pakistan succeeds it will be a cricket first.
	   Pakistan's best fourth innings total was in 1994 against
Australia when they won by a wicket while chasing 315 runs.
	   A late flurry of boundaries by Gavin Robertson (45) on Sunday in
the second last over of the day enabled Australia to line up the
massive total.
	   Robertson was the last man out which gave debutant Shakeel Ahmed
his fourth wicket of the innings.
	   Mark Waugh came to the crease in the fifth over of the day after
Mark Taylor (68) was bowled by Arshad Khan. Waugh was finally
stumped by Moin Khan off Shakeel Ahmed after spending six and a
half hours at the wicket in making 117 off 232 balls.
	   Pakistan captain Aamir Sohail setup a defensive field throughout
the day in order to restrict the Australians. However, Mark Waugh
continued to push the scoring with singles and twos and
occasionally found the boundary.
	   He brought up his 15th Test century with a gentle push to square
leg in nearly six hours off 201 balls. His second Test century
against Pakistan featured eight fours and a straight six over
left-arm spinner Shakeel Ahmed's head.
	   Waugh added 56 runs with his twin brother Steve (28) for the
fourth wicket. Then with Darren Lehmann (26) they put on another 76
runs for the fifth wicket before making 63 with Gavin Robertson.
	   Lehmann survived a touch and go stumping decision when the
square leg camera failed to catch both wicketkeeper Moin Khan and
the batsman in one frame.
	   Earlier, after resuming their second innings at the overnight
total of 130 for one, Australia lost skipper Taylor and Langer
before lunch.
	   Taylor added another four to his overnight 64 before he was
bowled by Arshad Khan. The 33-year-old Australian captain eclipsed
his predecessor Allan Border's 395-run mark in a series in
Pakistan. He scored 513, 426 in the second Test at Peshawar, with
an impressive average of 128.25.
	   Taylor and Langer put on 109 runs for the second wicket in 191
minutes.
	   Langer was run out when he failed to beat Ijaz Ahmed's strong
throw from square leg. His 51-run innings included three fours and
a six and came off 222 minutes.
	   Steve Waugh departed soon after lunch, giving left-arm spinner
Shakeel Ahmed his first Test wicket as Australia went for tea at
283 for four with Lehmann struggling at 26 and Mark Waugh on a
patient 77.
	   Pakistan paceman Wasim Akram and Shoaib Akhtar, removed Lehmann
and Ian Healy (3) respectively in the space of three overs. Ijaz
took a superb diving catch to his right at point to dismiss
Lehmann, while Afridi took a well judged catch off Healy's mistimed
pull at mid-wicket.
	   Shakeel ended with four for 91 while two wickets were claimed by
Khan.

Street fighting among Arafat followers leaves two hurt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with fighting over, two sides meeting, second
injury, other details &QL; 
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ In an ominous outbreak of internal
conflict stemming from the new peace accord, members of Yasser
Arafat's political faction fought street battles Sunday with
Palestinian security forces, injuring two men.
	   The clash, representing a serious rupture within Arafat's ranks,
followed a bid by Palestinian military intelligence to seize
unlicensed weapons. That was among tough new security measures
Arafat agreed to at last week's U.S. summit.
	   The fighting in the center of the West Bank town of Ramallah
broke out as Marwan Barghouti, the leader of Fatah in the West
Bank, was addressing a group of about 100 supporters outside the
Palestinian Authority headquarters and the offices of Governor
Mustafa Isa.
	   Some of the Fatah activists picked up stones and hurled them
over a fence into the compound and at plainclothes intelligence
agents who were watching the gathering from the sidelines,
witnesses said.
	   Intelligence agents hurled rocks back at the crowd. But then
some of the security agents fired from the second- and third-floor
windows, with some of the gunfire directed into the crowd. About
the same time, armed Fatah members arrived on the scene, firing
shots into the air.
	   Two men were hurt, including a Fatah activist who suffered a
gunshot wound to the head. That silenced the gunfire on both sides,
and leaders from both sides quickly withdrew for a meeting.
	   A senior Fatah official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the confrontation followed a search Saturday night of Fatah
headquarters by members of Palestinian intelligence. Fistfights
broke out as the searchers went through files and looked for
unlicensed weapons, the official said.
	   Some Fatah activists said the confrontation was exacerbated by a
personal feud between the commander of the raiding party and two
Fatah members.
	   Merchants in the center of town shuttered their shops, and
burning tires and overturned garbage bins littered the streets. The
fighting occurred entirely in Palestinian-controlled areas, and
Israeli troops were not involved.

England pile up best one-day total against South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Propped up by three solid innings,
England put together its best-ever total in a one-day international
match against South Africa in their Wills Cup quarterfinal match in
Dhaka Sunday.
	   After winning the toss and choosing to bat, England scored 281
for seven wickets in 50 overs at the Bangabandhu Stadium against a
new-look South African side.
	   South Africa took the English batsmen by surprise when it
introduced Paul Symcox with the new ball, but the batsmen scored
freely from the very start.
	   England's total was built around three important innings.
Skipper Adam Holliaoke stole the show with an unbeaten 83 off 91
balls but Neil Fairbrother held firm in the middle order with his
anchor innings of 56 runs. Earlier, Mark Ealham led the initial
charge with a run-a-ball 44.
	   England's wicketkeeper Jack Russell also played a flamboyant
knock, matching his captain for a while knock-for-knock before
getting out for 19 runs in 17 balls.
	   J. Kallis finished with three wickets for 48 runs for the South
Africans. left arm spinner Micky Boje bowled a tight line to finish
at one for 39 in his 10 overs.

Government admits losing a warplane in war against rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The Sudanese army admitted Sunday that it
has lost a fighter jet while on mission Saturday against southern
rebels but said it crashed due to a technical fault and not shot
down by the rebels.
	   The Sudan People's Liberation Army said their forces shot down a
Russian-built MiG 23 fighter of the Sudanese Air Force near
al-Jabalain, 64 Kilometers (40 miles) east of Juba while it was in
a support mission of a government ground attack.
	   But a statement from the armed forces central command insisted
the plane did not fall to rebel fire. ``A technical fault occurred
and the plane crashed, killing its pilot, Captain Abdel-Hamid Abu
Bakr,'' it said.
	   The statement did not mention the type of the plane, but said it
was on ``military mission as part of the ongoing fighting
operations in East Equatoria province to clear the remaining rebel
pockets.''
	   Sudanese government forces and the SPLA rebels have been
fighting for more than a month in East Equatoria province. Juba,
which lies 1,200 kilometers (740 miles) south of Khartoum, is the
capital of the province and the biggest town in southern Sudan.
	   The SPLA has been fighting since 1983 to win autonomy for the
south's Christians and adherents of tribal faiths from the north's
Muslim and Arab population. More than 1.5 million people have died
in the fighting and accompanying famines.

Blair, Aznar say Pinochet's fate up to judicial authorities
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; with EU-Summit; Britain-Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ The British and Spanish prime
ministers agreed Sunday that the fate of former Chilean dictator
Gen. Augusto Pinochet is in the hands of their judicial authorities
and they will not interfere.
	   ``Both myself and Mr. Aznar agree this is not a matter for us to
discuss,'' said British Premier Tony Blair. ``I've avoided
commenting on that judicial process and I don't intend to do so.''
	   Spanish leader Jose Maria Aznar made similar comments when he
meet journalists on the margin of a European Union summit in this
Alpine lakeside resort.
	   Pinochet is under arrest in a London hospital where he'd gone
for back surgery. He was detained on a warrant from a Spanish
magistrate seeking to extradite him on charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture during his 1973-90 rule.
	   The Chilean government has urged Britain to release Pinochet on
humanitarian grounds, and argued that as a senator, he is entitled
to diplomatic immunity.
	   Aznar dismissed reports that the bid to try Pinochet will damage
Spain's relations with Latin America. ``It's important we don't
talk nonsense about this issue. This is stupid.''

Ex-soldier softens tone, but Venezuela polarized over candidacy
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By BART JONES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ For months, the front-runner in
Venezuela's presidential race, Hugo Chavez, seemed like a free
market's worst nightmare: a failed coup leader eager to halt
privatizations and keep out foreign business.
	   Then he toned down his fiery populist rhetoric and sat down with
bankers and oil executives. To present a softer side, he pitched in
a game in an amateur baseball league and beamed for newspaper
photographers at his daughter's birthday party.
	   Chavez is ``trying to shed this image of being a slash-and-burn,
take-no-prisoners candidate,'' said political consultant Eric
Ekvall.
	   The new approach has made some inroads for the 44-year-old
candidate, although most businessmen still haven't embraced the
former army paratrooper who tried to overthrow the government in
1992.
	   Chavez's victory in the Dec. 6 presidential election seems a
growing possibility _ he leads his closest opponent by up to 20
percentage points in polls _ thanks to strong support from poor
Venezuelans.
	   Most of the business community backs former state Gov. Henrique
Salas Romer, a Yale-educated economist who is in second in the
polls.
	   Wealthy Venezuelans alarmed by Chavez's showing are mounting a
publicity campaign aimed at undermining him, including dire
predictions that he will expropriate private property and expel
foreigners.
	   Chavez's opponents also are circulating a videotape of a 1995
speech in which Chavez, who had been released from prison the
previous year, condemns the United States and praises the Cuban
revolution before an audience in Havana.
	   Polarization from the Chavez candidacy is apparent in the
military, where two officers were detained last Tuesday for
questioning about an alleged plot to kill the army's chief of
staff, a fierce Chavez opponent.
	   The candidate himself has accused the army chief, Gen. Ruben
Rojas Perez, of conspiring to thwart his electoral chances either
through a coup or an assassination. The government has denied the
allegation.
	   Chavez is drawing most of his support from poor people who are
fed up with rampant political corruption and see the retired
lieutenant colonel as a hero for trying to overthrow then President
Carlos Andres Perez. The candidate is barred from entering the
United States because of that unsuccessful coup.
	   Fearing a Chavez presidency, some rich people have fled to
Miami.
	   Chavez ``is the most dangerous person who has appeared in the
history of Venezuela,'' jewelry maker Tomas Gunz said as he
listened to a speech by Chavez at the Venezuelan-American Chamber
of Commerce last week.
	   Another member of the audience, oil industry executive Tony
Barrios, was more restrained. He said he disliked Chavez's
criticism of the state oil monopoly Petroleos de Venezuela, but
beyond that ``wouldn't have a problem with Chavez'' if he won.
	   Some businessmen are starting to support the candidate, mainly
because they think he will win and want to gain his favor. Sectors
such as agriculture that have traditionally enjoyed state
protection are also backing Chavez.
	   Henry Lord Boulton, president of Avensa airlines, recently held
a barbecue at his home for Chavez and later gave the candidate free
airplane tickets for use during the campaign.
	   The candidate also has met with the heavyweight of Venezuela's
business world, Gustavo Cisneros, a media mogul listed by Forbes
magazine as one of Latin America's richest men. Cisneros has not
commented publicly on the meeting.
	   In recent weeks, Chavez has made a point of trying to soothe
business fears, saying foreign investment would be welcome in his
administration and expressing support for British Prime Minister
Tony Blair's call for a ``third way'' between socialism and
unfettered capitalism.
	   ``Rigid fiscal discipline is urgent,'' Chavez told foreign
journalists last week.
	   When he's out on the campaign trail, the candidate pulls no
punches. He repeatedly denounces ``a conspiracy'' to kill him and
calls his opponents ``desperate.''
	   Candidates from Venezuela's two major parties, the center-left
Democratic Action and the Social Christian Copei, have dropped so
far behind that some party leaders want to dump them and back
Salas. Copei's candidate is former Miss Universe Irene Saez.

Britain hints it will relax Argentine arms embargo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Foreign Secretary says full arms
embargo ``daft''; doubts about authorship of Argentine president's
Falklands letter; alters overline to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) - Britain indicated Sunday it will relax a
16-year-old arms embargo against Argentina, but reiterated there
will be negotiations about sovereignty of the Falkland Islands when
the Argentine president visits this week.
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said aspects of the ban were
``daft,'' particularly as British and Argentine troops now serve
together in a U.N. peacekeeping force in Cyprus.
	   President Carlos Menem arrives Tuesday on the first official
visit by an Argentine president since Argentina's then-military
junta invaded the south Atlantic archipelago. Britain won the
islands back in a 74-day war that cost nearly 1,000 lives.
	   ``We had an application to provide the Argentinean force with
some vehicles and we found it ran up against the arms embargo,''
Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp. television interview.
``This is plainly daft. We can't be keeping the peace together and
then withholding the equipment that is necessary.''
	   Cook said Britain will keep a tight grip on what arms it sells
to Argentina, adding, ``We would not be sending equipment that
could be used against the Falkland Islands.''
	   Cook gave no date for relaxing the embargo. London's Sunday
Telegraph said negotiations will begin Nov. 10, soon after Menem
leaves.
	   On sovereignty of the islands, Cook said, ``Both sides will
state their position and I think we have a duty to the Falkland
islanders to make it clear that sovereignty is not up for
negotiation.''
	   The islands' 2,200-strong population is of British descent and
refuses any handover of the islands that Argentina still claims.
	   Also Sunday, suspicions grew that a letter to a British tabloid
from Menem expressing regret about the invasion was at least partly
the work of aides to Prime Minister Tony Blair.
	   The letter, published Friday in The Sun, Britain's top-selling
newspaper, was similar in tone to one The Sun published from
Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's then-prime minister, expressing regret
over Japanese brutality in World War II before he visited in May.
	   American linguistics expert Donald Foster, of New York state's
Vassar College, said both letters appeared to be ``government
plants'' and written by the same person.
	   ``I think one can say with some confidence Hashimoto's language
and Menem's language cannot be this similar,'' said Foster, who
testified in America's Unibomber trial and detected writer Joe
Klein as the author of the political satire, ``Primary Colors.''
	   ``I am inclined to believe ... that these largely represent the
work of the same individual,'' Foster added in a BBC radio
interview. ``I think that in neither case is it credible to believe
Hashimoto or Menem is principally responsible.''
	   Sun political editor Trevor Kavanagh said Blair's press
secretary, Alastair Campbell, who is a former tabloid journalist,
had ``made a couple of suggestions on stylistic matters.''
	   Via Blair's office, Kavanagh suggested both the Hashimoto and
Menem letters which The Sun then used as front-page exclusives.
	   Hashimoto expressed ``deep remorse and heartfelt apology.''
Menem said the Falklands was ``should never have happened and that
we deeply regret'' _ but stopped short of apologizing outright.

After U.N. resolution, OSCE sets up Kosovo Verification Mission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROLAND PRINZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Only hours after the U.N. Security
Council endorsed a Kosovo peace agreement, international officials
Sunday formally established a team to verify compliance with the
pact.
	   The decision of the permanent council of the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe resulted from
the peace deal struck Oct. 12 by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. That was followed by an
agreement on the stationing of foreign monitors that OSCE Chairman
Bronislaw Geremek reached with the Belgrade government on Oct. 16.
	   Under the decision, the verification mission, headed by William
Walker of the United States, will be established for one year with
the possibility of extensions, an OSCE release said.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
90 percent of Kosovo's population _ has killed hundreds of people
and forced around 300,000 from their homes since a Serb crackdown
began in February. Serbia is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The Security Council resolution adopted late Saturday endorsed
the agreement to allow 2,000 unarmed monitors to patrol Kosovo and
to let NATO verify from the air that fighting stopped.
	   The Security Council also demanded that Yugoslavia abide by the
accord to end fighting in Kosovo and said action may be needed to
ensure the safety of the international monitors.
	   In a statement delivered to Sunday's meeting, American
Ambassador David T. Johnson said the verification mission is ``a
critical part of a package that _ if fully implemented by Belgrade
_ can create the environment in which a peaceful solution for
Kosovo can be found.''
	   Last Thursday, the OSCE permanent council met in Vienna to work
out details for the Kosovo mission, but waited on a final decision
for the Security Council resolution.
	   Walker, the American mission head, said there was concern among
the would-be contributors to a verification force about the safety
of personnel, especially from countries whose nationals were taken
hostage by Bosnian Serbs during the 1992-95 Bosnian war.
	   Under the agreement, the Yugoslav government guarantees the
safety of the verifiers.

Member of Jihad dies in shootout with police

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A member of the Islamic militant Jihad
group died Saturday in a shootout with Albanian special police in a
Tirana suburb, authorities reported Sunday.
	   Salah el Saeid, a 29-year-old Egyptian national, was one of the
most dangerous persons wanted by the U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency, Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga told The
Associated Press.
	   Saeid reportedly lived in Tirana and was married to an Albanian
woman.
	   The shootout took place around 8 p.m. (1800 GMT) Saturday,
Bizhga said. The apartment where el Saeid was staying had been
observed by the Albanian secret service for many days.
	   Saeid reportedly started shooting from a first-floor window when
he saw police forces around his house. During the one-hour
shootout, the commander of the special police was wounded.
	   It was unclear how Saeid died. A first report issued by the
Interior Ministry said that Saeid was found dead on the floor.
Later Bizhga said the Egyptian had committed suicide.
	   El Saeid was wanted for threatening the U.S. Embassy in Tirana
in August, Bizhga said.
	   On Aug. 17, 120 heavily armed U.S. Marines tightened security at
the American diplomatic compound in Tirana after U.S. officials
said they received credible evidence of a plan to attack the U.S.
mission.
	   The embassy temporarily suspended normal operations, evacuating
family members and non-essential personnel.
	   Later that month, police and intelligence agents in Tirana
raided several alleged terrorist safe houses and arrested ten
foreign nationals, including some from Arab countries.
	   Those raids apparently were part of a nationwide manhunt for
suspects involved in terror attacks in Egypt, including the
November 1997 massacre of 62 people in Luxor.
	   Earlier in the summer, five suspects believed to be Egyptian
nationals were reported arrested and spirited out of the country
with the help of American agents.
	   According to Albanian sources, four of them were sought in the
1993 assassination of Rifat el-Mahgoub, the speaker of the Egyptian
parliament, and an abortive attempt several years later to blow up
the Khan Khalili public market in Cairo.
	   Members of Jihad are also suspected of blasting the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August this year.

German Social Democrats to approve partnership with Greens

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Social Democrats were expected to
approve an alliance with the environmentalist Greens party on
Sunday, clearing the final hurdle for the first center-left
government in 16 years to take office.
	   A special convention of the Social Democrats was to vote on the
coalition pact the two parties sealed last week, which declares the
fight against 10-percent unemployment their No. 1 goal.
	   The Social Democrats won the Sept. 27 election, ending
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's long tenure, but they needed a junior
partner to secure a majority in parliament. A Greens meeting
overwhelmingly backed the partnership Saturday.
	   Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, due to be sworn in Tuesday,
will be the last chancellor to run the nation from Bonn before the
government's historic return to Berlin, the prewar capital, next
year.
	   ``We will make a new beginning for Germany, first in Bonn, then
in Berlin,'' he declared in a convention speech.
	   Schroeder, whose pro-market reputation and populist stance
helped his party win over conservative voters, listed projects dear
to the left as priorities for his four-year term.
	   He defended Germany's social welfare state and stressed his
plans to seek a consensus with German industry and labor on how to
create jobs.
	   The coalition's program hews closer to Social Democratic goals,
but key pledges bear a Green imprint: closing nuclear power plants,
raising energy taxes and allowing more foreigners to become German
citizens.
	   German industry and many economists have criticized the new
administration's tax plans, which would provide relief to people
with low and medium incomes partly by curbing loopholes and
writeoffs for business.
	   Basking in their election triumph, Social Democratic leaders
played down a power struggle between Schroeder and his designated
finance minister Oskar Lafontaine, a more traditional leftist than
the future chancellor.
	   Schroeder appealed for party unity, and Lafontaine pledged to
respect his authority.
	   But Lafontaine renewed his controversial call for Germany's
powerful central bank to lower interest rates to spur the economy.
European central banks have focused too narrowly on fighting
inflation in recent years, he said.
	   ``I view this is a fundamental mistake,'' he told delegates.
``Monetary policy has the task of promoting growth and jobs.''
	   Schroeder came to Bonn fresh from a weekend meeting of European
Union leaders in Austria, where he was a special invitee.
	   On Saturday, the 18-year-old Greens party capped its
transformation from a loose band of peace protesters, anti-nuclear
activists and feminists by voting overwhelmingly to join Germany's
government for the first time.
	   The most prominent Greens pragmatist, Joschka Fischer, is in
line to be foreign minister. He is one of three Greens ministers in
Schroeder's designated 14-member Cabinet.
	   The new government will have a comfortable 21-seat majority in
parliament.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad will make a two-day visit to Brunei this week, a newspaper
reported Sunday.
	   In addition to conferring with Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, Mahathir

said.
	   On his way back, Mahathir will stop over in Ho Chi Minh City

Guinea-Bissau rebel leader agrees to talks with president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau rebel leader Brig.
Ansumane Mane, who staged a military coup five months ago, has
agreed to talks with the president of the tiny west African country
to bring a halt to renewed fighting, news reports said Sunday.
	   The agreement came after talks between Mane and visiting
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama, the Portuguese news agency
Lusa said. Gama met with Mane late Saturday and also held talks
with President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
	   Officials cited by Lusa said the meeting might take place this
week.
	   Vieira proposed talks with Mane last Wednesday when he announced
a government cease-fire after fighting had erupted four days
earlier.
	   The rebels responded Friday with a 48-hour truce, demanding that
Vieira schedule new talks and explain the presence of foreign
troops in the former Portuguese colony.
	   Some 3,000 heavily-armed soldiers from Senegal and the Republic
of Guinea have been in Guinea-Bissau to back Vieira since the
conflict began in early June.
	   Senegalese Interior Minister Lamine Sisse also talked to both
leaders Saturday and gave them a message from Senegal's President
Abdou Diouf, details of which were not disclosed, Lusa reported.
	   Fighting in the impoverished country restarted last Sunday when
Mane's rebels advanced on the center of Bissau, towards the
presidential palace.
	   While troops loyal to Vieira secured the capital's downtown, the
rebels gained ground inland, overrunning the country's second and
third largest towns, Bafata and Gabu.
	   A truce had been in place since July 26 and was reaffirmed a
month later, under mediation by west African and
Portuguese-speaking countries.
	   Mane led a military rebellion June 7, a day after Vieira
dismissed him as Armed Forces chief-of-staff on allegations that he
was running arms to separatists in Senegal's southern Casamance
province.
	   The rebels claimed Vieira was corrupt and called for early
elections, which had been scheduled for later this year.
	   About half of the country's population of 1 million has been
displaced since the fighting began June 7. Most of Bissau's
residents found refuge in Bafata or Gabu, both some 200 kilometers
(125 miles) east of the capital.

Italy's new international air hub opens to delays, protests,
</HEADLINE>
grumbles &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MALPENSA, Italy (AP) _ Italy's controversial new international
air hub opened in chaos Sunday with delays, demonstrations and an
escalator breakdown that sent grumbling passengers slogging three
up flights of stairs to departure gates.
	   Flights at the revamped airport at Malpensa 2000 outside Milan
were running at least 30 minutes late, the ANSA news agency said,
and the baggage claim system was in chaos.
	   Adding to passenger frustration was an hour-and-a-half breakdown
on the escalator traveling the three floors between check-in and
departure gates. ANSA said waits for the elevator, the only
alternative to climbing, were as much as 20 minutes.
	   The escalator snafu was especially galling because Malpensa's
design has been touted as one so compact travelers would have to
walk a maximum of 180 meters (590 feet) to reach their planes.
	   A shortage of buses to take passengers from the gates to the
planes also slowed things down as did a demonstration by
environmentalists which blocked the road to the airport for 30
minutes, ANSA said.
	   In Switzerland, Swissair spokesman Jean-Claude Donzel said the
chaotic situation forced Swissair to cancel one of its three
flights on Sunday, a Zurich-Malpensa-Zurich run.
	   A total of 634 flights had been scheduled to use Malpensa
Sunday, but ANSA said airlines had reduced the number to 500.
	   Malpensa has been dogged by controversy from the outset, in part
because of it is much further from Milan than the old hub, Linate.
	   The European Commission, concerned by the lack of good rail and
road links, gave Italy the green light to shift flights to Malpensa
only last week.
	   The location is also a sore point with airport employees.
	   Some 2,400 airport workers had threatened to strike on opening
day to protest the cost and difficulty of getting to work. Air
traffic controllers had also threatened to strike over what they
say are inadequate radar.
	   Malpensa is 53 kilometers (33 miles) from the center of Milan,
compared to 10 kilometers (6 miles) for Linate, and a high-speed
rail link won't be finished until some time in the next century.
The Milan-Malpensa highway is being widened, but the work won't be
complete until next year.
	   With double the number of gates and check-in counters as Linate,
Malpensa is expected to handle 18 million passengers a year
compared to Linate's 10 million and 58 flights an hour compared to
Linate's 32.
	   Many foreign carriers balked at the switch from Linate to
Malpensa, saying they didn't have enough time to prepare for the
complex transfer.
	   Alitalia and some small companies, including one of Alitalia's
competitors on the lucrative Milan-Rome shuttle, will keep using
Linate for most national flights.

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ A bomb exploded in the car of Chechnya's
top anti-kidnapping official Sunday, killing him and seriously
injuring two of his bodyguards on the day he was to launch a major
offensive in the breakaway republic.
	   Shadid Bargishev died in the hospital after losing both legs in
the blast outside the anti-kidnapping department office in the
Chechen capital of Grozny, according to Mairbek Vachagayev,
spokesman for Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov.
	   The explosion came on the day officials had promised to launch a
large operation to rescue people kidnapped in Chechnya.
	   Several hostages have been freed recently from the republic,
including 24 Russian soldiers and an English couple. Most of the
releases have been facilitated by Russian financier Boris
Berezovsky, though details of his involvement have been unclear.
	   Husein Zabrailov, an investigator who worked with Bargishev in
the anti-kidnapping department, blamed Sunday's bombing on the
recent hostage releases.
	   ``The accident is a result of the work of the department,'' he
said.
	   More than 100 people are still being held captive in Chechnya,
including three Britons, a New Zealander and a Turk, according to
the Interfax news agency.
	   Chechnya, where rebels fought a bloody independence war against
Russia in 1994-96, conducts its own affairs and has seen a sharp
rise in violent crime and hostage-taking, usually by criminal gangs
for ransom.
	   Also Sunday, Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov ordered law
enforcement officials to step up efforts against criminal groups,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. It was unclear if his order was
connected to the explosion.

Iran missiles upset regional balance, says French official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ French Defense Minister Alain Richard said
here Sunday that ballistic missiles developed by Iran upset the
regional balance of power.
	   Alain, speaking at a news conference, also said anti-missile
defenses are not total protection against attack when he was asked
about U.S. efforts to sell a missile defense system in the Gulf to
defend against attack by Iran or Iraq.
	   His remarks largely concerned the Iran's the Shahab-3 missile
which, with a range of 1,300-kilometers (800 miles), is capable of
striking Israel or U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia.
	   ``These missiles threaten the strategic balance of power in the
Gulf and the Middle East,'' Richard told reporters.
	   When asked about the proposed U.S. anti-missile system, he said:
``We believe every country has the right to protect itself against
missiles, but anti-missile technology does not take care of all
threats.''
	   He added that France was in the process of developing its own
air defense system in cooperation with another European country,
which he did not name.
	   France, Britain and the United States vie for influence in the
Gulf, where they have sold billions of dollars in arms.
	   Richard signed an expanded defense pact with Qatar here
Saturday, upon his arrival.
	   The agreement enlarged a military pact signed in 1994. The
details of the agreement were not available, but during previous
visits French officials had suggested it would include the
formation of a joint military committee and reinforced technical
cooperation to modernize Qatar's military equipment.
	   France maintains close relations with Qatar, a tiny nation
sitting on the world's third-largest reserves of natural gas. Qatar
buys more than 70 percent of its weapons from France, and Qatari
military personnel routinely train in France.
	   Richard also presented the Qatari army with a gift of 10 Leclerc
battle tanks on Sunday.
	   U.S. defense secretary William Cohen made a six-nation Gulf tour
earlier this month aimed at trying to convince allies to finance a
regional missile defense system.
	   The United States has said it would redouble efforts to curb the
transfer of technology that Iran needs for longer-range missiles.
It accuses Iraq, which is under U.N. sanctions, of continuing
efforts to acquire missiles with a range longer than permitted
under U.N. resolutions. Iraq denies the charge.
	   Iran says its missiles are only for defense. It is believed to
have received substantial missile technology from Russia and some
from China and North Korea. The Shahab-3 is believed to be based on
North Korea's No Dong ballistic missile.

	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Eager to end decades of separatist
violence, voters in the Basque country flocked to the polls Sunday
to choose between pro-independence nationalists and mainstream
parties that want it to remain part of Spain.
	   Turnout was expected to be high among 1.8 million registered
voters despite chilly, rainy weather in much of this picturesque,
wealthy region of northern Spain.
	   With Basques enjoying a five-week-old respite from violence
thanks to a cease-fire by the armed separatist group ETA, attention
is focused on whether the truce will propel pro-independence
parties to electoral gains.
	   ``The future of Euskadi is at stake,'' said Carlos Iturgaiz, the
candidate in Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's center-right
Popular Party to be Basque regional president. He was using the
Basque word for the region.
	   Voters are renewing the 75-seat legislature, which in turn will
elect the president. It is the sixth such election since Spain
granted the Basque country a broad degree of autonomy 19 years ago.
	   Following the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, Spain
was divided into 17 autonomous regions although the Madrid
government still controls most strategic powers, such as foreign
affairs and defense.
	   Aznar is hoping heavy turnout will give his party and other
non-nationalist groups more clout in the Basque country to seek a
lasting settlement to one of Western Europe's last regional
conflicts without splitting Spain.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968. It began its
truce Sept. 18 making this the first regional election held without
a threat of violence.
	   Polling stations were to close at 8:00 p.m. and final results
are expected by 11 p.m. (2200 gmt).

Kosovo Albanians say they expected stronger U.N. resolution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The ethnic Albanian leadership
expressed disappointment Sunday with the latest U.N. Security
Council resolution on Kosovo, saying it was less than what they
expected.
	   ``The latest U.N. Security Council resolution did not fulfill
the expectations of people in Kosovo and it will not have a
significant effect in improving the situation in Kosovo,'' Dzemail
Mustafa, a spokesman for Kosovo Albanian chief leader Ibrahim
Rugova, told The Associated Press.
	   The resolution, adopted Saturday 13-0, with Russia and China
abstaining, endorsed an earlier agreement that up to 2,000
international monitors patrol the province and NATO to verify from
the air that Serb-Albanian fighting has stopped and Serbian troops
be withdrawn.
	   It declared that action may be needed to protect the unarmed
monitors in Kosovo _ but council members disagreed on just what
that action would be.
	   ``We are convinced that only an urgent international
intervention and deployment of NATO troops in Kosovo could calm the
situation, ease the humanitarian catastrophe and create conditions
for negotiations and a political solution,'' Mustafa said.
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders have continuously demanded a military
intervention to prevent government forces from fighting against
ethnic Albanian separatist guerrillas.
	   Mustafa said, ``It appears that the activity by Russia and China
led to some easing of the stand toward the regime in Belgrade. The
regime will certainly use the insufficiently energetic (U.N.) stand
to further postpone its compliance,'' with the earlier U.N.
resolution that demands a halt to the Serbian crackdown on the
ethnic Albanian separatists.

Syrian minister to thank Iran for help in Turkey crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa
arrived to thank Iran for its help in defusing a crisis between
Syria and Turkey, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
	   IRNA quoted al-Sharaa as saying he would deliver a message from
President Hafez Assad to Iran's president, Mohammad Khatami,
expressing gratitude for for Tehran's mediation.
	   Tensions rose between the two neighbors after Ankara sought
Syria's commitment to stop sheltering separatist Kurdish guerrillas
from Turkey. Mediation by Egypt, and to a lesser degree Iran, ended
a standoff that had sparked fears of war in the region.
	   Al-Sharaa and his delegation also will be discussing bilateral
ties with senior Iranian officials, IRNA said. Syria is Iran's
closest Arab ally.

Bus crash in Turkey kills French tourist, injures 12

<TEXT>
	   IZMIR, Turkey (AP) _ A bus carrying French tourists overturned
on a rain-slick road near the Aegean port city of Izmir on Sunday,
killing one passenger and injuring 12 others, the Anatolia news
agency said.
	   The tourists were traveling from Pamukkale, a popular site
because of its waterfalls, to Izmir, some 230 kilometers (138
miles) west, to catch a flight back to France.
	   Nine of the injured were French and three were Turks, the report
said, adding that none had suffered life-threatening injuries.
	   Anatolia said the bus slid just outside of a tunnel and
overturned on a road slippery from rain.
	   French embassy officials were not available for comment.

Election of governors could influence Brazilian president's

austerity plan

 &UR; By MICHAEL ASTOR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ With President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso's economic austerity plan at a critical point for Brazil,
voters went to the polls Sunday to elect governors in 12 states and
the Federal District of Brasilia.
	   Voting was calm after polls opened at 8 a.m. (1000 GMT), showing
little of the illegal but last-minute campaigning that pervaded the
first-round election on Oct. 4. Even so, army troops were deployed
at voting stations in four northern states to ensure peace.
	   The austerity plan was very much on the minds of the 64 million
Brazilians expected to vote. Paulo Garrini, a business
administration student in Sao Paulo, said it was one reason he
voted for incumbent Gov. Mario Covas, a Cardoso ally.
	   ``Covas made it clear he will support Cardoso in the austerity
measures the country needs, no matter how painful they may be,''
Garrini said.
	   But many voters are indifferent, believing that hard times are
ahead _ no matter what their choice at the polls.
	   Caught up in the financial turmoil that began more than a year
ago in Southeast Asia, Brazil believes it needs to slash government
spending and raise taxes quickly to shore up its flagging economy
and restore investor confidence.
	   The difficulty, however, of pushing through such unpopular
measures at election time became evident when Cardoso repeatedly
put off announcing the austerity package. Such measures were
initially expected after first-round elections, in which Cardoso
was re-elected and 14 state governors were chosen.
	   After the election, Cardoso said the package could be announced
by Oct. 20. But with 13 government-allied candidates facing tough
run-offs, he postponed it until after the Oct. 25 second-round
elections.
	   David Fleischer, a professor of political science at the
University of Brasilia said it was a smart move on the president's
part.
	   ``Governors have far more power and a direct hold on their
states than the president has over the whole country,'' said
Fleischer. ``Their influence and political weight should not be
underestimated.''
	   Another reason Cardoso needs allies at the state level is to
curb their overspending, which accounts for a big chunk of the
government's dlrs 65 billion budget deficit.
	   Even without announcing harsh budget cutting measures, the
situation still looks fairly grim for Cardoso allies in Brazil's
four most developed states _ Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas
Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul.
	   In Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse with
more than 34 million inhabitants, Covas came from behind in the
polls to pass Paulo Maluf, a populist candidate with a taste for
extravagant public works projects.
	   In Rio de Janeiro, polls put opposition candidate Anthony
Garotinho well ahead of Cardoso ally Cesar Maia.
	   ``Whoever wins, it's going to be difficult because it doesn't
look like there's going to be much money to spend,'' said Paulo
Benevides, a 22-year-old college student. He said he planned to
vote for Maia, Rio's mayor.

German Social Democrats to approve partnership with Greens

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Social Democrats approved an
alliance with the environmentalist Greens party on Sunday, clearing
the final hurdle for the first center-left government in 16 years
to take office.
	   A special convention of the Social Democrats voted almost
unanimously to back the coalition pact the two parties sealed last
week, which declares the fight against 10-percent unemployment
their No. 1 goal.
	   The Social Democrats won the Sept. 27 election, ending
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's long tenure, but they needed a junior
partner to secure a majority in parliament. A Greens meeting
overwhelmingly backed the partnership Saturday.
	   Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, due to be sworn in Tuesday,
will be the last chancellor to run the nation from Bonn before the
government's historic return to Berlin, the prewar capital, next
year.
	   ``We will make a new beginning for Germany, first in Bonn, then
in Berlin,'' he declared in a convention speech.
	   The 525 delegates gave the future chancellor strong support.
Only one voted against the alliance, and three abstained.

	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Five weeks after separatists declared a
cease-fire in their fight against Spain, Basque voters faced a
decision in regional elections Sunday to either reward the
pro-independence nationalists or support more mainstream parties.
	   Turnout was expected to be high among the 1.8 million registered
voters despite chilly, rainy weather in much of this picturesque,
wealthy region of northern Spain.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's is hoping heavy turnout will
give his center-right Popular Party and other non-nationalist
groups more clout in the Basque country to seek a lasting
settlement to one of Western Europe's last regional conflicts
without splitting Spain.
	   The armed separatist group ETA, whose name is a Basque-language
acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed nearly 800
people since 1968. It began its truce Sept. 18 making this the
first regional election held without a threat of violence.
	   A key question is how much support the cease-fire will attract
for the third-placed, pro-ETA Herri Batasuna party, which is
fielding candidates under a new coalition called Euskal
Herritarrok.
	   Aznar says there can be no peace process until ETA accepts the
results of the elections and renounces violence for good.
	   Although ETA has called cease-fires before, many Spaniards see
this one as the best opportunity in years to end the conflict.
	   The elections are for the region's 75-seat legislature, which in
turn will elect the Basque regional president. It is the sixth such
election since Spain granted the Basque country a broad degree of
autonomy 19 years ago.
	   Following the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, Spain
was divided into 17 autonomous regions, although the Madrid
government still controls most strategic powers, such as foreign
affairs and defense.
	   The moderate Basque Nationalist Party, which helped negotiate
the cease-fire, is expected to remain the largest party in the
legislature but to fall short of an outright majority. It would
then need allies to form a coalition government.
	   In Vitoria, the clean, handsome town that serves as the seat of
the Basque government, people braved the cold to vote in polling
stations guarded by Basque police wearing bright red coats and
berets and carrying shiny white truncheons.
	   Many said they could not remember an election that so clearly
pitted the nationalists against the non-nationalist camps. They
also said that with the ETA cease-fire, regardless of who wins,
Basques will now feel freer to speak their minds.
	   ``The election opens a whole new range of possibilities,'' said
Ignacio Martinez, a 40-year-old teacher who said he voted for
Euskal Herritarrok.

Thousands march to mark 75th anniversary Turkish republic

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of people on Sunday
kicked off a week-long celebration to mark the 75th anniversary of
the republic, marching through streets across the country and
shouting slogans in favor of secular Turkey.
	   ``Turkey is secular and will remain so,'' and ``Long live the
republic,'' a stream of flag-waiving crowds chanted in the capital
Ankara as they marched some 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) to the
Mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of secular Turkey.
	   The marchers laid flags and flowers as they filed past Ataturk's
marble resting place.
	   In Istanbul, hundreds of thousands more who gathered in the
central Taksim square chanted the national anthem and songs from
the early days of the republic.
	   Similar rallies took place all across Turkey where a widening
divide between those determined to preserve Turkey's secular
tradition and supporters of an Islamic political movement has been
a constant source of tension for the country in the past two years.
	   An Islamic-led government was pressured into resignation last
year by the fiercely pro-secular military and the Islamic Welfare
party was disbanded by the Constitutional court for anti-secular
activity this year.
	   Sunday's marches, the largest gathering of people in the
country, managed to dwarf a protest march earlier this month by
thousands of Muslims demonstrators who joined hands and marched
throughout Turkey to protest a ban on Islamic-style head scarves in
schools and public offices.
	   Ataturk founded the secular republic on 29 October 1923 after
the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, curtailing religion's place in
society by making secularism a deeply ingrained ideology.
	   Celebrations will continue throughout the week across the
country with a series of cultural events and festivities. Several
heads of states and governments are expected to arrive in Ankara
Wednesday to attend an official republic day ceremony.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Traffic in central Madrid came to halt
Sunday as some 2,000 sheep were herded throught the city as part of
an annual procession to highlight the need to protect Spain's
ancient transhumance routes.
	   With bleating interspersed with the tinkling of bells making a
welcome substitute from the customary car horns of this busy city,
dozens of people lined the sidewalks as the merinos trotted through
Alcala street, the central Puerta del Sol square and out to the
Casa de Campo parkland on the city's southwestern outskirts.
	   The herding, staged each October for the past five years, is to
highlight the need for national and local authorities to protect
Spain's 125,000 kilometers (78,000 miles) of transhumance paths _
some dating back 800 years _ which are used for the seasonal
movement of livestock from different grazing grounds around the
country.
	   Shepherds and ecologists claim many of the paths have been
destroyed by the spread of cities and towns.
	   Madrid's lies along two of the north-south transhumance routes.
	   On Monday, the flock will continue its march to the more
temperate southwestern pastures of Extremadura after spending the
summer months in the cooler northern region of Leon.

Gunfire over grave at funeral missed by international observers

<TEXT>
	   KRAJKOVA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hostile gunfire whistled over the
heads of mourners Sunday at the funeral of an 11-year-old Albanian
boy that international observers said they were unable to attend.
	   The boy, Shemsi Elshani, was shot to death Saturday by Serb
police while helping his father and cousin chop wood from the
hillside behind this mountain village 30 kilometers (18 miles) west
of Pristina, according to Shemsi's father.
	   A team of European diplomats and an American team of the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission came to the house of the grieving
family Sunday morning, but all left before the burial.
	   Gunfire from another hill about one kilometer ( 1,000 yards)
away, the same area from where the fatal shots came the day before,
sounded several times as the diplomats decided what to do.
	   The Europeans left soon afterward, while the American observer
team questioned Shemsi's father, Rashit Elshani, and called to its
headquarters before leaving.
	   Villagers asked team leader Norman Olsen to attend the funeral
because they believed his presence would stop further shooting, but
he said that wasn't true.
	   ``Even though we have armored vehicles, if somebody is
determined to shoot more people, they won't stop for us,'' Olsen
said. ``Our presence at the gravesite will not protect you. If any
diplomat tells you otherwise, he's wrong.''
	   Shemsi's death and the unwillingness of the foreign observers to
attend his funeral showed the difficulties facing the international
community in forcing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
comply with the Oct. 12 agreement that averted NATO airstrikes on
his forces.
	   Meanwhile, in an interview with British Broadcasting Corp.,
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the threat of Nato
airstrikes would not be lifted until Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic reduces forces to pre-conflict level.
	   ``He has made progress but he needs to try an awful lot
harder,'' he said, referring to Milosevic.
	   ``I think that when on Tuesday we review this, we may well come
to the conclusion we cannot yet relax our guard, we cannot stand
down the planes, we need further progress before we relax that
order,'' Cook said in the interview.
	   Despite the agreement's demands for a cessation of hostilities
and the withdrawal of extra police and military forces sent into
Kosovo in an offensive on separatist Albanians that started in
February, sporadic violence continues with signs of increasing Serb
intimidation intended to prevent Albanian refugees from returning
to some villages.
	   Rashit Elshani said his son died simply because ``he's
Albanian.''
	   ``Even if you're unarmed, they're going to shoot you,'' he said,
his only surviving son, 7-year-old Dardan, hugging his leg. ``We'd
been there for two hours cutting trees and carrying them. We saw
them (the police) without binoculars and they had binoculars.''
	   His wife, Hasime, also 37, fainted repeatedly beside Shemsi's
bloodied body, which lay beneath blankets in a room of mourners.
	   Scores of mourners walked up the hillside for the burial in a
fresh grave next to six others _ including an uncle of Shemsi _
killed in a Serb offensive in the area on Sept. 25.
	   As the funeral ended, gunshots sounded again from the far hill,
with each round coming closer to the dispersing mourners. Some ran
down the hill while others hit the dirt, hearing the whistle of a
bullet overhead.

Typhoon Babs heads toward south China, flooding Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES death toll in Philippines; ADDS latest position of
slow-moving typhoon &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Typhoon Babs brought torrential rains and
landslides to Taiwan and lashed Hong Kong with strong winds Sunday
after killing at least 156 people in the Philippines and leaving
hundreds of thousands homeless.
	   The Hong Kong Observatory said that at 10 p.m. (1400 GMT), the
typhoon, packing sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph), was centered
about 300 kilometers (186 miles) southeast of the territory. It was
moving at about 10 kph (6.2 mph) toward the south China coast.
	   The storm was expected to be closest to Hong Kong on Tuesday,
the observatory said.
	   Its outer fringes brought torrential rains to the whole island
of Taiwan, with Hualien and several other eastern towns recording
more than 500 millimeters (20 inches) of rain in 24 hours,
weathermen said. Authorities evacuated hundreds of people from
their homes near flooded rivers.
	   In Taipei, the main Keelung River has swelled its banks.
One-third of Hsichih town was flooded in waist-high water, and much
of nearby Wutu was also flooded. Rescuers used rubber boats and
trucks to evacuate residents from apartment blocks, officials said.
	   In eastern Ilan, a man was swept into the sea while fishing in
the rough waters. Nine people were injured when their van was hit
by rockslides in eastern Taitung, police said.
	   Several domestic airports were closed, and landslides had halted
traffic and trapped hundreds of people in mountains in central
Taiwan, they said.
	   In Hong Kong, authorities hoisted the No. 3 typhoon signal, a
warning to residents to take precautions as gusts of 104 kph (64
mph) were recorded in some places.
	   The government opened several shelters for those seeking refuge
from the storm.
	   Hong Kong beaches were ordered closed because of rough seas, and
fishing boats sought shelter in the harbor.
	   In the Philippines, President Joseph Estrada has declared four
provinces and a city in the worst hit area on the southern tip of
Luzon under a state of calamity. Officials in calamity zones will
be able to use emergency funds and freeze prices of commodities
with little red tape.
	   The Philippine government's Office of Civil Defense said the
death toll from Babs rose to 156 Sunday. The fatalities included 71
people who died in landslides in hard-hit Catanduanes island and 41
people who drowned, were electrocuted or died in landslides in
nearby Camarines Sur province.
	   Local officials said entire families died in San Miguel town in
Catanduanes, where virtually every house was damaged. Residents
began burying their dead in two mass graves Saturday.
	   Nearly 400,000 people were forced out of their homes, disaster
relief officials said. Tens of thousands of others were stranded as
ports were shut and ships forbidden to sail.
	   Babs was the second devastating storm to hit the Philippines
this month. Two weeks ago, Super Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74
people in the northern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.
	   Philippine weather forecasters said Sunday they were monitoring
a low pressure area over the Pacific, about 900 kilometers (558
miles) east of the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, that
could strengthen into a storm in two to three days.

<TEXT>
	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ Hermann Maier led an Austrian sweep of
the podium Sunday in the men's World Cup opening giant slalom.
	   The double Olympic champion produced two stunning runs to finish
first with a two-leg aggregate time of 2 minutes, 10.74 seconds.
	   Teammate Stefan Eberharter, the Olympic silver medallist,
crossed second in 2:12.34, while Heinz Schilchegger was third in
2:13.08.
	   The three had clocked the fastest times in the first leg to set
up an Austrian sweep with compatriot Josef Strobl sitting in fourth
as an insurance marker.
	   But it was countryman Christian Mayer who placed fourth after
the second leg with a total time of 2:13.13, with Strobl dropping
to 19th after a disasterous final run.
	   Two-time World Cup champion Michael Von Gruenigen, sixth after
the first run, moved up a spot to fifth after the second, with a
time of 2:13.28.
	   Germany's Markus Eberle, who had just eeked into the top 30 to
qualify after the first leg, had the second fastest time, holding
the lead until Austrian Hans Knauss posted an identical chrono. In
the end Eberle moved up to a spectacular sixth place with a
combined time of 2:13.35.
	   Strong winds and heavy snow had forced race officials to delay
the start of the race by more than two hours, while workers cleared
the course and re-erected the start hut, which had been blown down
overnight.

No secret deal on nuclear test treaty with United States: minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India is not working on a secret deal
with the United States as part of talks aimed at getting New Delhi
to sign the nuclear test ban treaty, Defense Minister George
Fernandes said Sunday.
	   ``There cannot be any kind of private deal between the United
States and India on signing or not signing. It is a national
issue,'' Fernandes was quoted as saying in a panel discussion to be
telecast Monday on the state-run Doordarshan television network.
	   ``I believe that until Parliament clears it there is no question
of signing it,'' Fernandes was quoted as saying. A transcript of
his remarks on the weekly program ``On the Record,'' was made
available to news agencies Sunday.
	   In a speech last month at the United Nations, Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee expressed optimism that talks with the United
States would conclude successfully and enable New Delhi to sign the
nuclear test ban treaty by September 1999.
	   Vajpayee said on his return that some doubts remained about the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, but New Delhi had accepted the
substance of the agreement by announcing a unilateral moratorium on
nuclear testing.
	   Sunday, Fernandes watered down the prime minister's statement.
	   ``I would consider that as a statement of intent. Nothing
more,'' he was quoted as saying in the discussion.
	   U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has held a series
of discussions with Indian negotiator Jaswant Singh on the treaty
after New Delhi carried out five underground nuclear tests in May.
	   India's neighbor and rival Pakistan responded to those test with
its own tests. Washington imposed economic sanctions against both
nations.
	   The United States wants India and Pakistan to sign the treaty
and to take steps toward reconciliation to end their bitter 50-year
rivalry.
	   The treaty must be signed and ratified by 44 countries with
nuclear powers before it can go into effect. Forty-one of those 44
states have signed: India, Pakistan and North Korea have not. Of
those 41 signatories, 10 have ratified the treaty: Australia,
Austria, Brazil, Congo, France, Germany, Japan, Peru, Slovakia, and
Britain.
	   Fernandes said there had been little progress during the talks
with Washington.

India, Bangladesh to discuss border problems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA , Bangladesh (AP) _ India and Bangladesh will discuss
their common border problems when their officials meet at a
four-day conference here next week, officials said Sunday.
	   An 11-member Indian delegation led by E.N. Ram Mohan, Director
General of the Border Security Force, flew in Sunday for the talks
which begin Monday. Mohan will have discussions with Major General
Azizur Rahman, head of the Bangladeshi border guards.
	   Dhaka will raise the question of the alleged migration of
several thousand Indian tribespeople into the hilly regions of
Bangladesh following the signing of a peace accord between the
Bangladeshi government and Buddhist rebels last December, official
sources said.
	   According to officials estimates, some 20,000 Indian nationals
of the Chakma tribe have crossed into Bangladesh along with
Bangladeshi tribespeople who had taken refuge in India for years
and returned to their country after the accord.
	   But Shantu Larma, the leader of the tribespeople, has rejected
the government claim of large-scale migration of Indian Chakmas.
	   The two sides will also discuss the cross-border trafficking of
women and children, smuggling, illegal trespassing and the frequent
exchanges of gunfire between border guards on both sides, officials
said.

Tamil rebels release 3 civilian crewmen, 6 soldiers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Tamil rebels have released three
civilian crewmen and six soldiers taken captive during the past
four years to the International Red Cross, military and aid agency
officials said Sunday.
	   The rebels on Saturday released the Sri Lankan captain and a
crew member of the ``Iris Moana,'' a ferry which they hijacked in
1995 while it was transporting Tamil civilians in northern Sri
Lanka, said the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The two were among five crewmen captured by the rebels when they
seized the ferry, and took 135 Tamil passengers aboard hostage. The
other three crewmen are still kept hostage. The Tamil civilians
were released soon after the hijacking.
	   Twenty one naval sailors were killed when they tried to rescue
the passengers on board the seized ferry.
	   The rebels also released a crew member of the ``Missen,'' a
ferry they set ablaze while it anchored in the sea off Sri Lanka's
northwestern coast last year, said the officials.
	   Two Indonesian crewmen aboard the ship were released earlier,
but some Sri Lankan crewmen were held captive.
	   Six soldiers captured by the rebels in various confrontations in
northern Sri Lanka were also released Saturday, said the officials.
	   It was not immediately known how many more civilian crewmen were
being held by the rebels who are fighting for a separate homeland
in the nation's north and east for minority Tamils, claiming that
they are discriminated by the majority Sinhalese who control the
government and the military.
	   More than 54,000 people have been killed in the civil war since
1983.

Chirac, Jospin down; majority demand more in education crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Allegre comment, TRIMS
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Student discontent, retiree rage, stubborn
unemployment, and transit strikes sparked by youth violence are
finally taking their toll on the once-lofty approval ratings of
France's leaders.
	   A poll published Sunday indicates a sharp ratings drop for both
conservative President Jacques Chirac and Socialist Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin.
	   Another survey said Jospin's education minister has not done
enough to improve aging and overcrowded high schools, whose
students plan to protest nationwide again next month.
	   ``Chirac-Jospin: the fall'' headlined the Journal de Dimanche in
reporting Chirac's rating in October dropped six points to 56
percent.
	   Jospin, whose ratings once topped 70 percent since he took
office in June last year, got a 54 percent approval rating, down
seven points, according to the IFOP agency poll.
	   Both leaders had profited from France's summer World Cup soccer
victory and from economic growth. But unemployment leveled off at
11.8 percent and the French stock market suffered from the world
financial crisis.
	   Hundreds of thousands of students demonstrated in recent weeks
for more school aid and transit workers staged crippling strikes to
demand more police to fight rising youth violence. Tens of
thousands of retirees marched last week against plans to control
rising state pension costs.
	   The government, meanwhile, is trying to keep the deficit within
3 percent of the gross domestic product, required by the euro
single currency effective next year.
	   The Chirac-Jospin poll, conducted Oct. 15-23, surveyed a
nationally representative sampling of 1,850 adults. No margin of
error was given, but such French polls usually carry an error
margin of plus or minus 2-3 percent.
	   Another survey said 55 percent of the French believe Education
Minister Claude Allegre last week failed to adequately answer
demands by students, who plan another nationwide protest Nov. 5.
	   The disapproval widened to 63 percent among the 15-24 age group,
according to the poll, also conducted by IFOP for the Journal de
Dimanche.
	   That poll, conducted after Allegre announced the new measures
Wednesday, surveyed 1,002 people, a nationally representative group
age 15 and above, with a margin of error of 2-3 percent.
	   Allegre said he will hire 15,000 more personnel, cut class sizes
to 35 by next fall, boost security and make 4 billion francs (dlrs
730 million) in no-interest loans for regions to rebuild their
schools.
	   ``I'm hiring more professors,'' he argued on Canal Plus TV
Sunday. But he also sympathized with the students. ``I think I
would have protested, too.''
	   Students demand the government still more teachers, buy more
classroom equipment like computers and reform curricula to better
prepare them for the job market.

<TEXT>
	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ The 15 European Union leaders
pledged Sunday to revive stalled EU reform talks and better
coordinate their economic policies to weather global financial
turmoil.
	   ``The sense of urgency in the economic situation is very great
indeed,'' said British Prime Minister Tony Blair after a two-day EU
summit in this Alpine lakeside resort.
	   The summit marked a leftward swing in EU capitals with the
emergence of Gerhard Schroeder, a social democrat as German
chancellor, and Massimo D'Alema, the new, former-communist Italian
premier. Eleven of the 15 EU leaders are now left of center.
	   The impetus to crank the EU reform drive into high gear came
from Schroeder, whose center-left coalition takes office Tuesday,
ending 16 years of Helmut Kohl's conservative rule.
	   Germany assumes the EU presidency in January and Schroeder set a
five-month timetable to amend the Union's founding charter so the
now 15-member union can admit a dozen newcomers and not choke on
its own red tape.
	   Reforms are painful and touch on cutting farm subsidies,
revamping EU finances and giving the union a stronger defense and
foreign policy profile.
	   In a turnaround widely welcomed, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair declared his support for a greater European defense role to
prevent a recurrence of EU ``dithering and disunity'' over Kosovo.
	   ``As Kosovo has brought home to us, it is right ... that we play
a key and leading role,'' Blair said. ``Europe ... was slow to act.
If we had a more developed common foreign and security policy it
would be easier.''
	   Viktor Klima, the Austrian Chancellor and summit chairman, said
the leaders agreed more coordination of economic policies ``is the
key to create employment'' and growth to counter financial mayhem
sweeping in from Asia, Russia and Latin America.
	   The summit was held less than 100 days before the launch of the
single European currency that will aim to turn Europe into a zone
of stability and growth under an independent European Central Bank.
	   Yet there were mutterings central banks in Europe must join the
struggle against global financial turmoil by lowering benchmark
interest rates since inflation is at its lowest levels for decades.
	   ``The balance of the risk in the world economy has shifted from
inflation to deflation,'' said Blair. ``Everyone is cognizant of
this and it has policy implications.''
	   While leaders stressed they did not want to erode the
independence of the ECB that starts running monetary policy next
year, they urged the central bankers to help keep Europe on an even
economic keel.
	   The leaders asked their finance ministers to look into proposals
for raising money to finance public works projects, such as
trans-continental highway and high-speed rail networks.
	   ``If there are good, sensible infrastructure projects that will
enhance the competitiveness of European economy (they) will need to
be looked at,'' Blair said.
	   Schroeder told the summit it was important to have ``energetic
efforts to coordinate economic policy.''
	   Though he stopped short of endorsing an EU-wide employment
policy, his comments were a departure from the views of the
outgoing German government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   Schroeder said the EU governments must at long last accelerate
fruitless talks about reforming the EU ahead of its enlargement
into eastern Europe.
	   New housekeeping rules must replace ones from the 1950s when
there were only six members. Cyprus and a almost a dozen East
European nations are in line to join the EU.
	   Schroeder urged his partners to settle on draft reforms at a
mid-December summit in Vienna. He said he may call another summit
in February before the reforms can be finalized in March.
	   The talks have so far been fruitless because of the scope of
proposals: farm subsidy cuts of up to 30 percent, more majority
voting eroding national sovereignty and overhauling the budget to
end complaints from Germany, Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands
they pay too much for EU membership.

Street fighting among Arafat followers leaves two hurt

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ In an ominous outbreak of internal
conflict stemming from the new peace accord, members of Yasser
Arafat's political faction fought street battles Sunday with
Palestinian security forces, injuring two men.
	   The clash, representing a serious rupture within Arafat's ranks,
followed a bid by Palestinian military intelligence to seize
unlicensed weapons. That was among tough new security measures
Arafat agreed to at last week's U.S. summit.
	   The fighting in the center of the West Bank town of Ramallah
broke out as Marwan Barghouti, the leader of Fatah in the West
Bank, was addressing a group of about 100 supporters outside the
Palestinian Authority headquarters and the offices of Governor
Mustafa Isa.
	   Some of the Fatah activists picked up stones and hurled them
over a fence into the compound and at plainclothes intelligence
agents who were watching the gathering from the sidelines,
witnesses said.
	   Intelligence agents hurled rocks back at the crowd. But then
some of the security agents fired from the second- and third-floor
windows, with some of the gunfire directed into the crowd. About
the same time, armed Fatah members arrived on the scene, firing
shots into the air.
	   Two men were hurt, including a Fatah activist who suffered a
gunshot wound to the head. That silenced the gunfire on both sides,
and leaders from both sides quickly withdrew for a meeting.
	   A senior Fatah official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the confrontation followed a search Saturday night of Fatah
headquarters by members of Palestinian intelligence. Fistfights
broke out as the searchers went through files and looked for
unlicensed weapons, the official said.
	   Some Fatah activists said the confrontation was exacerbated by a
personal feud between the commander of the raiding party and two
Fatah members.
	   Merchants in the center of town shuttered their shops, and
burning tires and overturned garbage bins littered the streets. The
fighting occurred entirely in Palestinian-controlled areas, and
Israeli troops were not involved.

	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ Hermann Maier led an Austrian sweep of
the podium Sunday in the men's World Cup opening giant slalom.
	   The double Olympic champion produced two stunning runs to finish
first with a two-leg aggregate time of 2 minutes, 10.74 seconds.
Teammate Stefan Eberharter, the Olympic silver medallist, crossed
second in 2:12.34, while Heinz Schilchegger was third in 2:13.08.
	   The three had clocked the fastest times in the first leg to set
up an Austrian sweep with compatriot Josef Strobl sitting in fourth
as an insurance marker.
	   But it was countryman Christian Mayer who placed fourth after
the second leg with a total time of 2:13.13, with Strobl dropping
to 19th after a disastrous final run.
	   Two-time World Cup champion Michael Von Gruenigen, sixth after
the first run, moved up a spot to fifth after the second, with a
time of 2:13.28.
	   Germany's Markus Eberle, who had just eeked into the top 30 to
qualify after the first leg, had the second fastest time, holding
the lead until Austrian Hans Knauss posted an identical chrono. In
the end Eberle moved up to a spectacular sixth place with a
combined time of 2:13.35.
	   Strong winds and heavy snow had forced race officials to delay
the start of the race by more than two hours, while workers cleared
the course and re-erected the start hut, which had been blown down
overnight.

Iraq derides U.S. funding aimed at toppling Saddam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An official Iraqi newspaper on Sunday
derided a U.S. Congress proposal to spend dlrs 97 million to try to
topple President Saddam Hussein and said the move should be
condemned by the United Nations.
	   The daily Al-Thawra, paper of the ruling Baath Party, raised the
question of how Washington would react if Iraq adopted a similar
measure directed at U.S. leaders.
	   ``The American administration would not only refuse such
behavior, it would even complain to the Security Council ... and
consider Iraq's move an act of terrorism,'' said the paper.
	   The U.S. measure, which would fund Iraqi opposition groups, has
not yet been approved by the White House. It has been criticized as
a misstep or waste of money by some in the American intelligence
community and even some Iraqi opposition groups.
	   Al-Thawra said the move should be condemned by the U.N. Security
Council and the Arab League. On Oct. 20, the Iraqi government sent
a letter to the Security Council asking it to stop ``illegal U.S.
acts'' against Iraq, listing among them the effort to topple
Saddam.

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Former Saudi Oil Minister
Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani warned Gulf states Sunday that cutting oil
production more to drive up prices could encourage investment in
competing sources in Central Asia.
	   Yamani acknowledged that low oil prices will keep Caspian fields
from being developed at the pace originally planned, noting that
``it is very costly to explore, develop and transport the oil
reserves of the Caspian.''
	   ``But if we keep on cutting Gulf production, we will be faced
with another North Sea,'' he told a two-day conference on Caspian
oil. In the 1980s, OPEC's high prices made investment in North Sea
oil fields worthwhile and North Sea production has since limited
OPEC's clout.
	   Yamani said that with the current low prices, profits from from
Caspian oil would be much lower than earlier anticipated.
	   He said proven oil reserves around the Caspian total 16.1
billion barrels. While oil companies have estimated reserves could
be as high as 200 billion barrels, Yamani said these estimates were
``greatly exaggerated.''

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's exports to Arab countries dropped
20 percent to 256 million dinars (dlrs 360.5 million) in the first
seven months this year compared with the same period last year, the
government said Sunday.
	   A report from the Central Bank said Jordan exported to Arab
countries food stuffs, vegetable oil, chemicals, ready-made
garments, vegetables and fruits.
	   Jordan's imports from Arab countries during the first seven
months of 1998 amounted to 316 million dinars (dlrs 445 million)
and included fuel oil and other oil products.
	   Total imports amounted to 1.57 billion dinars (dlrs 2.2 billion)
during the January-July period this year, the statistics indicated.
	   Exports during the same period were 570 million dinars (dlrs
802.8 million) covering a variety of commodities.
	   ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Representatives of 14 South Korean manufacturers,
mostly of industrial machinery, are visiting Kuwait for three days
to promote their products, the Korean Embassy said Sunday.
	   The 27-man mission was scheduled to arrive Monday and will be
headed by the mayor of Changwon City, where the leading visiting
firms are located. The manufacturers make bottling machinery,
construction and oil field equipment and water purifiers.
	   The value of Korean exports to Kuwait in 1997 was dlrs 194
million dollars, the embassy said. Kuwait imports cars,
electronics, industrial machinery, tires and textiles from Korea.
	   Korea's imports from this oil-rich Gulf state were dlrs 1.75
billion for the same year, mostly in oil and petrochemicals.
	   In the first seven months this year, Korean exports to Kuwait
jumped 238 percent, compared to the same period last year, reaching
dlrs 451 million. The statement said this was due to the delivery
of two oil tankers from Hyundai Heavy Industries to Kuwait Oil
Tankers Co., and an increase in demand for steel products, cars and
industrial machinery.
	   ___
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ The Arab Banking Corp., the richest Arab
bank, is expecting lower profits this year because of the global
financial crisis, its executive officer said Sunday.
	   Ghazi Abdul-Jawad said the bank had set aside dlrs 90 million
for bad loans for the first half of this year, and expected to have
to set aside even more by the end of the year.
	   He noted that the bank has a presence in most of the world's
major markets, and that the situation in these markets is getting
worse. ``Therefore I expect that we will be compelled to set aside
additional provisions (for bad loans).''
	   Abdul-Jawad, in Qatar for a regional banking conference, would
not give specific figures for expected results this year.
Bahrain-based Arab Banking Corp.'s net profits last year were dlrs
145 million, up from dlrs 129 million in 1996. The bank is the
biggest in the Arab world in terms of assets.
	   The bank has said that its pretax profit in the first half of
1998 plunged 23.4 percent to dlrs 72 million, from dlrs 94 million
for the same period in 1996.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ The British and Spanish prime
ministers said Sunday that the fate of former Chilean dictator Gen.
Augusto Pinochet is in the hands of their judicial authorities and
they will not interfere.
	   ``Both myself and Mr. Aznar agree this is not a matter for us to
discuss,'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair said, referring to
Spanish leader Jose Maria Aznar. ``I've avoided commenting on that
judicial process and I don't intend to do so.''
	   Aznar made similar comments when he meet journalists on the
margin of a European Union summit in this Alpine lakeside resort.
	   Pinochet is under arrest in a London hospital where he'd gone
for back surgery. He was detained on a warrant from a Spanish
magistrate seeking to extradite him on charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture during his 1973-90 rule.
	   The Chilean government has urged Britain to release Pinochet on
humanitarian grounds, and argued that as a senator, he is entitled
to diplomatic immunity.
	   Aznar dismissed reports that the bid to try Pinochet will damage
Spain's relations with Latin America. ``It's important we don't
talk nonsense about this issue. This is stupid.''

Retired ``actors'' get new home

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Twenty-one aging bears _ previously
used in movies, but now kept in cages _ have been a given a new
home in a wooded compound, the weekly Vasarnapi Hirek reported
Sunday.
	   The bears once starred in films, but because the Hungarian movie
company Mafilm has fallen on hard times and the animals had gotten
too old, they were cooped up in small cages in the back yard.
	   Hearing of their plight, the mayor of Veresegyhaz, 40 kilometers
(25 miles) northeast of Budapest, got the municipality to donate a
plot of land and Jozsef Kosa, Mafilm's animal trainer, contacted
the World Society of the Protection of Animals for help.
	   The organization donated ten million forints (dlrs 48,000).
Artificial caves and a man-made lake were created in the fenced-in
area, with many people of Veresegyhaz donating their labor.
	   Releasing them in pairs, the bears have been moved to the park.
	   Peter Hanson from WSPA's branch in England said in a televison
report that the bears ``will be joined by some political refugees _

Brazilian pop singer Latino released by kidnappers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Kidnappers released a Brazilian
pop singer Sunday after realizing they had seized the wrong person,
police said.
	   The gang considered killing Roberto Souza Rocha, 25, known as
Latino, after capturing him Saturday, detective Alvaro Lins said in
a televised interview.
	   ``The kidnappers had wanted someone else and did not know what
to do with him,'' said Lins. Rocha eventually was dumped at a
railroad station on the poor northern outskirts of Rio.
	   Rocha was hospitalized Sunday with a broken arm, the Globo TV
network reported.
	   A search for the singer started after his abandoned jeep was
found near Rio's airport. He had been driving there to catch a
flight to northeastern Brazil for a concert.
	   Rocha has made three records since 1994. The most popular was
``Me Leva,'' (or ``Take Me'' in Portugese), which sold 500,000
copies.

Chileans in Sweden seek murder charges against Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ A group of Chilean immigrants who lost
family members during Gen. Augusto Pinochet's rule sought Sunday to
have the former dictator charged with mureder and kidnapping in
Sweden.
	   Pinochet is in a London hospital, where he was arrested this
month after spinal surgery on a Spanish warrant seeking his
extradition on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture during
his 17-year regime.
	   His lawyers are to go to the British High Court on Monday to
seek to have the arrest invalidated.
	   The Swedish group Association of Relatives of Disappeared
Political Prisoners on Sunday went to a Stockholm police station to
file three relatives' complaints of murder and kidnapping.
	   Group spokesman Jose Miguel Cortez said more complaints could be
in the works, but said the group decided on the unusual move of
filing quickly on Sunday in light of the possibility of a decision
in Britain on Monday.
	   There was no immediate decision on the complaints. Courts were
closed on Sunday and Justice Ministry spokesman Bjoern Lindh said
it was not immediately clear is Sweden would consider itself to
have jurisdiction in such cases.
	   ''We hope they take a stand,'' Cortez said. ''
	   One of those filing a complaint was Javier Munoz, who said his
sister, her husband, the husband's father and a brother disappeared
in April 1976 in Santiago, the Chilean capital.
	   The men were members of the Chilean Communist Party, an illegal
acitivity at the time, and the husband, Luis Emilio Recabarren, was
a prominent labor activist, Munoz said.
	   According to Munoz, the two younger men and the woman were
arrested at a bus-stop along with Recabarren's 1-year-old son. The
boy was later left near the house of his grandfather; when he heard
the boy's cries about 3 a.m. he went out to look for him and was
arrested, Munoz said.
	   ''It's more than just pain,'' Munoz said through an interpreter.
''We want nothing more than justice, but nothing less.''

Member of Jihad dies in shootout with police

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A member of the Islamic militant Jihad
group died Saturday in a shootout with Albanian special police in a
Tirana suburb, authorities reported Sunday.
	   Salah el Saeid, a 29-year-old Egyptian citizen, was considered
one of the most dangerous people wanted by the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency, Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga told
The Associated Press.
	   Saeid was wanted for threatening the U.S. Embassy in Tirana in
August, Bizhga said.
	   He reportedly lived in Tirana and was married to an Albanian
woman.
	   Saeid reportedly started shooting around 8 p.m. (1800 GMT)
Saturday from a first-floor window after he saw police forces
around his house, which had been under observation by the Albanian
secret service.
	   The commander of the special police was wounded during the
one-hour shootout.
	   A first report issued by the Interior Ministry said Saeid was
found dead on the floor. Later Bizhga said the Egyptian had
committed suicide.
	   On Aug. 17, 120 heavily armed U.S. Marines tightened security at
the American diplomatic compound in Tirana after U.S. officials
said they received credible evidence of a plan to attack the U.S.
mission.
	   The embassy temporarily suspended normal operations, evacuating
family members and nonessential personnel.

Intruder arrested at U.S. embassy in Berlin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A man who entered the U.S. Embassy with a fake
bomb, two knives and a starter pistol was arrested by
anti-terrorist agents after a guard set off a security alert,
police said Sunday.
	   The 56-year-old German, who apparently is mentally disturbed,
persuaded a Marine guard to open the embassy door Saturday by
asking for political asylum, police said.
	   The man surrendered his knives and pistol but stepped back and
set off an alarm when the guard saw what looked like a bomb.
	   Anti-terrorist police arrived at the building in central Berlin
within minutes, subdued the man and exposed the apparent bomb as a
fake, police said. The man, whose name was not released, was
committed to a psychiatric clinic.
	   An embassy spokesman was quoted in the Berliner Morgenpost
newspaper as saying that security officers had acted according to
procedure.
	   U.S. embassy officials were not immediately available for
comment.
	   Security at U.S. installations worldwide was tightened after the
Aug. 7 bombings of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

Maier wins opening giant slalom

<TEXT>
	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ Hermann Maier showed signs of prolonging
last year's domination of the men's World Cup circuit, leading an
Austrian sweep of the podium in Sunday's season opening giant
slalom.
	   The double Olympic champion left his rivals in his dust, posting
the fastest time in both runs, leaving his closest contender almost
two seconds behind.
	   Maier, who won the overall World Cup crown and World Cup titles
in super-G and giant slalom in his rookie year, finished with an
aggregate time of 2 minutes, 10.74 seconds.
	   Teammate Stefan Eberharter, the Olympic silver medallist,
crossed second in 2:12.34, while Heinz Schilchegger was third in
2:13.08.
	   The three had clocked the fastest times in the first leg to set
up an Austrian sweep with compatriot Josef Strobl sitting in fourth
as an insurance marker.
	   But it was countryman Christian Mayer who placed fourth after
the second leg with a total time of 2:13.13, with Strobl dropping
to 19th after a disasterous final run.
	   Two-time World Cup champion Michael Von Gruenigen, sixth after
the first run, moved up a spot to fifth after the second, with a
time of 2:13.28.
	   The Olympic bronze medallist, who injured his ankle playing
basketball this summer, had just resumed training two weeks ago
after a six week recovery period.
	   Germany's Markus Eberle, who barely eeked into the top 30 to
qualify after the first leg, had the second fastest time, holding
the lead until Austrian Hans Knauss posted an identical two-run
chrono of 2:13.35. In the end Eberle moved up to a spectacular
sixth place.
	   Strong winds and heavy snow had forced race officials to delay
the start of the race by more than two hours, while workers cleared
the course and re-erected the start hut, which had been blown down
overnight.
	   After the weekend races, the season takes almost a month off
before resuming for three weekends of racing in North America
beginning in Park City, Utah, Nov. 19-22 with men's and women's
giant slalom and slalom.
	   The circuit returns to Europe Dec. 10-13 in Val d'Isere, France,
for men's downhill and super-G and women's super-G and giant
slalom.

Internal Palestinian clash stemming from accord leaves two hurt

Ashrawi comment, other detail &QL; 
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ In a major rupture within Yasser
Arafat's ranks, members of the Palestinian leader's political
faction fought battled Palestinian security forces with rocks and
bullets Sunday. Two people were hurt, one seriously.
	   The fighting followed a bid by Palestinian military intelligence
to seize unlicensed weapons and inspect files belonging to Arafat's
Fatah faction. A crackdown on illegal arms was among tough new
security measures Arafat agreed to at last week's
Israeli-Palestinian summit.
	   Former Cabinet minister Hanan Ashrawi, who was present when the
clash began in the West Bank town of Ramallah, called it a result
of an accord that put too much emphasis on Israeli security at
Palestinian expense.
	   ``This is very dangerous,'' she said. ``If this situation is
allowed to continue we would be facing an internal breakdown.''
	   The fighting broke out as Marwan Barghouti, the leader of Fatah
in the West Bank, was addressing a group of about 100 supporters
outside the Palestinian Authority headquarters and the offices of
Governor Mustafa Isa.
	   Some of the Fatah activists picked up stones and hurled them
over a fence into the compound and at plainclothes intelligence
agents who were watching the gathering from the sidelines,
witnesses said.
	   Intelligence agents hurled rocks back at the crowd. But then
some of the security agents fired from the second- and third-floor
windows, with some of the gunfire directed into the crowd. About
the same time, armed Fatah members arrived on the scene, firing
shots into the air.
	   Two men were hurt, including a Fatah activist who suffered a
gunshot wound to the head. That silenced the gunfire on both sides,
and leaders from both sides quickly withdrew for a meeting.
	   A senior Fatah official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the confrontation followed a search Saturday night of Fatah
headquarters by about 50 members of Palestinian intelligence.
Fistfights broke out as the searchers went through files and looked
for unlicensed weapons, the official said.
	   Some Fatah activists said the confrontation was exacerbated by a
personal feud between the commander of the raiding party and two
Fatah members.
	   Fatah called a three-day strike in Ramallah to protest the
violence, and graffiti denouncing the intelligence agents as
``traitors'' appeared on walls near where the clash took place.
	   The fighting occurred entirely in Palestinian-controlled areas,
and Israeli troops were not involved.

60-vehicle pileup south of Paris during storm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ About 60 vehicles crashed into each other Sunday
afternoon on a rain-slicked stretch of France's main north-south
highway outside the capital as a storm barreled through northern
France, authorities said.
	   The chain-reaction pileup involved about 30 vehicles in each
direction on the A-6 highway near Wissous, a suburb south of Paris,
according to the National Highway Information Center (CNIR).
	   No injuries were immediately reported and traffic was restored
by mid-afternoon on the Paris-Lyon highway, the authorities said.
	   Meanwhile, heavy rain and winds gusting up to 126 kph (80 mph)
overnight Saturday caused damage in the Nord-Pas de Calais region
of northwestern France.
	   Fire-rescuers were called more than 180 times due to storm
damage including toppled trees, flooded basements and broken
antennas. No injuries were reported.
	   The storm caused several deaths in Britain in the past two days,
authorities have said.

Romania's president honors communist jailer, angers allies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romanian President Emil Constantinescu
on Sunday awarded a high military honor to the chief of a notorious
Communist prison, angering his political allies.
	   Constantin Ticu Dumitrescu, a lawmaker who was imprisoned and
tortured by the Communists, said: ``It is impossible that such
torturers ... are free. Next Constantinescu will want to lock up
former political prisoners.''
	   Constantinescu decorated thousands of former political prisoners
Sunday as part of Romania's national army day celebrations. Vasile
Cioplan, the chief of the Sighet prison in northern Romania, where
hundreds of prisoners died, was also given a military honor.
	   The president's press office had no comment on the matter.
Constantinescu does not have a spokesperson, which often makes
official comment slow to come from his office.
	   But Defense Minister Victor Babiuc was quoted as saying the
inclusion of Cioplan was ``a mistake.''
	   Romania was under Communist rule from 1948 to 1989. The
persecution of intellectuals and dissidents is still a sensitive
subject, especially as many people in office today were members of
the Communist Party.
	   Poet Ana Blandiana, who also heads the Civic Alliance party,
called Constantinescu's gesture unprofessional, saying that Cioplan
had headed Sighet prison at a time when Romania's political and
cultural elite ``were exterminated.''

	   The double Olympic champion left his rivals in his dust, posting
the fastest time in both runs, leaving his closest contender almost
two seconds behind.
	   Maier, who won the overall World Cup crown and World Cup titles
in super-G and giant slalom in his rookie year, finished with an
aggregate time of 2 minutes, 10.74 seconds. Teammate Stefan
Eberharter, the Olympic silver medalist, crossed second in 2:12.34,
while Heinz Schilchegger was third in 2:13.08.
	   The three had clocked the fastest times in the first leg to set
up an Austrian sweep with compatriot Josef Strobl sitting in fourth
as an insurance marker.
	   But it was countryman Christian Mayer who placed fourth after
the second leg with a total time of 2:13.13, with Strobl dropping
to 19th after a disastrous final run.
	   Two-time World Cup champion Michael Von Gruenigen, sixth after
the first run, moved up a spot to fifth after the second, with a
time of 2:13.28.
	   The Olympic bronze medalist, who injured his ankle playing
basketball this summer, had just resumed training two weeks ago
after a six-week recovery period.
	   Germany's Markus Eberle, who barely eeked into the top 30 to
qualify after the first leg, had the second fastest time, holding
the lead until Austrian Hans Knauss posted an identical two-run
chrono of 2:13.35. In the end Eberle moved up to a spectacular
sixth place.
	   Strong winds and heavy snow had forced race officials to delay
the start of the race by more than two hours, while workers cleared
the course and re-erected the start hut, which had been blown down
overnight.
	   After the weekend races, the season takes almost a month off
before resuming for three weekends of racing in North America
beginning in Park City, Utah, Nov. 19-22 with men's and women's
giant slalom and slalom.
	   The circuit returns to Europe Dec. 10-13 in Val d'Isere, France,
for men's downhill and super-G and women's super-G and giant
slalom.

Greece urges Turkey to help Orthodoxy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOUNT ATHOS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's president urged Turkey on
Sunday to do more to support the Istanbul-based Ecumenical
Patriarchate, which leads nearly 300 million Orthodox Christians
around the world.
	   ``It is in Turkey's interest to promote the role of the
Ecumenical Patriarchate,'' said President Costis Stephanopoulos
during a visit to the semi-autonomous, all-male monastic community
of Mount Athos in northern Greece.
	   Greece has accused mostly Muslim Turkey of imposing too many
restrictions on the Patriarchate in Istanbul, whose Greek Orthodox
community has dwindled to several thousand. The requirements
include Turkish citizenship for the ecumenical patriarch, the
``first among equals'' of the Orthodox clerics. This severely
limits the number of potential candidates.
	   Stephanopoulos is visiting Mount Athos to attend celebrations
marking 1,000 years since the Xenofondos Monastery was founded.
Xenofondos is among the oldest of the 20 Orthodox monasteries on
the secluded Athos peninsula.
	   Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I was present at the
celebrations, joining Greece's spiritual leader, Archbishop
Christodoulos and top Greek officials.

Jewish settlers protest accord; Netanyahu hails agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu arrival, comment, earlier protest in
east Jerusalem, dispute among Arafat supporters in Ramallah. Edits

<TEXT>
	   OFRA, West Bank (AP) _ Hours after Jewish settlers staged
road-blocking protests across the West Bank Sunday to protest the
new peace accord, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the
pact as the ``best deal'' that could be achieved.
	   Arriving back in Israel to a red-carpet welcome, the Israeli
leader said security concessions won from the Palestinians during
the nine-day summit outside Washington would justify the ceding of
more West Bank land.
	   ``We are returning after a long and difficult effort to bring
... security and peace to Israel,'' he said. ``We achieved such a
deal _ we achieved the best deal... We did something good for the
state of Israel.''
	   In Sunday morning's protests by settlers _ who were once
Netanyahu's staunch supporters _ police said at least 20 settlers
were arrested and two police officers were hurt.
	   Near the settlement of Ofra north of Jerusalem, about 50
settlers and their supporters rushed past Israeli police and sat
cross-legged on the highway. Some settlers wrapped in prayer shawls
held morning prayers at the roadside.
	   There were similar demonstrations throughout the West Bank.
Police also said settlers burned tires at the Karme Tsur settlement
north of Hebron.
	   ``I'm here to show that this is a sad day,'' said Natan El, 38,
an engineer, sitting in the middle of the main north-south highway
through the West Bank. ``We are in danger of losing our land, the
land we have returned to after 2,000 years.''
	   In the Ras al Amud neighborhood of traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem, Jewish settlers tried to fence in a disputed lot, but
police halted the work because they did not have a permit.
	   The neighborhood was the scene of riots last fall when a small
group of settlers moved into a home owned by Miami millionaire
Irving Moskowitz, a benefactor of Jewish settler causes
	   Tensions over the accord also boiled over in the West Bank town
of Ramallah, where infighting broke out among Yasser Arafat's
supporters. Members of the Palestinian leader's political faction,
Fatah, battled Palestinian security forces with rocks and bullets,
leaving two injured.
	   The confrontation broke out after Palestinian intelligence
agents searched Fatah headquarters, looking for illegal weapons. A
crackdown on unlicensed arms is one of the provisions of the
agreement.
	   Meanwhile, Israeli politicians from most parties predicted
political turmoil in the wake of the signing of the peace
agreement.
	   ``This government probably won't survive,'' said David Levy, who
quit his post as Netanyahu's foreign minister in January.
	   Twelve of Netanyahu's supporters in the parliament say they will
vote against him in upcoming no-confidence motions. Netanyahu has
only a one-seat majority.
	   The moderate opposition Labor party, which originated the peace
process with the Palestinians, pledges to back the accord in
parliament and refrain from voting no confidence in Netanyahu's
government for two weeks.
	   Sunday's protests marked the first major action by the settlers
since the signing of the accord, which came during the Jewish
Sabbath.
	   With orders to keep the roads open, police arrested 31
protesters, according to Aharon Domb, head of the settlers'
council. The police said more than 20 had been arrested but could
not provide a precise figure.
	   Domb also said 20 settlers, including women and children, were
injured in clashes with police near the settlement of Kadumim.
Police could not confirm any settler injuries, but said two police
were slightly hurt.
	   Israeli police were also on alert for possible attacks by
Palestinian extremists opposed to the accord, according to Israel
radio.
	   The agreement signed at the White House Friday calls for an
Israeli handover of 13.1 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian
civilian control. That means some Jewish settlements will be
surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory, except for access
roads.
	   Leaders of the settler council, including mayors of the various
West Bank regions, met at the movement's Jerusalem headquarters to
talk strategy. Settler spokeswoman Yehudit Tayar they were
discussing whether and how to try to bring down the government.
	   In a another development, Palestinian security arrested Sheik
Hamed Betawi, a Hamas leader from the West Bank town of Nablus.
According to his family, Betawi, 55, is being held in a Nablus
prison. During the past several weeks, more than two dozen Hamas
activists have been arrested.

Bomb blast kills head of Chechnya's anti-kidnapping division
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES throughout with passersby injured, details about
bomb, victim, comment from Chechen president. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechnya's top anti-kidnapping official
was killed Sunday when a bomb tore his car to pieces on the day he
was to launch a major offensive on hostage-takers in the breakaway
republic.
	   Shadid Bargishev's two bodyguards were in critical condition
after suffering serious injuries in the accident, and several
passersby were also injured, doctors said.
	   Bargishev, 27, died on the operating table after losing both
legs in the blast in the parking lot of the anti-kidnapping
department office in the Chechen capital of Grozny, Chechen
President Aslan Maskhadov's office said in a statement.
	   The remote-controlled bomb was planted just inside the gate to
the parking lot, the Interfax news agency said.
	   The explosion came as law enforcement officials were preparing a
large operation to rescue people kidnapped in Chechnya. Bargishev's
colleagues insisted they would not be intimidated by the attack and
would go ahead with the offensive.
	   Other anti-kidnapping officials blamed the attack on Bargishev's
recent success in securing the release of several hostages,
including 24 Russian soldiers and an English couple.
	   ``The accident is a result of the work of the (anti-kidnapping)
department,'' said Husein Zabrailov, an investigator who worked
with Bargishev.
	   More than 100 people are still being held captive in Chechnya,
including three Britons, a New Zealander and a Turk, according to
Interfax.
	   Soon after the blast, several Grozny residents came to a local
emergency clinic to donate blood to save Bargishev, Interfax said.
	   Maskhadov expressed his condolences, saying Chechnya ``will
never forget its true sons,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The Chechen president also ordered law enforcement officials
Sunday to step up efforts against criminal groups, giving them
permission to ``destroy bandits on the spot'' if they resist,
Maskhadov's office said.
	   Chechnya, where rebels fought a bloody independence war against
Russia in 1994-96, conducts its own affairs and has seen a sharp
rise in violent crime and hostage-taking, usually by criminal gangs
for ransom.
	   Most of the recent hostage releases have been facilitated by
Russian financier Boris Berezovsky, though details of his
involvement have been unclear.

Agassi wins Czech Indoor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSTRAVA, Czech Republic (AP) _ Second seed Andre Agassi of the
United States won the IPB Czech Indoor ATP tennis tournament,
defeating Jan Kroslak of Slovakia in the final on Sunday.
	   Agassi beat Kroslak 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, winning 220 points in ATP
ranking and dlrs 137,000 in prize money.
	   Kroslak started the play with an ace, not allowing Agassi to win
a single point in the first game of the first set. But Agassi won
his serve in the second game and broke Kroslak's in the third.
	   He then again broke Kroslak's serve in the fith game, winning
the set 6-2.
	   In the second set, Kroslak again won the first game and followed
by breaking Agassi in the second, winning the set 6-3.
	   In the third set, Kroslak failed to win a breakball in the third
game, and both players held their serves until the eight game of
the set. After Agassi broke Kroslak in that game, he easily won the
last one, not allowing his rival to gain a single point.
	   After the match, Agassi said the third set was the most
difficult but ``I managed to hold my serve.''
	   ``This has been such a great week for me,'' Agassi said,
congratulating Kroslak for his performance in the match.
	   ``I don't know what to say,'' said Kroslak, ranked 153rd in the
world, for whom his appearance in the final was an unexpected
success.

Jewish settlers protest accord; Netanyahu hails agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu arrival, comment, earlier protest in

<TEXT>
	   OFRA, West Bank (AP) _ Hours after Jewish settlers staged
road-blocking demonstrations across the West Bank on Sunday to
protest the new peace accord, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
defended the pact as the ``best deal'' that could be achieved.
	   Arriving back in Israel to a red-carpet welcome, the Israeli
leader said security concessions won from the Palestinians during
the nine-day summit outside Washington would justify the ceding of
more West Bank land.
	   ``We are returning after a long and difficult effort to bring
... security and peace to Israel,'' he said. ``We achieved such a
deal _ we achieved the best deal... We did something good for the
state of Israel.''
	   The agreement signed at the White House Friday calls for an
Israeli handover of 13.1 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian
civilian control. That means some Jewish settlements will be
surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory, except for access
roads.
	   In Sunday morning's protests by settlers _ who were once
Netanyahu's staunch supporters _ police said at least 20 settlers
were arrested and two police officers were hurt.
	   Near the settlement of Ofra north of Jerusalem, about 50
settlers and their supporters rushed past Israeli police and sat
cross-legged on the highway. Some settlers wrapped in prayer shawls
held morning prayers at the roadside.
	   There were similar demonstrations throughout the West Bank.
Police also said settlers burned tires at the Karme Tsur settlement
north of Hebron.
	   ``I'm here to show that this is a sad day,'' said Natan El, 38,
an engineer, sitting in the middle of the main north-south highway
through the West Bank. ``We are in danger of losing our land, the
land we have returned to after 2,000 years.''
	   In the Ras al Amud neighborhood of traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem, Jewish settlers tried to fence in a disputed lot, but
police halted the work because they did not have a permit.
	   The neighborhood was the scene of riots last fall when a small
group of settlers moved into a home owned by Miami millionaire
Irving Moskowitz, a benefactor of Jewish settler causes
	   Tensions over the accord also boiled over in the West Bank town
of Ramallah, where infighting broke out among Yasser Arafat's
supporters. Members of the Palestinian leader's political faction,
Fatah, battled Palestinian security forces with rocks and bullets,
leaving two injured.
	   The confrontation broke out after Palestinian intelligence
agents searched Fatah headquarters, looking for illegal weapons. A
crackdown on unlicensed arms is one of the provisions of the
agreement.
	   Meanwhile, Israeli politicians from most parties predicted
political turmoil in the wake of the signing of the peace
agreement.
	   ``This government probably won't survive,'' said David Levy, who
quit his post as Netanyahu's foreign minister in January.
	   Twelve of Netanyahu's supporters in the parliament say they will
vote against him in upcoming no-confidence motions. Netanyahu has
only a one-seat parliamentary majority.
	   The moderate opposition Labor party, which started the peace
process with the Palestinians, pledges to back the accord in
parliament and refrain from voting no confidence in Netanyahu's
government for two weeks.
	   Sunday's protests marked the first major action by the settlers
since the signing of the accord, which came during the Jewish
Sabbath.
	   With orders to keep the roads open, police arrested 31
protesters, according to Aharon Domb, head of the settlers'
council. The police said more than 20 had been arrested but could
not provide a precise figure.
	   Domb also said 20 settlers, including women and children, were
injured in clashes with police near the settlement of Kadumim.
Police could not confirm any settler injuries, but said two police
were slightly hurt.
	   Israeli police were also on alert for possible attacks by
Palestinian extremists opposed to the accord, according to Israel
radio.
	   Leaders of the settler council, including mayors of the various
West Bank regions, met at the movement's Jerusalem headquarters to
talk strategy. Settler spokeswoman Yehudit Tayar they were
discussing whether and how to try to bring down the government.
	   In another development, Palestinian security arrested Sheik
Hamed Betawi, a Hamas leader from the West Bank town of Nablus.
According to his family, Betawi, 55, is being held in a Nablus
prison. During the past several weeks, more than two dozen Hamas
activists have been arrested.

Jamaica prepares for Hurricane Mitch

	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A dangerous Hurricane Mitch
strengthened over open waters in the western Caribbean Sunday, its
winds approaching 130 mph (215 kph) as it crawled south of Jamaica.
	   At 10 a.m. EST (1500 GMT), Mitch _ now a very dangerous Category
4 storm on the Simpson-Saffir scale _ was located about 230 miles
(370 kilometers) southwest of Kingston and was moving
west-northwest at 7 mph (11 kph). Hurricane-force winds extended 45
miles (75 kilometers) from the center.
	   ``It's moving over warm water so we are forecasting it to
intensify,'' said Andrew Shashay, a meteorologist at the hurricane
center.
	   A hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica and eastern Cuba,
and a hurricane watch was posted in the Cayman Islands.
	   Jamaicans were hoping that the hurricane's track could be far
enough west to prevent the strongest winds, those around the eye of
the storm, from crossing the island.
	   In Negril, on the western tip of the island where the effects of
the hurricane were likely to be strongest, residents and tourists
took precautions.
	   At the Poinciana Beach Resort, sandbags were put in place and
the ground floor was left empty in case a storm surge from Mitch
flooded the hotel.
	   ``Experience has taught us well so we don't take any chances,''
said hotel manager Clive Miller. ``If we're going to err, we err on
the side of too much caution.''
	   Under cloudy skies Saturday afternoon, stores did brisk business
as people stocked up on canned food, water, flashlights, batteries,
candles and other necessities.
	   The Jamaica Defense Force was placed on alert and the government
Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management urged
residents to complete their preparations before nightfall.
Thousands of schools and community centers were opened as shelters.
	   Numerous weekend events were postponed, including the
International Marlin Tournament, a sportfishing event held annually
for the past 40 years in Port Antonio. Air Jamaica on Saturday
announced the cancellation of several of its Sunday flights.
	   Once past Jamaica, the slow-moving hurricane was likely to
threaten the Cayman Islands and Cuba, forecasters said.
	   Mitch formed a little more than a month after Hurricane Georges
stormed through the Caribbean, killing more than 500 people before
drenching the Florida keys and the U.S. Gulf coast.
	   Jamaica has not been directly hit by a hurricane for a decade.
In 1988, Hurricane Gilbert slammed into the island with torrential
rains and gusts as high as 145 mph (230 kph), killing 45 people.

Gunfire over grave at funeral missed by international observers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo available &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KRAJKOVA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hostile gunfire whistled over the
heads of mourners Sunday at the funeral of an 11-year-old Albanian
boy who was shot to death by Serb police.
	   The boy, Shemsi Elshani, was killed while helping his father and
cousin chop wood from the hillside behind this mountain village 30
kilometers (18 miles) west of Pristina, according to his father.
	   A team of European diplomats and an American team of the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission came to the house of the grieving
family Sunday morning, but all left before the burial.
	   Gunfire rang out from a hill about a kilometer (1,000 yards)
away, the same area from where the fatal shots came the day before,
before the diplomats left.
	   Villagers asked Norman Olsen, leader of the American team, to
attend the funeral because they believed his presence would stop
further shooting. But he disagreed.
	   ``Even though we have armored vehicles, if somebody is
determined to shoot more people, they won't stop for us,'' Olsen
said. ``Our presence at the gravesite will not protect you. If any
diplomat tells you otherwise, he's wrong.''
	   As the funeral ended, gunshots sounded again from the far hill,
with each round coming closer to the dispersing mourners. Some ran
down the hill while others hit the dirt, hearing the whistle of a
bullet overhead.
	   Shemsi's death and the absence of foreign observers at his
funeral underscored the difficulties facing the international
community in forcing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
comply with the Oct. 12 agreement that averted NATO airstrikes on
his forces.
	   Meanwhile, in an interview with British Broadcasting Corp.,
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the threat of Nato
airstrikes would not be lifted until Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic reduces forces to pre-conflict level.
	   ``He has made progress but he needs to try an awful lot
harder,'' he said, referring to Milosevic.
	   ``I think that when on Tuesday we review this, we may well come
to the conclusion we cannot yet relax our guard, we cannot stand
down the planes, we need further progress before we relax that
order,'' Cook said in the interview.
	   Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up
90 percent of Kosovo's population _ has killed hundreds of people
and forced around 300,000 from their homes since a Serb crackdown
began in February. Serbia is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Despite the Oct. 12 agreement's demands for an end to
hostilities and the withdrawal of extra police and military forces
sent into Kosovo in the Serb crackdown, sporadic violence
continues. There are also signs of increasing Serb intimidation
intended to prevent Albanian refugees from returning to some
villages.
	   Rashit Elshani said his son died simply because ``he's
Albanian.''
	   ``Even if you're unarmed, they're going to shoot you,'' he said,
as his only surviving son, 7-year-old Dardan, hugged his leg.
	   His wife, Hasime fainted repeatedly beside Shemsi's bloodied
body, which lay beneath blankets in a room of mourners.

Greece urges Turkey to help Orthodoxy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOUNT ATHOS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's president urged Turkey on
Sunday to do more to support the Istanbul-based Ecumenical
Patriarchate, which leads nearly 300 million Orthodox Christians
around the world.
	   ``It is in Turkey's interest to promote the role of the
Ecumenical Patriarchate,'' said President Costis Stephanopoulos
during a visit to the semi-autonomous, all-male monastic community
of Mount Athos in northern Greece.
	   Greece has accused mostly Muslim Turkey of imposing too many
restrictions on the Patriarchate in Istanbul, whose Greek Orthodox
community has dwindled to several thousand. The requirements
include Turkish citizenship for the ecumenical patriarch, the
``first among equals'' of the Orthodox clerics. This severely
limits the number of potential candidates.

Edmundo puts Fiorentina back on winning track
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ It took just one week for Fiorentina's Edmundo to go
from troublemaker to hero and for AS Roma's Francesco Totti to go
from hero to scapegoat.
	   Fiorentina rebounded from its first loss and increased its
Italian League lead to three standings points by defeating
Salernitana 4-0 Sunday as Edmundo, the Brazilian striker, scored
twice and assisted on one of Argentine star Gabriel Batistuta's two
goals.
	   Edmundo and coach Giovanni Trapattoni made a much-publicized
peace pact this week after the forward had yelled obscenities
toward the sideline when he was substituted in a 2-1 defeat against
Roma, a game decided by Totti's winner late in injury time.
	   Totti missed a penalty kick this Sunday and was one several
culprits _ along with the entire defense _ in a 3-2 loss at AC
Milan that dropped Roma out of second place and put Milan there.
Brazil's Leonardo, Liberia's George Weah and Germany's Christian
Ziege scored for the hosts, while Marco Delvecchio had both of
Roma's goals.
	   Fiorentina, leading Serie A for the first time since 1982, is
5-0-1 for 15 points. Milan is next with 12, while Roma has 10.
	   Elsewhere, Perugia shocked previously undefeated AC Parma 2-1.
Parma's Italy national 'keeper Gianluigi Buffon had not allowed a
goal before Sunday.
	   In other games, Lazio of Rome and Vicenza drew 1-1; Francesco
Palmieri's two goals led Sampdoria of Genoa past Empoli 3-0;
Venezia finally scored its first goal of the season but settled for
a 1-1 draw at Udinese; Bari rallied with two goals in the last 10
minutes to tie Cagliari 3-3, and Swedish striker Kennet Andersson's
double lifted Bologna to its first victory, 3-1 over Piacenza.
	   At night, Ronaldo was set to return to Serie A action for
Internazionale of Milan in its game at two-time defending champion
Juventus of Turin.

	   MALPENSA, Italy (AP) _ Italy's controversial new international
air hub opened in chaos Sunday with delays, demonstrations and an
escalator breakdown that sent grumbling passengers slogging three
up flights of stairs to departure gates.
	   Flights delays of up to four hours were reported at the revamped
airport at Malpensa 2000 outside Milan and the baggage claim system
was in chaos.
	   Adding to passenger frustration was an hour-and-a-half breakdown
on the escalator traveling the three floors between check-in and
departure gates. Waits for the elevator, the only alternative to
climbing, were as much as 20 minutes, the ANSA news agency said.

Romania's president honors communist jailer, angers allies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romanian President Emil Constantinescu
on Sunday awarded a high military honor to the chief of a notorious
Communist prison, angering his political allies.
	   Constantin Ticu Dumitrescu, a lawmaker who was imprisoned and
tortured by the Communists, said: ``It is impossible that such
torturers ... are free. Next Constantinescu will want to lock up
former political prisoners.''
	   Constantinescu decorated thousands of former political prisoners
Sunday as part of Romania's national army day celebrations. Vasile
Cioplan, the chief of the Sighet prison in northern Romania, where
hundreds of prisoners died, was also given a military honor.
	   The president's press office had no comment on the matter.
Constantinescu does not have a spokesperson, which often makes
official comment slow to come from his office.
	   But Defense Minister Victor Babiuc was quoted as saying the
inclusion of Cioplan was ``a mistake.''
	   Romania was under Communist rule from 1948 to 1989. The
persecution of intellectuals and dissidents is still a sensitive
subject, especially as many people in office today were members of
the Communist Party.
	   Poet Ana Blandiana, who also heads the Civic Alliance party,
called Constantinescu's gesture unprofessional, saying that Cioplan
had headed Sighet prison at a time when Romania's political and
cultural elite ``were exterminated.''

Mary Pierce upsets Monica Seles in Kremlin Cup final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional quotes, doubles results. &QL; 
 &UR; By LEONID CHIZHOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Mary Pierce upset Monica Seles at the dlrs 1
million Kremlin Cup on Sunday, winning her third tour title of the
year.
	   Seles, who had beaten Pierce five times in their last six
matches, could not keep up with her opponent's hard hitting serves
and fierce cross-court baseline shots on the Supreme carpet
surface.
	   Pierce beat Seles in two sets 6-6 (7-2), 6-3.
	   Second-seeded Seles came out strong, as she had throughout the
tournament, breaking Pierce in the second game. But the
Frenchwoman, down 0-3, broke back in the fifth on a Seles unforced
error.
	   The two then traded hard-hitting baseline shots that just caught
the corners, going to a tiebreaker, where Pierce's serves were too
much for Seles.
	   The American hit more shots into the net after mostly error-free
play over the rest of the tournament, and Pierce wrapped up the set
after jumping ahead 6-1.
	   ``I came out really good and I just became very sluggish,''
Seles said. ``I don't know really why. I really haven't been making
(unforced errors) during the entire tournament and today it was one
of those off days.''
	   The second set saw more of Pierce's hard hitting, and Seles,
ranked sixth on the WTA tour, tired quickly. Pierce battled back
from 0-40 to hold serve in the first game, recovering a crucial
edge.
	   ``Being broken in the first game of the second set is not really
what you would want to do after having a very tough first set,''
Pierce said. ``That was a very important game for me.''
	   She then broke serve in the sixth and held on for the 6-3 win,
hammering an ace past the 24-year-old Seles and keeping her to no
points in the last game.
	   Pierce, ranked No. 11 on the WTA tour, did not have an easy road
to the final. She upset top-seed Venus Williams in the semifinal,
coming back from a set down, and crawled back from a 2-5 deficit to
win 7-5 against Magui Serna Friday.
	   ``Even in this tournament I played some ugly matches and I was
just lucky to come out and win them,'' Pierce said.
	   Pierce will return to the top eight with the win, for which she
gets 260 points and prize money of dlrs 165,000. It was her third
title of the year, after wins at the Paris Indoors and at Amelia
Island.
	   In the doubles final, Pierce and her partner Natasha Zvereva
defeated top-seeded Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs, 6-3, 6-4.
	   Sunday's play drew the biggest crowd ever for the Ladies'
Kremlin Cup _ more than 14,900 people at Moscow's Olympic Stadium.

Internal Palestinian clash stemming from accord leaves two hurt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES BC-Palestinian-Shooting &QL;

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ In a major rupture within Yasser
Arafat's ranks, members of the Palestinian leader's political
faction fought battled Palestinian security forces with rocks and
bullets Sunday. Two people were hurt, one seriously.
	   The fighting followed a bid by Palestinian military intelligence
to seize unlicensed weapons and inspect files belonging to Arafat's
Fatah faction. A crackdown on illegal arms was among tough new
security measures Arafat agreed to at last week's
Israeli-Palestinian summit.
	   Former Cabinet minister Hanan Ashrawi, who was present when the
clash began in the West Bank town of Ramallah, called it a result
of an accord that put too much emphasis on Israeli security at
Palestinian expense.
	   ``This is very dangerous,'' she said. ``If this situation is
allowed to continue we would be facing an internal breakdown.''
	   The fighting broke out as Marwan Barghouti, the leader of Fatah
in the West Bank, was addressing a group of about 100 supporters
outside the Palestinian Authority headquarters and the offices of
Governor Mustafa Isa.
	   Some of the Fatah activists picked up stones and hurled them
over a fence into the compound and at plainclothes intelligence
agents who were watching the gathering from the sidelines,
witnesses said.
	   Intelligence agents hurled rocks back at the crowd. But then
some of the security agents fired from the second- and third-floor
windows, with some of the gunfire directed into the crowd. About
the same time, armed Fatah members arrived on the scene, firing
shots into the air.
	   Two men were hurt, including a Fatah activist who suffered a
gunshot wound to the head. That silenced the gunfire on both sides,
and leaders from both sides quickly withdrew for a meeting.
	   A senior Fatah official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the confrontation followed a search Saturday night of Fatah
headquarters by about 50 members of Palestinian intelligence.
Fistfights broke out as the searchers went through files and looked
for unlicensed weapons, the official said.
	   Some Fatah activists said the confrontation was exacerbated by a
personal feud between the commander of the raiding party and two
Fatah members.
	   Fatah called a three-day strike in Ramallah to protest the
violence, and graffiti denouncing the intelligence agents as
``traitors'' appeared on walls near where the clash took place.
	   The fighting occurred entirely in Palestinian-controlled areas,
and Israeli troops were not involved.

Chileans in Sweden seek murder charges against Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ A group of Chilean immigrants who lost
family members during Gen. Augusto Pinochet's rule sought Sunday to
have the former dictator charged with murder and kidnapping in
Sweden.
	   Pinochet is in a London hospital, where he was arrested this
month after spinal surgery on a Spanish warrant seeking his
extradition on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture during
his 17-year regime.
	   His lawyers are to go to the British High Court on Monday to
seek to have the arrest invalidated.
	   The Swedish group Association of Relatives of Disappeared
Political Prisoners on Sunday went to a Stockholm police station to
file three relatives' complaints of murder and kidnapping.
	   Group spokesman Jose Miguel Cortez said more complaints could be
in the works, but said the group decided on the unusual move of
filing quickly on Sunday in light of the possibility of a decision
in Britain on Monday.
	   There was no immediate decision on the complaints. Courts were
closed Sunday and Justice Ministry spokesman Bjoern Lindh said it
was not immediately clear if Sweden would consider itself to have
jurisdiction in such cases.
	   ``We hope they take a stand,'' Cortez said. ''
	   One of those filing a complaint was Javier Munoz, who said his
sister, her husband, the husband's father and a brother disappeared
in April 1976 in Santiago, the Chilean capital.
	   The men had joined the Chilean Communist Party, an illegal
activity at the time, and the husband, Luis Emilio Recabarren, was
a prominent labor activist, Munoz said.
	   According to Munoz, the two younger men and the woman were
arrested at a bus-stop along with Recabarren's 1-year-old son. The
boy was later left near the house of his grandfather. When he heard
the boy's cries about 3 a.m., he went out to look for him and was
arrested, Munoz said.
	   ``It's more than just pain,'' Munoz said through an interpreter.
``We want nothing more than justice, but nothing less.''

German police nab Iraqi illegal immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Police said Sunday they were deporting
nine Iraqi refugees to Austria after stopping a van that had
brought them across the border.
	   The illegal immigrants, including two children, were nabbed late
Saturday in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, a ski resort in the Bavarian
Alps, police said.
	   The 27-year-old driver, also an Iraqi, was jailed pending
charges.
	   German authorities have stepped up patrols in recent months to
stem what they say is a rising influx of refugees from Yugoslavia's
strife-torn Kosovo province. Iraqi Kurds have also been heading to
Germany in growing numbers.
	   The weekend before, Bavarian police stopped a truck packed with
75 Kosovo Albanian refugees near the German-Czech border.

Fastest Everest climber girding for fresh challenges

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ The man who reached the highest point on
earth in record time is girding for new mountaineering challenges,
but the search for sponsors seems more daunting than the lofty
mountain peaks.
	   Kaji Sherpa, 34, became the fastest climber of Mt. Everest, the
world's highest mountain, when he reached the summit on Oct. 17 in
a record 20 hours and 24 minutes, breaking the record set by French
alpinist Marc Bertard in 1990.
	   Bertard had covered the distance from the 5,300 meters (17,500
feet) base camp to the 8,848 meters (29,028 feet) high summit in 22
hours and 29 minutes.
	   ``My ambition now is to find new mountaineering challenges and
attempt to break other existing records,'' Kaji told reporters
Sunday on his return to Katmandu from the mountains. He had reached
the summit four previous times.
	   Kaji said he is prepared to climb the mountain ``in less than 18
hours as I had originally planned.''
	   But before planning any expedition, finding sponsors in Nepal
would be an even bigger challenge, he said.
	   Nepal ranks among one of the poorest countries in the world and
does not have the private or public resources to sponsor a major
expedition on Everest.
	   Kaji left base camp at 4 p.m. on Oct. 16 and reached the summit
a day later. The trek usually takes climbers two to four days in
favorable weather conditions, with breaks in camps in between.
	   Kaji reached 8,700 meters (28,700 feet) at 6 a.m., but bad
weather and high winds forced him to slow down. After losing three
hours at that altitude, he resumed his climb.
	   ``This was the most difficult time in my life,'' Kaji said.
	   Sherpas are known for their mountaineering skills. They were
mostly yak herders and traders living high in the Himalayas until
Nepal opened its borders to tourism in 1950. Their stamina and
knowledge of the mountains makes them expert guides and porters for
foreign climbers.
	   Kaji has also scaled four other mountains over 8,000 meters
(26,400 feet) high. He said he would like to climb all of the 14
highest peaks in the world.
	   His previous bid for a record in 1994 was thwarted by bad
weather when he had to return from 8,400 meters (27,720 feet). It
took him just 12 hours to get to that point.

Cargo ship blasts off for Mir; carries supplies and giant space

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A cargo ship blasted off smoothly Sunday with the
last supplies for the Mir space station this year, after more than
two months of delays while the Russian government scraped up the
cash for the launch.
	   Amid the food, water, fuel and bundles of New Year's gifts
aboard the Progress cargo ship was a giant space mirror designed to
illuminate sun-starved northern cities.
	   The ship was launched at 0414 GMT from the Baikonur cosmodrome
in Kazakstan, formerly a Soviet launching pad that Russia now
rents.
	   The launch originally was scheduled for August, but was delayed
several times. The latest postponement came Oct. 15, when Russia's
space agency said it still couldn't afford to buy the booster
rocket, Soyuz-U, from its manufacturer.
	   The Progress, the third and last cargo ship this year to go to
the Mir, is scheduled to dock with the 12-year-old space station on
Tuesday morning.
	   It also will bring several kits of scientific equipment,
including a Russian-French device to be installed on Mir's exterior
by cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev in a Nov. 11
spacewalk.
	   The device is designed to collect data about meteorites when Mir
flies through a meteorite cloud in mid-November.
	   The space mirror, called the Znamya, or Banner, is expected to
be unfurled in February, when Progress is jettisoned from Mir.
	   The mirror, about 100 feet in diameter, is a membrane covered
with a metal layer that, in theory, should reflect sunlight onto
some of the chilly reaches of Russia during the long nights.
	   However, officials say the Znamya would only be visible in good
weather and to those who knew its precise position. They said it
would resemble a shooting star, not a large object such as the
moon.
	   It is expected to serve as an experimental prototype for larger
mirrors that might be sent up in the future.
	   Space officials initially planned to keep Mir in orbit through
the end of 1999, but the last crew is now expected to depart in
June for lack of funds to maintain it.

	   At Florence, Batistuta raised his season total to a league-best
eight goals as all the scoring came after halftime. But Edmundo was
the true protagonist from the outset, drawing a foul from Salvatore
Monaco that resulted in the Salernitana defender's expulsion 10
minutes into the game. Edmundo made it 1-0 in the 50th minute,
heading in German defender Jorg Heinrich's cross. The Brazilian fed
Batistuta in the 69th and scored again himself in the 89th.
Batistuta added a goal in injury time as last-place Salernitana
fell to 0-1-5.
 &UR; Milan 3, Roma 2 &QC; 
	   At Milan, the hosts (4-0-2) played the type of game that made it
Italy's top team from the late 1980s through 1995. They overcame
Delvecchio's goal in the ninth minute, tying the game in first-half
injury time on Leonardo's fourth of the season. Goalkeeper
Sebastiano Rossia, playing because regular starter Jens Lehmann is
hurt, dove to block Totti's weak attempt from the penalty spot in
the 51st.
	   Ziege took advantage when Roma's Brazilian defender Aldair
whiffed on a clear attempt eight minutes later to make it 2-1. And
three minutes after Delvecchio again leveled the score in the 70th,
Weah _ the 1995 FIFA Player of the Year, whose personal decline has
been mirrored by the club's _ headed in his first goal of the
season for the winner.
	   Both clubs ended the game with 10 players. Milan's Croatian
midfielder Zvonomir Boban was expelled in the 82nd for a foul on
Totti, while Roma (3-1-2) _ which hit the crossbar or post three
times _ saw Daniele Conti sent off in injury time.
 &UR; Perugia 2, Parma 1 &QC; 
	   At Perugia, Parma (2-3-1) led after just 45 seconds on Enrico
Chiesa's goal. But Croat midfielder Milan Rapajic ended Buffon's
no-goal streak in the 10th minute and rookie Christian Bucchi
headed in the go-ahead goal in the 28th for Perugia (2-2-2).
 &UR; Lazio 1, Vicenza 1 &QC; 
	   At Rome, veteran striker Roberto Mancini knocked in a rebound in
the 54th minute to salvage the draw as Lazio (2-4-0) suffered a
letdown after last weekend's 5-3 rout of Inter. Vicenza (1-3-2) led
on winger Marco Schenardi's goal in the 30th.
 &UR; Sampdoria 3, Empoli 0 &QC; 
	   At Genoa, Palmieri tallied in the 18th and 72nd minutes, while
Argentine striker Ariel Ortega sent a penalty kick over the
crossbar late in the first half but atoned by scoring off an
individual run in the 70th. Samp is 2-2-2, Empoli 0-3-3.
 &UR; Udinese 1, Venezia 1 &QC; 
	   At Udine, striker Stefan Schwoch hit the target in the 56th
minute for Venezia (0-2-4), which was one of just four clubs in
Serie A history to open a season with five consecutive shutouts.
Brazilian striker Marcio Amoroso scored on a penalty kick in the
36th for Udinese (2-3-1).
 &UR; Cagliari 3, Bari 3 &QC; 
	   At Cagliari, Gianluca Zambrotta and South African striker Phil
Masinga scored late to rally Bari (1-3-2). Cagliari (2-2-2) wasted
Roberto Muzzi's two goals.
 &UR; Bologna 3, Piacenza 1 &QC; 
	   At Bologna, Andersson tallied in the 55th and 78th minutes to
lead the hosts (1-3-2). Piacenza is 2-1-3.

	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Five weeks after armed separatists
declared a cease-fire in their fight for independence, Basques
voted Sunday in regional elections to choose between
pro-independence nationalists and mainstream parties that favor
remaining part of Spain.
	   A heavy turnout was expected among the 1.8 million registered
voters despite chilly, rainy weather in much of this picturesque,
wealthy region of northern Spain.
	   The open-ended cease-fire by the armed ETA commandos focused
attention on whether the truce would propel pro-independence
parties to electoral gains.
	   ``The future of Euskadi is at stake,'' said Carlos Iturgaiz, the
candidate in Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's center-right
Popular Party for Basque regional president. He was using the
Basque word for the region.
	   Voters were renewing the 75-seat legislature, which in turn will
elect the president. It is the sixth such election since Spain
granted the Basque country a broad degree of autonomy 19 years ago.
	   Following the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, Spain
was divided into 17 autonomous regions although the national
government still controls most strategic powers, such as foreign
affairs and defense.
	   Aznar is hoping a heavy turnout will give his party and other
non-nationalist groups more clout in the Basque country to seek a
lasting settlement to one of Western Europe's last regional
conflicts without splitting Spain.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968. It began its
truce Sept. 18 making this the first regional election held without
a threat of violence.
	   In a taped program broadcast Saturday by the British
Broadcasting Corporation, a hooded ETA leader insisted that its
truce offer ``was solid and serious'' but added that it had no
regrets for any of its actions.
	   The more moderate Basque Nationalist Party, which helped
negotiate the cease-fire, is expected to remain the largest party
in the legislature but to fall short of an outright majority. It
would then need allies to form a coalition government.
	   A key question is how much support the cease-fire will attract
for the third-placed, pro-ETA Herri Batasuna party, which is
fielding candidates under a new coalition called Euskal
Herritarrok.
	   Aznar says there can be no peace process until ETA accepts the
results of the elections and renounces violence for good.
	   Although ETA has called cease-fires before, many Spaniards see
this one as the best opportunity in years to end the conflict.
	   In Vitoria, the clean, prosperous town that serves as the seat
of the Basque government, people braved the cold to vote in polling
stations guarded by Basque police in their standard bright red
coats and berets and shiny white truncheons.
	   Many said they could not remember an election which so clearly
pitted the nationalist and non-nationalist camps against each other
so fiercely. They also said that with the ETA ceasefire, regardless
of who wins, Basques will now feel freer to speak their minds.
	   ``People will be able to discuss things more openly. The
election opens a whole new range of possibilities,'''' said Ignacio
Martinez, a 40-year-old teacher who said he voted for Euskal
Herritarrok, which means `We the Basque People.'
	   Others felt a lasting peace was still far off.
	   ``This alone is not going to solve anything. It is important,
but it is just a step,'' said a 24-year-old man who gave his name
only as Alfonso.
	   Some had no qualms about stating their ultimate goal.
	   ``I want independence,'' said a man in his 60s who, like many
people, refused to be identified. ``Like me there are many,'' he
said with a sly smile.

Internal Palestinian clash stemming from accord leaves two hurt

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Fatah official saying police seized weapons from

 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ In a major rupture within Yasser
Arafat's ranks, members of the Palestinian leader's political
faction fought Palestinian security forces with rocks and bullets
Sunday. Two people were hurt, one seriously.
	   The fighting followed a move by Palestinian military
intelligence to seize unlicensed weapons and inspect files
belonging to Arafat's Fatah faction. A crackdown on illegal arms
was among tough new security measures Arafat agreed to at last
week's Israeli-Palestinian summit.
	   Former Cabinet minister Hanan Ashrawi, who was present when the
clash began in the West Bank town of Ramallah, called it a result
of an accord that put too much emphasis on Israeli security at
Palestinian expense.
	   ``This is very dangerous,'' she said. ``If this situation is
allowed to continue we would be facing an internal breakdown.''
	   The fighting broke out as Marwan Barghouti, the Fatah leader in
the West Bank, was addressing a group of about 100 supporters
outside the Palestinian Authority headquarters and the offices of
Governor Mustafa Isa.
	   Some of the Fatah activists picked up stones and hurled them
over a fence into the compound and at plainclothes intelligence
agents who were watching the gathering from the sidelines,
witnesses said.
	   Intelligence agents hurled rocks back at the crowd. But then
some of the security agents fired from the second- and third-floor
windows, with some of the gunfire directed into the crowd. About
the same time, armed Fatah members arrived on the scene, firing
shots into the air.
	   Two men were hurt, including a Fatah activist, 16-year old
Wassim Tarifi, who suffered a gunshot wound to the head. He was in
intensive care in Jerusalem's Hadassah hospital.
	   His injury silenced the gunfire on both sides, and leaders from
both sides quickly withdrew for a meeting.
	   A senior Fatah official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the confrontation followed a search Saturday night of Fatah
headquarters by about 50 members of Palestinian intelligence.
Fistfights broke out as the searchers went through files and looked
for unlicensed weapons, the official said.
	   Barghouti told reporters that police confiscated several weapons
but refused to elaborate.
	   Some Fatah activists said the confrontation was exacerbated by a
personal feud between the commander of the raiding party and two
Fatah members.
	   Fatah called a three-day strike in Ramallah to protest the
violence, and graffiti denouncing the intelligence agents as
``traitors'' appeared on walls near where the clash took place.
	   The fighting occurred entirely in Palestinian-controlled areas,
and Israeli troops were not involved.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with summit over; ADDS new quotes, comments

 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ The European Union's 15 leaders
pledged Sunday to revive stalled EU reform talks and to better
coordinate their economic policies to weather global financial
turmoil.
	   ``The sense of urgency in the economic situation is very great
indeed,'' said British Prime Minister Tony Blair after a two-day EU
summit in this Alpine lakeside resort.
	   The summit marked a leftward swing in EU capitals with the
emergence of Gerhard Schroeder, a Social Democrat as German
chancellor, and Massimo D'Alema, the new, former-communist Italian
premier. Eleven of the 15 EU leaders are now left of center.
	   The impetus to crank the EU reform drive into high gear came
from Schroeder, whose center-left coalition takes office Tuesday,
ending 16 years of Helmut Kohl's conservative rule.
	   Germany assumes the EU presidency in January and Schroeder set a
five-month timetable to amend the Union's founding charter so the
now 15-member union can admit a dozen newcomers.
	   Reforms are painful and touch on cutting farm subsidies,
revamping EU finances and giving the union a stronger defense and
foreign policy profile.
	   In a turnaround widely welcomed, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair declared his support for a greater European defense role to
prevent a recurrence of EU ``dithering and disunity'' over the
violence in the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo.
	   ``As Kosovo has brought home to us, it is right ... that we play
a key and leading role,'' Blair said. ``Europe ... was slow to act.
If we had a more developed common foreign and security policy it
would be easier.''
	   Viktor Klima, the Austrian Chancellor and summit chairman, said
the leaders agreed that more coordination of economic policies ``is
the key to create employment'' and growth to counter financial
mayhem sweeping in from Asia, Russia and Latin America.
	   The summit was held less than 100 days before the launch of the
single European currency that will aim to turn Europe into a zone
of stability and growth under an independent European Central Bank.
	   While leaders stressed they did not want to erode the
independence of the ECB that starts running monetary policy next
year, they urged the member nation's central bankers to help keep
Europe on an even economic keel by considering lowering interest
rates.
	   The leaders asked their finance ministers to look into proposals
for raising money to finance public works projects, such as
transcontinental highway and high-speed rail networks.
	   ``If there are good, sensible infrastructure projects that will
enhance the competitiveness of European economy (they) will need to
be looked at,'' Blair said.
	   Schroeder told the summit it was important to have ``energetic
efforts to coordinate economic policy.''
	   Though he stopped short of endorsing an EU-wide employment
policy, his comments were a departure from the views of Kohl's
outgoing government.
	   Schroeder said the EU members must accelerate fruitless talks on
reforming the union ahead of its enlargement. Cyprus and almost a
dozen East European nations are in line to join the EU.
	   New housekeeping rules must replace ones from the 1950s when
there were only six members.
	   Schroeder urged his partners to settle on draft reforms at a
mid-December summit in Vienna. He said he may call another summit
in February before the reforms can be finalized in March.

 &UR; Corretja fights back to beat Haas in final

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Alex Corretja staged a fine comeback to win
his first indoor championship Sunday, saving a match point before
beating Tommy Haas 2-6, 7-6 (8-6), 6-1 at the dlrs 750,000 Lyon
Grand Prix.
	   After easily grabbing the first set, unseeded Haas was 6-5 ahead
in the second set tiebreak against Spain's Corretja, the No. 4 seed
here and world number seven.
	   But Corretja blasted a backhand past Haas at the net to save the
match, before winning the tiebreak 8-6.
	   The match turned in the Spaniard's favor in the first game of
the final set, when he got a lucky deflection off the net to break
service.
	   Corretja is the first Spaniard to win an indoor championship
since Manuel Orantes' victory at the Houston Masters back in 1976.

headquarters by about 50 members of Palestinian intelligence.
Fistfights broke out as the searchers went through files and looked
for unlicensed weapons, the official said.
	   Barghouti told reporters that police confiscated several weapons
but refused to elaborate.
	   Some Fatah activists said the confrontation was exacerbated by a
personal feud between the commander of the raiding party and two
Fatah members.
	   Fatah called a three-day strike in Ramallah to protest the
violence, and graffiti denouncing the intelligence agents as
``traitors'' appeared on walls near where the clash took place.
	   The fighting occurred entirely in Palestinian-controlled areas,
and Israeli troops were not involved.

Edmundo puts Fiorentina back on winning track
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs. UPDATES with Trapattoni quote. will be updated
after Juventus-Inter late match, scheduled to start at 1930 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ It took just one week for Fiorentina's Edmundo to go
from troublemaker to hero and for AS Roma's Francesco Totti to go
from hero to scapegoat.
	   Fiorentina rebounded from its first loss and increased its
Italian League lead to three standings points by defeating
Salernitana 4-0 Sunday as Edmundo, the Brazilian striker, scored
twice and assisted on one of Argentine star Gabriel Batistuta's two
goals.
	   Edmundo and coach Giovanni Trapattoni made a much-publicized
peace pact this week after the forward had yelled obscenities
toward the sideline when he was substituted in a 2-1 defeat against
Roma, a game decided by Totti's winner late in injury time.
	   Totti missed a penalty kick this Sunday and was one several
culprits _ along with the entire defense _ in a 3-2 loss at AC
Milan that dropped Roma out of second place and put Milan there.
Brazil's Leonardo, Liberia's George Weah and Germany's Christian
Ziege scored for the hosts, while Marco Delvecchio had both of
Roma's goals.
	   Fiorentina, leading Serie A for the first time since 1982, is
5-0-1 for 15 points. Milan is next with 12, while Roma has 10.
	   Elsewhere, Perugia shocked previously undefeated AC Parma 2-1.
Parma's Italy national 'keeper Gianluigi Buffon had not allowed a
goal before Sunday.
	   In other games, Lazio of Rome and Vicenza drew 1-1; Francesco
Palmieri's two goals led Sampdoria of Genoa past Empoli 3-0;
Venezia finally scored its first goal of the season but settled for
a 1-1 draw at Udinese; Bari rallied with two goals in the last 10
minutes to tie Cagliari 3-3, and Swedish striker Kennet Andersson's
double lifted Bologna to its first victory, 3-1 over Piacenza.
	   At night, Ronaldo was set to return to Serie A action for
Internazionale of Milan in its game at two-time defending champion
Juventus of Turin.
	   At Florence, Batistuta raised his season total to a league-best
eight goals as all the scoring came after halftime. But Edmundo was
the true protagonist from the outset, drawing a foul from Salvatore
Monaco that resulted in the Salernitana defender's expulsion 10
minutes into the game.
	   ``We're not thinking about running away with the title,''
Trapattoni said. ``We had some trouble scoring early, but in the
second half we demonstrated our will to win.''
	   Edmundo made it 1-0 in the 50th minute, heading in German
defender Jorg Heinrich's cross. The Brazilian fed Batistuta in the
69th and scored again himself in the 89th. Batistuta added a goal
in injury time as last-place Salernitana fell to 0-1-5.
 &UR; Milan 3, Roma 2 &QC; 
	   At Milan, the hosts (4-0-2) played the type of game that made it
Italy's top team from the late 1980s through 1995. They overcame
Delvecchio's goal in the ninth minute, tying the game in first-half
injury time on Leonardo's fourth of the season. Goalkeeper
Sebastiano Rossia, playing because regular starter Jens Lehmann is
hurt, dove to block Totti's weak attempt from the penalty spot in
the 51st.
	   Ziege took advantage when Roma's Brazilian defender Aldair
whiffed on a clear attempt eight minutes later to make it 2-1. And
three minutes after Delvecchio again leveled the score in the 70th,
Weah _ the 1995 FIFA Player of the Year, whose personal decline has
been mirrored by the club's _ headed in his first goal of the
season for the winner.
	   Both clubs ended the game with 10 players. Milan's Croatian
midfielder Zvonomir Boban was expelled in the 82nd for a foul on
Totti, while Roma (3-1-2) _ which hit the crossbar or post three
times _ saw Daniele Conti sent off in injury time.
 &UR; Perugia 2, Parma 1 &QC; 
	   At Perugia, Parma (2-3-1) led after just 45 seconds on Enrico
Chiesa's goal. But Croat midfielder Milan Rapajic ended Buffon's
no-goal streak in the 10th minute and rookie Christian Bucchi
headed in the go-ahead goal in the 28th for Perugia (2-2-2).
 &UR; Lazio 1, Vicenza 1 &QC; 
	   At Rome, veteran striker Roberto Mancini knocked in a rebound in
the 54th minute to salvage the draw as Lazio (2-4-0) suffered a
letdown after last weekend's 5-3 rout of Inter. Vicenza (1-3-2) led
on winger Marco Schenardi's goal in the 30th.
 &UR; Sampdoria 3, Empoli 0 &QC; 
	   At Genoa, Palmieri tallied in the 18th and 72nd minutes, while
Argentine striker Ariel Ortega sent a penalty kick over the
crossbar late in the first half but atoned by scoring off an
individual run in the 70th. Samp is 2-2-2, Empoli 0-3-3.
 &UR; Udinese 1, Venezia 1 &QC; 
	   At Udine, striker Stefan Schwoch hit the target in the 56th
minute for Venezia (0-2-4), which was one of just four clubs in
Serie A history to open a season with five consecutive shutouts.
Brazilian striker Marcio Amoroso scored on a penalty kick in the
36th for Udinese (2-3-1).
 &UR; Cagliari 3, Bari 3 &QC; 
	   At Cagliari, Gianluca Zambrotta and South African striker Phil
Masinga scored late to rally Bari (1-3-2). Cagliari (2-2-2) wasted
Roberto Muzzi's two goals.
 &UR; Bologna 3, Piacenza 1 &QC; 
	   At Bologna, Andersson tallied in the 55th and 78th minutes to
lead the hosts (1-3-2). Piacenza is 2-1-3.

60-vehicle pileup south of Paris during storm, 17 injured
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 17 injured

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ About 60 vehicles crashed into each other Sunday
afternoon on a rain-slicked stretch of France's main north-south
highway outside the capital as a storm barreled through northern
France, injuring at least 17 people, authorities said.
	   The chain-reaction pileup involved about 30 vehicles in each
direction on the A-6 highway near Wissous, a suburb south of Paris,
according to the National Highway Information Center (CNIR).
	   Seventeen people were hospitalized with injuries from the chain
accident. Two of them were seriously hurt, including an 11-year-old
child, the authorities said. Traffic was restored by mid-afternoon
on the Paris-Lyon highway.
	   Meanwhile, heavy rain and winds gusting up to 126 kph (80 mph)
overnight Saturday caused damage in the Nord-Pas de Calais region
of northwestern France.
	   Fire-rescuers were called more than 180 times due to storm
damage including toppled trees, flooded basements and broken
antennas. No injuries were reported.
	   The storm caused several deaths in Britain in the past two days,
authorities have said.

AEK draws 1-1 against Proodeftiki, but retains lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ After a two-week interruption due to
municipal elections, the Greek soccer championship resumed Sunday
with league leader AEK Athens playing to a 1-1 draw against
Proodeftiki Korydalos away.
	   But despite the level score, AEK retained its lead in the first
division league.
	   The Athens club has 17 points from seven games. Olympiakos
Piraeus, which beat Ethnikos Asteras 3-1 away, follows in second
place with 16 points also from seven games.
	   But AEK's lead is threatened by crosstown Panathinaikos which
has 15 points and one game in hand. Panathinaikos plays Monday
against Kavala at the Athens Olympic stadium.
	   AEK took an early lead with a goal by its star striker Demis
Nikolaidis off a corner kick taken by Tony Sawevski in the 2nd
minute.
	   Two minutes later, the visitors came close to a second goal when
Sawevski's shot hit goalie Vangelis Karassavas' crossbar.
	   A similar opportunity was lost by Ethnikos Asteras when
Ukrainian star Oleg Protassov's shot struck AEK's crossbar in the
22nd.
	   The hosts levelled with an own goal by Vassilis Zikos in the
24th.
	   Proodeftiki was reduced to 10 man in the 58th when Vangelis
Dangas was expelled with two yellow cards. But despite the one-man
advantage, AEK's players could not score.
	   Christos Maladenis netted in the 70th, but the goal was
disallowed because of an offside call.
	   Proodeftiki played with nine players in the last eight minutes
when Michalis Politis saw the second yellow card in the 82nd.
Sawevski suffered a similar fate and was sent off in the 86th.
	   Stelios Yiannacopoulos scored two goals and gained a penalty as
Olympiakos beat Ethnikos Asteras 3-1.
	   Playing at Kessariani stadium, newcomer Ethnikos Asteras' home
ground, Olympiakos went on the attack from the opening minutes. But
it was Ethnikos Asteras which took the lead with a header by
Vassilis Xanthis off a center from Gradimir Yovanovic in the 11th.
	   Yiannacopoulos levelled in the 26th and Grigoris Georgatos made
it 2-1 with a penalty kick in the 38th. The penalty was awarded
when Filippos Frontzos downed Yiannacopoulos in the area.
	   Yiannacopoulos closed the scoring with a header off a corner
kick by Andreas Niniadis in the 58th.

Top cleric calls for legal abortions for unmarried rape victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A top Muslim cleric has issued a ruling
calling on the government to permit abortions for unmarried rape
victims.
	   The ruling by Sheik Nasr Farid Wasel, Egypt's grand mufti, is
the first of its kind in Egypt, where abortion is illegal unless
the pregnancy is life threatening.
	   Adel Ahmed, the deputy health minister, said the government has
no immediate plans to change its ban on abortion.
	   Wasel did not address whether abortions should be performed on
married rape victims. It is difficult for women who are not virgins
to find husbands in Egypt's conservative Islamic society.
	   Wasel, one of Egypt's top two clerics, also ruled that
government clinics should be allowed to perform operations on rape
victims to reconstruct their hymens and ``restore'' their
virginity.
	   The ruling, which was issued last week, has no legal weight, but
Wasel is deeply respected by conservative Muslims.
	   ``The girl who is raped and looses her virginity sustains great
moral and psychological damage,'' Wasel told the government-owned
Rose el-Youssef weekly, which hit newsstands on Sunday.
	   ``The government, which failed to provide her with protection,
should do everything possible to help her restore not only her
honor but her virtue,'' Wasel said.
	   Restoring the hymens of raped women would improve their chances
for marriage, he said.
	   Aminna al-Naqqash, a women's activist and member of the
opposition Progressive Unionist Party, welcomed the ruling on
abortion.
	   ``This is a very positive step forward which may help to solve
one serious problem and will give Muslim authorities more respect
and leverage,'' al-Naqqash said.
	   She said the move was made necessary by the increasing numbers
of reported rapes.
	   She, however, dismissed the ruling on ``restoring'' virginity.
	   ``This forgery can work if the purpose is to restore something
lost in the women's body but how can she restore her soul?'' she
asked.
	   Egyptian law prevents doctors from performing abortions unless
three doctors testify that the operation is necessary to save the
woman's life.
	   Some Egyptian women rely on private doctors or midwives to
perform abortions.
	   Ahmed, the deputy health minister, disagreed with Wasel's
rulings.
	   ``If we do this, we will encourage rape rather than solve the
problem,'' he said.
	   In Egypt, rape is punishable by death.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Sledgehammer South Africa made short
work of a good-looking England total to win its Wills Cup
quarterfinal match by six wickets in Dhaka Sunday.
	   Chasing England's total of 281 runs, the new-look South African
side won with 3.2 overs to spare, flogging some amateurish bowling
by English bowlers.
	   The foundation of the South African victory was laid by opener
Daryll Cullinan, who won the Man of the Match award for his
electrifying 69 runs off 70 balls. Cullinan's half century came off
just 40 balls and contained 12 boundaries.
	   The middle order carried forward the attack, with South African
captain Hanse Cronje scoring 67 off 57 balls to put his team within
sniffing distance of victory. Jonty Rhodes then did the honors for
his team, scoring five fours as he raced to 61 in 63 balls.
	   Earlier, after winning the toss and choosing to bat, England
scored 281 for seven wickets in 50 overs at the Bangabandhu Stadium
_ its highest ever total against the South Africans in a one-day
match.
	   South Africa took the English batsmen by surprise when it
introduced Paul Symcox with the new ball, but the batsmen scored
freely from the very start.
	   England's total was built around three important innings.
Skipper Adam Holliaoke stole the show with an unbeaten 83 off 91
balls but Neil Fairbrother held firm in the middle order with his
anchor innings of 56 runs. Earlier, Mark Ealham led the initial
charge with a run-a-ball 44.
	   England's wicketkeeper Jack Russell also played a flamboyant
knock, matching his captain for a while knock-for-knock before
getting out for 19 runs in 17 balls.
	   J. Kallis finished with three wickets for 48 runs for the South
Africans left arm spinner Micky Boje bowled a tight line to finish
at one for 39 in his 10 overs.

Gunfire over grave at funeral missed by international observers

	   KRAJKOVA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Mourners ran away or dived for cover
Sunday when hostile gunfire whistled overhead at the funeral of an
11-year-old Albanian boy believed slain by Serb police bullets.
	   Journalists filmed and photographed the chaos, but the people
sent to Kosovo to witness such violence _ international observers _
had left before the funeral began.
	   The boy's death and the unwillingness of foreign diplomats to
attend his burial showed the difficulties facing the international
community in forcing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
comply with the Oct. 12 agreement that averted NATO airstrikes on
his forces.
	   Despite the agreement's demands for a cessation of hostilities
and the withdrawal of extra police and military forces sent into
Kosovo in an offensive on separatist Albanians that started in
February, sporadic violence continues with signs of increasing Serb
intimidation intended to prevent Albanian refugees from returning
to some villages.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the threat of NATO
airstrikes would remain in place until Milosevic reduces forces to
pre-conflict level.
	   ``He has made progress but he needs to try an awful lot
harder,'' Cook said in an interview with the British Broadcasting
Corp. about the Oct. 27 deadline for Milosevic to comply with the
agreement. ``I think that when on Tuesday we review this, we may
well come to the conclusion we cannot yet relax our guard, we
cannot stand down the planes, we need further progress before we
relax that order.''
	   On the ground, however, daily violence shows little sign of
abating.
	   The boy, Shemsi Elshani, was shot to death Saturday by Serb
police while helping his father and cousin chop wood from the
hillside behind this mountain village 30 kilometers (18 miles) west
of Pristina, according to the father, Rashit Elshani.
	   He said his son died simply because ``he's Albanian.'' Police
have been shooting in the area every night, he said, trying to
scare off villagers.
	   ``Even if you're unarmed, they're going to shoot you,'' Elshani
said while his only surviving son, 7-year-old Dardan, hugged his
leg. ``We'd been there for two hours cutting trees and carrying
them. We saw them (the police) without binoculars and they had
binoculars.''
	   His wife, Hasime, also 37, fainted repeatedly beside Shemsi's
bloodied body, still clad in the blue jeans, blue shirt and jacket
he wore when he died.
	   ``They will come to shoot us and they will take my Dardan and
slit his throat,'' she sobbed.
	   A team of European diplomats and an American team of the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission came to the house, but all left before
the burial.
	   Gunfire from a hill about one kilometer (1,000 yards) away, the
same area from where the fatal shots came, sounded several times as
the diplomats decided what to do.
	   The Europeans drove away, while the American observer team
questioned Rashit and called to its headquarters before leaving.
	   Villagers asked team leader Norman Olsen to attend the funeral
because they believed his presence would stop further shooting. His
answer revealed the weakness of a plan for 2,000 unarmed observers
to come to Kosovo to verify whether Milosevic's forces comply with
the political agreement.
	   ``Even though we have armored vehicles, if somebody is
determined to shoot more people, they won't stop for us,'' Olsen
said before leaving. ``Our presence at the gravesite will not
protect you. If any diplomat tells you otherwise, he's wrong.''
	   Scores of people walked up the hillside for the burial in a
fresh grave next to six others _ including an uncle of Shemsi _
killed Sept. 25 during a Serb offensive in the area.
	   A bouquet of fresh flowers was placed on the mound, and after a
brief prayer, the mourners started to disperse.
	   More gunfire erupted from the far hill, each round coming
closer. Some people ran down the hill while others hit the dirt,
hearing the whistle of a bullet overhead.

Breaking precedent, Charles and Camilla deny Diana book
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Breaking precedent, Prince Charles and his
longtime love, Camilla Parker Bowles, jointly denied Sunday that
they cooperated in a new royal book which contains damaging
allegations about Princess Diana.
	   The statement, issued by Charles's St. James's Palace office,
was the clearest public sign yet of collaboration between the
prince and Mrs. Parker Bowles, who has no official status and never
appears with him at public functions.
	   The book said Diana telephoned death threats to Mrs. Parker
Bowles, that she was the first to be unfaithful in the royal
marriage, and that Charles felt principally relief when the
36-year-old princess was killed in a Paris car crash 14 months ago.
	   The image of Charles _ more relaxed, chattier and no longer
overshadowed by Diana, his hugely popular ex-wife _ has improved
since her death.
	   He appears also to be seeking public acceptability for Mrs.
Parker Bowles, and suspicions that they were trying to tarnish
Diana's reputation would be damaging.
	   The Mail on Sunday, which paid a reported 500,000 pounds (dlrs
850,000) for the serialization rights of ``Charles: Victim or
Villain?'', claimed that author Penny Junor interviewed more than
30 of Charles's friends, relatives and advisers.
	   The book, to coincide with Charles's 50th birthday Nov. 14, was
Ms. Junor's second biography of the heir to the British throne.
	   ``Penny Junor's book was not authorized, solicited or approved
by the Prince of Wales or Mrs. Parker Bowles,'' said the statement,
issued to the British domestic news agency Press Association.
	   Saying Charles felt personal details of his marriage should be
left undisturbed, the statement added, ``That is why both he, and
Mrs. Parker Bowles, refused to become involved in any way in the
writing of Penny Junor's book.''
	   Charles appealed for the sake of Diana's memory and of their
sons, Prince William, 16, and Prince Harry, 14, ``that what is in
the past should remain there,'' the statement added.
	   However, stories are building up. Mrs. Parker Bowles is planning
a big party, to which other European royals have reportedly been
invited, for Charles at his Highgrove country estate, where he
hosted her 50th birthday celebrations last year.
	   Queen Elizabeth II will host a separate party.
	   The book said that Mrs. Parker Bowles received late night phone
calls at her farm house and a voice she recognized as Diana's,
said, ``I've sent someone to kill you. They're outside in the
garden. Look out of the window; can you see them?''
	   Diana began an affair in 1985 with her police bodyguard, Sgt.
Barry Mannakee, before Charles resumed relations with Mrs. Parker
Bowles, the book said.
	   Mannakee was transferred in 1986 and killed in a motorcycle
accident in 1987.
	   Junor depicts Charles as always wanting to make the 1981
marriage work and ``feeling guilty about cheating on Diana with
Camilla.''
	   ``It was only years later that he found out that the princess
had been having an affair for months before he and Camilla had even
made contact,'' wrote Ms. Junor.
	   Diana's version of events, first aired in a 1992 book by Andrew
Morton, was that Charles's refusal to end his affair with Mrs.
Parker Bowles wrecked the marriage. She acknowledged an affair with
her sons' former riding instructor, James Hewitt, starting 1986.
	   On Charles' reaction to Diana's death, Ms. Junor wrote: ``Relief
that the pain and suffering was now over, that his children would
no longer be torn in opposite directions, confused and upset by
their mother's bizarre behavior, and the he would no longer be
spied upon.''

German Social Democrats clear way for taking power

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The Social Democrats approved an alliance
with the environmentalist Greens party on Sunday, clearing the way
for Germany's first center-left government in 16 years to take
office.
	   A special party convention voted to back the coalition pact the
two partners sealed last week, which declares the fight against
10-percent unemployment their No. 1 goal.
	   The Social Democrats ended Chancellor Helmut Kohl's long tenure
in the Sept. 27 election, but they need a junior partner to secure
a majority in parliament. A Greens meeting backed the partnership
Saturday.
	   Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, due to be sworn in Tuesday
for a four-year term, will be the last chancellor to run the nation
from Bonn before the government's historic return to Berlin, the
prewar capital, next year.
	   ``We will make a new beginning for Germany, first in Bonn, then
in Berlin,'' he declared in a convention speech.
	   Responding to his appeal for party unity, the 525 delegates gave
the future chancellor strong support. Only one delegate voted
against the alliance and three abstained.
	   Reached after unexpectedly smooth negotiations, the coalition's
program hews closer to Social Democratic goals. But key pledges
bear a Green imprint: closing nuclear power plants, raising energy
taxes and allowing more foreigners to become German citizens.
	   New hints emerged over the weekend about where Schroeder intends
to take the economy of Europe's pivotal nation.
	   He refused to rule out raising government debt to meet promises
of higher spending for social programs.
	   Designated finance minister Oskar Lafontaine, an old-style
leftist who favors a strong government role in the economy, will
have ``a free hand in taking the necessary steps,'' Schroeder told
Der Spiegel magazine.
	   At the same time, Schroeder said he was open to changing the
coalition's tax plans, which German industry and many economists
have blasted as too focused on relief for people with low and
medium incomes.
	   Even a senior Social Democrat speaker at the convention,
Wolfgang Clement, urged bolder tax cuts for business.
	   But with the party basking in its victory, Schroeder and tax
expert Lafontaine _ who is also party chairman _ played down talk
that they are competing for power.
	   Schroeder, whose pro-market reputation and populist stance
helped his party win over conservative voters, stressed his plan to
seek a job creation pact between German industry and labor.
	   Schroeder came to Bonn fresh from a weekend meeting of European
Union leaders in Austria, where he was a special guest.
	   On Saturday, the 18-year-old Greens party capped its
transformation from a loose band of peace protesters, anti-nuclear
activists and feminists by voting overwhelmingly to join Germany's
government for the first time.
	   The most prominent Greens pragmatist, Joschka Fischer, is in
line to be foreign minister, one of three Greens ministers in
Schroeder's designated 14-member Cabinet.
	   The new government will have a comfortable 21-seat majority in
the new parliament, which opens its session Monday to elect its
president.

	   PARIS (AP) _ At least 90 vehicles crashed in chain-reaction
accidents on highways outside Paris as a storm buffeted northern
France on Sunday, injuring at least 17 people, authorities and news
reports said.
	   On both directions of the main north-south route, about 30
vehicles crashed into each other near Wissous, a suburb south of
Paris during high winds, rain and sleet, according to the National
Highway Information Center (CNIR).
	   Seventeen people were hospitalized with injuries from the chain
accident on the A-6. Two of them were seriously hurt, including an
11-year-old child, the authorities said. Traffic was restored by
mid-afternoon on the Paris-Lyon highway.
	   Thirty other vehicles collided in two chain accidents on the
main A-1 highway north of Paris on Sunday afternoon, blocking the
roadway in both directions, France Info radio reported. There was
no immediate word on injuries.
	   Meanwhile, the storm snapped a large tree in the Parc Monceau on
Sunday afternoon, forcing closure of the park in a tony
neighborhood of northwestern Paris, near the Arc de Triomphe.
	   Heavy rain and winds gusting up to 126 kph (80 mph) overnight
Saturday caused damage in the Nord-Pas de Calais region of
northwestern France.
	   Fire-rescuers were called more than 180 times due to storm
damage including toppled trees, flooded basements and broken
antennas. No injuries were reported.
	   The storm caused several deaths in Britain in the past two days,
authorities have said.

Norwegian league roundup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRONDHEIM, Norway (AP) _ Rosenborg clinched the Norwegian soccer
league again for the seventh time in seven years on Oct. 18, and
they had nothing to play for in a 1-1 draw against Tromso in the
last game of the season Sunday.
	   As a Christmas gift in advance, the 15,745 fans did not have to
pay the entrance ticket. Instead they were encouraged to give their
money to the Salvation Army.
	   Now, Rosenborg's goal is to win the Norwegian FA Cup Final on
Nov. 1 against Stabaek and beat Galatasaray in the Champions League
in an away game on Nov. 4.
	   ``I don't bother to think about the Galatasaray game now; it's
too far away. Right now, the Cup Final is what matters,'' Rosenborg
coach Trond Sollied told The Associated Press.
	   Stabaek, however, could be tough to break. They trounced the
bottom team Sogndal 9-0 and placed third in the standings, and
Galatasaray beat Samsun in the Turkish league 3-1 Saturday.
	   Sogndal was the worst team in the league and it has been clear
for a while that they will be relegated. Haugesund will follow them
down the drain after a 1-1 tie against Kongsvinger.
	   Kongsvinger faces a two-game playoff against first-division team
Kjelsas Wednesday and Saturday.

U.S. Senate to hold hearings on CIA's Mideast role
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A senate committee will hold hearings on the
CIA's security-monitoring role in an interim Middle East peace
accord, which a key senator considers troubling.
	   Under the U.S.-brokered agreement concluded Friday between
Israel and the Palestinians, the CIA would keep track of
Palestinian efforts to arrest and punish terrorists as a way of
assuaging Israeli security concerns.
	   Sen. Richard Shelby, who heads the Select Committee on
Intelligence, said Sunday he is concerned about an agreement to
have the CIA monitor Palestinian efforts against terrorism.
	   ``What is the role of the CIA? Is it to enforce a policy? Is it
to be an arbitrator? Is it to be bodyguards? I think not,'' Shelby
said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' ``I think we have to look at this, and
I believe we will hold hearings on it in the Senate Intelligence
Committee.''
	   But Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said work of this kind
is nothing new for the agency.
	   ``The CIA has played roles previously in terms of monitoring and
verifying other agreements previously in the region,'' Albright
said on CBS's ``Face the Nation,'' adding that the CIA has been
fighting terrorism in the region since 1996.
	   Albright said the agency would work in a ``role which assists,
to try to deal with these issues without being personally involved.
... We're there, as we are in the peace talks, always as the honest
broker as assisting in this.''
	   The CIA has long participated in diplomacy, but Shelby said the
new proposal is ``troubling to me'' because it expands their work
from intelligence gathering to enforcing policy.
	   The Senate committee could not directly change the
Israeli-Palestinian agreement, though it has authority over U.S.
intelligence spending.
	   ``We want to know how it's going to work, how long the CIA will
be involved, how much it's going to cost, and what are the dangers
to American life,'' Shelby said.
	   Tenet, in this week's edition of Time magazine, said the CIA
``can have an enormous impact on the future, but the fact is that
we have to become a more agile institution.''
	   Tenet already has traveled to Israel and the Palestinian
territories four times, and the agency maintains offices in the
West Bank cities of Hebron, Ramallah and Nablus, as well as one in
the Gaza Strip.

AEK draws 1-1 against Proodeftiki, but retains lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ After a two-week interruption due to
municipal elections, the Greek soccer championship resumed Sunday
with league leader AEK Athens playing to a 1-1 draw against
Proodeftiki Korydalos away.
	   But despite the level score, AEK retained its lead in the first
division league.
	   The Athens club has 17 points from seven games. Olympiakos
Piraeus, which beat Ethnikos Asteras 3-1 away, follows in second
place with 16 points also from seven games.
	   But AEK's lead is threatened by crosstown Panathinaikos which
has 15 points and one game in hand. Panathinaikos plays Monday
against Kavala at the Athens Olympic stadium.
	   AEK took an early lead with a goal by its star striker Demis
Nikolaidis off a corner kick taken by Tony Sawevski in the 2nd
minute.
	   Two minutes later, the visitors came close to a second goal when
Sawevski's shot hit goalie Vangelis Karassavas' crossbar.
	   A similar opportunity was lost by Ethnikos Asteras when
Ukrainian star Oleg Protassov's shot struck AEK's crossbar in the
22nd.
	   The hosts leveled with an own goal by Vassilis Zikos in the
24th.
	   Proodeftiki was reduced to 10 men in the 58th when Vangelis
Dangas was expelled with two yellow cards. But despite the one-man
advantage, AEK's players could not score.
	   Christos Maladenis netted in the 70th, but the goal was
disqualified because of an offside call.
	   Proodeftiki played with nine players in the last eight minutes
when Michalis Politis saw the second yellow card in the 82nd.
Sawevski suffered a similar fate and was sent off in the 86th.
	   Stelios Yiannacopoulos scored two goals and gained a penalty as
Olympiakos beat Ethnikos Asteras 3-1.
	   Playing at Kessariani stadium, newcomer Ethnikos Asteras' home
ground, Olympiakos went on the attack from the opening minutes. But
it was Ethnikos Asteras which took the lead with a header by
Vassilis Xanthis off a center from Gradimir Yovanovic in the 11th.
	   Yiannacopoulos levelled in the 26th and Grigoris Georgatos made
it 2-1 with a penalty kick in the 38th. The penalty was awarded
when Filippos Frontzos downed Yiannacopoulos in the area.
	   Yiannacopoulos closed the scoring with a header off a corner
kick by Andreas Niniadis in the 58th.

Havel won't explain anything to anybody, spokesman says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel came
under strong criticism Sunday for his decision not to award former
Vienna mayor Helmut Zilk a previously announced state order.
	   But Havel said he had no intention to explain why he had changed
his mind, not even to Zilk himself.
	   Zilk was nominated for the order of White Lion, the Czech
Republic's highest state order, and was to receive it next
Wednesday in a ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the
founding of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1918.
	   Havel withdrew the honor after a source claimed that Zilk spied
for the Czech communist secret service and provided information
that led to several convictions.
	   ``I consider the accusations absolute nonsense,'' Zilk told
state-run Czech TV late Saturday. ``I had nothing to do with the
secret police in Czechoslovakia.''
	   In a newspaper interview on Sunday, Zilk said he'd write Havel a
letter, asking for ``all materials and evidence.'' He wants to go
into the offensive because ``I must defend myself with everything I
have'' against what he said were unwarranted allegations.
	   But Havel's spokesman Ladislav Spacek said Sunday the president
was not planning to explain his decision, not even to Zilk.
	   ``There's no legal claim to a state order, so it is not possible
to understand it (the president's decision) as damage (done to
Zilk),'' the news agency CTK quoted Spacek as saying.
	   Spacek, however, admitted that Havel had sent a letter to Zilk,
notifying him about the nomination. A letter withdrawing the
nomination was later sent to Zilk by the president's office, Spacek
said.
	   Eighty-one state orders and medals will be awarded by Havel on
Wednesday, 24 of them posthumously.
	   Havel's move drew strong criticism among Czech politicians.
	   Czech radio said that parliamentary speaker and former premier
Vaclav Klaus called Havel's behavior scandalous.
	   ``If I want to award somebody a state order and then put him in
such an unpleasant, embarrassing situation, that's something that
mustn't happen,'' Klaus told the radio.
	   ``I'm afraid that by this, the Czech-Austrian relations will be
quite damaged for some time,'' he said.
	   ``It's very unusual and ... the president should have known that
before,'' minister Jaroslav Basta told CTK.
	   In an interview with the Sunday edition of the Kurier daily,
Zilk said he was deeply hurt by Havel's decision, noting that ``in
the post-Communist era I became honorary citizen in Prague and
(Slovak capital) Bratislava.''
	   He also said that Prague and Bratislava mayors have come to his
rescue.

Election of governors could influence Brazil's austerity plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout with details and quotes; CHANGES byline. Polls
close at 1900 GMT. First official results expected after 2100 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ As Brazil readies an austerity
plan to escape its financial crisis, voters on Sunday elected 13
governors who will have a big say in its success or failure.
	   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso needs allies in major states
to rein in spending and pressure Congress to pass his reforms,
which he is expected to unveil this week.
	   Whoever wins will certainly have less to spend in the next four
years. The impending hard times turned the elections in 12 states
and the Federal District into a referendum on the austerity
measures.
	   ``Without them, Brazil will collapse,'' said Adriano Ramos, a
financial analyst in Sao Paulo. He voted for incumbent Gov. Mario
Covas, a Cardoso ally, because Covas ``is better prepared to
administrate a policy of scarce resources.''
	   Polls opened with little of the hoopla and last-minute
campaigning that marked the first-round election on Oct. 4.
	   Army troops were deployed in four northern states to ensure
peace. In the poor northeastern state of Piaui, the government
ordered the seizure of newspapers and magazines that carried
stories critical of incumbent Gov. Mao Santa.
	   Although voting is mandatory, observers said the turnout seemed
low. Cardoso, who was re-elected on the first ballot, has given
Brazilians little choice.
	   He already told the country the belt-tightening measures will
contain spending cuts and probably new taxes. They must be tough
enough to convince the International Monetary Fund to approve a
rescue package worth an estimated dlrs 30 billion.
	   Brazil is a victim of the global financial crisis that began
last year in Asia and shifted to Russia before moving here. In the
past two months, investors have withdrawn some dlrs 25 billion from
the country.
	   Cardoso's economic team and the IMF have spent the past weeks
working out ways to slash Brazil's deficit of around dlrs 65
billion, or 7 percent of the gross domestic product.
	   Many of Cardoso's proposals depend on approval by Congress, and
governors have tremendous influence over how legislators vote.
	   The most important race is in Sao Paulo, Brazil's richest and
most populous state. In recent days, Covas has stormed from behind
to pass Paulo Maluf, a two-time former governor with a history of
big spending and dubious finances.
	   But opposition candidates were strong in other key states.
	   In Rio de Janeiro, polls showed left-center candidate Anthony
Garotinho held a comfortable lead over former Rio Mayor Cesar Maia,
a Cardoso supporter. In Minas Gerais state, former President Itamar
Franco _ who broke with Cardoso during the campaign _ was shown far
ahead of incumbent Eduardo Azeredo.
	   The issue, as always, was the economy.
	   Osvaldo Severino Correia, a Rio telecommunications technician,
showed his paycheck of dlrs 116 (140 reals) a month. After taxes,
he has just dlrs 95 (113 reals).
	   ``Now they want to take out more taxes,'' he said. ``I wouldn't
vote for the government candidates for anything in the world.''

Maier wins opening giant slalom
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS quotes, CHANGES throughout &QL; 
 &UR; BY ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ Hermann Maier showed signs of prolonging
last year's reign over the men's World Cup circuit, leading an
Austrian sweep of the podium in Sunday's season opening giant
slalom.
	   The double Olympic champion left his rivals in his dust, posting
the fastest time in both runs, leaving his closest contender almost
two seconds behind.
	   Maier, reknowned for his ability to overcome tough course
conditions, took advantage of the poor visibility, clocking an
aggregate time of 2 minutes, 10.74 seconds, an incredible 1.60
seconds ahead of Eberharter.
	   ``I surprised myself today,'' said Maier, who won the overall
World Cup crown and World Cup titles in super-G and giant slalom as
a rookie last season. ``I wasn't really expecting to win and
espcially with such an advantage. My summer was so busy and you
never know how the other racers are skiing when they're out of
sight.''
	   Teammate Stefan Eberharter, the Olympic silver medallist, was
runnerup in 2:12.34, while Heinz Schilchegger was third in 2:13.08,
earning his first career podium.
	   ``This time I was able to have two solid runs,'' said
Schilchegger, whose previous best result was a fourth place in
Adelboden two years ago. ``I'm very happy as the fight within the
team for a place in the giant slalom is so fierce.''
	   The three had clocked the fastest times in the first leg to set
up an Austrian sweep with compatriot Josef Strobl sitting in fourth
as an insurance marker.
	   But it was countryman Christian Mayer who finished the day
fourth with a total time of 2:13.13, with Strobl dropping to 19th
after a disasterous second run.
	   The nation's stellar performance was only an extension of its
domination over the World Cup field last year.
	   Last season, Austria's men became the first to win all of the
World Cup titles with Andreas Schifferer winning downhill and
Thomas Sykora slalom.
	   The team's _ but especially Maier's _ supremacy is what sparked
ugly rumors concerning the Austrian squad the past few months.
	   Earlier in the week the Swiss daily ``Sport'' quoted Swiss ski
boss Theo Nadig questionning Maier's rapid physical development.
Nadig later softened his statement, saying he was just curious so
he could provide the same methods to his team.
	   ``It was a bit unfair for people to try and make us nervous just
before the race,'' said Maier, who won 11 World Cup races last
year. ``But the rumors in the Swiss papers had little effect on us,
I managed to stay focused.''
	   ``We were a bit more disturbed and upset when the same type of
rumors showed up in a Italian newspaper this summer.''
	   Two-time World Cup champion Michael Von Gruenigen, sixth after
the first run, moved up a spot after the second, with a time of
2:13.28.
	   The Olympic bronze medallist, who injured his ankle playing
basketball this summer, had resumed training just two weeks ago
after a six week recovery period.
	   Germany's Markus Eberle, who barely eeked into the top 30 in the
first leg to qualify, had the second fastest time in the final run,
holding the lead until Austrian Hans Knauss posted an identical
two-run chrono of 2:13.35. In the end Eberle moved up to a
spectacular sixth place.
	   Strong winds and heavy snow had forced race officials to delay
the start of the race by more than two hours, while workers cleared
the course and re-erected the start hut, which had been blown down
overnight.

Two boatloads of Albanian refugees collide, 16 missing, 3 dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A dinghy carrying 25 Albanian refugees headed for
Italy collided with another small boat, exploded and sank during
the night. Officials said Sunday 16 people were missing, three
confirmed dead and six injured.
	   In Tirana, an Albanian Interior Ministry spokesman said the
bodies of two women and a baby girl had been recovered. The
spokesman, Artan Bizhga, said six people were in hospital and 16
were missing.
	   The Italian news agency ANSA quoted Italian officials as saying
some of the survivors were rescued by passing boats, while others
apparently managed to swim to shore.
	   One survivor told ANSA in Vlora that the dinghy collided with a
small wooden boat returning nearly empty from a people-smuggling
run to Italy.
	   ``We heard a huge blow and then an explosion. Immediately after
that we found ourselves in the water,'' 27-year-old Aida Mustafaraj
told ANSA.
	   Mustafaraj said she stayed afloat on a piece of debris until a
passing boat picked her up, along with her child.
	   The accident happened off Sazen Island near the Albanian port
city of Vlora at around 2030 gmt Saturday, Bizgha said. The first
reports emerged on Sunday.
	   There is constant traffic across the Adriatic from Albania to
Italy, a favorite destination for Albanians fleeing their troubled
Balkan homeland. On some weekends, Italian authorities intercept
hundreds of would-be immigrants.

Arafat wants accurate, faithful implementation of peace deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Arab League comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Sunday
he hoped the new Israeli-Palestinian peace accord would be
``accurately and faithfully'' implemented to truly push forward the
Middle East peace process.
	   Arafat's comment, made at Cairo airport after briefing President
Hosni Mubarak on the accord, reflects Arab skepticism that Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will live up to the agreement to
withdraw from a further 13 percent of West Bank land.
	   The Palestinian leader met with Mubarak at the Unity
presidential palace in Cairo. The two talked briefly alone, then
were joined by aides. The session last one hour and 15 minutes.
	   Neither Arafat nor Mubarak spoke to reporters after the meeting,
but Arafat later told reporters just before he departed for Algeria
that the implementation of the deal was what counted.
	   He expressed hope that the agreement would be ``accurately and
faithfully implemented so that we can say that we have pushed
forward the peace process and protected the peace of the courageous
people.''
	   From Algeria, he will travel to Morocco and Saudi Arabia.
	   The agreement, signed Friday after marathon U.S.-mediated
negotiations, call for Arafat to clamp stringent security measures
on Palestinian militants to prevent attacks on Israelis in exchange
for the Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   Many in the Arab world have criticized the pact as geared too
much toward Israel's security demands and too little toward
Palestinian interests.
	   Mubarak, who in the past has mediated between Israel and the
Palestinians, has cautiously welcomed the agreement but also
questioned whether Netanyahu would implement all its parts.
	   In remarks Saturday, he accused Netanyahu of failing to live up
to past peace deals. Of the six points in the 1997 Hebron accord,
he said, ``only two points were implemented while the other four
were ignored.''
	   Also Sunday, the Cairo-based Arab League welcomed the agreement
as ``an important step,'' in the peace process. It called for using
the ``impetus of this agreement'' to conclude a final peace treaty
that would allow for the establishment of a Palestinian state.

Talks in France on disputed Karabakh postponed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The next round of talks in France on the disputed
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh has been postponed over procedural
disagreements, Armenia's parliament speaker said Sunday.
	   The discussions among legislators and foreign ministry officials
from Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh were scheduled for
Nov. 3 but have been put off until the end of the year, the
Interfax news agency quoted Khosrov Arutyunian as saying.
	   Arutyunian said he heard of the delay in a letter Sunday from
the Council of Europe, the Strasbourg, France-based body mediating
the talks.
	   The talks were postponed because Azerbaijan objected to the way
they were organized, Interfax said. It gave no other details.
	   Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous enclave within Azerbaijan that
is populated largely by ethnic Armenians, declared independence in
1988 and drove Azerbaijani troops out with Armenia's help. Armenia
and Azerbaijan continue to struggle for control of Karabakh, and
the conflict has slowed economic and political development in both
former Soviet republics.

Top cleric calls for legal abortions for unmarried rape victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A top Muslim cleric has issued a ruling
calling on the government to permit abortions for unmarried rape
victims.
	   The ruling by Sheik Nasr Farid Wasel, Egypt's grand mufti, is
the first of its kind in Egypt, where abortion is illegal unless
the pregnancy is life threatening.
	   Adel Ahmed, the deputy health minister, said the government has
no immediate plans to change its ban on abortion.
	   ``If we do this, we will encourage rape rather than solve the
problem,'' he said.
	   Wasel did not address whether abortions should be performed on
married rape victims.
	   Aminna al-Naqqash, a women's activist and member of the
opposition Progressive Unionist Party, welcomed the ruling.
	   ``This is a very positive step forward which may help to solve
one serious problem and will give Muslim authorities more respect
and leverage,'' al-Naqqash said.
	   She said the move was made necessary by the increasing numbers
of reported rapes.
	   Egyptian law prevents doctors from performing abortions unless
three doctors testify that the operation is necessary to save the
woman's life.
	   Some Egyptian women rely on private doctors or midwives to
perform abortions.

Maier wins opening giant slalom

<TEXT>
	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ Hermann Maier showed signs of prolonging
last year's reign over the men's World Cup circuit, leading an
Austrian sweep of the podium in Sunday's season-opening giant
slalom.
	   The double Olympic champion left his rivals in his dust, posting
the fastest time in both runs, leaving his closest contender almost
two seconds behind.
	   Maier, reknowned for his ability to overcome tough course
conditions, took advantage of the poor visibility, clocking an
aggregate time of 2 minutes, 10.74 seconds, an incredible 1.60
seconds ahead of Eberharter.
	   ``I surprised myself today,'' said Maier, who won the overall
World Cup crown and World Cup titles in super-G and giant slalom as
a rookie last season. ``I wasn't really expecting to win and
espcially with such an advantage. My summer was so busy and you
never know how the other racers are skiing when they're out of
sight.''
	   Teammate Stefan Eberharter, the Olympic silver medallist, was
runnerup with a time of 2:12.34, while Heinz Schilchegger was third
with 2:13.08, earning his first career podium.
	   ``This time I was able to have two solid runs,'' said
Schilchegger, whose previous best result was a fourth place in
Adelboden two years ago. ``I'm very happy as the fight within the
team for a place in the giant slalom is so fierce.''
	   The three had clocked the fastest times in the first leg to set
up an Austrian sweep with compatriot Josef Strobl sitting in fourth
as an insurance marker.
	   But it was countryman Christian Mayer who finished the day
fourth with a total time of 2:13.13, with Strobl dropping to 19th
after a disasterous second run.
	   The nation's stellar performance was only an extension of its
domination over the World Cup field last year.
	   Last season, Austria's men became the first to win all of the
World Cup titles with Andreas Schifferer winning downhill and
Thomas Sykora slalom.
	   The team's _ but especially Maier's _ supremacy is what sparked
ugly rumors concerning the Austrian squad the past few months.
	   Earlier in the week the Swiss daily ``Sport'' quoted Swiss ski
boss Theo Nadig questionning Maier's rapid physical development.
Nadig later softened his statement, saying he was just curious so
he could provide the same methods to his team.
	   ``It was a bit unfair for people to try and make us nervous just
before the race,'' said Maier, who won 11 World Cup races last
year. ``But the rumors in the Swiss papers had little effect on us,
I managed to stay focused.''
	   ``We were a bit more disturbed and upset when the same type of
rumors showed up in a Italian newspaper this summer.''
	   Two-time World Cup champion Michael Von Gruenigen, sixth after
the first run, moved up a spot after the second, with a time of
2:13.28.
	   The Olympic bronze medallist, who injured his ankle playing
basketball this summer, had resumed training just two weeks ago
after a six week recovery period.
	   Germany's Markus Eberle, who barely made the top 30 in the first
leg to qualify, had the second-fastest time in the final run,
holding the lead until Austrian Hans Knauss posted an identical
two-run chrono of 2:13.35. In the end Eberle moved up to a
spectacular sixth place.
	   Strong winds and heavy snow had forced race officials to delay
the start of the race by more than two hours, while workers cleared
the course and re-erected the start hut, which had been blown down
overnight.
	   After the weekend races, the season takes almost a month off
before resuming for three weekends of racing in North America
beginning in Park City, Utah, Nov. 19-22 with men's and women's
slalom and giant slalom.
	   The circuit returns to Europe Dec. 10-13 in Val d'Isere, France,
for men's downhill and super-G and women's super-G and giant
slalom.

Spanish royal couple to attend Peru-Ecuador peace treaty in Brazil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia of
Spain will attend a ceremony here Monday to mark peace between Peru
and Ecuador after 57 years of hostilities, officials said Sunday.
	   Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and his Ecuadorean
counterpart, Jamil Mahuad, will sign a treaty that sets the border
between their countries, said officials.
	   Peru and Ecuador fought in 1941, 1981 and 1995 over the 48-mile
(78 kilometer) strip of jungle. Some 600 people died in fighting.
	   The treaty was brokered by the United States, Brazil, Argentina
and Chile.
	   The terms reaffirm the boundary set in the 1942 Rio de Janeiro
Protocol, ending Ecuador's hopes of redrawing the border. But the
Ecuadoreans will get to keep one square kilometer (0.4 sq. miles)
of border land in the Tiwinza military outpost that both nations
claim.
	   Along with 600 guests, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of
Brazil, Argentina's Carlos Menem and Chile's Eduardo Frei are
expected at the ceremony. U.S. special envoy Luigi Einaudi and
Thomas ``Mack'' McLarty, a former aide to U.S. President Bill
Clinton, are also due to attend.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Waving flags and shouting secular slogans,
millions of Turks took to the streets Sunday to celebrate the
republic's 75th anniversary and stage a show of force against
Islamic politics.
	   ``Turkey is secular and will remain so,'' hundreds of thousands
of chanted the capital marching to the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal
Ataturk, who founded Turkey as a secular republic the collapse of
the Ottoman empire.
	   The military, the self-appointed guardians of the secular
system, showed its presence in the march with thousands of
uniformed officers.
	   Aiming to create a modern state, Ataturk curtailed religion's
place in society and made secularism the official ideology.
	   Today, a widening divide between those determined to preserve
the secular tradition and supporters of an Islamic political
movement is a source of tension.
	   The tension reached a peak when an Islamic-led government was
pressured into resignation last year by the military. The Islamic
party was later disbanded for anti-secularism.
	   Sunday's nationwide marches were a response to demonstrations
this month by thousands protesting a ban on Islamic-style head
scarves at universities. The official anniversary of the republic
is on Wednesday.
	   Modern Turkey faces difficulties on several other fronts as it
reaches the age of 75. The government is battling crime, Kurdish
rebels and reaching for a more aggressive foreign policy.
	   Dozens of gangs members have been rounded up in recent weeks,
following a series of scandals revealing that politicians and banks
have been entangled in shady dealings with the mafia.
	   For the last 15 years the republic has been engaged in a fight
against autonomy-seeking Kurdish rebels in which close to 37,000
people died. Efforts on the diplomatic as well as the military
front are also underway.
	   Using threats of military action, Turkey last week clinched a
commitment from Syria to stop sheltering the rebels. It was the
latest sign that Turkey is abandoning its once-passive foreign
policy.
	   Earlier, Ankara put relations with the European Union on hold
after it refused to consider Turkey as an EU candidate. In
response, the EU last week proposed spending 180 million for
projects in Turkey and included it in a list of countries for
membership assessment.

Liverpool defends decision to rest four-goal Owen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ The headlines heaped praise on
Liverpool striker Michael Owen Sunday for returning with a
four-goal performance against Nottingham Forest while team
co-manager Roy Evans defended his decision to drop the 18-year-old
striker against Valencia in the UEFA Cup.
	   Owen's non-appearance on the Liverpool starting lineup against
the Spaniards Tuesday prompted speculation that English soccer's
brightest young star for decades might be burning out.
	   He netted four times on his return in a 5-1 thrashing of Forest
Saturday and said he wanted to play every game he could.
	   ``I don't have to prove anything to anybody,'' he said. ``A few
weeks ago people were comparing me to the best player on the planet
and stupid things like that.
	   ``Now I'm being told I should be in the side, it's a crazy world
that we live in, I think.
	   ``Whether it was right to leave me out is debatable,'' Owen
said. ``A lot of people have said what they think about it, and the
managers decided to give me a rest.
	   ``On this evidence it looks as if it has paid off. But I'm young
and I want to play in every match, the managers know that.
	   ``If it was felt that I was tired, fair enough. But I feel fine
in myself and I want to play,'' Owen said. ``I was told it was in
my best interests, if that is what the managers think, then that is
the decision.''
	   Evans explained that he and co-manager Gerard Houllier decided
to rest the young player against Valencia because they knew that
England coach Glenn Hoddle would almost certainly field Owen at
every possible opportunity.
	   ``England won't rest him, they won't do it,'' Evans said. ``So
someone has to look at the situation and we have been given that
task. It's not nice sometimes because you may suffer with a result.
	   ``Obviously (Owen) doesn't just have the burden of Liverpool on
his shoulders, but England too. There has been a lot of stuff
heaped on Michael's shoulders that I don't think should be.''
	   Evans saluted Owen's performance against Forest but stressed it
was the result of a team effort.
	   ``Michael certainly enjoyed himself, ably assisted by the
team,'' he said. ``The quickness of our play and the sharpness of
the passing got him into scoring positions and he capitalised on
it.
	   ``But without the rest of the team he is not going to be able to
do it. He'll get the limelight, but from our point of view after a
spell when we haven't looked the part, we got ourselves back on
song.
	   ``At 18 he has to get better,'' Evans said. ``He has things to
learn and he wants to learn, which is the main thing. He's capable
of scoring from all positions, and that can only improve with
age.''
	   Evans said Owen had no problems with being left off the team
against Valencia.
	   ``He took it the right way. Michael never doesn't want to play,
like any kid,'' the Liverpool manager said. ``It's a game of
football and if we said to him play every day, play twice a day,
he'd do it.
	   ``But we are custodians of his talent. During the week he had
looked really tired, so we took him out of one game. We may have
paid the penalty because we didn't get a great result against
Valencia, but it's not about one week it's about 10 to 12 years.''

Hurricane Mitch threatens western Caribbean

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Driving rain squalls spawned by
powerful Hurricane Mitch forced churches to cancel Sunday services
and flooded streets in the Jamaican capital.
	   Under dark, menacing skies, seaports closed and buses and taxis
stayed off Kingston's streets as Mitch, swirled in the western
Caribbean Sea south of Jamaica. With 130-mph (215-kph) winds, Mitch
was a powerful Category 4 hurricane.
	   Prime Minister P.J. Patterson appealed for calm, shelters opened
and Jamaica's defense forces went on alert. Residents cleared
shelves of bakery items, batteries and other goods at the few
Kingston markets open Sunday.
	   A hurricane warning was also posted for eastern Cuba and a
hurricane watch was in effect for the tourist islands of the
Caymans. Colombia's tiny islands off Central America were also
threatened, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.
	   At 10 a.m. (1500 GMT), Mitch was about 230 miles (370
kilometers) west-southwest of Kingston and 225 miles (360
kilometers) south-southeast of the Caymans. Crawling west-northwest
at 7 mph (11 kph), its hurricane-force winds of at least 74 mph
(118 kph) extended 45 miles (75 kilometers) from the center.
	   In Jamaica, sheets of rain reduced visibility to a few yards
(meters) as squalls pelted Kingston and Jamaica's eastern
districts. With rain expected at least through Monday, authorities
warned of mudslides and flash floods, especially in the mountains.
	   Several airlines canceled flights, although the Kingston and
Montego Bay airports remained open.
	   In western Jamaica, hoteliers and tourists kept a wary eye on
the storm's progress.
	   ``It's not a very good beach day,'' said Rohan Watson, a manager
at the Negril Inn in the western resort of Negril. Employees
stockpiled food and plywood to board windows in case Mitch
threatened, he said.
	   ``People are still coming in. I think most people think the
weather's going to pass,'' said Marcia Tomlinson, a receptionist at
the Montego Bay hotel in the northwestern coastal resort of Montego
Bay.
	   Jamaica was struck in 1988 by Hurricane Gilbert, which killed 45
people. But the island was spared by Hurricane Georges, a storm
that killed more than 500 during its rampage through the northeast
Caribbean last month.
	   In the Cayman Islands, a British colony of about 28,000, some
boat owners secured their vessels and residents stocked up on
essentials. The government allowed markets _ normally closed by law
on Sunday _ to open and ordered public works employees to report to
work.
	   The annual Pirates Festival and street parade was rescheduled
for next weekend, and a planned release of 400 endangered green sea
turtle hatchlings from Grand Cayman was postponed indefinitely.

Hard-liners win national elections for key Iranian assembly
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By SCHEHEREZADE FARAMARZI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A decisive but expected win by conservatives
in elections for an assembly of Iran's ruling clergy was hailed by
victors and losers Sunday as a triumph for democracy, despite the
setback it might deal to President Mohammad Khatami's reforms.
	   Conservatives won at least 54 places on the 86-seat Assembly of
Experts in Friday's vote and moderates only 13, although they were
buoyed by the prospect of a lively opposition.
	   Sixteen seats went to candidates whose affiliation was unclear _
but who probably lean toward the hard-line camp _ and three to
declared independents, who are believed closer to the moderates.
	   ``We took a step _ however small _ toward the democratization of
Iranian society in a reformist manner,'' said Saeid Laylaz, of the
Executives of Construction party, which supports Khatami.
	   Sunday's results came as no surprise since most moderates were
dropped from the ballot in advance by the Council of Guardians,
which determines eligibility and is dominated by hard-liners.
	   Many moderate groups decided not to enter the race to protest
the ban on the progressive theologians.
	   The council had reviewed a list of 396 applicants, but allowed
only 167 to stand as candidates.
	   Still Laylaz said that even with 15 percent of the seats, the
moderates will carry clout, having substantial say in the running
of the assembly, including oversight of the country's supreme
leader and the choice of his successor.
	   ``These 15 members will no doubt become members of some kind of
a committee in the assembly or will form a powerful faction to make
sure the assembly works more vigorously and better than it has been
doing in the past,'' Laylaz told The Associated Press.
	   Not all agreed.
	   Assadollah Badamchian, a leader of the powerful and
ultra-conservative Islamic Coalition Group, said the Assembly of
Experts has always functioned strictly according to the country's
constitution. Instead, he saw the vote itself as the real success.
	   ``The elections showed that democracy in Islam exists in the
true sense,'' said Badamchian, whose camp wants to maintain the
absolute powers of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. ``It proved
that Iran is the most democratic country in the region.''
	   In recent months, hard-liners like Badamchian also have battled
Khatami's efforts to grant more freedom to the press and the arts
and reduce Islamic strictures on the average citizen _ all reforms
that have garnered Khatami widespread support across Iran.
	   Nationwide, about 18 million, or 47 percent, of the 38.5 million
eligible voters cast ballots.
	   Many Iranians, however, were skeptical of the numbers, even
though there was no significant indication of any vote rigging.
	   Others compared Friday's vote to last year's presidential
elections when some 30 million cast ballots, 20 million of them for
Khatami, whose tenure has presented the biggest challenge to
conservatives since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   Last year, ``people voted with all their hearts,'' said Farshid
Moeini, 21, who sells watches at a shop in western Tehran.
	   ``Then, there was competition. This time, people didn't care
very much because there was no real contest,'' added Moeini, who
said he voted Friday although he didn't know any of the candidates.
	   ``I voted just because I felt it was my duty,'' he said.
	   In Sunday's session of Parliament, the powerful and hard-line
speaker, Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, thanked the Iranian people for
their ``splendid'' participation in the polls.
	   Of the 7.1 million eligible voters in Tehran, a key district,
only 1.68 million cast ballots, official figures showed.
	   Voters there could choose up to 16 candidates. Hashemi
Rafsanjani, the former president who remains influential and has
sided with moderates, had 1,682,882 votes, the most of any
candidate. Behind him was hard-liner Ali Meshkini, the current head
of the Assembly of Experts, who had 1,240,524 votes.
	   Hard-liners grabbed 11 of the 16 seats in Tehran and moderates
only five. Among the hard-liners who won in the capital were
Mohammad Yazdi, head of the powerful judiciary, and Ahmad Jannati,
who leads the council that vetted the candidates.
	   The election for the assembly is held every eight years.

Corretja fights back to beat Haas in final

	   LYON, France (AP) _ Alex Corretja staged a fine comeback to win
his first indoor championship Sunday, saving a match point before
beating Tommy Haas 2-6, 7-6 (8-6), 6-1 at the dlrs 750,000 Lyon
Grand Prix.
	   After easily grabbing the first set, unseeded Haas was 6-5 ahead
in the second set tiebreak against Spain's Corretja, the No. 4 seed
here and world number seven.
	   But Corretja blasted a backhand past Haas, who was at the net,
to save the match, before winning the tiebreak 8-6.
	   Earlier in the second set, Corretja saved four break points at
0-2.
	   ``Coming back from 0-2 and 0-40 down after losing the first set
was incredible. At that stage it looked like it would be a very
quick final,'' Corretja told reporters after the match.
	   ``On match point, he came to the net to put pressure on me,''
Corretja said. ``But I made a good shot and after that I think his
confidence went a little bit.''
	   The match turned in the Spaniard's favor in the first game of
the final set, when he got a lucky deflection off the net to break
service.
	   Corretja is the first Spaniard to win an indoor championship
since Manuel Orantes' victory at the Houston Masters back in 1976.
	   But the victory looked unlikely earlier in the match.
	   In the first meeting between the two players, the Roland Garros
finalist fired three aces in the first game but Haas still took the
game to take an early lead.
	   Haas, 20, showed no sign of nerves in what was only the second
final of his career.
	   He continued to look comfortable on the Spaniard's service, and
broke again to race into a 4-1 lead, easily taking the first set in
just 29 minutes.
	   Corretja, 24, has now won eight titles, including four this
year, but before the Lyon event he had only ever won one match
indoors, against Tim Henman at the Paris Open last year.
	   ``I hope this win will be the start of better form indoors. A
lot of it has to do with mentality. I have worked hard to improve
my indoor game and I am glad it is paying off,'' he said.
	   The Barcelona-born player collects dlrs 101,500, and 200 ATP
points, for winning the trophy.
	   By winning here, he also qualifies for the ATP world
championship in Hannover.
	   Haas came into the Lyon tournament ranked 53 in the world.
	   After a quarterfinal victory against France's Fabrice Santoro -
the player who beat him in last year's Lyon Grand Prix final - Haas
profited from walkovers against No. 1 seed Pete Sampras and No. 3
seed Marcelo Rios to reach the final.

Iranian missiles upset balance of power, says French official
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES BC-Qatar-France. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ France's defense minister said Sunday that
ballistic missiles developed by Iran upset the Mideast balance of
power and questioned whether a U.S anti-missile system offered to
the Gulf would provide the best protection.
	   Alain Richard made the comments to reporters in this oil-rich
Gulf state and on a visit earlier in the day to nearby Qatar.
	   Speaking in the Qatari capital Doha, he discussed Iran's the
Shahab-3 missile which, with a range of 1,300-kilometers (800
miles), is capable of striking Israel or U.S. troops in Saudi
Arabia.
	   ``These missiles threaten the strategic balance of power in the
Gulf and the Middle East,'' Richard said.
	   When asked about the proposed U.S. anti-missile system, he said:
``We believe every country has the right to protect itself against
missiles, but anti-missile technology does not take care of all
threats.''
	   Later, in Kuwait, Richard said France does not ``believe that
heavy and expensive anti-missile systems could a factor in
maintaining security in the long term.'' Instead, it would bring
``further escalation.''
	   Asked about alternatives, Richard said ``agreements on
limitation of the use of weapons'' are a good solution. ``That is
very simple, it is not too expensive and in some regions it is
working.''
	   Richard met with Kuwait's defense minister, Sheik Salem
al-Sabah, and was scheduled to leave late Sunday.
	   Kuwait signed a 10-year defense agreement with France after the
1991 Gulf War that liberated the Gulf state from a seven-month
Iraqi occupation. Similar pacts were signed with the United States
and Britain.
	   France, Britain and the United States vie for influence in the
Gulf, where they have sold billions of dollars in arms.
	   U.S. defense secretary William Cohen made a six-nation Gulf tour
earlier this month aimed at trying to convince allies to finance a
regional missile defense system.
	   The United States has said long-range missiles from both Iran
and Iraq could be a danger to the region. Iraq denies it has
long-range missiles in violation of U.N. resolutions, and Iraq says
its missiles are defensive.
	   Richard signed an expanded defense pact with Qatar in Doha on
Saturday shortly after he arrived.
	   Details of the agreement, which enlarged a 1994 pact, were not
available. French officials earlier suggested it would include
forming a joint military committee and upgrading technical
cooperation.
	   France maintains close relations with Qatar, a tiny nation
sitting on the world's third-largest reserves of natural gas. Qatar
buys more than 70 percent of its weapons from France, and Qatari
military personnel routinely train in France.
	   Richard also presented the Qatari army with a gift of 10 Leclerc
battle tanks on Sunday.

Britain tells Chile it cannot intervene in Pinochet case
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A delegation of right-wing Chilean senators
arrived Sunday to warn that the arrest of former Chilean dictator
Gen. Augusto Pinochet could destroy democracy in Chile and
``seriously imperil'' relations with Britain.
	   Outside the London Clinic, where Pinochet is under police guard,
scuffles broke out when a visitor, reportedly Chilean Sen. Ignacio
Perez Walker, left after seeing Pinochet and made taunting gestures
toward the protesters yelling for a trial.
	   Several demonstrators climbed over barriers but were blocked by
police. Others were held back by their fellow protesters. Police
reported no arrests.
	   ``We have come to represent to the British authorities that as
long as they keep their hands in Chilean affairs, they are
seriously damaging the process of transition in Chile,'' said
Carlos Bombal, a right-wing senator, who arrived with six other
senators seeking Pinochet's release.
	   Pinochet, 82, was arrested Oct. 16 on a warrant from a Spanish
magistrate seeking to extradite him on charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture during his 17-year rule.
	   The Chilean government has urged Britain to release Pinochet on
humanitarian grounds, and argued that as a senator, he is entitled
to diplomatic immunity. Britain says he does not have immunity and
the government cannot intervene.
	   ``Once you start to say to the Metropolitan Police as
politicians: `Look, we don't want you to carry out that warrant for
arrest that has been given by the magistrates,' you are only one
step away from politicians telling the police who you do want to
have arrested,'' Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a British
Broadcasting Corp. interview on Sunday.
	   Pinochet's lawyers go to High Court on Monday to try to get the
arrest ruled invalid.
	   London's Observer newspaper reported Sunday that Pincohet's
aides planned to ``spirit him secretly'' back to Chile Oct. 17. But
a Pinochet ally, Miguel Schweitzer, a former ambassador to Britain,
said the Foreign Office had been told he planned to leave Oct. 20.
He underwent spinal surgery Oct. 9.
	   The Foreign Office acknowledged it allowed Pinochet to use a VIP
suite a London's Heathrow airport when he arrived last month.
	   In the Chilean capital, Santiago, some 5,000 anti-Pinochet
demonstrators gathered peacefully in a park.
	   On Saturday, a rally by more than 20,000 Pinochet supporters
ended in scattered clashes with police.
	   In Stockholm, a group of Chilean immigrants to Sweden filed at a
police station three complaints of murder and kidnapping of
relatives during Pincohet's rule.
	   Pinochet ruled from 1973 until 1990 and remained army commander
until last March as part of a compromise in Chile's transition to
democracy.

Britain tells Chile it cannot intervene in Pinochet case

	   LONDON (AP) _ A delegation of right-wing Chilean senators
arrived Sunday to warn that the arrest of former Chilean dictator
Gen. Augusto Pinochet could destroy democracy in Chile and
``seriously imperil'' relations with Britain.
	   Outside the London Clinic, where Pinochet is under police guard,
scuffles broke out when a visitor, reportedly Chilean Sen. Ignacio
Perez Walker, left after seeing Pinochet and made taunting gestures
toward the protesters yelling for a trial.
	   Several demonstrators climbed over barriers but were blocked by
police. Others were held back by their fellow protesters. Police
reported no arrests.
	   ``We have come to represent to the British authorities that as
long as they keep their hands in Chilean affairs, they are
seriously damaging the process of transition in Chile,'' said
Carlos Bombal, a right-wing senator, who arrived with six other
senators seeking Pinochet's release.
	   Pinochet, 82, was arrested Oct. 16 on a warrant from a Spanish
magistrate seeking to extradite him on charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture during his 17-year rule.
	   The Chilean government has urged Britain to release Pinochet on
humanitarian grounds, and argued that as a senator, he is entitled
to diplomatic immunity. Britain says he does not have immunity and
the government cannot intervene.
	   ``Once you start to say to the Metropolitan Police as
politicians: `Look, we don't want you to carry out that warrant for
arrest that has been given by the magistrates,' you are only one
step away from politicians telling the police who you do want to
have arrested,'' Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a British
Broadcasting Corp. interview on Sunday.
	   Pinochet's lawyers go to High Court on Monday to try to get the
arrest ruled invalid.
	   London's Observer newspaper reported Sunday that Pincohet's
aides planned to ``spirit him secretly'' back to Chile Oct. 17. But
a Pinochet ally, Miguel Schweitzer, a former ambassador to Britain,
said the Foreign Office had been told he planned to leave Oct. 20.
He underwent spinal surgery Oct. 9.
	   The Foreign Office acknowledged it allowed Pinochet to use a VIP
suite a London's Heathrow airport when he arrived last month.
	   In the Chilean capital, Santiago, some 5,000 anti-Pinochet
demonstrators gathered peacefully in a park.
	   On Saturday, a rally by more than 20,000 Pinochet supporters
ended in scattered clashes with police.
	   In Stockholm, a group of Chilean immigrants to Sweden filed at a
police station three complaints of murder and kidnapping of
relatives during Pincohet's rule.
	   Pinochet ruled from 1973 until 1990 and remained army commander
until last March as part of a compromise in Chile's transition to
democracy.

Hard-liners win national elections for key Iranian assembly

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A decisive but expected conservative victory
in elections for an assembly of Iran's ruling clergy was hailed by
victors and losers Sunday as a triumph for democracy, despite the
setback it might deal to President Mohammad Khatami's reforms.
	   Conservatives won at least 54 places on the 86-seat Assembly of
Experts in Friday's vote and moderates only 13, although they were
buoyed by the prospect of a lively opposition.
	   Sixteen seats went to candidates whose affiliation was unclear _
but who probably lean toward the hard-line camp _ and three to
declared independents, who are believed closer to the moderates.
	   ``We took a step _ however small _ toward the democratization of
Iranian society in a reformist manner,'' said Saeid Laylaz, of the
Executives of Construction party, which supports Khatami.
	   Sunday's results came as no surprise since most moderates were
dropped from the ballot in advance by the Council of Guardians,
which determines eligibility and is dominated by hard-liners.
	   The council allowed only 167 of 396 applicants to stand as
candidates.
	   Many moderate groups decided not to enter the race to protest
the ban on the progressive theologians.
	   Still Laylaz said that even with a small percentage of seats,
the moderates will have substantial clout in the assembly, whose
responsibilities include oversight of the country's supreme leader
and the choice of his successor.
	   The moderates ``will no doubt become members of some kind of a
committee in the assembly or will form a powerful faction to make
sure the assembly works more vigorously and better than it has been
doing in the past,'' Laylaz told The Associated Press.
	   Not all agreed.
	   Assadollah Badamchian, a leader of the powerful and
ultra-conservative Islamic Coalition Group, said the Assembly of
Experts has always functioned strictly according to the country's
constitution. Instead, he saw the vote itself as the real success.
	   ``The elections showed that democracy in Islam exists in the
true sense,'' said Badamchian, whose camp wants to maintain the
absolute powers of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. ``It proved
that Iran is the most democratic country in the region.''
	   In recent months, hard-liners like Badamchian also have battled
Khatami's efforts to grant more freedom to the press and the arts
and to reduce Islamic strictures on the average citizen _ all
reforms that have garnered Khatami widespread support across Iran.
	   Nationwide, about 18 million, or 47 percent, of the 38.5 million
eligible voters cast ballots.
	   Many Iranians, however, were skeptical of the numbers, even
though there was no significant indication of any vote rigging.
	   Others compared Friday's vote to last year's presidential
elections when some 30 million cast ballots, 20 million of them for
Khatami, whose tenure has presented the biggest challenge to
conservatives since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   Last year, ``people voted with all their hearts,'' said Farshid
Moeini, 21, who sells watches at a shop in western Tehran.
	   ``Then, there was competition. This time, people didn't care
very much because there was no real contest,'' added Moeini, who
said he voted Friday although he didn't know any of the candidates.
	   ``I voted just because I felt it was my duty,'' he said.
	   In Sunday's session of Parliament, the powerful hard-line
speaker, Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, thanked the Iranian people for
their ``splendid'' participation in the polls.
	   Of the 7.1 million eligible voters in Tehran only 1.68 million
cast ballots, official figures showed.
	   Voters there could choose up to 16 candidates. Hashemi
Rafsanjani, the former president who remains influential and has
sided with moderates, had nearly 1.7 million votes, the most of any
candidate. Behind him was hard-liner Ali Meshkini, the current head
of the Assembly of Experts, who had 1.24 million votes.
	   Hard-liners grabbed 11 of the 16 seats in Tehran and moderates
only five.

Jewish settlers protest accord; Netanyahu hails agreement

	   OFRA, West Bank (AP) _ Appealing to Jewish settlers to end
staged protests across the West Bank and accept the new Mideast
peace accord, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Sunday called the
pact the ``best deal'' that could be achieved.
	   Arriving back in Israel to a red-carpet welcome, the Israeli
leader said security concessions won from the Palestinians during
the nine-day summit outside Washington would justify the ceding of
more West Bank land.
	   ``We are returning after a long and difficult effort to bring
... security and peace to Israel,'' he said. ``We achieved such a
deal _ we achieved the best deal... We did something good for the
state of Israel.''
	   Hours before his return home, protests by settlers _ who were
once Netanyahu's staunchest supporters _ led to at least 20 arrests
and two police officers were hurt.
	   Near the settlement of Ofra north of Jerusalem, about 50
settlers and their supporters rushed past Israeli police and sat
cross-legged on the highway. Some settlers wrapped in prayer shawls
held morning services at the roadside.
	   Police also said settlers burned tires at the Karme Tsur
settlement north of Hebron.
	   ``I'm here to show that this is a sad day,'' said Natan El, 38,
an engineer, sitting in the middle of the main north-south highway
through the West Bank. ``We are in danger of losing our land, the
land we have returned to after 2,000 years.''
	   Tensions over the accord also boiled over in the West Bank town
of Ramallah, where infighting broke out among Yasser Arafat's
supporters. Members of the Palestinian leader's political faction,
Fatah, battled Palestinian security forces with rocks and bullets,
leaving two injured.
	   The confrontation broke out after Palestinian intelligence
agents searched Fatah headquarters, looking for illegal weapons. A
crackdown on unlicensed arms is one of the provisions of the
agreement.
	   in Israel, politicians across the board predicted Netanyahu
would face political turmoil as a result of the agreement when he
brings it before his right-wing Cabinet and the Israeli parliament
for approval Monday.
	   The agreement signed at the White House Friday calls for an
Israeli handover of 13.1 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian
civilian control. That means some Jewish settlements will be
surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory, except for access
roads.
	   Twelve hardliners in Netanyahu's government say they will vote
against him in upcoming no-confidence motions. Even Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon, who leads the right-wing camp in Netanyahu's
government and helped forge the agreement, said the withdrawal
endangered Israel's security and would not reveal how he would vote
on the deal.
	   Netanyahu has only a one-seat majority.
	   Hoping to calm settler fears, the premier made overtures to the
settler community, but they mostly went unheard.
	   ``I say now here to our friends listening, you are us, you are
us and we are you. We love you and we are fighting for you and
there is no other government that will fight like this,'' Netanyahu
said, mentioning settler leader Ahron Dombe by name.
	   ``I am very, very, very disappointed with the prime minister and
the ministers who participated in this deal,'' Dombe said after the
premier's speech. ``Netanyahu is no longer the leader of our
national camp.'' Dombe said his staff would begin opinion samplings
among settlers Monday in search of a candidate to challenge
Netanyahu.
	   In a another development, the militant Palestinian Islamic Jihad
group said its leader in the Gaza Strip had been arrested as part
of a renewed crackdown by Arafat's police on militants. in a
statement, faxed to news agencies, the group said dozens of its
members had been taken into custody.
	   The larger Hamas group also announced that one its West Bank
leaders was under arrest and being held in a Palestinian jail.

Mandela woos whites, whose votes may be critical for ANC in
</HEADLINE>
election &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREW SELSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ With elections only months away,
President Nelson Mandela appealed on Sunday to whites _ whose votes
may be critical to his party _ ``to overcome the legacy of our
divided past.''
	   Mandela's African National Congress faces a struggle to win a
two-thirds majority in parliament, necessary to independently pass
legislation aimed at redressing imbalances caused by decades of
apartheid rule.
	   The National Party, backed by Afrikaner descendants of Dutch
settlers, governed during apartheid but is now seen by many as a
relic. If enough whites abandon the party for the ANC, it could tip
the balance in the ANC's favor.
	   Mandela, speaking before a mostly white audience of 800 in an
affluent suburb of the capital, beckoned them to think of
themselves as South Africans first, instead of drawing racial
lines.
	   ``Our past has led us to talk in terms of minorities and a
majority in our society,'' Mandela said. ``But all of us can now be
part of one great South African majority ... working consciously
together for shared goals.
	   ``The most basic of those goals is to overcome the legacy of our
divided past, in order to create a better life for each and every
person in our land.''
	   The audience, which filled every seat in a high school
auditorium, warmly applauded Mandela's remarks. However, some were
already converted.
	   Joggie Boers had been an organizer for the National Party before
he switched to the ANC in May 1997.
	   Boers feels he made the right choice in leaving a party he
believes still believes in white supremacy and will soon be
obsolete.
	   ``They'll make a grand exit in the next election,'' Boers said
as Mandela left the stage amid loud applause. ``I doubt they'll get
even 4 percent of the vote.''
	   In South Africa's first all-race election in 1994 _ an event
marking the end of apartheid _ the National Party won 20 percent of
the vote. The ANC won 62 percent.
	   Boers is now the secretary of the ANC's local branch in the
suburb of East Pretoria and is an ANC member of provincial Gauteng
legislature.
	   He denied he switched horses simply to further his political
career., saying it came at a cost. He said he has received death
threats from some conservative Afrikaners who consider him a
traitor.
	   National Party executive director Renier Schoeman, speaking
Sunday in the eastern city of Durban, scoffed at ``Mickey Mouse''
parties and political commentators who predict his party is on the
brink of extinction.
	   ``They will have egg all over their faces when the votes are
counted,'' Schoeman was quoted as saying by the South African Press
Association.
	   Mandela, in kicking off a voter registration dive on Saturday,
underscored the importance of winning a two-thirds majority in
parliament, saying: ``If we get another 62 percent we will have
failed.''
	   Mandela wooed white voters on Sunday with that in mind.
	   ``If we want to get the two-thirds majority, there is only one
sector we can get that from and that is the whites,'' Boers said.
	   No date for the 1999 election has been set, but authorities say
May is being considered.
	   Mandela plans to retire after the election. He will likely be
succeeded by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.

Arafat wants accurate, faithful implementation of peace deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Arafat in Algeria and Morocco in 6th graf; ADDS
Kuwait comment in last graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Sunday
he hoped the new Israeli-Palestinian peace accord would be
``accurately and faithfully'' implemented to truly push forward the
Middle East peace process.
	   Arafat's comment, made at Cairo airport after briefing President
Hosni Mubarak on the accord, reflects Arab skepticism that Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will live up to the agreement to
withdraw from a further 13 percent of West Bank land.
	   The Palestinian leader met with Mubarak at the Unity
presidential palace in Cairo. The two talked briefly alone, then
were joined by aides. The session last one hour and 15 minutes.
	   Neither Arafat nor Mubarak spoke to reporters after the meeting,
but Arafat later told reporters just before he departed for Algeria
that the implementation of the deal was what counted.
	   He expressed hope that the agreement would be ``accurately and
faithfully implemented so that we can say that we have pushed
forward the peace process and protected the peace of the courageous
people.''
	   Arafat also briefed officials in Algeria on the new pact Sunday.
He then flew to Morocco and was to travel later to Saudi Arabia.
	   The agreement, signed Friday after marathon U.S.-mediated
negotiations, call for Arafat to clamp stringent security measures
on Palestinian militants to prevent attacks on Israelis in exchange
for the Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   Many in the Arab world have criticized the pact as geared too
much toward Israel's security demands and too little toward
Palestinian interests.
	   Mubarak, who in the past has mediated between Israel and the
Palestinians, has cautiously welcomed the agreement but also
questioned whether Netanyahu would implement all its parts.
	   In remarks Saturday, he accused Netanyahu of failing to live up
to past peace deals. Of the six points in the 1997 Hebron accord,
he said, ``only two points were implemented while the other four
were ignored.''
	   Also Sunday, the Cairo-based Arab League welcomed the agreement
as ``an important step,'' in the peace process. It called for using
the ``impetus of this agreement'' to conclude a final peace treaty
that would allow for the establishment of a Palestinian state.
	   In Kuwait, the Cabinet issued a statement saying it hoped the
agreement would move forward the peace process in a way to protect
the rights of the Palestinian people. It also urged new steps in
Israel's peace talks with Syria and Lebanon.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Lightning struck six soccer
players during a match between two local teams on Sunday. There
were no fatalities.
	   The incident happened during a match between Jomo Cosmos and the
Moroka Swallows. The game was called off, with the Swallows leading
2-0, after six Swallows players were struck by lightning in the
79th minute.
	   Referee Jeff Motsamai immediately stopped the game as paramedics
rushed onto the pitch and carried off the players on stretchers.

Basque voters seek peace after years of separatist strife

	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Five weeks after armed separatists
declared a cease-fire, Basques voted Sunday in regional elections
pitting pro-independence nationalists against mainstream parties
that want to keep Spain united.
	   Turnout was high among the 1,8 million registered voters despite
chilly, rainy weather in much of the picturesque and prosperous
Basque country of northern Spain.
	   The Basque government said that as of 5 p.m.(1600 GMT), 52
percent of the electorate had cast ballots, nine points higher than
at the same stage of the 1994 regional elections.
	   The open-ended cease-fire by the armed ETA commandos focused
attention on whether the truce would propel pro-independence
parties to electoral gains.
	   ``The future of Euskadi is at stake,'' said Carlos Iturgaiz, the
candidate in Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's center-right
Popular Party for Basque regional president. He was using the
Basque word for the region.
	   Voters were renewing the 75-seat legislature, which in turn will
elect the president. It is the sixth such election since Spain
granted the Basque country a broad degree of autonomy 19 years ago.
	   Following the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, Spain
was divided into 17 autonomous regions although the national
government still controls most strategic powers, such as foreign
affairs and defense.
	   Aznar is hoping a heavy turnout will give his party and other
non-nationalist groups more clout in the Basque country to seek a
lasting settlement to one of Western Europe's last regional
conflicts without splitting Spain.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968. It began its
truce Sept. 18 making this the first regional election held without
a threat of violence.
	   In a taped program broadcast Saturday by the British
Broadcasting Corporation, a hooded ETA leader insisted that its
truce offer ``was solid and serious'' but added that it had no
regrets for any of its actions.
	   A spokesman and top candidate of the pro-ETA party Herri
Batasuna, Arnaldo Otegi, said the truce meant ETA was committed to
ending the conflict and that it was up to the government to
negotiate. ``The ball is in the government's court,'' he told
reporters.

Reconstructed memorial to British troops in Crimean War unveiled

	   BALAKLAVA, Ukraine (AP) _ A renovated memorial to British troops
killed in a key battle of the 1853-56 Crimean War against Russia
was unveiled Sunday in the Black Sea port town of Balaklava.
	   The white obelisk monument was originally erected by British
soldiers who survived the Battle of Balaklava on Oct. 25, 1854.
Thousands of British servicemen died in the fighting, which was
immortalized in the poem by Lord Tennyson ``The Charge of the Light
Brigade.''
	   Britain's Chief of Defense Staff, Gen. Sir Charles Guthrie, and
the ambassador to Ukraine, Sir Roy Reeve, led a British delegation
to the unveiling on Katkartov Hill. Reeve's great-grandfather
fought in the battle.
	   ``It is the first time ... I've had the chance to visit this
historical site and honor the heroes that Britain lost,'' he said.
	   Ukraine inherited the badly deteriorating memorial along with
the Crimean peninsula when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. But
the cash-starved country could not afford to restore the monument,
so the British government donated the funds.
	   Restorers shored up the sinking ground around the monument and
decorated its base with new metal tiles.
	   Guthrie noted that such monuments honor the victims of fighting
_ not the battles themselves.
	   ``Memorials are for preventing wars,'' he said.
	   Britain, France and the Ottoman Empire joined forces in the
Crimean War to try to stop Russia's expansion around the Black Sea.
The war ended with the Treaty of Paris, which forced Russia to give
up some of the territories it had seized from the Ottoman Empire.

Arsenal wins at Blackburn, 13 cards shown as Chelsea held by Leeds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ French stars Nicolas Anelka and Emanuel Petit
fired defending champion Arsenal into third place in the Premier
League Sunday after a 2-1 victory over struggling Blackburn Rovers.
	   In another Premier League game, the referee showed 12 yellow
cards and a red one to Chelsea's Frank Leboeuf in a 0-0 tie at
Leeds.
	   The Gunners went ahead in the 25th minute at Ewood Park when
Anelka collected the ball 30 meters from goal and fired a shot that
went in off the inside of the post
	   A deflected free kick by Petit seven minutes before halftime
made it 2-0 and Blackburn's sole reply was Damien Johnson's
64th-minute diving header after Petit had failed to clear a long
throw.
	   Substitute Kevin Davies had the ball in the Arsenal net for what
the Blackburn fans thought was an equalizer 10 minutes from the end
but it was ruled out for a foul on Martin Keown.
	   With the game going into injury time, Blackburn striker Chris
Sutton was sent off for clattering into Anelka's legs
	   Arsene Wenger's team climbed into third, five points behind
Aston Villa, and replacing Liverpool, which crushed Nottingham
Forest 5-1 Saturday with four goals from Michael Owen.
	   Villa was held 1-1 at home by Leicester Saturday and second
place Manchester United managed only a 1-1 tie at Derby and is four
points behind.
	   In Sunday's other Premier League game, Leeds missed a penalty
and failed to score for the fifth game in a row in a 0-0 tie with
Chelsea,
	   Five Chelsea players _ Gianfranco Zola, Roberto Di Matteo, Frank
Leboeuf, goalkeeper Ed de Goey and Dennis Wise _ were shown the
yellow card in a 15 minute spell in the first half although none of
them for serious fouls.
	   A sixth, Michael Duberry, was cautioned by referee Mike Reed
when he brought down a goalbound Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink for a
penalty in first half injury time. But De Goey blocked
Hasselbaink's spot kick with his leg.
	   Leboeuf was expelled for his second yellow card, a foul on
Leeds' Australian forward Harry Kewell, as Chelsea slipped to sixth
place and Leeds climbed four places to 10th.
	   Queens Park Rangers remained rooted to the foot of division one
after losing 1-0 at home to Birmingham City, which climbed to
second, level on points with unbeaten Sunderland which has two
games in hand.
	   Rangers have lost all three games and failed to score a goal
since Gerry Francis returned as manager.

De Klerk to fight Truth Commission report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Former President F.W. de Klerk
plans to ask a court to prevent a panel probing apartheid-era
abuses from implicating him in covering up state-sponsored terror,
his spokesman said Sunday.
	   Dave Steward said de Klerk wanted the High Court to stop the
Truth and Reconciliation from publishing a finding that he was ``an
accessory after the fact'' to the bombings in the 1980s of
headquarters of a church group and of a labor federation.
	   A publication ban would be sought with the court on Tuesday,
just two days before the Truth Commission is to give President
Nelson Mandela its final report on abuses committed all sides
during the struggle against white rule.
	   In its report, the commission is expected to say that although
de Klerk did not order the bombings, he subsequently came to know
about the roles of former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and
former police commissioner Johan van der Merwe in the blasts but
failed to report it to police.
	   The finding could pave the way for the prosecution of de Klerk,
who has not sought amnesty in connection with the bombings of the
buildings which housed anti-apartheid bodies.
	   Steward said de Klerk's lawyers met Truth Commission officials
last week in a bid to persuade them to excise the damaging
findings, but were unsuccessful.
	   His lawyers are expected to contend that when de Klerk came to
know about the bombings, Vlok and Van der Merwe were already in the
process of applying for amnesty, and he did not think it necessary
to report the matter to the police.
	   The Truth Commission can grant amnesty to those who fully
confess to politically motivated crimes committed during apartheid.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Typhoon Babs weakened into a severe
tropical storm Sunday night after it triggered massive flooding and
landslides in Taiwan and slammed Hong Kong with strong winds. The
storm earlier killed at least 156 people in the Philippines and
left hundreds of thousands homeless.
	   Babs, which packed winds of more than 140 kph (87 mph) at its
height, was downgraded into severe tropical storm at 1500 GMT, when
it was centered about 290 kilometers (179 miles) of Hong Kong, the
Hong Kong Observatory reported.
	   It said the storm was moving north at 10 kilometers (six miles)
toward the south China coast.
	   On its present track, Babs is expected to pass 200 kilometers
(124 miles) east of Hong Kong on Monday.
	   The typhoon dumped torrential rains on Taiwan, with Hualien and
several other eastern towns recording more than 500 millimeters (20
inches) of rain in 24 hours, meteorologists reported. Authorities
evacuated hundreds of people from their homes near flooded rivers.
	   In Taipei, the main Keelung River swelled its banks. One-third
of Hsichih town was flooded in waist-high water, and much of nearby
Wutu was also flooded. Rescuers used rubber boats and trucks to
evacuate residents from apartment blocks, officials said.
	   In eastern Ilan, a man was swept into the sea while fishing in
rough waters. Nine people were injured when their van was hit by
rockslides in eastern Taitung, police said.
	   Several domestic airports were closed, and landslides halted
traffic and trapped hundreds of people in mountains in central
Taiwan, they said.
	   In Hong Kong, four people were slightly injured when two trees
were uprooted by the wind, police said.
	   Hong Kong authorities hoisted the No. 3 typhoon signal, a
warning to residents to take precautions as gusts of 104 kph (64
mph) were recorded in some places. They also opened several
shelters for those seeking refuge.

Eleven dead in storms

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to increase the number dead and add more details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lashing rains and winds gusting to 80 mph (130
kph) swept across areas of Britain for two days, leaving at least
eleven people dead.
	   Police and firefighters searching for James Bilson, a
19-year-old canoeist, recovered a body from the river Dart near
Holne Bridge on the edge of Dartmoor in southern England. Another
canoeist, a 47-year-old man, was pulled from the river Barle at
Dulverton, on Exmoor, southwest England. He was not immediately
identified.
	   Four people died in a car crash on Saturday near Malvern in
central England, when two cars were involved in a head-on collision
on a slippery road. Three men were killed when their car crashed
near Congleton in northwest England on Friday in an accident police
have blamed on severe weather.
	   And a motorcyclist died instantly on Saturday night when a gust
of wind blew his cycle into the path of a crane near Chippenham in
southern England. None of the victims were identified.
	   A man was seen swept away in a fast-flowing stream in the
Treorchy area of the Rhondda Valley, 20 miles (30 km) west of
Cardiff, on Thursday night. After a police search, his body was
discovered Friday.
	   Farmer William Mason, 62, was missing after he went out in the
storm to save his livestock from the flood-swollen River Wye near
his home at Clifford, 50 miles (80 km) north of Cardiff. The search
was called off Sunday.
	   Many roads in Wales, and central and southwest England were
closed because of flooding or fallen trees, creating problems just
at the start of a week of school vacation. And hundreds of people
were forced to flee their homes as severe flood warnings were
issued for 46 rivers. But by late Sunday, only six of the alerts
remained active.
	   With the rain and storms subsiding, residents began the cleanup
process. The Association of British Insurers estimated the final
repair bill at 100 million pounds (dlrs 170 million).
	   The storms also caused chain-reaction traffic accidents and wind
damage in France.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Mallorca, coached by Argentine Hector
Cuper, thrashed Arrigo Sacchi's Atletico de Madrid 4-0 Sunday while
defending titlist Barcelona beat cross-town rival Espanyol 2-1.
	   Mallorca's victory shoved it to No. 1 with 15 points. Real
Madrid with 13 points was to plays its seventh-round game later
Sunday against Racing de Santander and could regain the top spot.
	   Other seventh-round results Sunday were: Oviedo 0, Villareal 0;
Real Sociedad 1, Valladolid 0; Salamanca 2, Athletic Bilbao 1;
Valencia 5, Betis 1 and Alaves 0, Extremadura 1. On Saturday, Celta
defeated Zaragoza 2-0. Tenerife was to play Deportivo later Sunday.
	   Yugoslav midfielder Veljko Paunovic score in the 19th minute for
Mallorca against his old side. Two minutes into the second half
Lauren Bisan-Etane scored the second while Yugoslav Jovan Jankovic
made it 3-0 in the 51st. Francisco Soler scored the fourth and
final in the 79th.
	   Atletico stays with 10 points.
 &UR; Espanyol 1, Barcelona 2 &QC; 
	   Dutch centerforward Patrick Kluivert shot Barcelona into the
lead in the 10th minute. Barcelona got a jolt in the 33rd minute
when Argentine defender Mauricio Pellegrino was sent off for two
yellow cards while in the 59th minute 19-year-old Enrique de Lucas
grabbed an equalizer. Espanyol's luck plummeted in the 84th minute
when the side was left with 10 men after a penalty call which
Brazilian Giovanni neatly converted to give Barcelona a 2-1 victory
and 13 points.
 &UR; Valencia 5, Betis 1
	   Argentine international Clauio Lopez notched one up for Valencia
in the 34th minute only to see Alexis Trujillo matching it for
Betis four minutes later. Three minutes before the break, Valencia
took the lead again with a goal by Rumanian international Adrian
Ilie. Things appeared about to turn sour for Valencia in the 63rd
when Frenchman Alain Roche was sent off but three minutes later
Swedish player Stefan Schwarz got the third while Lopez snatched a
fourth in the 72nd. Ilie got his second and the team's fifth eight
minutes from the whistle.
 &UR; Salamanca 2, Athletic Bilbao 1 &QC; 
	   Ismael Urzaiz got his sixth of the season to put Bilbao, last
season's league runnerup, ahead four minutes into the game but Edu
Alonso pulled lowly Salamanca even in the 39th minute. Sergio
Corino edged Salamanca ahead three minutes after the break for a
2-1 victory.
 &UR; Alaves 0, Extremadura 1
	   Bottom-of-the-table Extremadura grabbed its first victory of the
season on downing fellow division newcomer Alaves 1-0 with a goal
by Jose Luis Soto in the fourth minute. Extremadura stays last in
the 20-team division, now with five points.

Jewish settlers protest accord; Netanyahu hails agreement

<TEXT>
	   OFRA, West Bank (AP) _ Appealing to Jewish settlers to end
staged protests across the West Bank and to accept the new Mideast
peace accord, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Sunday called the
pact the ``best deal'' that could be achieved.
	   Arriving back in Israel to a red-carpet welcome, the Israeli
leader said security concessions won from the Palestinians during
the nine-day summit outside Washington would justify the ceding of
more West Bank land.
	   ``We are returning after a long and difficult effort to bring
... security and peace to Israel,'' he said. ``We achieved such a
deal _ we achieved the best deal... We did something good for the
state of Israel.''
	   The agreement signed at the White House on Friday calls for an
Israeli handover of 13.1 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian
civilian control. That means some Jewish settlements will be
surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory, except for access
roads.
	   Hours before his return home, protests by settlers _ who were
once Netanyahu's staunchest supporters _ led to at least 20 arrests
and two police officers were hurt.
	   Near the settlement of Ofra north of Jerusalem, about 50
settlers and their supporters rushed past Israeli police and sat
cross-legged on the highway. Some settlers wrapped in prayer shawls
held morning services at the roadside.
	   Police also said settlers burned tires at the Karme Tsur
settlement north of Hebron.
	   ``I'm here to show that this is a sad day,'' said Natan El, 38,
an engineer, sitting in the middle of the main north-south highway
through the West Bank. ``We are in danger of losing our land, the
land we have returned to after 2,000 years.''
	   Tensions over the accord also boiled over in the West Bank town
of Ramallah, where infighting broke out among Yasser Arafat's
supporters. Members of the Palestinian leader's political faction,
Fatah, battled Palestinian security forces with rocks and bullets,
leaving two injured.
	   The confrontation broke out after Palestinian intelligence
agents searched Fatah headquarters, looking for illegal weapons. A
crackdown on unlicensed arms is one of the provisions of the
agreement.
	   In Israel, politicians across the board predicted Netanyahu
would face political turmoil when he brings the agreement before
his right-wing Cabinet and the Israeli parliament for approval
Monday.
	   Twelve hard-liners in Netanyahu's government say they will vote
against him in upcoming no-confidence motions. Even Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon, who leads the right-wing camp in Netanyahu's
government and helped forge the agreement, said the withdrawal
endangered Israel's security and would not reveal how he would vote
on the deal.
	   Netanyahu has only a one-seat majority.
	   The premier made overtures to the settler community, but they
mostly went unheard.
	   ``I say now here to our friends listening, you are us, you are
us and we are you. We love you and we are fighting for you and
there is no other government that will fight like this,'' Netanyahu
said, mentioning settler leader Ahron Dombe by name.
	   ``I am very, very, very disappointed with the prime minister and
the ministers who participated in this deal,'' Dombe said after the
premier's speech. ``Netanyahu is no longer the leader of our
national camp.'' Dombe said his staff would begin opinion samplings
among settlers Monday in search of a candidate to challenge
Netanyahu.
	   In another development, the militant Palestinian Islamic Jihad
group said its leader in the Gaza Strip had been arrested as part
of a renewed crackdown by Arafat's police on militants. In a
statement, faxed to news agencies, the group said dozens of its
members had been taken into custody.
	   The larger Hamas group also announced that one its West Bank
leaders was under arrest and being held in a Palestinian jail.

Pope beatifies four founders of religious institutions

 &UR; Eds: corrects spelling of Agostini in 7th graf, year of Miguez'
birth in 8th graf

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II on Sunday beatified four
founders of religious institutions: Italian, Brazilian and Spanish
priests and a French nun.
	   All four, he said at a Mass Sunday, were modest people and stand
as symbols of deep connection between faith and humility.
	   ``These newly beatified are examples for us to imitate and
follow,'' the pope said. ``They believed in God. Their existence
demonstrates the power of 'little' people and of prayer.''
	   Beatification is a step toward sainthood in the Roman Catholic
Church.
	   The four beatified by John Paul Sunday are the Revs. Zefirino
Agostini, Antonio de Sant'Ana Galvao, Faustino Miguez and Mother
Theodore Guerin.
	   Guerin was a French nun of the Sisters of Providence order who
left her homeland in 1840 for the then-frontier state of Indiana,
where she founded its first colleges for women.
	   She founded St. Mary-of-the Woods College in St. Mary's, Ind.,
near Terre Haute, within a year of her arrival and went on to
establish a number of other schools throughout Indiana and two
orphanages. She died in 1856 at the age of 57.
	   Agostini, a native of Verona, Italy, founded a school for poor
girls and several other institutions and during Italy's war of
independence he turned his church into a hospital to care for the
wounded. He died in 1896 at the age of 83.
	   Miguez was born in Spain in 1831 and was a member of the Order
of the Pious Schools. He spent his life as a teacher and founded
the Calasanzian Institute of Daughters of the Divine Shepherdess in
1885. Miguez, who lived to the age of 94, also carried out
experiments on the medicinal properties of plants.
	   Galvao was born in Brazil in 1739 to a well-to-do family. He
founded a retreat for women which later became a religious order.
	   John Paul has beatified 800 people since he became pope in 1978
and canonized 279 _ more than all the other popes of this century
combined.

Russian lawmakers visit China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament
led a delegation of lawmakers from across the political spectrum to
China on Sunday for talks with Chinese officials.
	   The legislators are expected to meet Li Peng, No. 2 in China's
communist party heirarchy, on Monday, the Interfax news agency
reported. It did not give details of other talks.
	   The Russians include members of the country's most influential
political parties: State Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov, a
Communist; Vladimir Lukin of the market reform-oriented Yabloko
party, head of the Duma's international affairs committee; Pavel
Bunich of the pro-government Our Home is Russia party, chairman of
the Duma's privatization committee; and Vladimir Gusev of the
ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party.
	   The visit comes the day after Russia's defense minister, Igor
Sergeyev, returned from a trip to China, at which he announced
increased military cooperation between the countries.
	   Relations between Moscow and Beijing have improved dramatically
in recent years as China has become a major trading partner and a
leading customer for Russia's struggling defense industry. Russia
views its relations with China as a counterbalance to what it sees
as U.S. dominance in world affairs.

	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Driving rain squalls spawned by
powerful Hurricane Mitch forced churches to cancel Sunday services
and flooded streets in the Jamaican capital.
	   Under dark, menacing skies, seaports closed and buses and taxis
stayed off Kingston's streets as Mitch, swirled in the western
Caribbean Sea south of Jamaica. With 130-mph (215-kph) winds, Mitch
was a powerful Category 4 hurricane.
	   Prime Minister P.J. Patterson appealed for calm, shelters opened
and Jamaica's defense forces went on alert. Residents cleared
shelves of bakery items, batteries and other goods at the few
Kingston markets open Sunday.
	   A hurricane warning was also posted for eastern Cuba and a
hurricane watch was in effect for the tourist islands of the
Caymans. Colombia's tiny islands off Central America were also
threatened, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.
	   At 1800 GMT, Mitch was about 210 miles (360 kilometers)
south-southeast of Grand Cayman. Crawling west-northwest at 8 mph
(11 kph), its hurricane-force winds of at least 74 mph (118 kph)
extended 45 miles (75 kilometers) from the center.

Police detain pro-Kurdish party members in Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Riot police on Sunday detained hundreds
of members of a pro-Kurdish party after breaking up a demonstration
urging government to end a crackdown on Kurdish rebels, the
Anatolia news agency said.
	   Anatolia said police picked up around 483 people, including the
regional head of the pro-Kurdish People's Democracy Party, Mahmut
Sakar. It quoted police as saying demonstrators broke several
windows and damaged around 80 cars.
	   The party wants the government to join a truce declared by the
rebels on Sept. 1. The government rejected the truce, calling
instead for the rebels to surrender.
	   Earlier this month, police detained around 500 members of the
party to stop them from staging a similar rally.
	   The insurgents have been fighting for autonomy in the southeast
since 1984 in a war that has claimed 37,000 lives.

	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Five weeks after separatists declared a
cease-fire in their fight against Spain, Basque voters faced a
decision in regional elections Sunday to either reward the
pro-independence nationalists or support more mainstream parties.
	   Turnout was high among the 1.8 million registered voters despite
chilly, rainy weather in much of this picturesque, wealthy region
of northern Spain.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's is hoping heavy turnout will
give his center-right Popular Party and other non-nationalist
groups more clout in the Basque country to seek a lasting
settlement to one of Western Europe's last regional conflicts
without splitting Spain.
	   The armed separatist group ETA, whose name is a Basque-language
acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed nearly 800
people since 1968. It began its truce Sept. 18 making this the
first regional election held without a threat of violence.
	   A key question is how much support the cease-fire will attract
for the third-placed, pro-ETA Herri Batasuna party, which is
fielding candidates under a new coalition called Euskal
Herritarrok.
	   In a taped program broadcast Saturday by the British
Broadcasting Corporation, a hooded ETA leader insisted that its
truce offer ``was solid and serious'' but added that it had no
regrets for any of its actions.
	   A spokesman and top candidate of the pro-ETA party Herri
Batasuna, Arnaldo Otegi, said the truce meant ETA was committed to
ending the conflict and that it was up to the government to
negotiate. ``The ball is in the government's court,'' he told
reporters.

Twenty-Two candidates run for Bucharest mayor

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Turnout in Sunday's elections for
Bucharest mayor was so low that most likely they will have to be
repeated, Ion Ciopata, the head of the Central Election Burau said.
	   At 6 p.m. (1700 GMT), only 20.4 percent of the voters had cast
their ballot.
	   Speaking on private PRO TV, Ciopata said he would extend voting
until midnight (2300 GMT), but he had little hope the ballot would
be valid because at least half of those eligible to vote must
participate.
	   To win, a candidate needs to secure 50 percent of the vote.
	   While the degree of reluctance to go to the polls surpassed
expectations, turnout had been expected to be low, with many people
indicating they have lost confidence in the power of authorities to
do something for the benefit of ordinary people.
	   Commenting on the embarrassing turnout figure, Cristian Popescu,
a journalist, said, ``It's extremely serious, it means the loss of
belief in the democratic process.''
	   One woman and 21 men were competing to run this crowded city of
three million, plagued by housing problems, pollution and poor
infrastructure.
	   ``An enormous amount needs to be done. Bucharest still looks
untended, mediocre and Balkan,'' said Cornel Nistorescu, director
of the daily Evenimentul Zilei.
	   Mihai Pandelescu, a 46-year-old mathematics professor, 46, was
among the few who did vote.
	   He, too, was unhappy. ``We need better roads, it's an old
problem in Bucharest. Every two months I have to change the
ball-bearings of my car.''
	   Sunday's ballot became necessary when Bucharest's last elected
mayor Victor Ciorbea became prime minister in 1996. He resigned
from that job in April, quitting the post of mayor at the same
time.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin will meet with
international lenders, sign economic agreements, and discuss NATO
expansion during a one-day visit to Austria this week.
	   Yeltsin, dogged by health problems that forced him to cancel a
visit to Malaysia later this year, will meet Tuesday with Austrian
Chancellor Viktor Klima, the present holder of the rotating
European Union chairmanship.
	   The two are expected to discuss security issues, including the
recent Middle East peace agreement and the crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province.
	   The 67-year-old Yeltsin's trip had originally been announced as
a two-day visit. His latest illness, described as a respiratory
infection, forced him to cut short a visit to Central Asia last
week, and he has spent much of his time since then in country
residences.
	   Accompanied by high-level officials, including Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov, Yeltsin will
also meet with International Monetary Fund and World Bank officials
to debate economic assistance to Russia.
	   So far the IMF has been reluctant to release the next part of a
dlrs 22.6 billion loan package created for Russia earlier this
summer.
	   Russian delegates will sign a number of economic agreements that
should bring dlrs 600 million in direct investment to Russia, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The agreements include joint venture contracts, a program to
train Russian managers abroad and creating environmentally safe
sewage systems.
	   Yeltsin is expected to push for annulling export restrictions on
Russian goods to the EU, the Interfax news agency reported. He's
also meeting with Jacques Santer, chairman of the European
Commission.
	   Yeltsin has been weakened by recurring health problems in recent
years, including heart bypass surgery in 1996. He has kept an
increasingly low political profile since the latest economic crisis
hit in August, going to the Kremlin two or three days a week.
	   The president and his doctors insist that Yeltsin will serve out
the less than two years that remain of his term, and they deny that
he has serious health problems.

Jewish settlers protest accord; Netanyahu hails agreement

<TEXT>
	   OFRA, West Bank (AP) _ Jewish settlers, angered over a new
Mideast peace deal which gives more land to Palestinians, scuffled
with police and took to the streets across the West Bank Sunday in
protest over an agreement which they vowed to scuttle.
	   The road-block demonstrations came several hours before Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned to Israel hoping to convince
hardliners the deal he made with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
was the best possible.
	   Arriving back in Israel to a red-carpet welcome, the Israeli
leader said security concessions won from the Palestinians during
the nine-day summit outside Washington would justify the ceding of
more West Bank land.
	   ``We are returning after a long and difficult effort to bring
... security and peace to Israel,'' he said. ``We achieved such a
deal _ we achieved the best deal... We did something good for the
state of Israel.''
	   In Sunday's wide spread demonstrations including one outside of
Israel's international airport, following Netanyahu's arrival, at
least 20 settlers _ who were once Netanyahu's staunchest supporters
_ were arrested and two police officers were hurt.
	   ``With the Lord's help, we will use all of our powers to break
this agreement,'' said settler leader Ahron Dombe.
	   Near the settlement of Ofra north of Jerusalem, about 50
settlers and their supporters rushed past Israeli police and sat
cross-legged on the highway. Some settlers wrapped in prayer shawls
held morning services at the roadside.
	   Police also said settlers burned tires at the Karme Tsur
settlement north of Hebron.
	   ``I'm here to show that this is a sad day,'' said Natan El, 38,
an engineer, sitting in the middle of the main north-south highway
through the West Bank. ``We are in danger of losing our land, the
land we have returned to after 2,000 years.''
	   Tensions over the accord also boiled over in the West Bank town
of Ramallah, where infighting broke out among Arafat's supporters.
Members of the Palestinian leader's political faction, Fatah,
battled Palestinian security forces with rocks and bullets, leaving
two injured.
	   The confrontation broke out after Palestinian intelligence
agents searched Fatah headquarters, looking for illegal weapons. A
crackdown on unlicensed arms is one of the provisions of the
agreement.
	   in Israel, politicians across the board predicted Netanyahu
would face political turmoil as a result of the agreement when he
brings it before his right-wing Cabinet and the Israeli parliament
for approval Monday.
	   The agreement signed at the White House Friday calls for an
Israeli handover of 13.1 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian
civilian control. That means some Jewish settlements will be
surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory, except for access
roads.
	   Twelve hardliners in Netanyahu's government say they will vote
against him in upcoming no-confidence motions. Even Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon, who leads the right-wing camp in Netanyahu's
government and helped forge the agreement, said the withdrawal
endangered Israel's security and would not reveal how he would vote
on the deal.
	   Netanyahu has only a one-seat majority.
	   Hoping to calm settler fears, the premier made overtures to the
settler community, but they mostly went unheard.
	   ``I say now here to our friends listening, you are us, you are
us and we are you. We love you and we are fighting for you and
there is no other government that will fight like this,'' Netanyahu
said, mentioning settler leader Dombe by name.
	   ``I am very, very, very disappointed with the prime minister and
the ministers who participated in this deal,'' Dombe said after the
premier's speech. ``Netanyahu is no longer the leader of our
national camp.'' Dombe said his staff would begin opinion samplings
among settlers Monday in search of a candidate to challenge
Netanyahu.
	   In a another development, the militant Palestinian Islamic Jihad
group said its leader in the Gaza Strip had been arrested as part
of a renewed crackdown by Arafat's police on militants. in a
statement, faxed to news agencies, the group said dozens of its
members had been taken into custody.
	   The larger Hamas group also announced that one its West Bank
leaders was under arrest and being held in a Palestinian jail.

Internal Palestinian clash stemming from accord leaves two hurt

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ In a major rupture within Yasser
Arafat's ranks, members of the Palestinian leader's political
faction fought Palestinian security forces with rocks and bullets
Sunday. A 16-year old Fatah activist was killed in the violence.
	   The fighting followed a move by Palestinian military
intelligence to seize unlicensed weapons and inspect files
belonging to Arafat's Fatah faction. A crackdown on illegal arms
was among tough new security measures Arafat agreed to at last
week's Israeli-Palestinian summit.
	   Former Cabinet minister Hanan Ashrawi, who was present when the
clash began in the West Bank town of Ramallah, called it a result
of an accord that put too much emphasis on Israeli security at
Palestinian expense.
	   ``This is very dangerous,'' she said. ``If this situation is
allowed to continue we would be facing an internal breakdown.''
	   The fighting broke out as Marwan Barghouti, the Fatah leader in
the West Bank, was addressing a group of about 100 supporters
outside the Palestinian Authority headquarters and the offices of
Governor Mustafa Isa.
	   Some of the Fatah activists picked up stones and hurled them
over a fence into the compound and at plainclothes intelligence
agents who were watching the gathering from the sidelines,
witnesses said.
	   Intelligence agents hurled rocks back at the crowd. But then
some of the security agents fired from the second- and third-floor
windows, with some of the gunfire directed into the crowd. About
the same time, armed Fatah members arrived on the scene, firing
shots into the air.
	   Two men were hurt, including a Fatah activist, 16-year old
Wassim Tarifi, who suffered a gunshot wound to the head. Tarifi, a
nephew of a Palestinian lawmaker, was taken to Jerusalem's Hadassah
hospital, and died several hours later of his wound, said hospital
spokeswoman Yael Bossem-Levy.
	   His injury silenced the gunfire on both sides, and leaders from
both sides quickly withdrew for a meeting.
	   A senior Fatah official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the confrontation followed a search Saturday night of Fatah
headquarters by about 50 members of Palestinian intelligence.
Fistfights broke out as the searchers went through files and looked
for unlicensed weapons, the official said.
	   Barghouti told reporters that police confiscated several weapons
but refused to elaborate.
	   Some Fatah activists said the confrontation was exacerbated by a
personal feud between the commander of the raiding party and two
Fatah members.
	   Fatah called a three-day strike in Ramallah to protest the
violence, and graffiti denouncing the intelligence agents as
``traitors'' appeared on walls near where the clash took place.
	   The fighting occurred entirely in Palestinian-controlled areas,
and Israeli troops were not involved.

<TEXT>
	   MALPENSA, Italy (AP) _ Italy's controversial new international
air hub opened in chaos Sunday with delays, demonstrations and an
escalator breakdown that sent grumbling passengers slogging three
up flights of stairs to departure gates.
	   Flights delays of four hours or more were reported at the
revamped Malpensa 2000 airport outside Milan. The baggage claim
system was in chaos.
	   ``The worst has passed,'' the head of the airport authority,
Giuseppe Bonomi, told a news conference Sunday afternoon, admitting
a ``series of dysfunctions.''
	   ``We're getting a grip on things,'' he said.
	   The airport teemed with frustrated passengers and there were
huge lines for check-in, boarding, security, baggage, shuttle buses
and just about everything else, ANSA said.
	   Adding to the misery was an hour-and-a-half breakdown on he
escalator traveling the three floors between check-in and departure
gates. Waits for the elevator, the only alternative to climbing,
were as much as 20 minutes, the ANSA news agency said.
	   The escalator snafu was especially galling because Malpensa's
design has been touted as one so compact travelers would have to
walk a maximum of 180 meters (590 feet) to reach their planes.
	   A shortage of buses to take passengers from the gates to the
planes also slowed things down as did a demonstration by
environmentalists which blocked the road to the airport for 30
minutes, ANSA said. And one passenger had to be carried aboard a
flight because the airport lacked special equipment to accommodate
people in wheelchairs.
	   In Switzerland, Swissair spokesman Jean-Claude Donzel said the
chaotic situation forced Swissair to cancel two flights at Malpensa
on Sunday, a Zurich-Malpensa-Zurich run.
	   ``Nothing works down there,'' he said. ``There are not enough
parking places for planes.''
	   A total of 634 flights had been scheduled to use Malpensa
Sunday, but ANSA said airlines had reduced the number to 500.
	   Virtually every flight at Malpensa was late, with the average
delay at about two hours, Bonomi said, and some people had to wait
at least an hour for their baggage.
	   Malpensa has been dogged by controversy from the outset, in part
because of it is much further from Milan than the old hub, Linate.
	   The European Commission, concerned by the lack of good rail and
road links, gave Italy the green light to shift flights to Malpensa
only last week.
	   About half the passengers at Malpensa had to transfer from
domestic flights at Linate, which involved long waits for a shuttle
bus that operated at irregular intervals on Sunday.
	   The location is also a sore point with airport employees.
	   Some 2,400 airport workers had threatened to strike on opening
day to protest the cost and difficulty of getting to work. Air
traffic controllers had also threatened to strike over what they
say are inadequate radar.
	   Malpensa is 53 kilometers (33 miles) from the center of Milan,
compared to 10 kilometers (6 miles) for Linate, and a high-speed
rail link won't be finished until some time in the next century.
The Milan-Malpensa highway is being widened, but the work won't be
complete until next year.
	   With double the number of gates and check-in counters as Linate,
Malpensa is expected to handle 18 million passengers a year
compared to Linate's 10 million and 58 flights an hour compared to
Linate's 32.

Italy's Capirossi wins 1998 250-cc championship; Doohan takes
</HEADLINE>
500-cc race &QL; 
 &UR; By KEVIN GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Italy's Loris Capirossi won the
1998 250-cc world championship Sunday with a second-place finish in
the Argentine Gran Prix.
	   Fellow countryman Valentino Rossi won the season's final race,
but Capirossi's strong showing gave him twenty points and the top
spot in the year's final standings.
	   Australian Michael Doohan capped off a championship winning
season in the 500-cc race, with another dominating performance in
the year's final race. He was never challenged as he paced the
entire race.
	   Doohan, who sat in the pole position, led the 21-rider pack by
as much as five seconds. He finished the 27-lap race in a time of
47 minutes and 7.332 seconds, ahead of Japan's Tadayuki Okada.
	   The victory gave Doohan 260 points in the season's final
standings, ahead of Italy's Massimiliano Biaggi who finished with
208. Spain's Alex Criville followed with 198 points.
	   Doohan captured the season championship - his fifth consecutive
- with a victory earlier this month at the Australian Gran Prix.
	   The 250-cc race provided all of the day's excitement as all eyes
were on Capirossi and Japan's Tetsuya Harada who were battling for
the season's championship.
	   Coming into the race, Capirossi held a slim four point advantage
over Harada in the standings.
	   The two riders swapped the top two positions most of the 25-lap
race, looking to overtake one another at every turn.
	   Capirossi lead most of the race. But Harada snatched the lead
back on the 22nd lap. Seconds later, the Italian rider sped by him
to move back into the top position heading into the race's final
laps.
	   But Rossi, who had been riding in third, overtook the
second-place Harada on the next lap.
	   Rossi took the lead away from Capirossi on the race's final lap.
	   And Capirossi and Harada were left to resume their battle for
the year's championship.
	   Harada then passed Capirossi, pushing him back to third place.
	   Going into the final turn, Capirossi moved up behind Harada to
pass him on his right. Harada stayed high, but seeing his
challenger making his move, he moved his bike over, trying to close
the line.
	   Capirossi slipped by, catching the side of the Japanese rider's
motorcycle. Harada's Aprilia bike fell to the ground and spun out
into the dirt.
	   As Capirossi rode on to the championship, Harada threw his
gloves to the ground in disgust.
	   Capriossi finished the year with 224 points. Rossi's victory
catapulted him into second, and Harada dropped to third.
	   Rossi's victory, in a time of 44 minutes and 26.581 seconds,
helped him win rookie of the year honors.

Kyrgyz president visits Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The president of the Central Asian nation of
Kyrgyzstan arrived in Japan on Sunday for informal talks on
investment and economic relations, a news agency reported.
	   Askar Akayev is to meet Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi,
Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura, the head of Japan's Export-Import
Bank, Hiroshi Yasuda, and Japanese businessmen, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Akayev last visited Japan in 1993.
	   Akayev's impoverished agricultural nation has seen minimal
economic development since Kyrgyzstan gained independence with the
1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. Japan, one of the biggest
investors in Central Asia, has given Kyrgyzstan millions of dollars
in grants and credits since 1991.

Two Albanian refugees boats collide, 6 die

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with new death, survivor toll &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A dinghy carrying 25 Albanian refugees headed for
Italy collided with another small boat, exploded and sank during
the night. Officials said Sunday that six people died and 20
survived.
	   In Tirana, an Albanian Interior Ministry spokesman said the
bodies of two women and a baby girl had been recovered and three
other bodies had been spotted.
	   The spokesman, Artan Bizhga, said 20 other people survived.
	   The Italian news agency ANSA quoted Italian officials as saying
some of the survivors were rescued by passing boats, while others
apparently managed to swim to shore.
	   One survivor told ANSA in Vlora that the dinghy collided with a
small wooden boat returning nearly empty from a people-smuggling
run to Italy.
	   ``We heard a huge blow and then an explosion. Immediately after
that we found ourselves in the water,'' 27-year-old Aida Mustafaraj
told ANSA.
	   Mustafaraj said she stayed afloat on a piece of debris until a
passing boat picked her up, along with her child.
	   The accident happened off Sazen Island near the Albanian port
city of Vlora at around 2030 gmt Saturday, Bizgha said. The first
reports emerged on Sunday.
	   There is constant traffic across the Adriatic from Albania to
Italy, a favorite destination for Albanians fleeing their troubled
Balkan homeland. On some weekends, Italian authorities intercept
hundreds of would-be immigrants.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ In a major rupture within Yasser
Arafat's ranks, members of the Palestinian leader's political
faction fought Palestinian security forces with rocks and bullets
Sunday. A 16-year old Fatah activist was killed in the violence.
	   The fighting followed a move by Palestinian military
intelligence to seize unlicensed weapons and inspect files
belonging to Arafat's Fatah faction. A crackdown on illegal arms
was among tough new security measures Arafat agreed to at last
week's Israeli-Palestinian summit.
	   Former Cabinet minister Hanan Ashrawi, who was present when the
clash began in the West Bank town of Ramallah, called it a result
of an accord that put too much emphasis on Israeli security at
Palestinian expense.
	   ``This is very dangerous,'' she said. ``If this situation is
allowed to continue we would be facing an internal breakdown.''
	   The fighting broke out as Marwan Barghouti, the Fatah leader in
the West Bank, was addressing a group of about 100 supporters
outside the Palestinian Authority headquarters and the offices of
Governor Mustafa Isa.
	   Some of the Fatah activists picked up stones and hurled them
over a fence into the compound and at plainclothes intelligence
agents who were watching the gathering from the sidelines,
witnesses said.
	   Intelligence agents hurled rocks back at the crowd. But then
some of the security agents fired from the second- and third-floor
windows, with some of the gunfire directed into the crowd. About
the same time, armed Fatah members arrived on the scene, firing
shots into the air.
	   Two men were hurt, including a Fatah activist, 16-year old
Wassim Tarifi, who suffered a gunshot wound to the head. Tarifi, a
nephew of a Palestinian lawmaker, was taken to Jerusalem's Hadassah
hospital, and died several hours later of his wound, said hospital
spokeswoman Yael Bossem-Levy.
	   His injury silenced the gunfire on both sides, and leaders from
both sides quickly withdrew for a meeting.
	   A senior Fatah official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the confrontation followed a search Saturday night of Fatah
headquarters by about 50 members of Palestinian intelligence.
Fistfights broke out as the searchers went through files and looked
for unlicensed weapons, the official said.
	   Barghouti told reporters that police confiscated several weapons
but refused to elaborate. Barghouti later said the police officers
who shot at the crowd, should be ``tried and executed.'' But Isa,
speaking on behalf of the Palestinian Authority, said the officers
would likely be prosecuted and jailed.
	   Some Fatah activists said the confrontation was exacerbated by a
personal feud between the commander of the raiding party and two
Fatah members.
	   Fatah called a three-day strike in Ramallah to protest the
violence, and graffiti denouncing the intelligence agents as
``traitors'' appeared on walls near where the clash took place.
	   The fighting occurred entirely in Palestinian-controlled areas,
and Israeli troops were not involved.

	   CIUDAD VICTORIA, Mexico (AP) _ Opposition groups struggled to
overcome alleged overspending and gift-giving by Mexico's governing
party ahead of Sunday's gubernatorial election in the northern
border state of Tamaulipas.
	   Election officials described turnout as medium in the hours
after polls opened Sunday.
	   Tomas Yarrington, candidate of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, held a substantial lead in pre-election polls
over his two rivals, Gustavo Cardenas of the conservative National
Action Party, and Joaquin Hernandez of the left-center Democratic
Revolution Party.
	   The ruling party, known as the PRI, has won four of the six
gubernatorial elections held so far this year. It has held the
presidency and most state houses without interruption for 69 years
and many say this year's elections give a preview of its chances in
the 2000 presidential race.
	   Frustrated by the poverty and lack of public services in the
state, Diana Luis Sosa traveled from a poor neighborhood outside
Ciudad Victoria, the state capital, to vote for an opposition
candidate, Cardenas.
	   ``Every time it rains, our neighborhood gets flooded. We can't
have much furniture, because the water will ruin it,'' she said.
	   Debate in the Tamaulipas race _ in which 1.61 million registered
voters will also elect the state Congress and 43 mayors _ has
shifted in recent weeks from unemployment, poverty and
infrastructure problems to accusations that the PRI spent more than
the 23 million pesos (dlrs 2.3 million) campaign limit and
distributed food to potential voters.
	   Handing out food is not illegal, but opposition officials and
local residents suspect that government money was used.
	   Yarrington, who has campaigned on a platform of economic
development and job creation, has denied the accusations of
overspending.
	   No major problems were reported Sunday, but opposition parties
described other incidents, supposedly involving free food or
transportation given to potential voters in violation of election
rules.
	   Both opposition candidates have focused their campaigns on
fighting the corruption they say is rampant in state government.
	   All three candidates agree the state needs more foreign
investment, but also must improve conditions in the border cities
already crowded with assembly-for-export plants known as
maquiladoras.
	   Cardenas pledged to provide basic services to the sprawling
slums of border cities like Matamoros, where many maquiladora
workers live.
	   Hernandez has focused on pledges to improve law enforcement to
stop rising crime.

Jewish settlers protest accord; Netanyahu hails agreement

	   OFRA, West Bank (AP) _ Jewish settlers, angered over a new
Mideast peace deal that gives more land to Palestinians, scuffled
with police and demonstrated across the West Bank Sunday to protest
an agreement they vowed to scuttle.
	   The road-block demonstrations came several hours before Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned to Israel hoping to convince
hard-liners the deal he made with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
was the best possible.
	   Arriving back in Israel to a red-carpet welcome, the Israeli
leader said security concessions won from the Palestinians during
the nine-day summit outside Washington would justify the ceding of
more West Bank land.
	   ``We are returning after a long and difficult effort to bring
... security and peace to Israel,'' he said. ``We achieved such a
deal _ we achieved the best deal... We did something good for the
state of Israel.''
	   The agreement signed at the White House Friday calls for an
Israeli handover of 13.1 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian
civilian control. That means some Jewish settlements will be
surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory, except for access
roads.
	   In Sunday's wide spread demonstrations including one outside of
Israel's international airport, following Netanyahu's arrival, at
least 20 settlers _ who were once Netanyahu's staunchest supporters
_ were arrested and two police officers were hurt.
	   ``With the Lord's help, we will use all of our powers to break
this agreement,'' said settler leader Ahron Dombe.
	   Near the settlement of Ofra north of Jerusalem, about 50
settlers and their supporters rushed past Israeli police and sat
cross-legged on the highway. Some settlers wrapped in prayer shawls
held morning services at the roadside.
	   Police also said settlers burned tires at the Karme Tsur
settlement north of Hebron.
	   ``I'm here to show that this is a sad day,'' said Natan El, 38,
an engineer, sitting in the middle of the main north-south highway
through the West Bank. ``We are in danger of losing our land, the
land we have returned to after 2,000 years.''
	   Tensions over the accord also boiled over in the West Bank town
of Ramallah, where infighting broke out among Arafat's supporters.
Members of the Palestinian leader's political faction, Fatah,
battled Palestinian security forces with rocks and bullets, leaving
one dead and another injured.
	   The confrontation broke out after Palestinian intelligence
agents searched Fatah headquarters, looking for illegal weapons. A
crackdown on unlicensed arms is one of the provisions of the
agreement.
	   In Israel, politicians across the board predicted Netanyahu
would face political turmoil as a result of the agreement when he
brings it before his right-wing Cabinet and the Israeli parliament
for approval Monday.
	   Twelve hard-liners in Netanyahu's government say they will vote
against him in upcoming no-confidence motions. Even Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon, who leads the right-wing camp in Netanyahu's
government and helped forge the agreement, said the withdrawal
endangered Israel's security and would not reveal how he would vote
on the deal.
	   Netanyahu has only a one-seat majority.
	   The premier made overtures to the settler community, but they
mostly went unheard.
	   ``I say now here to our friends listening, you are us, you are
us and we are you. We love you and we are fighting for you and
there is no other government that will fight like this,'' Netanyahu
said, mentioning settler leader Dombe by name.
	   ``I am very, very, very disappointed with the prime minister and
the ministers who participated in this deal,'' Dombe said after the
premier's speech. ``Netanyahu is no longer the leader of our
national camp.'' Dombe said his staff would begin opinion samplings
among settlers Monday in search of a candidate to challenge
Netanyahu.
	   In another development, the militant Palestinian Islamic Jihad
group said its leader in the Gaza Strip had been arrested as part
of a renewed crackdown by Arafat's police on militants. In a
statement, faxed to news agencies, the group said dozens of its
members had been taken into custody.
	   The larger Hamas group also announced that one its West Bank
leaders was under arrest and being held in a Palestinian jail.

Ajax still out of form but goals keep flowing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Ajax Amsterdam still doesn't look
good but, at least in the league, the end product is fine. It
downed Cambuur Leeuwarden 4-0 Sunday without breaking sweat.
	   But Ronald de Boer did have a good day, heading the first goal
from a corner then pin-pointing Brazilian Wamberto and Georgian
Shota Arveladze with crosses for the second and third. Peter
Hoekstra scrambled the fourth.
	   Ajax (6-2-2) moved to third on 20 points but unbeaten Feyenoord
still leads the league with 23 points and a game in hand, after
coming back to down FC Utrecht 3-2 in a match of 59 fouls.
	   Jean-Paul van Gastel celebrated his return from a four-game
suspension with two vital goals for the Rotterdammers, both from
free-kicks driven low past the wall.
	   Defender and captain Mitchell van der Gaag scored Utrecht's
first goal with a diving header but was later sent off for the foul
on Julio Ricardo Cruz.
	   John de Jong scored Utrecht's second and Bonaventure Kalou
netted for Feyenoord after an error from keeper Frank Kooiman.
	   In the bottom half of the table, Bobby Robson's embattled PSV
Eindhoven fell to 12th after its fourth defeat, this time a 4-2
hammering at Brabant neighbour Willem II Tilburg.
	   Willem II took the lead after Marcel Valk seized on a high
bouncing ball, used his body to beat Dmitri Khokhlov and nudged the
ball over the advancing Ronald Waterreus.
	   PSV struck back with a snapshot from Luc Nilis but Adil Ramzi
netted either side of the break to make it 3-1. Ruud van Nistelrooy
pulled one back for PSV but Gambian Jatto Ceesay hit the Willem II
fourth.
	   Sunday's other game saw SC Heerenveen drop from fourth to sixth
after a 3-1 loss at Sparta Rotterdam.
	   The weekend's most eventful game was Roda JC Kerkrade's 5-3
victory in Friday's Limburg derby with Fortuna Sittard, which
contained a red card and three penalties.

Arafat's ranks, members of the Palestinian leader's political

The schooling of David Reid continues in victory over Coker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN CURRAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ Junior middleweight David Reid,
the 1996 Olympic gold medalist who has won all 11 of his pro
fights, learned a little about adversity en route to his latest
triumph.
	   Reid survived a severe cut over his right eye and two late-round
knockdowns to post a unanimous decision Saturday night over
previoulsy unbeaten James ``Cowboy'' Coker.
	   ``It's a good lesson,'' said Al Mitchell, his manager and
mentor. ``He went 12 rounds. He's gotta' understand he can't knock
everybody out.''
	   Coker, a left-hander who held the Continental Americas super
welterweight title, posed problems for Reid with his style.
	   ``He was awkward,'' Reid said. ``He leaned over to his left so
that if I threw my right, he'd miss it. And he was standing in a
certain position and smothering my punches.''
	   Reid controlled the fight, but still faced challenges.
	   In the third round, an accidental head-butt by Coker opened a
deep cut over Reid's right eye. The blood from it covered his whole
eye socket and threatened to put an early end to the bout, since
Reid's left eye was already swollen shut.
	   But Fred Jenkins tended to the cut between rounds, and Reid
wasn't bothered by it the rest of the fight.
	   In the 11th, Coker hit Reid with a left that didn't seem
particularly powerful, but Reid either slipped or lost his balance
and went down.
	   In the 12th, Coker drilled him with another left that dropped
Reid again. But Reid owned the round otherwise, just as he did the
11th.
	   ``It was more than a slip,'' Reid said of the first knockdown.
``His glove hit me and and I got knocked down.''
	   Judge Ron Greenley scored it 118-110, judge John Poturely
119-111 and judge Paul Venti 117-111. Reid won 115-111 on The AP's
card.
	   Coker dropped to 20-1.

Arafat wants accurate, faithful implementation of peace deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Arafat in Algeria and Morocco in 6th graf; ADDS
Kuwait comment in last graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Sunday
he hoped the new Israeli-Palestinian peace accord would be
``accurately and faithfully'' implemented to truly push forward the
Middle East peace process.
	   Arafat's comment, made at Cairo airport after briefing President
Hosni Mubarak on the accord, reflects Arab skepticism that Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will live up to the agreement to
withdraw from a further 13 percent of West Bank land.
	   The Palestinian leader met with Mubarak at the Unity
presidential palace in Cairo. The two talked briefly alone, then
were joined by aides. The session last one hour and 15 minutes.
	   Neither Arafat nor Mubarak spoke to reporters after the meeting,
but Arafat later told reporters just before he departed for Algeria
that the implementation of the deal was what counted.
	   He expressed hope that the agreement would be ``accurately and
faithfully implemented so that we can say that we have pushed
forward the peace process and protected the peace of the courageous
people.''
	   Arafat also briefed officials in Algeria on the new pact Sunday.
He then flew to Morocco and was to travel later to Saudi Arabia.
	   The agreement, signed Friday after marathon U.S.-mediated
negotiations, call for Arafat to clamp stringent security measures
on Palestinian militants to prevent attacks on Israelis in exchange
for the Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   Many in the Arab world have criticized the pact as geared too
much toward Israel's security demands and too little toward
Palestinian rights.
	   Mubarak, who in the past has mediated between Israel and the
Palestinians, has cautiously welcomed the agreement but also
questioned whether Netanyahu would implement all its parts.
	   In remarks Saturday, he accused Netanyahu of failing to live up
to past peace deals. Of the six points in the 1997 Hebron accord,
he said, ``only two points were implemented while the other four
were ignored.''
	   Also Sunday, the Cairo-based Arab League welcomed the agreement
as ``an important step,'' in the peace process. It called for using
the ``impetus of this agreement'' to conclude a final peace treaty
that would allow for the establishment of a Palestinian state.
	   In Kuwait, the Cabinet issued a statement saying it hoped the
agreement would move forward the peace process in a way to protect
the rights of the Palestinian people. It also urged new steps in
Israel's peace talks with Syria and Lebanon.

Belgrade offers food to Russia in exchange for fuel oil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Yugoslav capital may offer Russia food
supplies and construction services in exchange for fuel oil, a
Russian news agency reported Sunday.
	   A delegation of Belgrade officials just visited Moscow and the
two capitals expect to reach an agreement within a month on future
cooperation, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Spasoje Krunic, head
of Belgrade's city council, as saying.
	   Officials from both cities discussed supplies of 100,000 tons of
Russian fuel oil to Yugoslavia, and Yugoslav food shipments and
construction efforts in Moscow, he said.
	   Yugoslav contractors have built or renovated many buildings
across Moscow in recent years, including Russia's Central Bank
headquarters, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Russia and Serbia, the dominant republic remaining in
Yugoslavia, share Slavic roots and the Orthodox Christian religion.
Russia has fiercely opposed NATO's proposed airstrikes on the
Serbian province of Kosovo to halt a crackdown on mostly Muslim
ethnic Albanians.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Waving flags and shouting secular slogans,
millions of Turks took to the streets Sunday to celebrate the
republic's 75th anniversary and stage a show of force against
Islamic politics.
	   ``Turkey is secular and will remain so,'' hundreds of thousands
of chanted the capital marching to the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal
Ataturk, who founded Turkey as a secular republic the collapse of
the Ottoman empire.
	   The military, the self-appointed guardians of the secular
system, showed its presence in the march with thousands of
uniformed officers.
	   Aiming to create a modern state, Ataturk curtailed religion's
place in society and made secularism the official ideology.
	   Today, a widening divide between those determined to preserve
the secular tradition and supporters of an Islamic political
movement is a source of tension.
	   The tension reached a peak when an Islamic-led government was
pressured into resignation last year by the military. The Islamic
party was later disbanded for anti-secularism.
	   Sunday's nationwide marches were a response to demonstrations
this month by thousands protesting a ban on Islamic-style head
scarves at universities. The official anniversary of the republic
is on Thursday.

Ajax still out of form but goals keep flowing

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Ajax Amsterdam downed Cambuur
Leeuwarden 4-0 Sunday without breaking sweat, moving into third
place in the Netherland's premier league.
	   Ronald de Boer had a good day, heading the first goal from a
corner then pin-pointing Brazilian Wamberto and Georgian Shota
Arveladze with crosses for the second and third. Peter Hoekstra
scrambled the fourth.
	   Ajax (6-2-2) moved to third on 20 points but unbeaten Feyenoord
still leads the league with 23 points and a game in hand, after
coming back to down FC Utrecht 3-2 in a match of 59 fouls.
	   Jean-Paul van Gastel celebrated his return from a four-game
suspension with two vital goals for the Rotterdammers, both from
free-kicks driven low past the wall.
	   Defender and captain Mitchell van der Gaag scored Utrecht's
first goal with a diving header but was later sent off for the foul
on Julio Ricardo Cruz.
	   John de Jong scored Utrecht's second and Bonaventure Kalou
netted for Feyenoord after an error from keeper Frank Kooiman.
	   In the bottom half of the table, Bobby Robson's embattled PSV
Eindhoven fell to 12th after its fourth defeat, this time a 4-2
hammering at Brabant neighbour Willem II Tilburg.
	   Willem II took the lead after Marcel Valk seized on a high
bouncing ball, used his body to beat Dmitri Khokhlov and nudged the
ball over the advancing Ronald Waterreus.
	   PSV struck back with a snapshot from Luc Nilis but Adil Ramzi
netted either side of the break to make it 3-1. Ruud van Nistelrooy
pulled one back for PSV but Gambian Jatto Ceesay hit the Willem II
fourth.
	   Sunday's other game saw SC Heerenveen drop from fourth to sixth
after a 3-1 loss at Sparta Rotterdam.
	   The weekend's most eventful game was Roda JC Kerkrade's 5-3
victory in Friday's Limburg derby with Fortuna Sittard, which
contained a red card and three penalties.

Bomb damages tax office; no injuries

<TEXT>
	   PIRAEUS, Greece (AP) _ A time bomb exploded outside a government
tax office Sunday, causing damage but no injuries, police said.
	   The blast in the port of Piraeus, about 10 kilometers (six
miles) from central Athens, was the latest in a year-long series of
arson and bombing attacks aimed at government offices and foreign
targets such as businesses and diplomatic cars.
	   A variety of leftist and anarchist groups have claimed
responsibility for the attacks, which have caused no deaths and
only a few minor injuries.
	   An anonymous caller to an Athens newspaper gave advance warning
to the Piraeus blast. The bomb _ dynamite connected to a timer _
went off about 15 minutes later, police said.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility following the
blast.

NATO generals end talks with Yugoslav political, military leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two top NATO generals left here
Sunday after two days of talks in which they pressured Yugoslav
political and military leaders for further troop withdrawals from
Kosovo, a diplomatic source said.
	   Gen. Wesley Clark, the alliance's supreme military commander in
Europe, and German Gen. Klaus Naumann, chairman of the NATO
military committee, met Saturday with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic before talking to the military, NATO officials said.
	   There was no word on their Sunday schedule in Belgrade.
	   Both the Alliance and the Yugoslav army remained tight-lipped
about the meetings, but a diplomatic source speaking on condition
of anonymity said that NATO wanted to let the Yugoslavs know they
must do more in withdrawing military and special police units in
Kosovo back to their barracks.
	   The Alliance has given the Yugoslav president until Tuesday to
do so.
	   A terse official announcement released Sunday evening in
Belgrade said Milosevic met with the two NATO generals, together
with the Yugoslav army chief of staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic and head
of Serbian Interior Ministry's pblic security, Vlastimir
Djordjevic.
	   It only said they discussed ``security issues'' in Kosovo,
adding Milosevic emphasized that ``measures taken by state bodies
represent a firm foundation for further peaceful development and
for security of all citizens in Kosovo which is of crucial
importance for a successful political process.''
	   The Serbian-led Yugoslav government insists that it is abiding
by the terms of the Oct. 12 agreement to defuse the crisis and
recall the units sent to Kosovo during his crackdown on ethnic
Albanian militants, who demand independence for the majority
Albanian province. It blames the Albanians for the continued,
scattered clashes.

	   OFRA, West Bank (AP) _ Jewish settlers, angered over a new
Mideast peace deal which gives more land to Palestinians, scuffled
with police and took to the streets across the West Bank Sunday in
protest over an agreement which they vowed to scuttle.
	   The road-block demonstrations came several hours before Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned to Israel hoping to convince
hardliners the deal he made with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
was the best possible.
	   Arriving back in Israel to a red-carpet welcome, the Israeli
leader said security concessions won from the Palestinians during
the nine-day summit outside Washington would justify the ceding of
more West Bank land.
	   ``We are returning after a long and difficult effort to bring
... security and peace to Israel,'' he said. ``We achieved such a
deal _ we achieved the best deal... We did something good for the
state of Israel.''
	   In Sunday's wide spread demonstrations including one outside of
Israel's international airport, following Netanyahu's arrival, at
least 20 settlers _ who were once Netanyahu's staunchest supporters
_ were arrested and two police officers were hurt.
	   ``With the Lord's help, we will use all of our powers to break
this agreement,'' said settler leader Ahron Dombe. Settler leaders
said they would channel their efforts into intense lobbying Monday
before legislators vote on a no-confidence motion against
Netanyahu.
	   Near the settlement of Ofra north of Jerusalem, about 50
settlers and their supporters rushed past Israeli police and sat
cross-legged on the highway. Some settlers wrapped in prayer shawls
held morning services at the roadside.
	   Police also said settlers burned tires at the Karme Tsur
settlement north of Hebron.
	   ``I'm here to show that this is a sad day,'' said Natan El, 38,
an engineer, sitting in the middle of the main north-south highway
through the West Bank. ``We are in danger of losing our land, the
land we have returned to after 2,000 years.''
	   Tensions over the accord also boiled over in the West Bank town
of Ramallah, where infighting broke out among Arafat's supporters.
Members of the Palestinian leader's political faction, Fatah,
battled Palestinian security forces with rocks and bullets. One 16
year-old youth shot in the head, later died of his wounds in a
Jerusalem hospital.
	   The confrontation broke out after Palestinian intelligence
agents searched Fatah headquarters, looking for illegal weapons. A
crackdown on unlicensed arms is one of the provisions of the
agreement.
	   In Israel, politicians across the board predicted Netanyahu
would face political turmoil as a result of the agreement when he
brings it before his right-wing Cabinet Monday.
	   The agreement signed at the White House Friday calls for an
Israeli handover of 13.1 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian
civilian control. That means some Jewish settlements will be
surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory, except for access
roads.
	   Twelve hardliners in Netanyahu's government say they will vote
against him in upcoming no-confidence motions. Even Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon, who leads the right-wing camp in Netanyahu's
government and helped forge the agreement, said the withdrawal
endangered Israel's security and would not reveal how he would vote
on the deal.
	   Netanyahu has only a one-seat majority.
	   Hoping to calm settler fears, the premier made overtures to the
settler community, but they mostly went unheard.
	   ``I say now here to our friends listening, you are us, you are
us and we are you. We love you and we are fighting for you and
there is no other government that will fight like this,'' Netanyahu
said, mentioning settler leader Dombe by name.
	   ``I am very, very, very disappointed with the prime minister and
the ministers who participated in this deal,'' Dombe said after the
premier's speech. ``Netanyahu is no longer the leader of our
national camp.'' Dombe said his staff would begin opinion samplings
among settlers Monday in search of a candidate to challenge
Netanyahu.
	   In a another development, the militant Palestinian Islamic Jihad
group said its leader in the Gaza Strip had been arrested as part
of a renewed crackdown by Arafat's police on militants. in a
statement, faxed to news agencies, the group said dozens of its
members had been taken into custody.
	   The larger Hamas group also announced that one its West Bank
leaders was under arrest and being held in a Palestinian jail.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ With a harsh austerity package to
be unveiled this week, voters on Sunday elected a key ally of
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso in Brazil's most important
state, exit polls showed.
	   An poll by the organization Ibope showed Sao Paulo state Gov.
Mario Covas was re-elected with 56 percent of the vote, while
two-time former governor Paulo Maluf had 44 percent.
	   The support for Covas, a frugal administrator and personal
friend of Cardoso, is a tremendous boost for the president as he
seeks to extricate Brazil from the global financial crisis.

Bomb blast kills head of Chechnya's anti-kidnapping division

 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechnya's top anti-kidnapping official
was killed Sunday when a bomb tore his car to pieces on the day he
was to launch a major offensive on hostage-takers in the breakaway
republic.
	   Shadid Bargishev's two bodyguards were in critical condition
after suffering serious injuries in the explosion, and several
passersby were also injured, doctors said.
	   Bargishev, 27, died on the operating table after losing both
legs in the blast in the parking lot of the anti-kidnapping
department office in the Chechen capital of Grozny, Chechen
President Aslan Maskhadov's office said in a statement.
	   The remote-controlled bomb was planted just inside the gate to
the parking lot, the Interfax news agency said.
	   The explosion came as law enforcement officials were preparing a
large operation to rescue people kidnapped in Chechnya. Bargishev's
colleagues insisted they would not be intimidated by the attack and
would go ahead with their offensive.
	   Security was stepped up around Chechnya after the explosion,
with police posted on major highways and large cities, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Other anti-kidnapping officials blamed the attack on Bargishev's
recent success in securing the release of several hostages,
including 24 Russian soldiers and an English couple.
	   ``The accident is a result of the work of the (anti-kidnapping)
department,'' said Husein Zabrailov, an investigator who worked
with Bargishev.
	   More than 100 people are still being held captive in Chechnya,
including three Britons, a New Zealander and a Turk, according to
Interfax.
	   Soon after the blast, several Grozny residents came to a local
emergency clinic to donate blood to save Bargishev, Interfax said.
	   Maskhadov expressed his condolences, saying Chechnya ``will
never forget its true sons.''
	   ``The terrorist act plays into the hands of those ... trying to
show that (local) law enforcement bodies are incapable of ensuring
order in Chechnya,'' he said, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   The Chechen president also ordered law enforcement officials
Sunday to step up efforts against criminal groups, giving them
permission to ``destroy bandits on the spot'' if they resist,
Maskhadov's office said.
	   Chechnya, where rebels fought a bloody independence war against
Russia in 1994-96, conducts its own affairs and has seen a sharp
rise in violent crime and hostage-taking, usually by criminal gangs
for ransom.
	   Most of the recent hostage releases have been facilitated by
Russian financier Boris Berezovsky, though details of his
involvement are unclear.

<TEXT>
	   The race in Sao Paulo, Brazil's wealthiest and most populous
state, was the most closely watched of the gubernatorial runoff
elections in 12 states and the Federal District.
	   In other important states, however, polls showed Cardoso's
opponents were winners.
	   In Rio de Janeiro, Anthony Garotinho, a former provincial mayor
and radio announcer of the center-left Democratic Labor Party, was
the apparent victor with 59 percent of the vote, the poll by the
respected Ibope polling organization found. Former Rio mayor Cesar
Maia, a Cardoso ally, had 41 percent.
	   In the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, an important farm
state, Olivio Dutra of the leftist Workers Party apparently wrested
the government from incumbent Antonio Britto, a Cardoso backer.
Dutra had 52 percent to Britto's 48 percent, Ibope said.
	   Results from states with electronic voting machines were
expected by Monday, while returns from states that used paper
ballots would take two days longer, electoral officials said.
	   Ibope interviewed 5,500 voters and said the margin of error was
1.7 percent.

	   The mood of voters was subdued, with little of the hoopla and
last-minute campaigning that marked the first-round election on
Oct. 4.
	   Army troops were deployed in four northern states to ensure
peace. In the poor northeastern state of Piaui, the government
ordered the seizure of newspapers and magazines that carried
stories critical of incumbent Gov. Mao Santa.
	   Although voting is mandatory, observers said the turnout seemed
low. Cardoso, who was re-elected on the first ballot, has given
Brazilians little choice.
	   He already told the country the belt-tightening measures will
contain spending cuts and probably new taxes. They must be tough
enough to convince the International Monetary Fund to approve a
rescue package worth an estimated dlrs 30 billion.
	   Brazil is a victim of the global financial crisis that began
last year in Asia and shifted to Russia before moving here. In the
past two months, investors have withdrawn some dlrs 25 billion from
the country.
	   Cardoso's economic team and the IMF have spent the past weeks
working out ways to slash Brazil's deficit of around dlrs 65
billion, or 7 percent of the gross domestic product.
	   Many of Cardoso's proposals depend on approval by Congress, and
governors have tremendous influence over how legislators vote.
	   As Brazilians await the unveiling of the package, the elections
became a referendum on the austerity measures.
	   ``Without them, Brazil will collapse,'' said Adriano Ramos, a
financial analyst in Sao Paulo. He voted for incumbent Covas
because ``he is better prepared to administrate a policy of scarce
resources.''
	   But many voters were unwilling to vote for more cuts.
	   Osvaldo Severino Correia, a Rio telecommunications technician,
showed his paycheck of dlrs 116 (140 reals) a month. After taxes,
he has just dlrs 95 (113 reals).
	   ``Now they want to take out more taxes,'' he said. ``I wouldn't
vote for the government candidates for anything in the world.''

	   BERLIN (AP) _ A man who entered the U.S. Embassy with a fake
bomb, two knives and a starter pistol was arrested by
anti-terrorist agents after a guard set off a security alert,
police said Sunday.
	   The 56-year-old German, who apparently is mentally disturbed,
persuaded a Marine guard to let him into the lobby Saturday by
asking for political asylum, police said.
	   The man surrendered his knives and pistol, but the guard set off
an alarm when he saw what looked like a bomb.
	   Anti-terrorist police arrived at the building in central Berlin
within minutes, subdued the man and exposed the apparent bomb as a
fake, police said. The man, whose name was not released, was
committed to a psychiatric clinic.
	   An embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the security officers had acted according to procedure.
	   Security at U.S. installations worldwide was tightened after the
Aug. 7 bombings of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Italian soccer federation opened an inquiry
Sunday into allegations that someone attempted to influence the
referee of a first-division match between Empoli and Sampdoria of
Genoa.
	   The referee assigned to the game, Stefano Farina, was replaced
by a reserve, Piero Ceccarini, hours before Sunday's game, which
Sampdoria won 3-0.
	   Federation officials questioned Empoli owner Fabrizio Corsi and
others, the ANSA news agency reported.
	   According to ANSA, Farina offered to withdraw from working the
game after he was contacted by a person with ties to Corsi.

Government candidate wins election in important Brazilian state

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ With a harsh austerity package to
be unveiled this week, voters on Sunday elected a key ally of
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso in Brazil's most important
state, exit polls showed.
	   An exit poll by the respected Ibope organization showed Sao
Paulo state Gov. Mario Covas was re-elected with 56 percent of the
vote, while two-time former governor Paulo Maluf had 44 percent.
	   The race in Sao Paulo, Brazil's wealthiest and most populous
state, was the most closely watched of the gubernatorial runoff
elections in 12 states and the Federal District.
	   The support for Covas, a frugal administrator and personal
friend of Cardoso, is a tremendous boost for the president who is
trying to rescue Brazil from the global financial crisis.
	   In other important states, however, polls showed Cardoso's
opponents were winners.
	   In Rio de Janeiro, Anthony Garotinho, a radio announcer of the
center-left Democratic Labor Party, was the apparent victor with 59
percent of the vote, Ibope found. Former Rio mayor Cesar Maia, a
Cardoso ally, had 41 percent.
	   In the southern Rio Grande do Sul, an important farm state,
Olivio Dutra of the leftist Workers Party apparently wrested the
office from incumbent Antonio Britto, a Cardoso backer. Dutra had
52 percent to Britto's 48 percent, Ibope reported.
	   Results from states with electronic voting machines were
expected by Monday, while returns from states that used paper
ballots would take two days longer, electoral officials said.
	   Brazil is a victim of the global financial crisis that began
last year in Asia and shifted to Russia before moving here. In the
past two months, investors have withdrawn some dlrs 25 billion from
the country.
	   Cardoso's economic team and the IMF have spent the past weeks
working out ways to slash Brazil's deficit of around dlrs 65
billion, or 7 percent of the gross domestic product.
	   Many of Cardoso's proposals _ which include spending cuts and
tax hikes _ require congressional approval, and governors have
tremendous influence over how legislators vote. They must be tough
enough to persuade the International Monetary Fund to approve a
dlrs 30 billion rescue package.
	   As Brazilians await the unveiling of the package, the elections
became a referendum on the austerity measures.
	   ``Without them, Brazil will collapse,'' said Adriano Ramos, a
financial analyst in Sao Paulo. He voted for incumbent Covas
because ``he is better prepared to administrate a policy of scarce
resources.''
	   But many voters were unwilling to vote for more cuts.
	   Osvaldo Severino Correia, a Rio telecommunications technician,
showed his paycheck of dlrs 116 (140 reals) a month. After taxes,
he has just dlrs 95 (113 reals).
	   ``Now they want to take out more taxes,'' he said. ``I wouldn't
vote for the government candidates for anything in the world.''
	   Although voting is mandatory, observers said the turnout seemed
low and voters were subdued. Cardoso, who was re-elected Oct. 4 on
the first ballot, has given Brazilians little choice.
	   Ibope interviewed 5,500 voters and said the margin of error was
1.7 percent.
	   Army troops were deployed in four northern states to ensure
peace. In the poor northeastern state of Piaui, the government
ordered the seizure of newspapers and magazines that carried
stories critical of incumbent Gov. Mao Santa.

Basque voters seek peace after years of separatist strife
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with voting stations closing, exit polls predict
victory for moderate nationalist party; final results by 2300 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; With AP photos
 &UR; By DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Five weeks after armed separatists
declared a cease-fire, Basque voters appeared Sunday to have
rewarded a moderate nationalist party that helped bring about the
truce, according to exit polls.
	   Surveys released on several television channels immediately
after polling centers closed at 8 p.m. (1900 gmt) said the Basque
Nationalist Party, the largest in the outgoing legislature with 22
of 75 seats, finished first with 21 to 23 seats.
	   The party has topped the poll in each of the five regional
elections held so far.
	   But the exit polls varied widely on which group finished second.
The private station Tele 5 said its poll had the Socialist party
with 16 seats, compared to 12 in the last assembly, and that the
center-right Popular Party of Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar had jumped from 11 to 15 seats.
	   It added that Herri Batasuna, the party linked to the
pro-independence armed organization ETA that has called a truce,
had kept its 11 seats.
	   Other exit polls said Herri Batasuna, which fielded its
candidates under a new coalition Euskal Herritarrok, had won 16 to
18 seats and could finish No. 2, a result that would be a severe
setback for Aznar.
	   The Basque regional government was to announce partial results
at 9:30 p.m. (2030 gmt) and the final tally about 90 minutes later.
	   Turnout was high among the 1.8 million registered voters despite
chilly, rainy weather in much of this picturesque, wealthy region
of northern Spain.
	   As of 7 p.m. (1800 GMT) it stood at 63 percent, 11 points higher
than at the same stage in the last such election in 1994, officials
said.
	   The open-ended cease-fire by ETA focused attention on whether
the truce would propel pro-independence parties to electoral gains.
	   ``The future of Euskadi is at stake,'' said Carlos Iturgaiz, the
Popular Party candidate for Basque regional president, who is
elected by the parliament. He was using the Basque word for the
region.
	   The election is the sixth since Spain granted the Basque country
a broad degree of autonomy 19 years ago.
	   Following the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, Spain
was divided into 17 autonomous regions although the national
government still controls most strategic powers, such as foreign
affairs and defense.
	   Aznar had hoped a heavy turnout would give his party and other
non-nationalist groups more clout in the Basque country to seek a
lasting settlement to one of Western Europe's last regional
conflicts without splitting Spain.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968. It began its
truce Sept. 18 making this the first regional election held without
a threat of violence.
	   The Basque Nationalist Party, which helped negotiate the
cease-fire in talks with Herri Batasuna, says it wants independence
too but opposes violence as the way to achieve it.
	   Aznar says there can be no peace process until ETA accepts the
results of the elections and renounces violence for good.
	   Although ETA has called cease-fires before, many Spaniards see
this one as the best opportunity in years to end the conflict.
	   In Vitoria, the clean, prosperous town that serves as the seat
of the Basque government, people braved the cold to vote in polling
stations guarded by Basque police in their standard bright red
coats and berets and shiny white truncheons.
	   Many said they could not remember an election which so clearly
pitted the nationalist and non-nationalist camps against each other
so fiercely. They also said that with the ETA ceasefire, regardless
of who wins, Basques will now feel freer to speak their minds.
	   ``People will be able to discuss things more openly. The
election opens a whole new range of possibilities,'''' said Ignacio
Martinez, a 40-year-old teacher who said he voted for Euskal
Herritarrok, which means `We the Basque People.'
	   Others felt a lasting peace was still far off.
	   ``This alone is not going to solve anything. It is important,
but it is just a step,'' said a 24-year-old man who gave his name
only as Alfonso.

Tajik archaeologists excavate road to ancient temple
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Archaeologists in the Central Asian nation of
Tajikistan have found a road paved with alabaster that dates from
Alexander the Great's empire in the 4th century B.C., a news report
said Sunday.
	   The road led to a temple that combined Greek culture brought by
Alexander with local traditions, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted
Anzhelina Druzhinina, head of the archaeological team, as saying.
	   The site is in strife-torn southern Tajikistan near the Pyandzh
River, which runs between the impoverished former Soviet republic
and Afghanistan.
	   The road was made of alabaster and crushed stone covered with
clay putty, Druzhinina said. The archaeologists have excavated a
section of the road and parts of the temple, but she said they have
no money to finish the work.
	   Alexander, king of Macedon, united Greece under his command and
then headed east in 334 B.C. for what became the greatest conquest
of ancient times. Winning battle after battle, he reached
northeastern India before turning back towards Egypt, where he died
of fever in 323 B.C. at age 33.

1860 coach tossed out in draw against Leverkusen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ 1860 Coach Werner Lorant, angry about an offsides
call, was tossed in the late stages of his team's 1-1 draw Sunday
against Leverkusen in the Bundesliga.
	   But afterwards, 1860 took advantage of the confusion to score
the 1-1 evener by Bernd Hobsch, who sent the ball flying left past
the keeper on a cross with just three minutes left in the match.
	   The big winner was Bayern Munich, which built its lead to five
points clear as its second-place crosstown rival and third place
Leverkusen neutralized each other with the draw.
	   Munich, off to the fastest start in Bundesliga history,
demolished FC Kaiserslautern 4-0 on Saturday.
	   Neither visiting 1860 Munich or Leverkusen, which took a 1-0
lead on Ulf Kirsten's seventh-minute penalty conversion, was able
to show much dazzle in the first half of a tactical match.
	   But after the break, Leverkusen squandered its chances to win
the match and halt 1860's unbeaten streak at seven matches.
	   Keeper Michael Hofmann accidentally passed the ball directly to
Ulf Kirsten, the Bundesliga's leading marksman the past two
seasons, but made amends by blocking the striker with a lunging
dive in the 60th minute.
	   Hofmann was forced into another diving save 10 minutes later
when Markus Happe was sprung free in front of his goal by a pass
that threaded the 1860 defenders.
	   The Bundesliga's fifth-place club also failed to gain ground on
Bayern Munich. Hertha Berlin, which hasn't won on the road this
season, was held to a scoreless draw by MSV Duisburg.

Ethiopian Airlines resumes flights to Sudan after three-year halt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Ethiopian Airlines plane landed in the
Sudanese capital Sunday, ending a three-year suspension of
Ethiopian flights to the country, the Egyptian news agency
reported.
	   The pilot and crew were greeted with flowers at Khartoum
airport, the Middle East News Agency reported.
	   Ethiopian Airlines will now fly twice a week between Addis Ababa
and Khartoum, officials of the carrier have said.
	   The resumption of flights signaled an improvement in relations
between the two countries. Ties were strained in June 1995 when
Ethiopia accused Sudan of aiding Muslim militants in an
assassination attempt against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in
Addis Ababa.
	   Mubarak was in the Ethiopian capital to attend an African
summit. He escaped the attack unharmed.
	   Ethiopia ordered the suspension of flights and a cut in the
Sudanese diplomatic staff in Addis Ababa after the attack.
	   Sudan has denied aiding the militants.

Guinea-Bissau rebel leader agrees to talks with president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau rebel leader Brig.
Ansumane Mane, who staged a military coup five months ago, has
agreed to talks with the president of the tiny west African country
over ending renewed fighting, news reports said Sunday.
	   The agreement came after talks between Mane and visiting
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama, the Portuguese news agency
Lusa said. Gama met with Mane late Saturday and also held talks
with President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
	   Officials cited by Lusa said the meeting might take place this
week.
	   Vieira proposed talks with Mane last Wednesday when he announced
a government cease-fire after fighting had erupted four days
earlier.
	   The rebels responded Friday with a 48-hour truce, demanding that
Vieira schedule new talks and explain the presence of foreign
troops in the former Portuguese colony.
	   Some 3,000 heavily armed soldiers from Senegal and the Republic
of Guinea have been in Guinea-Bissau to back Vieira since the
conflict began in early June.
	   Senegalese Interior Minister Lamine Sisse also talked to both
leaders Saturday and gave them a message from Senegal's President
Abdou Diouf, details of which were not disclosed, Lusa reported.
	   Fighting in the impoverished country restarted last Sunday when
Mane's rebels advanced on the center of Bissau, toward the
presidential palace.
	   While troops loyal to Vieira secured the capital's downtown, the
rebels gained ground inland, overrunning the country's second and
third largest towns, Bafata and Gabu.
	   A truce had been in place since July 26 and was reaffirmed a
month later, under mediation by west African and
Portuguese-speaking countries.
	   Mane led a military rebellion June 7, a day after Vieira
dismissed him as Armed Forces chief for allegedly arming
separatists in Senegal.
	   About half of the country's population of 1 million has been
displaced since the fighting began.

Government candidate wins election in important Brazilian state

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rio candidate conceding defeat in 6th graf; ADDS

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ With a harsh austerity package to
be unveiled this week, voters on Sunday elected a key ally of
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso in Brazil's most important
state, exit polls showed.
	   An exit poll by the respected Ibope organization showed Sao
Paulo state Gov. Mario Covas was re-elected with 56 percent of the
vote, while two-time former governor Paulo Maluf had 44 percent.
	   The race in Sao Paulo, Brazil's wealthiest and most populous
state, was the most closely watched of the gubernatorial runoff
elections in 12 states and the Federal District.
	   The support for Covas, a frugal administrator and friend of
Cardoso, is a tremendous boost for the president, who is trying to
rescue Brazil from the global financial crisis.
	   In other important states, however, polls showed Cardoso's
opponents were winners.
	   In Rio de Janeiro, Anthony Garotinho, a radio announcer of the
center-left Democratic Labor Party, was the apparent victor with 59
percent of the vote, Ibope found. Former Rio mayor Cesar Maia, a
Cardoso ally, had 41 percent and conceded defeat.
	   Former President Itamar Franco, who broke with Cardoso during
the campaign, won handily in powerful Minas Gerais state, Ibope
said. Franco was given 59 percent of the vote to 41 percent for
incumbent Eduardo Azeredo, of Cardoso's Brazilian Social Democracy
Party.
	   In the southern Rio Grande do Sul, an important farm state,
Olivio Dutra of the leftist Workers Party apparently wrested the
office from incumbent Antonio Britto, a Cardoso backer. Dutra had
52 percent to Britto's 48 percent, Ibope reported.
	   Results from states with electronic voting machines were
expected by Monday, while returns from states that used paper
ballots would take two days longer, electoral officials said.
	   Brazil is a victim of the global financial crisis that began
last year in Asia and shifted to Russia before moving here. In the
past two months, investors have withdrawn some dlrs 25 billion from
the country.
	   Cardoso's economic team and the International Monetary Fund have
spent the past weeks working out ways to slash Brazil's deficit of
around dlrs 65 billion, or 7 percent of the gross domestic product.
	   Many of Cardoso's proposals _ which include spending cuts and
tax hikes _ require congressional approval, and governors have
tremendous influence over how legislators vote. They must be tough
enough to persuade the IMF to approve a dlrs 30 billion rescue
package.
	   As Brazilians awaited the unveiling of the package, the
elections became a referendum on the austerity measures.
	   ``Without them, Brazil will collapse,'' said Adriano Ramos, a
financial analyst in Sao Paulo. He voted for incumbent Covas
because ``he is better prepared to administrate a policy of scarce
resources.''
	   But many voters were unwilling to vote for more cuts.
	   Osvaldo Severino Correia, a Rio telecommunications technician,
showed his paycheck of dlrs 116 (140 reals) a month. After taxes,
he has just dlrs 95 (113 reals).
	   ``Now they want to take out more taxes,'' he said. ``I wouldn't
vote for the government candidates for anything in the world.''
	   Although voting is mandatory, observers said the turnout seemed
low and voters were subdued. Cardoso, who was re-elected Oct. 4 by
receiving more than half the vote on the first ballot, has given
Brazilians little choice.
	   Ibope interviewed 5,500 voters and said the margin of error was
1.7 percent.
	   Army troops were deployed in four northern states to ensure
peace. In the poor northeastern state of Piaui, the government
ordered the seizure of newspapers and magazines that carried
stories critical of incumbent Gov. Mao Santa.

Gunfire over grave at funeral missed by international observers

	   KRAJKOVA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Mourners ran away or dived for cover
Sunday when gunfire whistled overhead at the funeral of an
11-year-old Albanian boy believed slain by Serbs.
	   Journalists filmed and photographed the chaos. But international
observers sent to Kosovo to witness such violence left before the
funeral began, with one observer saying their presence wouldn't
protect the mourners from more gunfire.
	   The boy's death and the refusal of foreign diplomats to attend
his burial demonstrated the difficulties facing the international
community in forcing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
comply with the Oct. 12 agreement that averted NATO airstrikes on
his forces.
	   The agreement calls for a cessation of hostilities and the
withdrawal of extra police and military forces sent into Kosovo in
February as part of an offensive against ethnic Albanians fighting
for independence.
	   But sporadic violence continues, and there are signs of
increasing Serb intimidation to prevent ethnic Albanian refugees
from returning to some villages.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in the fighting and an
estimated 300,000 have been driven from their homes in Kosovo, a
province of the main Yugoslav republic, Serbia.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the threat of NATO
airstrikes would remain in place until Milosevic reduces forces to
pre-conflict level.
	   ``He has made progress but he needs to try an awful lot
harder,'' Cook said in an interview with the British Broadcasting
Corp. ``I think that when on Tuesday we review this, we may well
come to the conclusion we cannot yet relax our guard, we cannot
stand down the planes, we need further progress before we relax
that order.''
	   On the ground, however, daily violence showed little sign of
abating.
	   The boy, Shemsi Elshani, was killed Saturday while helping his
father and cousin chop wood behind this mountain village 30 kms (18
miles) west of Pristina, according to the boy's father, Rashit
Elshani.
	   He blamed Serb police, saying his son died simply because he's
Albanian. Police have been shooting in the area every night to try
to scare off villagers, he said. Serb officials were unavailable
for comment.
	   ``Even if you're unarmed, they're going to shoot you,'' Elshani
said while his only surviving son, 7-year-old Dardan, hugged his
leg. ``We'd been there for two hours cutting trees and carrying
them.''
	   His wife, Hasime, also 37, fainted repeatedly beside Shemsi's
bloodied body, still clad in the blue jeans, blue shirt and jacket
he wore when he died.
	   ``They will come to shoot us, and they will take my Dardan and
slit his throat,'' she said, sobbing.
	   A team of European diplomats and an American team of the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission came to the house, but all left before
the burial.
	   Gunfire from a hill about a kilometer (about half a mile) away,
the same area from where the fatal shots came, sounded several
times after the diplomats arrived.
	   The Europeans eventually drove away, while the American observer
team questioned Rashit and called its headquarters before leaving.
	   Villagers asked team leader Norman Olsen to attend the funeral
because they believed his presence would stop further shooting, but
he declined.
	   ``Even though we have armored vehicles, if somebody is
determined to shoot more people, they won't stop for us,'' Olsen
said before leaving. ``Our presence at the gravesite will not
protect you. If any diplomat tells you otherwise, he's wrong.''
	   Scores of people walked up the hillside for the burial in a
fresh grave next to six others, including an uncle of Shemsi killed
Sept. 25 during a Serb offensive in the area.
	   When mourners started to disperse, more gunfire erupted from the
far hill. Some people ran down the hill while others lay on the
ground
	   Also Sunday, two top NATO generals left Belgrade after two days
of talks in which they pressured Yugoslav political and military
leaders for further troop withdrawals from Kosovo, a diplomatic
source said.
	   Both sides remained tight-lipped about the meetings, but a
diplomatic source speaking on condition of anonymity said NATO
wanted to let the Yugoslav leaders know they must do more in
withdrawing military and special police units in Kosovo back to
their barracks.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Mallorca, coached by Argentine Hector
Cuper, moved to the top of the league Sunday on thrashing Arrigo
Sacchi's Atletico de Madrid 4-0 while Real Madrid only managed a
2-2 tie against Racing.
	   Mallorca's victory gave it 15 points, one more than Real. Celta,
which defeated Zaragoza 2-0 Saturday, stayed No. 3 with 13 points
ahead by goal difference of defending titlist FC Barcelona which
defeated cross-town rival Espanyol 2-1.
	   Other seventh-round results Sunday were: Oviedo 0, Villareal 0;
Real Sociedad 1, Valladolid 0; Salamanca 2, Athletic Bilbao 1;
Valencia 5, Betis 1; Tenerife 1, Deportivo 1 and Alaves 0,
Extremadura 1.
	   In Mallorca, Yugoslav midfielder Veljko Paunovic score in the
19th minute against his old side Atletico. Two minutes into the
second half Lauren Bisan-Etane hit a second while Yugoslav Jovan
Jankovic made it 3-0 in the 51st. Francisco Soler scored the fourth
and final in the 79th.
	   Atletico, which was playing without Brazilian midfielder,
Juninho, stays with 10 points.
 &UR; Real Madrid 2, Racing de Santander 2 &QC; 
	   Two minutes into injury time in the first half, Racing took a
surprise lead when defender Jesus Maria Merino ran into the area to
connect with a cross and head the ball past German goalkeeper Bodo
Ilgner.
	   But Madrid bounced back in the 59th minute when Fernando Hierro
slotted home from the penalty spot. The veteran Spanish
international edged the side into the lead in the 77th with a
free-kick shot from some 30 yards (meters).
	   Victory seemed in the bag until two minutes into injury time
again Russian striker Vladimir Bestchastnykh tied the game at 2-2.
 &UR; Espanyol 1, Barcelona 2 &QC; 
	   Dutch centerforward Patrick Kluivert shot Barcelona into the
lead in the 10th minute. Barcelona got a jolt in the 33rd minute
when Argentine defender Mauricio Pellegrino was sent off for two
yellow cards while in the 59th minute 19-year-old Enrique de Lucas
grabbed an equalizer. Espanyol's luck plummeted in the 84th minute
when the side was left with 10 men after a penalty call which
Brazilian Giovanni neatly converted to give Barcelona a 2-1 victory
and move it up to No. 4 with 13 points.
 &UR; Valencia 5, Betis 1 &QC; 
	   Argentine international Claudio Lopez notched one up for
Valencia in the 34th minute but Alexis Trujillo matched it for
Betis four minutes later. Three minutes before the break, Valencia
took the lead again with a goal by Rumanian international Adrian
Ilie. Things appeared about to turn sour for Valencia in the 63rd
when Frenchman Alain Roche was sent off but three minutes later
Swedish player Stefan Schwarz got the third while Lopez snatched a
fourth in the 72nd. Ilie got his second and the team's fifth eight
minutes from the whistle.
 &UR; Salamanca 2, Athletic Bilbao 1 &QC; 
	   Ismael Urzaiz got his sixth of the season to put Bilbao, last
season's league runner-up, ahead four minutes into the game but Edu
Alonso pulled lowly Salamanca even in the 39th minute. Sergio
Corino edged Salamanca ahead three minutes after the break for a
2-1 victory.
 &UR; Alaves 0, Extremadura 1
	   Bottom-of-the-table Extremadura grabbed its first victory of the
season on downing fellow division newcomer Alaves 1-0 with a goal
by Jose Luis Soto in the fourth minute. Extremadura stays last in
the 20-team division, now with five points.

Israel arrests three Hamas activists for settler murders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Three members of the Islamic militant group
Hamas have been arrested by Israel for the shooting deaths of two
Jewish settlers in August, an army spokesman said Sunday.
	   All three suspects are from the village of Tell near the Jewish
settlement of Yitzhar, home of the two settlers who were ambushed
and shot to death on Aug. 4 while on a routine night patrol of the
area.
	   The suspects received direct orders to carry out such attacks
from Adel Awadallah, a leader of the Hamas, who along with his
brother, was shot and killed by Israeli troops five weeks later,
the Israeli army said.
	   The army spokesman said that several weapons and explosives were
found at the homes of the three Hamas members who had planned more
attacks.
	   A Palestinian police official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said a forth member of the same Hamas cell was in
palestinian custody.
	   Hamas opposes Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking and has claimed
responsibility for many deadly attacks against Israelis.

Internal Palestinian clash stemming from accord leaves two hurt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS third graf on relations between Fatah and Arafat &QL; 
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ In a major rupture within Yasser
Arafat's ranks, members of the Palestinian leader's political
faction fought Palestinian security forces with rocks and bullets
Sunday. A 16-year old Fatah activist was killed in the violence.
	   The fighting followed a move by Palestinian military
intelligence to seize unlicensed weapons and inspect files
belonging to Arafat's Fatah faction. A crackdown on illegal arms
was among tough new security measures Arafat agreed to at last
week's Israeli-Palestinian summit.
	   The clash alarmed Palestinian leaders, who fear the pressures of
the implementing the U.S.-brokered agreement will wind up pitting
Palestinian against Palestinian. Many of its provisions, such as
reining in Islamic militants, disarming political groups and
halting anti-Israel incitement, are extremely unpopular, and will
be difficult politically for Arafat's government to impose.
	   Former Cabinet minister Hanan Ashrawi, who was present when the
clash began in the West Bank town of Ramallah, called it a result
of an accord that put too much emphasis on Israeli security at
Palestinian expense.
	   ``This is very dangerous,'' she said. ``If this situation is
allowed to continue we would be facing an internal breakdown.''
	   The fighting broke out as Marwan Barghouti, the Fatah leader in
the West Bank, was addressing a group of about 100 supporters
outside the Palestinian Authority headquarters and the offices of
Governor Mustafa Isa.
	   Some of the Fatah activists picked up stones and hurled them
over a fence into the compound and at plainclothes intelligence
agents who were watching the gathering from the sidelines,
witnesses said.
	   Intelligence agents hurled rocks back at the crowd. But then
some of the security agents fired from the second- and third-floor
windows, with some of the gunfire directed into the crowd. About
the same time, armed Fatah members arrived on the scene, firing
shots into the air.
	   Two men were hurt, including a Fatah activist, 16-year old
Wassim Tarifi, who suffered a gunshot wound to the head. Tarifi, a
nephew of a Palestinian lawmaker, was taken to Jerusalem's Hadassah
hospital, and died several hours later of his wound, said hospital
spokeswoman Yael Bossem-Levy.
	   His injury silenced the gunfire on both sides, and leaders from
both sides quickly withdrew for a meeting.
	   A senior Fatah official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the confrontation followed a search Saturday night of Fatah
headquarters by about 50 members of Palestinian intelligence.
Fistfights broke out as the searchers went through files and looked
for unlicensed weapons, the official said.
	   Barghouti told reporters that police confiscated several weapons
but refused to elaborate. Barghouti later said the police officers
who shot at the crowd, should be ``tried and executed.'' But Isa,
speaking on behalf of the Palestinian Authority, said the officers
would likely be prosecuted and jailed.
	   Some Fatah activists said the confrontation was exacerbated by a
personal feud between the commander of the raiding party and two
Fatah members.
	   Fatah called a three-day strike in Ramallah to protest the
violence, and graffiti denouncing the intelligence agents as
``traitors'' appeared on walls near where the clash took place.
	   The fighting occurred entirely in Palestinian-controlled areas,
and Israeli troops were not involved.

Del Piero leads nine-man Juve past Inter on late winner
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: TOPS with Juventus-Internazionale night match. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Alessandro Del Piero slammed in the rebound after
'keeper Gianluca Pagliuca blocked but failed to hold the striker's
penalty kick with two minutes left Sunday night to lift Juventus of
Turin, which ended the game with nine players, past Internazionale
of Milan 1-0 and into second place in the Italian League.
	   Despite having French World Cup star Zinedine Zidane expelled
for a foul on Portugal's Paulo Sousa in the 49th minute, Juventus
maintained control of the action for much of the match. But the
two-time defending champions did not hit the target until the 88th.
	   Inter defender Fabio Galante was whistled for fouling striker
Filippo Inzaghi in the penalty area, and Del Piero took the ensuing
shot from the spot. Pagliuca dove to his left at the base of the
post, stopping the ball. But it bounced off his chest and Del Piero
pounced to slot home from steps away.
	   Juventus then had Dutch midfielder Edgar Davids sent off with a
second yellow card, but Inter ran out of time.
	   The goal continued Del Piero's resurgence. He has four goals,
including two for Italy's national team, in his past four games
after going through a six-month slump.
	   At the other end of the field, Inter's Brazilian star Ronaldo
was a non-factor. The two-time FIFA Player of the Year was seeing
his first Serie A action in more than a month after being sidelined
with tendinitis in both knees.
	   Earlier, it took just one week for Fiorentina's Edmundo to go
from troublemaker to hero and for AS Roma's Francesco Totti to go
from hero to scapegoat.
	   Fiorentina rebounded from its first loss and kept its hold on
first place by defeating Salernitana 4-0 as Edmundo, the Brazilian
striker, scored twice and assisted on one of Argentine star Gabriel
Batistuta's two goals.
	   Edmundo and coach Giovanni Trapattoni made a much-publicized
peace pact this week after the forward had yelled obscenities
toward the sideline when he was substituted in a 2-1 defeat against
Roma, a game decided by Totti's winner late in injury time.
	   Totti missed a penalty kick this Sunday and was one several
culprits _ along with the entire defense _ in a 3-2 loss at AC
Milan that dropped Roma out of second place. Brazil's Leonardo,
Liberia's George Weah and Germany's Christian Ziege scored for the
hosts, while Marco Delvecchio had both of Roma's goals.
	   Fiorentina, leading Serie A for the first time since 1982, is
5-0-1 for 15 points, two ahead of Juventus. Milan is next with 12,
while Inter, Roma and Lazio of Rome all have 10.
	   Elsewhere, Perugia shocked previously undefeated AC Parma 2-1.
Parma's Italy national 'keeper Gianluigi Buffon had not allowed a
goal before Sunday.
	   In other games, Lazio of Rome and Vicenza drew 1-1; Francesco
Palmieri's two goals led Sampdoria of Genoa past Empoli 3-0;
Venezia finally scored its first goal of the season but settled for
a 1-1 draw at Udinese; Bari rallied with two goals in the last 10
minutes to tie Cagliari 3-3, and Swedish striker Kennet Andersson's
double lifted Bologna to its first victory, 3-1 over Piacenza.
	   At Turin, Inter (3-1-2) suffered its second straight loss
against a fellow title contender, following last weekend's 5-3
humiliation against Lazio. Coach Luigi Simoni started young
strikers Andrea Pirlo and Nicola Ventola alongside Ronaldo, but the
trio never found a serious shot on goal. Zidane had been the most
effective player on the field for Juventus (4-1-1), but the hosts
played collectively better after he was sent to the locker room.

	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Driving rain squalls spawned by
Hurricane Mitch _ a dangerous storm with 150-mph (240-kph) winds _
forced churches to cancel Sunday services and flooded some streets
in the Jamaican capital Sunday.
	   Under dark, menacing skies, seaports closed and buses and taxis
stayed off Kingston's streets as Mitch, the 13th named storm of the
Atlantic hurricane season, swirled in the western Caribbean Sea.
	   Mitch, a powerful Category 4 hurricane, could also threaten the
Cayman Islands, Cuba, Honduras and Colombia's tiny islands off
Central America, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.
	   Hurricane warnings were posted for the Cayman Islands and
eastern Cuba, and a hurricane watch was in effect for the tourist
islands of the Caymans.
	   At 2100 GMT, Mitch was about 190 miles (305 kilometers)
south-southwest of Grand Cayman. Crawling west-northwest at 8 mph
(13 kph), its hurricane-force winds of at least 74 mph (118 kph)
extended 70 miles (110 kilometers) from the center.
	   Sheets of rain reduced visibility to a few yards (meters) as
squalls pelted Kingston and Jamaica's eastern districts. With rain
expected at least through Monday, authorities warned of mudslides
and flash floods, especially in the mountains.
	   Residents cleared shelves of bakery items, batteries and other
goods at the few Kingston markets open Sunday, though by
mid-afternoon the hurricane appeared to be moving farther away from
Jamaica.
	   Several airlines canceled flights, although the Kingston and
Montego Bay airports remained open.
	   In the Cayman Islands, a British colony of about 28,000, some
boat owners secured their vessels and residents stocked up on food,
water, batteries and other essentials. The government allowed
markets _ normally closed by law on Sunday _ to open and ordered
public works employees to report to work.
	   The annual Pirates Festival and street parade was rescheduled
for next weekend, and a planned release of 400 endangered green sea
turtle hatchlings from Grand Cayman was postponed indefinitely.
	   In Cuba, civil defense authorities began warning citizens in the
eastern part of the island on Sunday. Cuba's eastern half was
battered by Hurricane Georges one month ago.
	   Information about the hurricane's location and movement was
broadcast on national and regional television and radio stations.
Civil defense warning centers, which oversee evacuations and
temporary shelters, were activated.
	   In western Jamaica, hoteliers and tourists kept a wary eye on
the storm's progress.
	   ``It's not a very good beach day,'' said Rohan Watson, a manager
at the Negril Inn in the western resort of Negril. Employees had
stockpiled food and plywood to board windows in case Mitch
threatened, he said.
	   ``People are still coming in. I think most people think the
weather's going to pass,'' said an optimistic Marcia Tomlinson, a
receptionist at the Montego Bay hotel in the northwestern coastal
resort of Montego Bay.
	   Jamaica was last struck by Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, which
killed 45 people. But the island was spared by Hurricane Georges, a
storm that killed more than 500 during its rampage through the
northeast Caribbean last month.

Jewish settlers protest accord; Netanyahu hails agreement

	   OFRA, West Bank (AP) _ Jewish settlers, angered over a new
Mideast peace deal which gives more land to Palestinians, scuffled
with police and took to the streets across the West Bank Sunday in
protest over an agreement which they vowed to scuttle.
	   The road-block demonstrations came several hours before Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned to Israel hoping to convince
hardliners the deal he made with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
was the best possible.
	   Arriving in Israel to a red-carpet welcome, the Israeli leader
said security concessions won from the Palestinians during the
nine-day summit outside Washington would justify the ceding of more
West Bank land.
	   ``We are returning after a long and difficult effort to bring
... security and peace to Israel,'' he said. ``We achieved such a
deal _ we achieved the best deal... We did something good for the
state of Israel.''
	   In Sunday's wide spread demonstrations including one outside of
Israel's international airport, following Netanyahu's arrival, at
least 20 settlers _ who were once Netanyahu's staunchest supporters
_ were arrested and two police officers were hurt.
	   ``With the Lord's help, we will use all of our powers to break
this agreement,'' said settler leader Ahron Dombe. Settler leaders
said they would channel their efforts into intense lobbying Monday
before legislators vote on a no-confidence motion against
Netanyahu. Debate on the vote is scheduled to begin Monday at
4:00pm (14:00gmt.)
	   Near the settlement of Ofra north of Jerusalem, about 50
settlers and their supporters rushed past Israeli police and sat
cross-legged on the highway. Some settlers wrapped in prayer shawls
held morning services at the roadside.
	   Police also said settlers burned tires at the Karme Tsur
settlement north of Hebron.
	   ``I'm here to show that this is a sad day,'' said Natan El, 38,
an engineer, sitting in the middle of the main north-south highway
through the West Bank. ``We are in danger of losing our land, the
land we have returned to after 2,000 years.''
	   Tensions over the accord also boiled over in the West Bank town
of Ramallah, where infighting broke out among Arafat's supporters.
Members of the Palestinian leader's political faction, Fatah,
battled Palestinian security forces with rocks and bullets. One 16
year-old youth shot in the head, later died of his wounds in a
Jerusalem hospital.
	   The confrontation broke out after Palestinian intelligence
agents searched Fatah headquarters, looking for illegal weapons. A
crackdown on unlicensed arms is one of the provisions of the
agreement.
	   The clash alarmed Palestinian leaders, who fear the pressures of
the implementing the U.S.-brokered agreement will wind up pitting
Palestinian against Palestinian. Many of its provisions, such as
reining in Islamic militants, disarming political groups and
halting anti-Israel incitement, are extremely unpopular, and will
be difficult politically for Arafat's government to impose.
	   By a margin of four to one, Israelis surveyed in a poll
published Sunday in the Yediot Ahronot newspaper supported the new
agreement with the Palestinians. The poll questioned 505 Israeli
adults, and had a 4.5 percent margin of error.
	   But politicians across the board predicted Netanyahu would face
political turmoil as a result of the agreement when he brings it
before his right-wing Cabinet Monday.
	   The agreement signed at the White House Friday calls for an
Israeli handover of 13.1 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian
civilian control. That means some Jewish settlements will be
surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory, except for access
roads.
	   Twelve hardliners in Netanyahu's government say they will vote
against him in upcoming no-confidence motions. Even Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon, who leads the right-wing camp in Netanyahu's
government and helped forge the agreement, said the withdrawal
endangered Israel's security and would not reveal how he would vote
on the deal.
	   Netanyahu has only a one-seat majority.
	   Hoping to calm settler fears, the premier made overtures to the
settler community, but they mostly went unheard.
	   ``I say now here to our friends listening, you are us, you are
us and we are you. We love you and we are fighting for you and
there is no other government that will fight like this,'' Netanyahu
said, mentioning settler leader Dombe by name.
	   ``I am very, very, very disappointed with the prime minister and
the ministers who participated in this deal,'' Dombe said after the
premier's speech. ``Netanyahu is no longer the leader of our
national camp.'' Dombe said his staff would begin opinion samplings
among settlers Monday in search of a candidate to challenge
Netanyahu.
	   In a another development, the militant Palestinian Islamic Jihad
group said its leader in the Gaza Strip had been arrested as part
of a renewed crackdown by Arafat's police on militants. In a
statement, faxed to news agencies, the group said dozens of its
members had been taken into custody.
	   The larger Hamas group also announced that one its West Bank
leaders was under arrest and being held in a Palestinian jail.
Israel announced it had arrested three Hamas members suspected of
shooting to death two Jewish settlers in August.

Huston a winner again at Disney
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Florida (AP) _ Down to his last straw when the
PGA Tour season began, John Huston is having a year he wishes would
never end.
	   Huston, who decided to use a one-time exemption instead of
returning to qualifying school last year, won his second tournament
of the year Sunday by closing with a 6-under-par 66 for a
one-stroke victory over Davis Love III.
	   Starting the day four strokes behind Love, Huston caught him
with a brilliant display of accuracy. He hit every green in
regulation in the final round, was 3-under on the par 5s and took
the lead for good with a 7-iron into 3 feet (a meter) for birdie on
the 16th.
	   Love had a chance to catch him with booming drives on the last
two holes, but he didn't give himself a decent birdie try with an
8-iron and a 9-iron in his hands.
	   ``I'm thrilled to be in this position,'' Huston said.
	   The only guy who may have felt as good as Huston was Larry
Rinker.
	   The final full-field tournament of the year determined the top
125 players on the money list who keep their full-exempt cards for
1999. Rinker, 135th going into the Disney, closed with seven
straight pars for a 68 that left him in a tie for 12th. He made
dlrs 42,000 and moved up to 120th.
	   ``It was a big day for me, a day I needed to perform,'' Rinker
said. ``I was fortunate I did.''
	   Blaine McCallister shot a 66 in the final round and got the
125th spot on the money list by dlrs 4,204 over P.H. Horgan III.
	   Huston won dlrs 360,000 to put him at dlrs 1.4 million, by far
his best season in 11 years on tour. He also moved up to 13th in
the Presidents Cup standings, giving him a good chance to make the
team with a strong showing next week in the Tour Championship.
	   Love, who opened with a 73, started the final round with a
three-stroke lead and had a chance early on to put distance between
him and the rest of the field.
	   Already 1-under for the day, his bunker shot for eagle on the
par-5 fourth hole ran over the lip. Then he three-putted from about
8 feet for bogey.
	   ``That probably was a killer,'' Love said.
	   Brent Geiberger had the best round of the day, a 7-under 65 that
moved him up to third at 13-under 275. Jesper Parnevik, Tom Purtzer
and Rocco Mediate were another stroke back.
	   Glen Day and Doug Martin, roommates at the University of
Oklahoma, started the final round paired with Love and needing to
make up three strokes.
	   Martin was the first to catch him with birdies on the first
three holes, but he finished with two straight bogeys for a 72 and
was at 277, tied with Tiger Woods. Day shot a 73 to finish at 278.
	   ``I didn't hit very good irons, and that was the difference,''
Love said. ``I didn't give myself enough makeable birdie putts.''
	   That wasn't a problem for Huston.
	   His iron play was remarkably consistent _ he missed only seven
greens over 72 holes, and he played the final 33 holes without a
bogey.
	   That's a far cry from a year ago, when Huston became so
frustrated with nagging shoulder and wrist injuries _ not to
mention his play _ that he took the last four weeks off. Instead of
going back to Q-school, Huston decided to take his one-time
exemption for being in the top 50 on the career money list.
	   ``Mentally, I was shot,'' he said. ``Taking the time off was a
big turnaround for me.''
	   That much was clear in the fourth tournament of the year, when
Huston set the PGA Tour scoring record in relation to par _
28-under 260 to win the Hawaiian Open.
	   ``It certainly worked out great,'' he said.
	   Huston still holds the tournament scoring record at Disney, a
26-under 262 when he won in 1992. He didn't have to go that low to
win Sunday.

Ethiopian Airlines resumes flights to Sudan after three-year halt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Ethiopian Airlines plane landed in the
Sudanese capital Sunday, ending a three-year suspension of
Ethiopian flights to the country, the Egyptian news agency
reported.
	   The pilot and crew were greeted with flowers at Khartoum
airport, the Middle East News Agency reported.
	   Ethiopian Airlines will now fly twice a week between Addis Ababa
and Khartoum, officials of the carrier have said.
	   The resumption of flights signaled an improvement in relations
between the two countries. Ties were strained in June 1995 when
Ethiopia accused Sudan of aiding Muslim militants in an
assassination attempt against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in
Addis Ababa.
	   Mubarak was in the Ethiopian capital to attend an African
summit. He was not hurt.
	   Ethiopia suspended flights and cut Sudanese diplomatic staff in
Addis Ababa after the attack.
	   Sudan has denied aiding the militants.

Inspector says derided Jamaican pitch is fine for Test series
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Kingston's Sabina Park took a step
closer to hosting the second match of the five-Test home series
against Australia in March as an inspector ruled the pitch
acceptable for play.
	   International Cricket Council inspector Mike Smith called the
Sabina wicket a ``perfectly good strip.''
	   On Jan. 29, a Test match between the West Indies and England was
called off after 10 overs because match officials deemed the Sabina
Park pitch unsuitable for Test cricket. English players called it
``dangerous'' and a ``death trap'' and claimed the cracked playing
surface sent balls rearing up unpredictably.
	   It was the first time in the history of Test cricket that a
match was abandoned because of a sub-standard pitch.
	   After watching the drawn four-day game between Jamaica and the
West Indies ``A'' team at the ground Sunday, Smith said the ground
was acceptable.
	   ``I've seen enough to give it a favorable report when I get back
to London,'' Smith said Sunday. ``I see no reason why a Test should
not be played here.''
	   The West Indies and Australia are scheduled to play at Sabina
from March 13 to March 17.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Traffic in central Madrid came to a halt
Sunday as an estimated 2,000 sheep were herded through the city as
part of an annual procession to highlight the need to protect
Spain's ancient grazing roots.
	   With bleating interspersed with the tinkling of bells making a
welcome substitute from the customary car horns of this busy city,
dozens of people lined the sidewalks as the merinos trotted through
central Madrid and on to the city's southwestern outskirts.
	   The protest, staged each October for the past five years,
highlights the need for authorities to protect Spain's 125,000
kilometers (78,000 miles) of transhumance paths _ some dating back
800 years _ which are used for the seasonal movement of livestock
from different grazing grounds around the country.
	   Shepherds and ecologists claim many of the paths have been
destroyed by the spread of cities and towns.
	   Madrid lies along two of the north-south grazing routes.
	   On Monday, the flock was to continue its march to the more
temperate southwestern pastures of Extremadura.

	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Five weeks after armed Basque separatists
declared a cease-fire, their allied Herri Batasuna party posted
gains in regional elections Sunday. But so did Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar's party which opposes any split in Spain.
	   With 99 percent of the vote counted, the moderate Basque
Nationalist Party that helped bring about the truce finished first
in parliamentary elections placed first with 21 of the house's 75
seats, Basque Interior Minister Juan Maria Atutxa said.
	   The party has topped the vote in each of the five previous
regional elections although it has never won a majority.
	   Herri Batasuna, the party linked to the armed group ETA which
declared the cease-fire, gained three seats for a total of 14, he
said.
	   Aznar's Popular Party jumped from 11 to 16 seats.
	   The winning party will need to seek an alliance with others to
form a new government. The party favors independence although it
also lends support to Aznar's moderate government in the national
Parliament in Madrid.
	   Officials said 70.8 percent of the 1.8 million registered voters
turned out despite chilly, rainy weather in this northern region.
The figure was nearly 11 percentage points more than that of the
last election in 1994.
	   The open-ended cease-fire by ETA focused attention on whether
the truce would propel pro-independence parties to electoral gains.
	   ``The future of Euskadi is at stake,'' said Carlos Iturgaiz, the
Popular Party candidate for Basque regional president, who is
elected by the parliament. He was using the Basque word for the
region.
	   The election is the sixth since Spain granted the Basque country
a broad degree of autonomy 19 years ago.
	   Following the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, Spain
was divided into 17 autonomous regions although the national
government still controls most strategic powers, such as foreign
affairs and defense.
	   Aznar had hoped a a strong performance for his party and other
non-nationalist groups more clout in dealing with nationalists to
seek a settlement to one of Western Europe's last regional
conflicts.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968. It began its
truce Sept. 18 making this the first regional election held without
a threat of violence.
	   Aznar says there can be no peace process until ETA accepts the
results of the elections and renounces violence for good.
	   Although ETA has called cease-fires before, many Spaniards see
this one as the best opportunity in years to end the conflict.

	   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Florida (AP) _ Down to his last straw when the
PGA Tour season began, John Huston is having a year he wishes would
never end.
	   Huston, who decided to use a one-time exemption instead of
returning to qualifying school last year, won his second tournament
of the year Sunday by closing with a 6-under-par 66 for a
one-stroke victory over Davis Love III.
	   Starting the day four strokes behind Love, Huston caught him
with a brilliant display of accuracy. He hit every green in
regulation in the final round, was 3-under on the par 5s and took
the lead for good with a 7-iron into 3 feet (a meter) for birdie on
the 16th.
	   Love had a chance to catch him with booming drives on the last
two holes, but he didn't give himself a decent birdie try with an
8-iron and a 9-iron in his hands.
	   ``I'm thrilled to be in this position,'' Huston said.
	   The only guy who may have felt as good as Huston was Larry
Rinker.
	   The final full-field tournament of the year determined the top
125 players on the money list who keep their full-exempt cards for
1999. Rinker, 135th going into the Disney, closed with seven
straight pars for a 68 that left him in a tie for 12th. He made
dlrs 42,000 and moved up to 120th.
	   ``It was a big day for me, a day I needed to perform,'' Rinker
said. ``I was fortunate I did.''
	   Blaine McCallister shot a 66 in the final round and got the
125th spot on the money list by dlrs 4,204 over P.H. Horgan III.
	   Huston won dlrs 360,000 to put him at dlrs 1.4 million, by far
his best season in 11 years on tour. He also moved up to 12th in
the Presidents Cup standings, giving him a good chance to make the
team with a strong showing next week in the Tour Championship.
	   Love, who ... Picks up 11th graf pvs

Jewish settlers protest accord; Netanyahu hails agreement

	   OFRA, West Bank (AP) _ Jewish settlers, angered over a new
Mideast peace deal that gives more land to Palestinians, scuffled
with police and took to the streets across the West Bank on Sunday
to protest an agreement that they vowed to scuttle.
	   The road-block demonstrations came several hours before Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned to Israel, hoping to convince
hard-liners the deal he made with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
was the best possible.
	   Arriving in Israel to a red-carpet welcome, the Israeli leader
said security concessions won from the Palestinians during the
nine-day summit outside Washington would justify the ceding of more
West Bank land.
	   ``We are returning after a long and difficult effort to bring
... security and peace to Israel,'' he said. ``We achieved such a
deal. We achieved the best deal... We did something good for the
state of Israel.''
	   In Sunday's widespread demonstrations, including one outside of
Israel's international airport following Netanyahu's arrival, at
least 20 settlers _ who were once Netanyahu's staunchest supporters
_ were arrested and two police officers were hurt.
	   ``With the Lord's help, we will use all of our powers to break
this agreement,'' said settler leader Ahron Dombe. Settler leaders
said they would carry out an intense lobbying effort on Monday
ahead of a scheduled no-confidence motion against Netanyahu later
in the day.
	   Near the settlement of Ofra north of Jerusalem, about 50
settlers and their supporters rushed past Israeli police and sat
cross-legged on the highway. Some settlers wrapped in prayer shawls
held morning services at the roadside.
	   Police also said settlers burned tires at the Karme Tsur
settlement north of Hebron.
	   ``I'm here to show that this is a sad day,'' said Natan El, 38,
an engineer, sitting in the middle of the main north-south highway
through the West Bank. ``We are in danger of losing our land, the
land we have returned to after 2,000 years.''
	   Tensions over the accord also boiled over in the West Bank town
of Ramallah, where infighting broke out among Arafat's supporters.
Members of the Palestinian leader's political faction, Fatah,
battled Palestinian security forces with rocks and bullets. One 16
year-old youth shot in the head, later died of his wounds in a
Jerusalem hospital.
	   The confrontation broke out after Palestinian intelligence
agents searched Fatah headquarters, looking for illegal weapons. A
crackdown on unlicensed arms is one of the provisions of the
agreement.
	   The clash alarmed Palestinian leaders, who fear the pressures of
the implementing the U.S.-brokered agreement will wind up pitting
Palestinian against Palestinian. Many of its provisions, such as
reining in Islamic militants, disarming political groups and
halting anti-Israel incitement, are extremely unpopular, and will
be difficult politically for Arafat's government to impose.
	   By a margin of four to one, Israelis surveyed in a poll
published Sunday in the Yediot Ahronot newspaper supported the new
agreement. The poll questioned 505 Israeli adults, and had a 4.5
percent margin of error.
	   But politicians across the board predicted difficulties for
Netanyahu when he brings the agreement before his right-wing
Cabinet on Monday.
	   The agreement signed at the White House Friday calls for an
Israeli handover of 13.1 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian
civilian control. That means some Jewish settlements will be
surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory, except for access
roads. In all, the Palestinians will have full or partial control
over 40 percent of the West Bank.
	   Twelve hard-liners in Netanyahu's government said they would
vote against him in the no-confidence vote.
	   Netanyahu has only a one-seat majority. But left-wing lawmakers
were expected to support the prime minister in Monday's vote.
	   Hoping to calm fears, Netanyahu attempted to make overtures to
the settlers on Sunday. But his calls were mostly rejected.
	   ``I say now here to our friends listening, you are us, you are
us and we are you. We love you and we are fighting for you and
there is no other government that will fight like this,'' Netanyahu
said, mentioning settler leader Dombe by name.
	   ``I am very, very, very disappointed with the prime minister and
the ministers who participated in this deal,'' Dombe said later.
``Netanyahu is no longer the leader of our national camp.'' Dombe
said his staff would begin opinion samplings among settlers Monday
in search of a candidate to challenge Netanyahu.
	   In another development, the militant Palestinian Islamic Jihad
group said its leader in the Gaza Strip had been arrested as part
of a renewed crackdown by Arafat's police on militants. The group
also said dozens of its members had been taken into custody.
	   The larger Hamas group also announced that one its West Bank
leaders was under arrest and being held in a Palestinian jail.
Israel announced it had arrested three Hamas members suspected of
shooting to death two Jewish settlers in August.

Government candidate wins election in important Brazilian state

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with first official results and ADDS some quotes from
Covas
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ With a harsh austerity package to
be unveiled this week, voters on Sunday elected a key ally of
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso in Brazil's most important
state, the first official results showed.
	   With 57 percent of the vote counted, Sao Paulo state Gov. Mario
Covas had 56 percent of the vote, while two-time former governor
Paulo Maluf had 44 percent.
	   The race in Sao Paulo, Brazil's wealthiest and most populous
state, was the most closely watched of the gubernatorial runoff
elections in 12 states and the Federal District.
	   The support for Covas, a frugal administrator and friend of
Cardoso, is a tremendous boost for the president, who is trying to
rescue Brazil from the global financial crisis.
	   Covas told reporters that the partial results showed that the
electorate ``understands that you cannot spend more than you take
in.''
	   He said ``difficult decisions will have to be made,'' and that
there will be ``less money for social projects like health and
education.''
	   In other important states, however, polls showed Cardoso's
opponents were winners.
	   In Rio de Janeiro, with 86 percent of the votes counted, Anthony
Garotinho, a radio announcer of the center-left Democratic Labor
Party, had 58 percent of the vote. His opponent, former Rio mayor
Cesar Maia, a Cardoso ally, had 42 percent and conceded defeat.
	   Former President Itamar Franco, who broke with Cardoso during
the campaign, won handily in powerful Minas Gerais state. Official
results showed that with 25 percent of the vote counted, Franco was
leading with 58 percent.Incumbent Eduardo Azeredo, of Cardoso's
Brazilian Social Democracy Party had 42 percent.
	   In the southern Rio Grande do Sul, an important farm state,
Olivio Dutra of the leftist Workers Party was leading with 55
percent. Incumbent Antonio Britto, a Cardoso backer, had 45
percent, official results showed.
	   Results from states with electronic voting machines were
expected by Monday, while returns from states that used paper
ballots would take two days longer, electoral officials said.
	   Brazil is a victim of the global financial crisis that began
last year in Asia and shifted to Russia before moving here. In the
past two months, investors have withdrawn some dlrs 25 billion from
the country.
	   Cardoso's economic team and the International Monetary Fund have
spent the past weeks working out ways to slash Brazil's deficit of
around dlrs 65 billion, or 7 percent of the gross domestic product.
	   Many of Cardoso's proposals _ which include spending cuts and
tax hikes _ require congressional approval, and governors have
tremendous influence over how legislators vote. They must be tough
enough to persuade the IMF to approve a dlrs 30 billion rescue
package.
	   As Brazilians awaited the unveiling of the package, the
elections became a referendum on the austerity measures.
	   ``Without them, Brazil will collapse,'' said Adriano Ramos, a
financial analyst in Sao Paulo who voted for Covas.
	   But many voters were unwilling to vote for more cuts.
	   Osvaldo Severino Correia, a Rio telecommunications technician,
showed his paycheck of dlrs 116 (140 reals) a month. After taxes,
he has just dlrs 95 (113 reals).
	   ``Now they want to take out more taxes,'' he said. ``I wouldn't
vote for the government candidates for anything in the world.''
	   Although voting is mandatory, observers said the turnout seemed
low and voters were subdued. Cardoso, who was re-elected Oct. 4 by
receiving more than half the vote on the first ballot, has given
Brazilians little choice.
	   Army troops were deployed in four northern states to ensure
peace. In the poor northeastern state of Piaui, the government
ordered the seizure of newspapers and magazines that carried
stories critical of incumbent Gov. Mao Santa.

A weakened Babs heads toward China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with updated wind speeds and location. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Typhoon Babs weakened into a severe
tropical storm Sunday night after it triggered massive flooding and
landslides in Taiwan and slammed Hong Kong with strong winds. The
storm earlier killed at least 156 people in the Philippines and
left hundreds of thousands homeless.
	   Babs, which packed winds of more than 140 kph (87 mph) at its
height, was downgraded to a severe tropical storm, with a wind
speed of 110 kph (68 mph) Monday morning, according to the Hong
Kong Observatory.
	   The storm was located 260 kilometers (160 miles) southeast of
Hong Kong at 2200 GMT and was moving north toward the south China
coast at 10 kph (6 mph), officials at the observatory said.
	   The typhoon dumped torrential rains on Taiwan, with Hualien and
several other eastern towns recording more than 50 centimeters (20
inches) of rain in 24 hours, meteorologists reported. Authorities
evacuated hundreds of people from their homes near flooded rivers.
	   In Taipei, the main Keelung River swelled its banks. One-third
of Hsichih town was flooded in waist-high water, and much of nearby
Wutu was also flooded. Rescuers used rubber boats and trucks to
evacuate residents from apartment blocks, officials said.
	   In eastern Ilan, a man was swept into the sea while fishing in
rough waters. Nine people were injured when their van was hit by
rockslides in eastern Taitung, police said.
	   Several domestic airports were closed, and landslides halted
traffic and trapped hundreds of people in mountains in central
Taiwan, they said.
	   In Hong Kong, four people were slightly injured when two trees
were uprooted by the wind, police said.
	   Hong Kong authorities hoisted the No. 3 typhoon signal, a
warning to residents to take precautions as gusts of 104 kph (64
mph) were recorded in some places. They also opened several
shelters for those seeking refuge.
	   Hong Kong beaches were ordered closed because of rough seas, and
fishing boats sought shelter in the harbor.
	   In the Philippines, President Joseph Estrada has declared four
provinces and a city in the worst hit area on the southern tip of
Luzon under a state of calamity. Officials in calamity zones will
be able to use emergency funds and freeze prices of commodities
with little red tape.
	   The Philippine government's Office of Civil Defense said the
death toll from Babs rose to 156 Sunday. The fatalities included 71
people who died in landslides in hard-hit Catanduanes island and 41
people who drowned, were electrocuted or died in landslides in
nearby Camarines Sur province.
	   Local officials said entire families died in San Miguel town in
Catanduanes, where virtually every house was damaged. Residents
began burying their dead in two mass graves Saturday.
	   Nearly 400,000 people were forced out of their homes, disaster
relief officials said. Tens of thousands of others were stranded as
ports were shut and ships forbidden to sail.
	   Babs was the second devastating storm to hit the Philippines
this month. Two weeks ago, Super Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74
people in the northern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.
	   Philippine weather forecasters said Sunday they were monitoring
a low pressure area over the Pacific, about 900 kilometers (558
miles) east of the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, that
could strengthen into a storm in two to three days.

Inkster outduels Sorenstam for victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDDIE PELLS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE VILLAGES, Florida (AP) _ Juli Inkster pulled away from
Annika Sorenstam over the final three holes Sunday, beating the
world's top player by three strokes in defending her title at the
Samsung World Championship of Women's Golf.
	   Inkster entered the final round trailing Sorenstam by one
stroke. Playing in a twosome with the Swede, Inkster shot a 6-under
66 to finish at 13-under 275.
	   Her 66 matched the Tierra Del Sol course record that she and
Sorenstam had set in Saturday's third round. The victory was
Inkster's first of the year and worth dlrs 137,000.
	   One of the tour's most popular players, Inkster was greeted with
bear hugs from Dottie Pepper and Brandie Burton as she walked off
the 18th green after finishing a bogey-free round.
	   Sorenstam shot 2-under 70 for her fourth second-place finish of
the year to go with four victories.
	   Pepper fired a 72 to finish at 282, in a third-place tie with
Burton. Burton shot a 69 and, like Pepper, never made a move at the
leaders.
	   That left a taut duel between Inkster _ who won this tournament
last year when it was played in South Korea _ and Sorenstam, who
leads the tour in money, scoring average and in the points race for
Player of the Year.
	   ``The key for me was that I didn't blow any shots, I didn't give
her any shots, I didn't give her any breaks,'' Inkster said.
``She's the best player in the world. It was key for me to go out,
play my game and not give in to her.''
	   Inkster tied Sorenstam at 8-under with a 10-foot birdie putt at
the par-3 fifth.
	   Inkster birdied Nos. 6-8 to get to minus-11, one stroke ahead of
Sorenstam, who equaled Inkster's birdies at 6 and 8, but parred No.
7.
	   They matched each other par for par over the next seven holes
before Sorenstam missed a 14-foot (4.2-meter) putt for birdie and
Inkster sank her 8-foot (2.4-meter) birdie attempt for a two-stroke
lead at the par-5 16th.
	   ``It was a critical hole _ but I expected Annika to make that
putt,'' Inkster said.
	   At the par-3 17th, Inkster teed off to four feet (1.2 meters)
for an easy birdie. Meanwhile, Sorenstam hit her drive into a
green-side bunker, flew the green on the sand shot and finished
with a bogey and a four-shot deficit.
	   ``I saw her shot on 17 and I knew it was perfect,'' Sorenstam
said. ``I thought I had to hole my tee shot. I haven't made a
hole-in-one in a long time and when you want it, it never
happens.''
	   Sorenstam won dlrs 78,500 and became the first player to surpass
the dlrs 1 million mark in winnings this season.
	   She did, however, widen her lead in the Player of the Year
points race.
	   While a first-place finish would have given her 30 points and a
decisive edge over Se Ri Pak, second place was worth only 12
points.
	   Pak, who finished tied for next-to-last in the 16-player field
at 292, didn't earn any points in the race and trails 225.89 to
185.99 with two official events remaining. One of those, the LPGA
Tour Championship, is worth double points.
	   ``It's not over,'' Sorenstam said. ``If I win today, I could
have relaxed a little. But I've got to play well and keep
grinding.''

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Two boys, ages 10 and 14, have been accused
of raping and killing four children whose bodies were found in an
abandoned car in the Pacific Coast state of Sinaloa, Mexican news
media reported Sunday.
	   State Attorney General Amado Zambada Senties said in a news
conference Saturday that the two boys admitted locking the four
children _ ages 1 to 6 years old _ in an abandoned car Thursday
afternoon in the municipality of Guasave, according to the reports.
The windows were rolled up and the car could not be opened from the
inside.
	   The boys returned three hours later and raped the children, who
were then semiconcious, the reports said. The boys later abandoned
the children, who suffocated inside the car. Their bodies were
discovered Friday after their families reported them missing.
	   The two boys reportedly told authorities that they didn't want
to kill the children and had planned to free them the next day.
	   The government news agency Notimex said the four victims lived
with their aunt because their mothers were working in the United
States.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's much-awaited reform
package includes spending cuts and tax increases expected to save
dlrs 25 billion (30 billion reals) next year, leading newsweekly
Veja said Sunday.
	   Details of the plan will be officially disclosed Tuesday,
government sources said, but Veja claimed it had access to the
52-page program.
	   The plan would not include additional import taxes, the magazine
said. But reforms would touch social security and labor laws.
	   According to Veja, the measures include:
	   -- Sweeping budget cuts of up to 10 billion reals (dlrs 8.5
billion), affecting mainly the Ministries of Education and Health.
	   -- An increase in the tax on financial transactions to 0.35
percent from the current 0.2 percent.
	   -- A gradual increase in social security payments by all public
servants, from 11 percent to 16 percent.
	   Brazil has been hurt badly by worldwide financial market
turmoil. Since July, when reserves stood at dlrs 70 billion, it has
lost dlrs 25 billion.
	   ___
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia of
Spain will attend a ceremony here Monday to mark peace between Peru
and Ecuador after 57 years of hostilities, officials said Sunday.
	   Peru's President Alberto Fujimori and his Ecuadorean counterpart
Jamil Mahuad will sign a treaty that sets the border between their
countries, said officials.
	   Peru and Ecuador fought in 1941, 1981 and 1995 over the 48-mile
(78 kilometer) strip of jungle. Some 600 people died in fighting.
	   The treaty was brokered by the United States, Brazil, Argentina
and Chile.
	   The terms end Ecuador's hopes of redrawing the border although
it will keep one square kilometer, or nearly half a square mile, of
land that both nations claim.
	   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, Argentina's
Carlos Menem and Chile's Eduardo Frei are expected to attend the
ceremony.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Italy's Loris Capirossi won the
1998 250-cc world championship Sunday in the Argentine Gran Prix
even though he was disqualified for bumping Japan's Tetsuya Harada
in the race's final lap.
	   Capirossi finished the race in second place, and was awarded the
year's championship. But Harada protested Capirossi's tactics in
the race's final moments and race officials ruled in the Japanese
rider's favor hours after the end of the race.
	   As a result, the Italian rider was stripped of his finish along
with the 20 points award.
	   Nevertheless, Capirossi finished the year with 204 points, three
ahead of fellow countryman Valentino Rossi, the winner of today's
race and retained his championship.
	   Australian Michael Doohan capped off a championship winning
season in the 500-cc race, with another dominating performance in
the year's final race. He was never challenged as he paced the
entire race.
	   Doohan, who sat in the pole position, led the 21-rider pack by
as much as five seconds. He finished the 27-lap race in a time of
47 minutes and 7.332 seconds, ahead of Japan's Tadayuki Okada.
	   The victory gave Doohan 260 points in the season's final
standings, ahead of Italy's Massimiliano Biaggi who finished with
208. Spain's Alex Criville followed with 198 points.
	   Doohan captured the season championship _ his fifth consecutive
_ with a victory earlier this month at the Australian Gran Prix.
	   The 250-cc race provided all of the day's excitement as all eyes
were on Capirossi and Japan's Tetsuya Harada who were battling for
the season's championship.
	   Coming into the race, Capirossi held a slim four point advantage
over Harada in the standings.
	   The two riders swapped the top two positions most of the 25-lap
race, looking to overtake one another at every turn.
	   Capirossi lead most of the race. But Harada snatched the lead
back on the 22nd lap. Seconds later, the Italian rider sped by him
to move back into the top position heading into the race's final
laps.
	   But Rossi, who had been riding in third, overtook the
second-place Harada on the next lap.
	   Rossi took the lead away from Capirossi on the race's final lap.
	   And Capirossi and Harada were left to resume their battle for
the year's championship.
	   Harada then passed Capirossi, pushing him back to third place.
	   Going into the final turn, Capirossi moved up behind Harada to
pass him on his right. Harada stayed high, but seeing his
challenger making his move, he moved his bike over, trying to close
the line.
	   Capirossi slipped by, catching the side of the Japanese rider's
motorcycle. Harada's Aprilia bike fell to the ground and spun out
into the dirt.
	   As Capirossi rode on to the championship, Harada threw his
gloves to the ground in disgust.
	   Rossi's victory, in a time of 44 minutes and 26.581 seconds,
catapulted him into second in the season's standings, and Harada
dropped to third. He also won rookie of the year honors.

Gunfire over grave at funeral missed by international observers

	   KRAJKOVA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Mourners ran away or dived for cover
Sunday when gunfire whistled overhead at the funeral of an
11-year-old Albanian boy believed slain by Serbs.
	   Journalists filmed and photographed the chaos. But international
observers sent to Kosovo to witness such violence left before the
funeral began, with one observer saying their presence wouldn't
protect the mourners from more gunfire.
	   The boy's death and the refusal of foreign diplomats to attend
his burial demonstrated the difficulties facing the international
community in forcing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
comply with the Oct. 12 agreement that averted NATO airstrikes on
his forces.
	   The agreement calls for a cessation of hostilities and the
withdrawal of extra police and military forces sent into Kosovo in
February as part of an offensive against ethnic Albanians fighting
for independence.
	   But sporadic violence continues, and there are signs of
increasing Serb intimidation to prevent ethnic Albanian refugees
from returning to some villages.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in the fighting and an
estimated 300,000 have been driven from their homes in Kosovo, a
province of the main Yugoslav republic, Serbia.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the threat of NATO
airstrikes would remain in place until Milosevic reduces forces to
pre-conflict level.
	   ``He has made progress but he needs to try an awful lot
harder,'' Cook said in an interview with the British Broadcasting
Corp. ``I think that when on Tuesday we review this, we may well
come to the conclusion we cannot yet relax our guard, we cannot
stand down the planes, we need further progress before we relax
that order.''
	   On the ground, however, daily violence showed little sign of
abating.
	   The boy, Shemsi Elshani, was killed Saturday while helping his
father and cousin chop wood behind this mountain village 30 kms (18
miles) west of Pristina, according to the boy's father, Rashit
Elshani.
	   He blamed Serb police, saying his son died simply because he's
Albanian. Police have been shooting in the area every night to try
to scare off villagers, he said. Serb officials were unavailable
for comment.
	   ``Even if you're unarmed, they're going to shoot you,'' Elshani
said while his only surviving son, 7-year-old Dardan, hugged his
leg. ``We'd been there for two hours cutting trees and carrying
them.''
	   His wife, Hasime, also 37, fainted repeatedly beside Shemsi's
bloodied body, still clad in the blue jeans, blue shirt and jacket
he wore when he died.
	   ``They will come to shoot us, and they will take my Dardan and
slit his throat,'' she said, sobbing.
	   A team of European diplomats and an American team of the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission came to the house, but all left before
the burial.
	   Gunfire from a hill about a kilometer (about half a mile) away,
the same area from where the fatal shots came, sounded several
times after the diplomats arrived.
	   The Europeans eventually drove away, while the American observer
team questioned Rashit and called its headquarters before leaving.
	   Villagers asked team leader Norman Olsen to attend the funeral
because they believed his presence would stop further shooting, but
he declined.
	   ``Even though we have armored vehicles, if somebody is
determined to shoot more people, they won't stop for us,'' Olsen
said before leaving. ``Our presence at the gravesite will not
protect you. If any diplomat tells you otherwise, he's wrong.''
	   Scores of people walked up the hillside for the burial in a
fresh grave next to six others, including an uncle of Shemsi killed
Sept. 25 during a Serb offensive in the area.
	   When mourners started to disperse, more gunfire erupted from the
far hill. Some people ran down the hill while others lay on the
ground
	   Also Sunday, two top NATO generals left Belgrade after two days
of talks in which they pressured Yugoslav political and military
leaders for further troop withdrawals from Kosovo, a diplomatic
source said.
	   During a meeting with Milosevic, NATO military commander U.S.
Gen. Wesley Clark on Sunday ``made clear the need for significant
compliance on the ground by Tuesday,'' said White House spokesman
Barry Toiv.
	   Meanwhile, President Bill Clinton, while on a fund-raising trip
in California, spoke for about 30 minutes by telephone Sunday with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair about ``the need to continue to
keep the pressure on and how they expect Milosevic to fulfill his
commitment.''

	   MIAMI (AP) _ Olindo Mare kicked four field goals, including a
43-yarder with 10:24 left in overtime, as Miami beat New England
12-9 Sunday in a showdown of AFC East co-leaders.
	   The Patriots had won the four previous games against Miami,
including three last season, but the Dolphins turned the tables
without scoring a touchdown. Miami (5-2) took over sole possession
in the division, and the injury-plagued Patriots (4-3) slipped to
second with their second consecutive defeat.
	   Dan Marino moved Miami 52 yards in the final two minutes of
regulation to set up Mare's game-tying 25-yard field goal. In
overtime, a pass interference penalty on Ty Law on third-and-10
allowed Miami to keep possession deep in its own territory, and
Marino's completions of 25 and 10 yards set up Mare's game-winner.
 &UR; Jets 28, Falcons 3 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Curtis Martin rushed for more
than 100 yards for the fourth straight game, Vinny Testaverde threw
for two TDs and Anthony Pleasant led a stingy defense as the New
York Jets beat the Atlanta Falcons 28-3 Sunday.
	   Jerome Henderson went 53 yards with a fumble return and Keith
Byars had a 22-yard TD reception for the Jets (4-3), who shut down
the Falcons and their 44-year-old quarterback Steve DeBerg.
	   Atlanta (5-2) was held to 55 yards on the ground, including 46
by leading NFC rusher Jamal Anderson. DeBerg went 9-for-17 for 117
yards and an interception in just under three quarters.
 &UR; Packers 28, Ravens 10 &QC; 
	   In Green Bay, Wisconsin, Brett Favre broke out of his three-week
funk by throwing for two touchdowns and running for one, Roell
Preston got his third TD return of the season and LeRoy Butler was
turned loose on the blitz as the Packers beat the Baltimore Ravens.
	   The Packers, who lost back-to-back games after their first 4-0
start in 32 years, won for the first time since Sept. 27.
	   The Ravens (2-5), who extended their skid to 13 quarters without
an offensive touchdown, lost their third straight behind bungling
quarterbacks Eric Zeier and Jim Harbaugh.
 &UR; Vikings 34, Lions 13 &QC; 
	   In Pontiac, Michigan, Randall Cunningham threw two touchdown
passes and the Minnesota Vikings scored 17 consecutive points in
the third quarter to remain undefeated.
	   Robert Smith rushed for 134 yards on 19 carries, including a
57-yard touchdown to clinch it for the Vikings (7-0), who defeated
Detroit (2-5) for the second time this season.
	   Lions rookie Charlie Batch, who made his NFL debut at Minnesota
in the third game of the season, was 20-of-37 for 231 yards with
one TD pass and one interception. But Detroit was hurt by sloppy
play, which resulted in 14 penalties for 169 yards.
 &UR; 49ers 28, Rams 10 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, Steve Young threw three touchdown passes and
Darnell Walker had two first-half interceptions that led to scores
as the San Francisco 49ers beat the St. Louis Rams for the 16th
straight time.
	   Jerry Rice set an NFL record by catching a pass in 184
consecutive games, Terrell Owens scored twice and the 49ers (6-1)
sacked Tony Banks eight times.
	   Rice broke the mark for consecutive games with a catch set by
Art Monk from 1980-95 and became the first receiver to top 17,000
career yards, finishing with four catches for 64 yards.
 &UR; Saints 9, Buccaneers 3 &QC; 
	   In New Orleans, Doug Brien kicked three field goals, including a
50-yarder, to help the New Orleans Saints snap their three-game
losing streak.
	   Both teams were inept on offense, with Tampa Bay getting just 11
first downs and New Orleans 12. Each team was 4-for-16 on
third-down conversions.
	   The Saints (4-3), ranked 23rd in the NFL in offense, gained only
266 yards. The Buccaneers (3-4) continued their streak of not
scoring a first-half offensive touchdown this season.

O'Leary succeeds Graham at Leeds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ Leeds United announced Sunday that former
Irish international center-back David O'Leary had been appointed
the club's manager in succession to George Graham, who has moved to
Tottenham.
	   After days of speculation that Leicester's Martin O'Neill would
take the job, O'Leary signd a 2 1/2 year contract. O'Neill decided
last week to stay at Leicester.
	   ``I am delighted David has agreed to become manager,'' said
Leeds owner Peter Ridsdale.
	   ``It has all been sorted out, and I am convinced David will be a
very successful manager for Leeds United.''
	   There was speculation that O'Leary might follow Graham to
Tottenham as his assistant and the former Arsenal center-back asked
for time to think over the appointment at Elland Road.
	   ``I am absolutely delighted,'' O'Leary said. ``This is a great
opportunity for me. I know it's a hard job, but what a job to start
your managerial career with.
	   ``I am flattered to get a chance like this. I played all my
career at the top with Arsenal and now I am starting as a manager
at the top.
	   ``I had to be satisfied with promises about money for new
players and I've got the guarantees I was looking for,'' O'Leary
said.
	   ``I have learned a lot under George, but I shall be my own man
and produce a team playing my kind of football.''
	   O'Leary, who was a Leeds coach under Graham, has been caretaker
manager since the former Arsenal manager moved on to White Hart
Lane. He would have been in charge of the Leeds team in last
Tuesday's UEFA Cup game at AS Roma but for a UEFA ban imposed for
making comments to the match officials. Leeds lost the game 1-0 but
still has the second leg to come.

	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Driving rain squalls spawned by
Hurricane Mitch _ a dangerous storm with 150-mph (240-kph) winds _
forced churches to cancel Sunday services and flooded some streets
in the Jamaican capital Sunday.
	   Under dark, menacing skies, seaports closed and buses and taxis
stayed off Kingston's streets as Mitch, the 13th named storm of the
Atlantic hurricane season, swirled in the western Caribbean Sea.
	   Mitch, a powerful Category 4 hurricane, could also threaten the
Cayman Islands, Cuba, Honduras and Colombia's tiny islands off
Central America, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.
	   A tropical storm warning was posted for the Cayman Islands,
which remained under a hurricane watch along with parts of Cuba. A
hurricane warning in Jamaica was discontinued Sunday evening, but
forecasters expected rain storms through Monday.
	   At 2100 GMT, Mitch was about 190 miles (305 kilometers)
south-southeast of Grand Cayman. Crawling west-northwest at 8 mph
(13 kph), its hurricane-force winds of at least 74 mph (118 kph)
extended 70 miles (110 kilometers) from the center.
	   Earlier Sunday, sheets of rain reduced visibility to a few yards
(meters) as squalls pelted Kingston and Jamaica's eastern
districts. Some roads were blocked with debris from surging seas;
and authorities warned of mudslides and flash floods, especially in
the mountains.
	   Residents cleared shelves of bakery items, batteries and other
goods at the few Kingston markets open Sunday morning.
	   Several airlines canceled flights, although the Kingston and
Montego Bay airports remained open.
	   In the Cayman Islands, a British colony of about 28,000, some
boat owners secured their vessels and residents stocked up on food,
water, batteries and other essentials. The government allowed
markets _ normally closed by law on Sunday _ to open and ordered
public works employees to report to work.
	   The annual Pirates Festival and street parade was rescheduled
for next weekend, and a planned release of 400 endangered green sea
turtle hatchlings from Grand Cayman was postponed indefinitely.
	   In Cuba, civil defense authorities began warning citizens in the
eastern part of the island on Sunday. Cuba's eastern half was
battered by Hurricane Georges one month ago.
	   Information about the hurricane's location and movement was
broadcast on national and regional television and radio stations.
Civil defense warning centers, which oversee evacuations and
temporary shelters, were activated.
	   As the storm subsided in Negril, on Jamaica's west coast, some
tourists took advantage of a choppy sea to go body-surfing along
the city's seven-mile-long (11-kilometer-long) beach.
	   ``We were a bit worried, there,'' said Alan Weiss of Annapolis,
Maryland. ``But now it's clearing up.''
	   Some residents and businesses had stockpiled food and plywood to
board windows in case Mitch threatened.
	   ``I think a lot of people panicked because the local papers
reported that it was going to be a hit,'' said O'mar Robinson,
manager of the Point Ciana Beach Resort.
	   ``I think this is as rough as it's going to get,'' he said,
pointing to a sea that smashed within 10 feet (three meters) of a
seaside bar and waters that covered the usual 30 feet (nine meters)
of beach.
	   Jamaica was last struck by Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, which
killed 45 people. But the island was spared by Hurricane Georges, a
storm that killed more than 500 during its rampage through the
northeast Caribbean last month.

Rice sets consecutive games reception record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with postgame quotes. New to some points. &QL; 
 &UR; By R.B. FALLSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Jerry Rice didn't waste any time adding another
NFL record to his collection Sunday.
	   Rice extended his pass-catching streak to 184 straight games
with a 12-yard reception on San Francisco's first offensive play in
a 28-10 victory over the St. Louis Rams.
	   That broke the mark for consecutive games with a catch set by
Art Monk from 1980-95.
	   ``There's no doubt (Monk) was one of the best receivers to ever
play the game and it's an honor to break his record,'' Rice said.
``Art Monk, he was an ideal receiver. The thing I liked about him
was that he would show up for every game and go out there and
play.''
	   Rice also is the NFL's career leader in touchdowns (170),
touchdown receptions (159), total receptions (1,092) and yards
receiving (17,018).
	   San Francisco quarterback Steve Young said the latest record
means more because the 49ers have been one of the dominant teams in
the NFL.
	   ``I think it's neat that it came over a period of time when
we've won championships and been successful,'' Young said. ``We've
had to work for every one because people the last four or five
years knew the ball was going to Jerry.''
	   Rice missed 14 games last season with two serious knee injuries,
ending his consecutive-game playing streak at 189. But the
reception streak didn't end because Rice was not in uniform for any
of those games.
	   The Rams double-covered Rice much of the game, holding him to
four catches for 64 yards.
	   ``I think I'm at a point right now where I'm not thinking about
my knee,'' Rice said. ``Whenever you have a injury like that, you
have to protect that knee.
	   ``Once I get to the point where I'm not working my right side as
hard and everything balances out, I think everything is going to
fall in place.''
	   Rice leads the 49ers with 35 catches for 563 yards and has four
touchdowns.
	   ``I think Jerry is going to get better and better as he
continues to play and practice,'' coach Steve Mariucci said. ``He's
feeling more confident and he's going to get better as the season
goes on.''

	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Five weeks after armed Basque separatists
declared a cease-fire, regional elections Sunday showed voters
still sharply divided over creating an independent Basque state in
northern Spain.
	   With 99 percent of the vote counted, the pro-independence Basque
Nationalist Party had won 21 of the house's 75 seats, earning the
right to form the next area government.
	   Herri Batasuna, the party linked to the armed group ETA, gained
three seats for a total of 14, said Basque Interior Minister Jose
Maria Atutxa.
	   Two anti-independence parties _ Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar's ruling Popular Party and the Socialist Party _ combined to
win 30 seats.
	   ETA's announcement last month of a cease-fire in its 30-year
fight for an independent homeland in northern Spain had fueled
speculation that pro-independence parties would make major
electoral gains.
	   Aznar, on the other hand, hoped a strong performance by
anti-independence parties would give him and other nationalists
more clout in attempts to resolve one of Western Europe's last
regional conflicts.
	   In all, the major pro-independence parties gained two seats,
while anti-independence parties gained seven. But the divided
parliament demonstrated that voters remain as split as before.
	   Officials said 70.8 percent of the 1.8 million registered voters
turned out despite chilly, rainy weather _ a nearly 11 percent
increase over the turnout in the last election in 1994.
	   The election is the sixth since the central government in Madrid
granted Basques broad autonomy in 1979.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968. It started
its cease-fire Sept. 18, making this the first regional election
held without a threat of violence.
	   Aznar says there can be no peace process until ETA accepts the
results of the elections and renounces violence for good.

<TEXT>
	   PASADENA, California (AP) _ The expansion Chicago Fire ended
D.C. United's two-year reign as Major League Soccer's only champion
with a 2-0 victory Sunday in the MLS Cup.
	   In the process, coach Bob Bradley finally won a game against his
longtime friend and former boss, Bruce Arena.
	   Jerzy Podbrozny and Diego Gutierrez scored goals 16 minutes
apart in the first half and goalkeeper Zach Thornton and the Fire
defense did the rest before a crowd of 51,350 at the Rose Bowl on a
warm, sunny day.
	   Bradley's long association with Arena includes 1996 and 1997,
when he was Arena's assistant as D.C. United won the new league's
first two championship games. Arena, who already owned an NCAA
tournament win over his pal, guided D.C. United to two
regular-season victories over Bradley's Fire this year, by scores
of 3-1 and 4-1.
	   Arena is widely regarded as the top candidate for the vacant
U.S. national team job.
	   Thornton had eight saves as the Fire shackled United's
high-powered offense, including league MVP Marco Etcheverry and
strikers Jaime Moreno and Roy Lassiter. D.C. outshot the Fire 22-10
and held an 8-4 edge in shots on goal, including 6-0 in the second
half.
	   The first half featured continuing attacks by both sides, with
D.C. taking three shots in the opening four minutes, and Chicago
also came forward on the attack, coming closest to scoring early
when Chris Armas' shot was cleared by United defender Jeff Agoos
just inches from the line six minutes into the game.
	   Podbrozny, a native of Poland who is one of a quartet of
Chicago's ``Eastern Bloc'' players, finished what was a textbook
bit of passing to give Chicago the lead in the 29th minute.
	   Gutierrez started the sequence just outside the D.C. box,
passing to Lubos Kubik, from the Czech Republic. Kubik passed the
ball to Peter Nowak of Poland, who fed Ante Razov as the United
defenders tried an offsides trap. Razov rolled a perfectly paced
pass beyond the defensive line and Nowak sprinted to the ball and
dribbled toward the left post, with goalie Tom Presthus forced to
come out on him.
	   Nowak rolled the ball slowly across the goal mouth and the
charging Podbrozny tapped it into the open net to complete a
scoring sequence in which half the Fire's position players touched
the ball.
	   Gutierrez, a Colombian who missed all of last season with Kansas
City because of torn ligaments in his left knee, gave Chicago a pad
by being in the right place at the right time in the closing
seconds of the first half. Nowak got off a shot toward the center
of the goal that Presthus could have stopped, but the ball
deflected off Gutierrez and veered into the left corner of the
goal.
	   With a two-goal lead in the second half, Chicago returned to the
defensive stance that was its trademark during the regular season
and a two-game sweep of Los Angeles in the conference playoffs.
	   The ties between Bradley and Arena go back to 1982-83, when
Bradley was an assistant under Arena at the University of Virginia.
Bradley left to become head coach at his alma mater, Princeton, and
he guided the Tigers to the NCAA semifinals in 1993 _ where they
lost to Virginia and his old boss.
	   Arena hired Bradley again for D.C. United for the inaugural
season of MLS, and also called on him to serve as his assistant for
the 1996 U.S. Olympic team.
	   Thornton, out of Loyola of Maryland, played a total of just six
games in is first two MLS seasons with the New York/New Jersey
MetroStars, and was expected to remain on the bench behind starter
Jorge Campos at Chicago. But Thornton impressed Bradley enough to
move ahead of Campos, with Campos eventually leaving to return to
Mexico and Thornton having a league-leading 1.17 goals against.

Elam ties 63-yard field goal mark
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Denver's Jason Elam kicked a 63-yard field goal on
Sunday, tying Tom Dempsey's 28-year-old NFL record.
	   Elam's kick, which came at the end of the first half, matched
the record Dempsey set for the New Orleans Saints against Detroit
on Nov. 8, 1970.
	   Elam's field goal gave Denver a 27-10 halftime lead over the
Jacksonville Jaguars.
	   He would not have had a chance to tie the record if not for
confusion on the Broncos' sideline.
	   Denver faced a fourth-and-3 at the Jacksonville 40-yard line
with no timeouts left and time expiring. But instead of kicking
immediately, the Broncos were called for a 5-yard delay-of-game
penalty with four seconds left.
	   That meant Elam faced a 63-yard kick instead of a 58-yarder.
	   Elam came onto the field apparently expecting to attempt the
shorter kick, but moved back and made the longer one after the
penalty was marched off.
	   His kick barely cleared the crossbar, and the Broncos sideline
erupted when it went through. A beaming Elam clutched the ball as
he sprinted into the locker room for intermission.
	   Elam's kick bettered the Denver record of 57 set by Fred
Steinfort in 1980.

Government candidate wins election in important Brazilian state

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with latest official results and ADDS quotes from Rio
winner. &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ With a harsh austerity package to
be unveiled this week, voters on Sunday elected a key ally of
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso in Brazil's most important
state, official results showed.
	   With 96 percent of the vote counted, Sao Paulo state Gov. Mario
Covas was the apparent winner with 56 percent of the vote. Two-time
former governor Paulo Maluf had 44 percent.
	   The race in Sao Paulo, Brazil's wealthiest and most populous
state, was the most closely watched of the gubernatorial runoff
elections in 12 states and the Federal District.
	   The support for Covas, a frugal administrator and friend of
Cardoso, is a tremendous boost for the president, who is trying to
rescue Brazil from the global financial crisis.
	   Covas told reporters that the partial results showed that the
electorate ``understands that you cannot spend more than you take
in.''
	   He said ``difficult decisions will have to be made,'' and that
there will be ``less money for social projects like health and
education.''
	   In other important states, however, polls showed Cardoso's
opponents were winners.
	   In Rio de Janeiro, with all the votes counted Anthony Garotinho,
a radio announcer of the center-left Democratic Labor Party, was
elected with 58 percent of the vote. His opponent, former Rio mayor
Cesar Maia, a Cardoso ally, had 42 percent and conceded defeat.
	   ``I will support the (austerity) measures, but with
restrictions,'' Garotinho said. ``They are important for the
country but they can't bring states to a standstill.''
	    &UR; Former President Itamar Franco, who broke with Cardoso during
the campaign, seemed headed toward victory in powerful Minas Gerais
state. Official results showed that with 62 percent of the vote
counted, Franco was leading with 58 percent. Incumbent Eduardo
Azeredo, of Cardoso's Brazilian Social Democracy Party had 42
percent.
	   In the southern Rio Grande do Sul, an important farm state,
Olivio Dutra of the leftist Workers Party was leading with 52
percent, after 81 of the votes were counted. Incumbent Antonio
Britto, a Cardoso backer, had 48 percent, official results showed.
	   In the Federal District of Brasilia, final results showed
Cardoso ally Joaquim Roriz elected by a 52 to 48 percent margin
over Cristovam Buarque of the leftist Workers Party.
	   Cardoso opponents were leading in two other states, while his
allies led in six.
	   Twelve pro-Cardoso governors and two opponents were elected in
the first ballot on Oct.4.

	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Driving rain squalls spawned by
Hurricane Mitch _ a dangerous storm with 150-mph (240-kph) winds _
forced churches to cancel Sunday services and flooded some streets
in the Jamaican capital Sunday.
	   Under dark, menacing skies, seaports closed and buses and taxis
stayed off Kingston's streets as Mitch, the 13th named storm of the
Atlantic hurricane season, churned westward in the western
Caribbean Sea.
	   Mitch, a powerful Category 4 hurricane, could also threaten the
Cayman Islands, Cuba, Honduras and Colombia's tiny islands off
Central America, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.
	   A tropical storm warning was posted for the Cayman Islands,
which remained under a hurricane watch along with parts of Cuba. A
hurricane warning in Jamaica was discontinued Sunday evening, but
forecasters expected rain storms through Monday.
	   At 0000 GMT, Mitch was about 195 miles (310 kilometers) south of
Grand Cayman. Crawling west at 8 mph (13 kph), its hurricane-force
winds of at least 74 mph (118 kph) extended 70 miles (110
kilometers) from the center.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   OFRA, West Bank _ Furious over Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's peace agreement with the Palestinians, settlers said
they would launch an intense lobbying effort ahead of a
no-confidence vote in parliament on Monday. At least 12 lawmakers
in Netanyahu's fragile coalition were expected to vote in favor of
bringing the government down. But left-wing lawmakers planned to
support Netanyahu. The settlers scuffled with police and took to
the streets across the West Bank on Sunday to protest the
agreement, which cedes more than 13 percent of the territory to the
Palestinians. The road-block demonstrations came several hours
before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned to Israel.
Arriving to a red-carpet welcome, Israeli leader said security
concessions won from the Palestinians during the nine-day summit
outside Washington justified the Israeli withdrawal.
(ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Both victors and losers in Iran's latest
elections on Sunday hailed the vote as a triumph for democracy,
despite the setback it might deal to President Mohammad Khatami's
reforms. Conservatives won at least 54 places on the 86-seat
Assembly of Experts in Friday's vote and moderates only 13,
although they were buoyed by the prospect of a lively opposition.
Sixteen seats went to candidates who were expected to lean toward
the hard-line camp, and three to independents who are believed
closer to the moderates. Sunday's results came as no surprise since
most moderates were dropped from the ballot in advance by the
Council of Guardians, which determines eligibility and is dominated
by hard-liners. Many moderate groups decided not to enter the race
to protest the ban on the progressive theologians. (IRAN-ELECTIONS)
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Typhoon Babs weakened into a severe
tropical storm Sunday night after it triggered massive flooding and
landslides in Taiwan and slammed Hong Kong with strong winds. The
storm earlier killed at least 156 people in the Philippines and
left hundreds of thousands homeless. Babs, which packed winds of
more than 140 kph (87 mph) at its height, was downgraded to a
severe tropical storm, with a wind speed of 110 kph (68 mph) Monday
morning, according to the Hong Kong Observatory. The storm was
located 260 kilometers (160 miles) southeast of Hong Kong at 2200
GMT and was moving north toward the south China coast at 10 kph (6
mph), officials at the observatory said. (PACIFIC-TYPHOON)
	   POERTSCHACH, Austria (AP) _ The European Union's 15 leaders
pledged Sunday to revive stalled EU reform talks and to better
coordinate their economic policies to weather global financial
turmoil. ``The sense of urgency in the economic situation is very
great indeed,'' said British Prime Minister Tony Blair after a
two-day EU summit in this Alpine lakeside resort. The summit marked
a leftward swing in EU capitals with the emergence of Gerhard
Schroeder, a Social Democrat as German chancellor, and Massimo
D'Alema, the new, former-communist Italian premier. Eleven of the
15 EU leaders are now left of center. The impetus to crank the EU
reform drive into high gear came from Schroeder, whose center-left
coalition takes office Tuesday, ending 16 years of Helmut Kohl's
conservative rule. (EU-SUMMIT)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ A month after Germany's left swept to power
in elections, the new parliament convenes Monday to set out toward
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's agenda for change. With the
Social Democrats and ecology-minded Greens jointly running the
country for the first time, both parties have pledged to buttress
the social welfare state while promising continuity in foreign
policy. On the eve of the legislature's opening session, Schroeder
promised ``a new beginning for Germany'' after 16 years of
conservative rule by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Schroeder, 54, is to
be formally elected chancellor Tuesday by the new 669-seat
parliament, which has a four-year term. He will lead the nation
through historic changes: the government's return to the prewar
capital, Berlin, next year, and the Jan. 1 debut of Europe's single
currency, the euro. (GERMANY-POLITICS)

<TEXT>
	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Five weeks after armed Basque separatists
declared a cease-fire, regional elections Sunday showed voters
still sharply divided over creating an independent Basque state in
northern Spain.
	   With 99.7 percent of the vote counted, the pro-independence
Basque Nationalist Party had won 21 of Basque Parliament's 75
seats, earning the right to form the next area government.
	   Herri Batasuna, the party linked to the armed group ETA, gained
three seats for a total of 14, said Basque Interior Minister Jose
Maria Atutxa.
	   Two national parties with branches in the Basque country opposed
to independence _ Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's ruling
Popular Party and the Socialist Party _ won 30 seats between them.
	   Aznar's party, which rejects talks with ETA or changing the
national constitution to allow secession, increased its share from
11 seats to 16.
	   The Socialists, Spain's main national opposition group which
shares the government's view on the Basque question, won 14 seats,
a gain of two.
	   Analysts said the results reflect a profound rift in the
prosperous, picturesque region that is home to one of Western
Europe's last regional armed rebels.
	   ``What this election shows more than anything else is that you
cannot build a new Basque country without both of the halves,''
said Spanish philosopher Fernando Savater, himself a Basque and an
outspoken critic of Basque nationalism. He was interviewed while
visiting Venezuela.
	   Regional President Jose Antonino Ardanza of the Nationalist
Party saw the election as a clear vote for peace and a message to
ETA.
	   ``ETA will have to interpret this election result as meaning
voters are telling it they want democracy and not armed struggle,''
Ardanza told reporters.
	   ETA's announcement last month of a cease-fire in its 30-year
fight for an independent homeland in northern Spain had fueled
speculation that pro-independence parties would make major
electoral gains.
	   Aznar, on the other hand, hoped a strong performance by his
party would give him more clout in attempts to resolve the
conflict.
	   But Sunday's results demonstrated voters as split as before.
	   Officials said 70.8 percent of the 1.8 million registered voters
turned out despite chilly, rainy weather _ a nearly 11 percent
increase over the turnout in the last election in 1994.
	   The election is the sixth since the central government in Madrid
granted Basques broad autonomy in 1979.
	   ETA _ the initials are a Basque-language acronym for Basque
Homeland and Freedom _ has killed nearly 800 people since 1968. It
started its cease-fire Sept. 18, making this the first regional
election held without a threat of violence.
	   Aznar says there can be no peace process until ETA accepts the
results of the elections and renounces violence for good.
	   The moderate Basque Nationalist Party that helped bring about
the truce by negotiating with Herri Batasuna lost one seat in the
election. It has won the most votes in the five previous regional
elections, but never a majority.
	   Although it favors eventual independence, it lends support to
Aznar's government in the national Parliament in Madrid.

	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The Red Crescent society
brought dolphins to this Gulf emirate for the first time Sunday,
hoping to raise money for needy children by entertaining other
youngsters and their parents.
	   The dolphins flown in from Italy _ Pele, Aida and Elena _ were
to perform daily for two months starting Sunday in a tent seating
800 people. The one-hour show will then move to the cities of Al
Ain and Dubai.
	   ``We will give away tickets to orphans and handicapped children,
but the money raised will go towards our work in the country and
abroad,'' said Red Crescent Society official Nabil Zahra.
	   The Red Crescent, the Muslim equivalent of the Red Cross, hopes
the show will raise dlrs 1 million. It will charge 25 dirhams (dlrs
7) for each child attending with school classes and up to 100
dirhams (dlrs 27) for other tickets.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ John Travolta, whose career began as Vinny
Barbarino on ``Welcome Back, Kotter'' and moved on to movies
ranging from ``Saturday Night Fever'' to ``Pulp Fiction,'' received
a lifetime achievement award at the 34th Chicago International Film
Festival.
	   In his acceptance speech Saturday, Travolta praised the festival
for showing ambitious independent and foreign films.
	   ``I think Chicago should be proud of that, for 34 years, it has
cared enough to keep challenging us,'' Travolta said.
	   The two-time Academy Award nominee's many other credits include
``Get Shorty,'' ``Face/Off'' and ``Mad City.'' Past winners of the
film festival award include Jodie Foster, Michael Douglas and Tom
Cruise.

	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ The man who reached the highest point on
earth in record time is girding for new mountaineering challenges,
but the search for sponsors seems more daunting than the lofty
mountain peaks.
	   Kaji Sherpa, 34, became the fastest climber of Mt. Everest, the
world's highest mountain, when he reached the summit on Oct. 17 in
a record 20 hours and 24 minutes, breaking the record set by French
alpinist Marc Bertard in 1990.
	   Bertard had covered the distance from the 5,300 meters (17,500
feet) base camp to the 8,848 meters (29,028 feet) high summit in 22
hours and 29 minutes.
	   ``My ambition now is to find new mountaineering challenges and
attempt to break other existing records,'' Kaji told reporters
Sunday on his return to Katmandu from the mountains. He had reached
the summit four previous times.
	   But before planning any expedition, finding sponsors in Nepal
would be an even bigger challenge, he said.
	   Nepal ranks among one of the poorest countries in the world and
does not have the private or public resources to sponsor a major
expedition on Everest.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ They cavorted on the big screen until a
cash-starved film company confined them to cages.
	   Now, 21 bears have earned a proper retirement in a wooded
compound after their careers as movie stars, the weekly Vasarnapi
Hirek reported Sunday.
	   When the struggling Hungarian movie company Mafilm cooped the
animals up in a back yard, the mayor of Veresegyhaz, 25 miles (40
kilometers) northeast of Budapest heard about their plight and
persuaded his town to donate a plot of land where the bears could
live.

	   DURHAM, North Carolina (AP) _ It's been more than a decade since
Thomas Wolfe's last book, ``Bonfire of the Vanities.'' It's only
natural that Wolfe thinks his latest, ``A Man in Full,'' was worth
the wait.
	   ``It's much better,'' Wolfe said before a reading Saturday at
Duke University. ``Of course, if you don't believe the last book's
your best, you're in trouble.''
	   Wolfe's reading was part of ``Duke Moms and Dads Read,'' part of
the school's parents weekend. The writer appeared dressed in his
trademark double-breasted white suit and tie, striped shirt and
two-toned shoes, accompanied by his daughter Alexandra, a Duke
freshman.
	   Wolfe's daughter told the crowd ``Bonfire of the Vanities'' was
published when she was just 7.
	   ``A Man in Full'' is a 700-page novel set in Atlanta salons of
power and Georgia plantation retreats.

	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Five weeks after armed Basque separatists
declared a cease-fire, regional elections have shown voters still
sharply divided over creating an independent Basque state in
northern Spain.
	   With 99.7 percent of Sunday's vote counted, the pro-independence
Basque Nationalist Party had won 21 of Basque Parliament's 75
seats, earning the right to form the next area government. It had
held 22 seats in the previous parliament, making it the largest
party in the outgoing legislature.
	   Herri Batasuna, the party linked to the armed group ETA, gained
three seats for a total of 14, said Basque Interior Minister Jose
Maria Atutxa.
	   Two national parties with branches in the Basque country opposed
to independence _ Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's ruling
Popular Party and the Socialist Party _ won 30 seats between them.
	   Aznar's party, which rejects talks with ETA or changing the
national constitution to allow secession, increased its share from
11 seats to 16.
	   The Socialists, Spain's main national opposition group which
shares the government's view on the Basque question, won 14 seats,
a gain of two.
	   Analysts said the results reflect a profound rift in the
prosperous, picturesque region, which is home to one of Western
Europe's last regional armed rebels.
	   ``What this election shows more than anything else is that you
cannot build a new Basque country without both of the halves,''
said Spanish philosopher Fernando Savater, himself a Basque and an
outspoken critic of Basque nationalism. He was interviewed while
visiting Venezuela.
	   Regional President Jose Antonino Ardanza of the Nationalist
Party saw the election as a clear vote for peace and a message to
ETA.
	   ``ETA will have to interpret this election result as meaning
voters are telling it they want democracy and not armed struggle,''
Ardanza said.
	   ETA's announcement last month of a cease-fire in its 30-year
fight for an independent homeland in northern Spain had fueled
speculation that pro-independence parties would make major
electoral gains.
	   Aznar, on the other hand, hoped a strong performance by his
party would give him more clout in attempts to resolve the
conflict.
	   But Sunday's results demonstrated voters as split as before.
	   Officials said 70.8 percent of the 1.8 million registered voters
turned out despite chilly, rainy weather _ a nearly 11 percent
increase over the turnout in the last election in 1994.
	   The election is the sixth since the central government in Madrid
granted Basques broad autonomy in 1979.
	   ETA _ the initials are a Basque-language acronym for Basque
Homeland and Freedom _ has killed nearly 800 people since 1968. It
started its cease-fire Sept. 18, making this the first regional
election held without a threat of violence.
	   Aznar says there can be no peace process until ETA accepts the
results of the elections and permanently renounces violence.
	   The moderate Basque Nationalist Party, which helped bring about
the truce by negotiating with Herri Batasuna, has won the most
votes in the five previous regional elections, but never a
majority.
	   Although it favors eventual independence, it lends support to
Aznar's government in the national Parliament in Madrid.

Police disperse anti-Pinochet demonstrators, more that 40 detained
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Police used tear gas and water cannons to
disperse demonstrators at the end of a massive rally to celebrate
the arrest in London of former dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
	   Police said 45 people were detained Sunday and an unspecified
number were injured, including two police officers.
	   It was not immediately known whether the detainees would face
any charges or be released after their identities were checked, as
occurred in similar protests recently.
	   Police sources said some would probably be charged with damaging
private and public property. A number of traffic lights and shop
windows were destroyed.
	   According to police, about 6,000 people gathered for several
hours in a Santiago park to listen to folk and rock bands and some
speeches at the ``party for justice'' rally, organized by leftist
and human rights groups supporting Pinochet's arrest.
	   As the peaceful gathering disolved, small groups blocked traffic
at a nearby avenue and started throwing rocks at police and at
passing vehicles.
	   Police moved in quickly, using tear gas and water cannons to
restore order within an hour.
	   A rally on Saturday by some 22,000 Pinochet supporters demanding
his release also ended in clashes with police.
	   Pinochet has been held at a London clinic where he was arrested
on Oct. 16 while recovering from back surgery. A Spanish judge
wants to extradite him and try him for genocide and terrorism for
abuses that occurred while he ruled the country from 1973 to 1990.
Pinochet now holds a special lifetime seat in the Chilean senate.

Japanese stocks fall in early trading, dollar lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks fell in early trading Monday as
investors took profits following last week's gains. The U.S. dollar
was lower against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 202.00 points,
or 1.43 percent, to 13,942.70 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
On Friday, the average fell 150.86 points, or 1.06 percent.
	   ``After the Tokyo market gained strongly last week, it is seeing
active profit-taking,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at
Tokyo Securities Co.
	   Before Friday's decline, the Nikkei had gained some 1,300
points, or 10 percent, in the preceding five trading days.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 17.78 points, or 1.67 percent, to 1,050.37
points. The TOPIX closed down 6.14 points, or 0.57 percent, on
Friday.
	   In currency trading, the dollar bought 118.59 yen, down 0.55 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo but above its New York level of 117.95
yen in late Friday.
	   The dollar's relative strength from Friday's New York levels
came amid renewed concern about the health of Japan's financial
system.
	   Trader attention shifted to Japan's financial sector late last
week after credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service placed
four Japanese banks under review for possible ratings downgrades.
	   The Japanese government on Thursday officially placed the
nation's troubled Long-Term Credit Bank under temporary control,
the first such measure taken under new bank rescue legislation
passed into law earlier this month.
	   Some traders said fears that some other Japanese banks may face
a similar fate to that of LTCB was supporting the dollar against
the Japanese currency.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.870 percent from Friday's finish of 0.860 percent,
driving its price down to 108.27 yen from 108.37 yen.

Police seize property of fined daily
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Police raided the office of a
prominent independent daily late Sunday, taking away equipment to
forcefully collect a fine that its publisher and editor had been
ordered to pay for alleged anti-state activity.
	   The police also surrounded the apartment building of Slavko
Curuvija, the editor, preparing to seize his property and enforce a
court ruling ordering him to pay 400,000 dinars (dlrs 41,000) for
``trying to undermine the constitutional order'' of Yugoslavia.
	   It was the latest step in the government's crackdown on
independent media and opponents of Yugoslavia's autocratic
president, Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Serbian parliament, controlled by Milosevic's Socialists and
ultranationalists, passed a controversial media law on Tuesday that
banned Serbian-language programs by foreign media and empowered the
authorities to punish publishers and journalists for any articles
or photos deemed damaging to the state.
	   Independent legal experts and journalists say the law reimposes
censorship that Serbia formally abandoned in the 1980's and drags
Serb-led Yugoslavia back toward single-party dictatorship.
	   On Friday, a Belgrade court ruled that Curuvija, the DT Press
company, another editor and a magazine manager violated the law by
publishing an article that accused Milosevic of introducing
``dictatorship'' and leading the country into political and
economic chaos.
	   The article, along with two disputed photographs, appeared in
Evropljanin (European) weekly, also published by DT Press and
edited by Curuvija, from the same premises in downtown Belgrade.
	   Dozens of desks, telephones and other equipment were loaded onto
trucks under police supervision and taken away. This also prevented
the printing of 100,000 copies of Dnevni Telegraf's Monday issue.
	   The accused journalists said they could not and would not pay
the fines, which total 2.4 million dinars (dlrs 246,000). The fines
for Curuvija and DT Press are 800,000 dinars (dlrs 82,000) each.
The other two were charged with 400,000 dinars (dlrs 41,000) each.
	   The law was passed amid anti-Western sentiment in the country
fueled by NATO threats to launch airstrikes to end the crisis in
Kosovo. Ethnic Albanian secessionists have been battling Yugoslav
troops in the southern province.
	   Early Monday, police were still around Curuvija's apartment,
reluctant to move in after U.N. human rights official Jirzi
Dinstbir paid a sudden visit to the journalist.
	   ``What is happening now is seriously destroying the image of
your country,'' Dinstbir said. ``I will ask the international
community to support the existence of free media in Serbia.''

Lockout goes through Day 117, talks to resume soon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ After a three-hour sitdown Saturday between
David Stern, Billy Hunter and others, Sunday passed without the
opposing sides in the NBA lockout resuming collective bargaining
talks.
	   Hunter and deputy commissioner Russ Granik planned to speak by
telephone Monday morning to make plans for the next meeting, and a
source close to the talks said it was likely the sides would resume
face-to-face discussions Monday afternoon.
	   Whenever such a session materializes, it will be just the
seventh time the sides have met since the lockout was imposed by
the owners July 1.
	   The league has already canceled the first two weeks of the
season, and barring a quick settlement, the rest of the November
schedule _ and perhaps some December games _ will be canceled this
week after the league's Board of Governors meets.
	   The owners' labor committee, comprised of David Checketts
(Knicks), Mickey Arison (Heat), Gordon Gund (Cavaliers), Les
Alexander (Rockets), Jerry Colangelo (Suns), Peter Holt (San
Antonio), Larry Miller (Jazz), Jerry Buss (Lakers) and Abe Pollin
(Wizards), will meet Tuesday afternoon.
	   On Wednesday, a large turnout of players is expected in New York
when ownership representatives from each of the 29 teams hold their
general meeting.
	   Whether all those players come face-to-face with all those
owners remains to be seen.
	   The league and the union have not yet finalized plans to hold
such a large gathering, NBA spokesman Chris Brienza said.
	   By inviting all the players, Hunter seems to be gambling that if
the owners see how unified the players are, they will be more
willing to compromise. And if Stern isn't willing to soften his
hard-line stance, Hunter thinks his players will seize upon their
competitive instincts and be resolved to fight even harder.
	   By the time the week ends, basketball fans should have a better
idea of whether the sides have closed the gap. If they haven't, it
increases the chances that the entire 1998-99 season will be
scrapped _ a possibility that Stern and Granik haven't ruled out.
	   When Stern, Granik, Hunter, Patrick Ewing and attorneys for both
sides met Saturday, they were the first talks since the union held
a rank-and-file meeting in Las Vegas on Thursday that drew 240
players.
	   ``They didn't make any progress,'' Brienza said of Saturday's
discussions.
	   The owners are seeking an absolute limit on player salaries, or
a hard cap, to replace the ``soft'' cap that was exceeded last
season by more than two-thirds of the teams. By the 2000-01 season,
the league wants to have the percentage of designated revenues
devoted to salaries reduced from 57 percent to 52 percent.

Sigel runs away with Kaanapali Senior Classic
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAANAPALI, Hawaii (AP) _ Jay Sigel, who had left the door
slightly ajar for the rest of the field in the second round,
slammed it shut Sunday with a closing 3-under-par 68 to win the
Kaanapali Senior Classic.
	   Sigel, fourth on the Senior PGA Tour money list, posted a
12-under 201 total to become the tournament's first wire-to-wire
winner, finishing two strokes in front of fast-closing Hugh
Baiocchi and Larry Laoretti.
	   It also earned Sigel, who earlier this year won the Bell
Atlantic Classic, dlrs 150,000.
	   The distance between Sigel and the runners-up could have been
greater had he not made it an interesting finish by putting his tee
shot at the par-3 17th into the water. But with a three-stroke
lead, Sigel's double-bogey still held up as Terry Dill, who was
second, bogeyed the hole.
	   Baiocchi closed with a 67 and Laoretti had a 69.
	   Dill dropped into fourth when his drive at the closing hole
found water and he finished with a 70. Another stroke back at 205
were 1994 champion Bob Murphy and former local pro Steve Veriato,
both of whom had a 69 Sunday.
	   Three-time Kaanapali champion Bob Charles made a brief closing
run, but his 70 left him in a three-way tie at 206. Jim Colbert,
another former champion, had a 70 and tied with five others at 207.
	   Hale Irwin, last year's champion and this year's leading money
winner on tour, closed with a rush, but it was too late. His
closing 65 was the day's lowest round and put him at 208.
	   Sigel appeared to be in control after the first round, shooting
a course-record 10-under 61 for a three-stroke lead. But a 1-over
72 the next day, gave him only a one-stroke lead over Dill and
Laoretti.
	   After two days of ideal playing conditions, a stiff breeze blew
off the West Maui mountain and swept across the 6,590-yard (6024
meters) Kaanapali North Course during the final round.
	   It didn't bother Sigel _ until his next-to-last hole adventure,
but by then it was too late for his pursuers.
	   He held a two-stroke lead over Dill at the turn and increased it
to four before Murphy and Baiocchi started inching back in on the
back nine, but they never got closer than two shots.
	   The tournament is sponsored by EMC Corp. of Massachusetts, a
provider of enterprise storage and retrieval technology.

of an Australian colleague in Saudi Arabia wants to meet the
victim's brother to apologize for past animosity and to gather
evidence which may quash her conviction, reports said Monday.
	   In interviews from Dundee, Scotland, with The Australian
newspaper and the Australian Broadcasting Corp., Lucille McLachlan
said she wants to personally express her sympathies to Frank
Gilford for the murder of his sister Yvonne in a hospital in Saudi
Arabia in December 1996.
	   She also said Gilford has banking records which may prove her
innocence.
	   McLachlan, 32, was convicted of being an accessory to Gilford's
murder and was sentenced to eight years in jail and 500 lashes. A
second British nurse, Deborah Parry, was convicted of the murder
and sent to death row.
	   For months, Gilford refused to rule out exercising his right to
call for the death penalty. He eventually received U.S. dlrs 1
million (Australian dollars 1.7 million) compensation for waiving
that right.
	   Parry and McLauchlan were released in May after Saudi King Fahd
commuted their sentences to the 17 months already served in prison.
	   ``I would like the opportunity, obviously if Mr. Gilford was in
agreement, to meet (him) and basically apologize for what's
happened to Yvonne,'' McLachlan told the ABC.
	   ``I state I was not responsible for Yvonne's death.''
	   McLauchlan said she was sorry for saying in a diary written in
prison that Gilford was a ``greedy, selfish bastard,'' explaining
that reports she heard of Gilford's position were inaccurate.
	   ``I cannot deny that I felt very angry with him when I was in
prison in Saudi Arabia,'' McLachlan said in The Australian.
	   ``When Frank Gilford's lawyer stood up in court in May 1997 and
said that his client wanted to exercise his right to call for the
death penalty my blood chilled.
	   ``Up until then, I had heard the expression before but I never
knew what it meant until that moment. My heart sank into my
stomach, my blood froze and I literally went numb. I could not
believe that somebody would want your head cut off _ not on the
basis of the pathetic evidence against me.''
	   McLachlan said that since her release, her lawyers and family
had collected a large amount of evidence to prove her innocence.
	   ``We believe (Frank Gilford) has evidence that could clear me,''
she told The Australian.
	   Evidence used in the Saudi court included that Parry and
McLachlan had used bank cards belonging to Yvonne Gilford shortly
after the murder.
	   ``I completely deny ever having Yvonne's bank cards after her
death and I understand that (Frank Gilford) has her bank records
for that period.
	   ``The Saudis maintain that they show withdrawals of 5,000 riyals
(about U.S. dlrs 8,600) but if they do not, a large part of the
case against me fails.''
	   McLauchlan confirmed she and Parry had fallen out since their
release from prison.
	   ``All I can say is that since Deborah's returned home her
campaign to prove her innocence has basically focused on
discrediting me and believing some of the Saudi evidence ...
against me,'' McLachlan told the ABC.
	   ``I now find myself in the situation where I'm defending myself
not against the Saudis but against Deborah Parry.''

Westernization trend divides the city of a thousand minarets

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ It's 11 p.m. on Samba Night at the Fat Black
Pussycat and Jazzy Dog Cafe, and Cairo's sleek nouveau riche begin
gliding to the sexy strains of Brazilian music.
	   The less fortunate mill in the crowded street outside, stopped
at the door by a cover charge of 20 pounds (dlrs 6) _ steep by
Cairo's standards _ or by the jam nearing capacity inside the dimly
lit club, one of the capital's hottest night spots.
	   The place is brashly Western, its sparse, cream-and-black decor
slightly Mediterranean, the menu in English loosely Latino.
	   Perhaps the only hint of Egypt is the Arabic chatter that mixes
with the clink of beer bottles and the billowing smoke of cigars.
	   ``There's more life here, and there's more to do,'' said Tarek
Ghaleb, a hip, 31-year-old Egyptian just back from five years in
Canada, dressed casual but chic in black, his hair cropped close.
	   ``Things are coming from all over the place. Cairo has
changed.''
	   Remarkably so.
	   The largest city in Africa and the Middle East and a metropolis
at the heart of the Muslim world, Cairo is undergoing a
transformation as sweeping as any in its 1,000-year history,
redefining lifestyles, traditions, even the skyline.
	   But the pace and breadth of that Westernization is provoking
anxiety and unease in America's biggest Arab ally. From
intellectuals to the denizens of grimy cafes come warnings that
social divisiveness may be nearing a new flashpoint _ one pitting
East against West and poor against rich in a fight that could rival
the six-year Islamic insurgency that has largely been crushed by
the government.
	   The situation could hold lessons _ and cautions _ for other
cities in the Arab world and elsewhere grappling with
Westernization.
	   Cairo's history since mid-century has been marked by periodic
spasms of envy unleashed: on ``Black Saturday'' in 1952 when crowds
burned banks, bars and the landmark Shepheard's Hotel, or in 1977
when Egyptians angered by price hikes rioted against Anwar Sadat's
government, chanting ``Sadat dresses in style while we live seven
to a room.''
	   Such social divisions, some warn, provide fertile ground for
opposition, be it an organized campaign by Islamic militants or a
sudden flash of violent dissent _ like the anti-Western riots that
raced through Cairo in 1986.
	   ``We are polarizing the environment into two extremes,'' said
Abdel-Halim Abdel-Halim, an architect and social critic. ``The
inevitable result of that is an explosion, a disaster, violence and
destruction.''
	   Westernization has visited other Arab cities.
	   The sectarian diversity in Lebanon's capital, Beirut, made a mix
of East and West a matter of national survival. The oil boom
transformed Kuwait from a desert backwater that relied on pearl
diving in the Persian Gulf into a modern financial powerhouse.
	   Cairo, though, is a city apart. It remains the most important in
the Arab world _ in music, in literature, in film. With 16 million
residents, it is by far the largest. Its changes _ unleashed by
economic reforms finally bearing fruit _ are the most far-reaching.
	   Across the capital, American movies are the rage and Western
fashions the trend, all in a city that may also be one of the
Muslim world's most deeply conservative and religious.
	   Long known for its thousand minarets, Cairo now seems to have
that many Western-style, fast-food restaurants, nearly all of them
American: McDonald's, Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Subway,
Pizza Hut, hundreds representing 30 chains. A quarter-century ago,
there was just one, a lone Wimpy hamburger outlet.
	   Luxury goods, from caviar to cars, are bountiful.
	   Ruby red BMWs sit on display at the entrance of the World Trade
Center, a glittery shopping complex along the Nile. It overlooks
one of the city's biggest slums, where water buffalo are tethered
to concrete hovels in dirt alleys that wind past rotting heaps of
trash.
	   The BMWs join Mercedes as the elite's ranking status symbols.
	   Mobile phones, however, may take their place. The slogan of the
country's cellular phone company, Mobinil, is ``A mobile in
everyone's hand'' _ despite the fact that a phone's yearly
subscription and one-time deposit cost Egyptian pounds 4,250 (dlrs
1,250), or the annual per capita income.
	   Nightlife has taken a dramatic and, for many, welcome turn. One
of the latest additions is a jazz bar in Cairo's Sphinx Square.
	   Perhaps the most striking change, though, is the transformation
of the city itself. For centuries, Cairenes irrespective of class
intermingled with ease in the city's crowded warrens. Cairo was
home to affluent neighborhoods, but rich and poor still lived
together and wealth was rarely displayed outside the home.
	   Today, that display is everywhere.
	   Newspapers and television are filled with advertisements for new
suburban communities with names like Beverly Hills and Monte Carlo,
offering villas and apartments that can cost Egyptian pounds
1,700,000 (dlrs 500,000) or more.
	   One community promises its own park, school, sports club,
business center, movie theater, Internet connection, mosque, clinic
and supermarket. This in a country where the government says nearly
one-third of people live in homes with dirt floors.

CAIRO: dirt floors.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Thousands of villas, which are billed as escapes from Cairo's
thundering chaos, are even going up in a sprawling suburb that the
government originally designed to house industry and workers.
	   The suburb, known as 6th of October for the date of Egypt's
surprise attack in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, now permits Cairo's
rich to live removed from the city's squalor.
	   To the south is Katameya Heights, a community and resort that is
everything Cairo is not. Its 300 red-roofed villas spaciously
surround a man-made pond next to a 27-hole golf course stretching
across the lifeless desert. Its rolling hills are kept green by
sprinklers freely spraying water that Egypt has so little of.
	   The resort costs Egyptian pounds 24,990 (dlrs 7,350) to join
and, to many Egyptians, represents the starkest example of
resources directed to Cairo's tiny elite.
	   Ironically, its managing director, Ibrahim Abdel-Aziz, longs for
the old days.
	   ``I liked Cairo 20 years ago much better than now,'' he said.
	   ``The spirit of the people today, the greed _ money, money,
money _ it wasn't like this before. The rich are getting richer,
the poor are getting poorer, and you can see the frustration in the
streets. You can see it in their faces.''
	   Abdel-Aziz is not alone.
	   A sense of nostalgia and unease over the Westernization and
ostentatious living is apparent across the capital, captured this
year in a popular book titled ``What Happened to the Egyptians?''
	   It was followed by an article in Cairo's leading newspaper in
which prominent writer Fahmi Howeidi lamented that the aggressive,
free-market economy emerging in Cairo has overwhelmed the
``principles and honor'' that once defined Egyptian society.
	   ``There is a growing acceptance for everything that is
foreign,'' he wrote, ``from wearing Western clothes, to preferring
fast food, to an infatuation with everything that is automatic and
ready to use, to sending children to foreign schools.''
	   In parts of Cairo bypassed by a modernizing economy, that
nostalgia takes on a more threatening tone: anger and resentment at
a class of society that seems less and less Egyptian.
	   ``All these things that enter from the West, we use them in a
mistaken way. These things don't belong to us,'' said Mahmoud
Diyab, a 30-year-old sitting at a cafe around the corner from
Al-Azhar, one of the Muslim world's greatest institutions of
scholarship.
	   Such discontent has spilled over before.
	   In 1986, underpaid recruits of the Central Security Forces
mutinied, burning luxury hotels, night clubs and restaurants _
symbols of a Westernized elite from which they were alienated.
	   To Diyab, watching donkeys plod down a street bordered by the
crumbling ruins of medieval Cairo, trouble may be brewing again.
	   ``Nothing that comes from the West pleases the heart,'' he said.

	   At the intersection of Asia, Africa and Europe, Cairo has long
been a crossroads. Ibn Khaldoun, one of the medieval Muslim world's
greatest thinkers, called it the ``Mother of the World.''
	   Founded in 969 as the capital of Shiite Muslim warriors from
modern-day Tunisia, Cairo has long served as a city of conquerors.
	   The city's predecessors were overrun by the Greeks, Libyans,
Nubians, Romans and Arabs. Cairo itself fell under the sway of
Kurds, Turks, French and the English.
	   Perhaps leaving the greatest mark _ the architectural legacy
that makes Cairo one of the Muslim world's greatest capitals _ was
the construction of the awesome mosques and minarets of the
Mamluks, a corps of Turkish and Circassian soldier-slaves that rose
to rule Egypt and Syria for 250 years. Their reign ended with the
arrival of the Ottoman Turks in 1517.

	   MIAMI (AP) _ Olindo Mare kicked four field goals, including a
43-yarder with 10:24 left in overtime, as Miami beat New England
12-9 Sunday in a showdown of AFC East co-leaders.
	   The Patriots had won the four previous games against Miami,
including three last season, but the Dolphins turned the tables
without scoring a touchdown. Miami (5-2) took over sole possession
in the division, and the injury-plagued Patriots (4-3) slipped to
second with their second consecutive defeat.
	   Dan Marino moved Miami 52 yards in the final two minutes of
regulation to set up Mare's game-tying 25-yard field goal. In
overtime, a pass interference penalty on Ty Law on third-and-10
allowed Miami to keep possession deep in its own territory, and
Marino's completions of 25 and 10 yards set up Mare's game-winner.
 &UR; Jets 28, Falcons 3 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Curtis Martin rushed for more
than 100 yards for the fourth straight game, Vinny Testaverde threw
for two TDs and Anthony Pleasant led a stingy defense as the New
York Jets beat the Atlanta Falcons 28-3 Sunday.
	   Jerome Henderson went 53 yards with a fumble return and Keith
Byars had a 22-yard TD reception for the Jets (4-3), who shut down
the Falcons and their 44-year-old quarterback Steve DeBerg.
	   Atlanta (5-2) was held to 55 yards on the ground, including 46
by leading NFC rusher Jamal Anderson. DeBerg went 9-for-17 for 117
yards and an interception in just under three quarters.
 &UR; Packers 28, Ravens 10 &QC; 
	   In Green Bay, Wisconsin, Brett Favre broke out of his three-week
funk by throwing for two touchdowns and running for one, Roell
Preston got his third TD return of the season and LeRoy Butler was
turned loose on the blitz as the Packers beat the Baltimore Ravens.
	   The Packers, who lost back-to-back games after their first 4-0
start in 32 years, won for the first time since Sept. 27.
	   The Ravens (2-5), who extended their skid to 13 quarters without
an offensive touchdown, lost their third straight behind bungling
quarterbacks Eric Zeier and Jim Harbaugh.
 &UR; Vikings 34, Lions 13 &QC; 
	   In Pontiac, Michigan, Randall Cunningham threw two touchdown
passes and the Minnesota Vikings scored 17 consecutive points in
the third quarter to remain undefeated.
	   Robert Smith rushed for 134 yards on 19 carries, including a
57-yard touchdown to clinch it for the Vikings (7-0), who defeated
Detroit (2-5) for the second time this season.
	   Lions rookie Charlie Batch, who made his NFL debut at Minnesota
in the third game of the season, was 20-of-37 for 231 yards with
one TD pass and one interception. But Detroit was hurt by sloppy
play, which resulted in 14 penalties for 169 yards.
 &UR; 49ers 28, Rams 10 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, Steve Young threw three touchdown passes and
Darnell Walker had two first-half interceptions that led to scores
as the San Francisco 49ers beat the St. Louis Rams for the 16th
straight time.
	   Jerry Rice set an NFL record by catching a pass in 184
consecutive games, Terrell Owens scored twice and the 49ers (6-1)
sacked Tony Banks eight times.
	   Rice broke the mark for consecutive games with a catch set by
Art Monk from 1980-95 and became the first receiver to top 17,000
career yards, finishing with four catches for 64 yards.
 &UR; Saints 9, Buccaneers 3 &QC; 
	   In New Orleans, Doug Brien kicked three field goals, including a
50-yarder, to help the New Orleans Saints snap their three-game
losing streak.
	   Both teams were inept on offense, with Tampa Bay getting just 11
first downs and New Orleans 12. Each team was 4-for-16 on
third-down conversions.
	   The Saints (4-3), ranked 23rd in the NFL in offense, gained only
266 yards. The Buccaneers (3-4) continued their streak of not
scoring a first-half offensive touchdown this season.
 &UR; Raiders 27, Bengals 10 &QC; 
	   In Oakland, California, Donald Hollas, who hadn't thrown a
touchdown pass in six years, threw two and Napoleon Kaufman rushed
for 143 yards as Oakland won its fourth straight.
	   Hollas, making his second start in place of injured Jeff George,
threw a 19-yard TD pass to Tim Brown and a 39-yarder to James Jett
against his former team. Hollas finished 9-of-21 for 173 yards,
while Kaufman had a career-high 31 carries.
	   Lance Johnstone returned a fumble 40 yards for another touchdown
and Greg Davis added two field goals for the Raiders (5-2). Two
fumbles by the Bengals (2-5) led to Oakland touchdowns.
 &UR; Seahawks 27, Chargers 20 &QC; 
	   In San Diego, Joey Galloway scored on an 81-yard reception and a
74-yard punt return in the first half, then came up with a
controversial catch in the fourth quarter that set up Ricky
Watters' 1-yard touchdown run.
	   San Diego cut the lead on John Carney's 45-yard field goal, and
rookie Ryan Leaf moved the Chargers from their 20 to the Seahawks'
3 in the final 2:43 before throwing three straight incompletions in
the end zone to end the game.
	   Leaf had his best game as a pro, completing 25 of 52 passes for
281 yards and a touchdown. The Seahawks (4-3), coming off their bye
week, snapped a three-game losing streak. The loss dropped the
Chargers to 3-5 and interim head coach June Jones to 1-1 since he
replaced the fired Kevin Gilbride on Oct. 13.
 &UR; Bears 23, Oilers 20 &QC; 
	   In Nashville, Tennessee, Jeff Jaeger kicked a game-winning field
goal for the second straight week, a 33-yarder with 1:03 left that
lifted the Chicago Bears over the Tennessee Oilers.
	   The Oilers (3-4) had a final chance to send the game into
overtime when they moved the ball to the Chicago 38 in the final
minute. But Chicago (3-5) got a sack and forced Steve McNair to
spike the ball.
	   McNair then connected with Willie Davis for a 13-yard gain to
the 32, and the Oilers tried a 49-yard field goal in the closing
seconds. But Craig Hentrich's low kick missed, and the Oilers also
were penalized for 12 men on the field.
 &UR; Broncos 37, Jaguars 24 &QC; 
	   In Denver, Jason Elam kicked a record-tying, 63-yard field goal
and Terrell Davis became the third player to reach 1,000 yards
rushing in seven games as Denver improved to 7-0 for the first time
in its history.
	   Elam's kick at the end of the first half tied the NFL record for
longest field goal set by New Orleans' Tom Dempsey in 1970.
	   Davis, the NFL's leading rusher, finished with 136 yards to
reach 1,001 for the season. He joins Jim Brown (1958) and O.J.
Simpson (1973 and 1975) as the only players to reach the 1,000-yard
mark in seven games.
	   John Elway completed 21 of 35 passes for 295 yards and a
touchdown for the Broncos. Jacksonville's Mark Brunell was 28-of-46
for 353 yards and three touchdowns, but he was sacked seven times.

New deal in hand, Netanyahu to face Cabinet, parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Confidence vote scheduled at 1400 GMT. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Hoping to sell a new Mideast peace
agreement to hard-liners, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's first
test comes in a vote of confidence in parliament.
	   The tiny, extreme right-wing Moledet party, which opposes peace
with the Palestinians, submitted the motion to bring down
Netanyahu's government. Debate was to begin Monday afternoon.
	   Netanyahu returned to the country on Sunday from a nine-day
summit in the United States, where he agreed to a long overdue
troop withdrawal from the West Bank in return for security
guarantees from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Although Netanyahu was likely to survive Monday's vote, he faces
a difficult time selling the peace agreement to his right-wing
coalition.
	   Opposition to the deal, which calls for an Israeli troop
withdrawal from 13.1 percent of the West Bank, is growing within
Netanyahu's own coalition. At least 12 hard-liners from his own
government, backed by the powerful Jewish settler lobby, say they
will vote against the deal.
	   Netanyahu was to meet with his Cabinet Monday, but the Israeli
newspaper Haaretz reported that the ministerial meeting was
postponed for two days so Netanyahu could shore up support from
within his own Likud party.
	   After returning to Israel on Sunday, Netanyahu defended the pact
as the ``best deal,'' possible for Israel and made a plea to the
settlers to accept the accord they have already denounced.
	   ``I say now here to our friends listening, you are us, you are
us and we are you. We love you and we are fighting for you and
there is no other government that will fight like this,'' Netanyahu
said, mentioning settler leader Ahron Dombe by name.
	   Dombe said settlers were very disappointed with the deal and
would work to scuttle it. ``Netanyahu is no longer the leader of
our national camp,'' Dombe said. He said his staff would begin
polling settlers Monday in search of a candidate to challenge
Netanyahu in a future election.
	   They also planned an intense lobbying effort Monday in hopes of
swaying more votes against Netanyahu. The prime minister was
expected to easily survive the motion with the help of Israel's
dovish Labor Party.
	   A poll published by the Yediot Ahronot newspaper showed that 74
percent of the 505 Israelis questioned, support the new deal.
	   With an eye on his right-wing critics, Netanyahu issued a stern
warning to Arafat that no land would be handed over without keeping
their promises. The deal calls on Arafat's autonomy government to
crack down on military groups and disarm its own people.
	   ``With the completion of each step, they will receive. They give
and only then we give,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Honoring the deal won't be easy for Arafat, either.
	   On Sunday, violent infighting broke out between members of
Arafat's political faction, Fatah, and Palestinian security forces,
leaving one youth dead from a bullet wound to the head.
	   The confrontation broke out after Palestinian intelligence
agents searched Fatah headquarters, looking for illegal weapons. A
crackdown on unlicensed arms is one of the provisions of the
agreement.
	   Palestinian police also began arresting members of the militant
Palestinian groups of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, who threaten to
derail peace agreements by carrying out deadly attacks on Israel.

Torrijos' son chosen as Panamanian ruling party's presidential
</HEADLINE>
candidate &QL; 
 &UR; By ERIC NUNEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ The son of former Panamanian
strongman Omar Torrijos will be the governing Democratic
Revolutionary Party's candidate in next year presidential election,
primary election results showed.
	   With 25 percent of precincts counted in Sunday's primary, Martin
Torrijos had 60 percent of the vote. His closest rival, former
Agriculture Minister Alfredo Oranges, had 27 percent.
	   Although final totals weren't expected until Monday, all nine of
Torrijos' rivals conceded defeat Sunday evening.
	   Torrijos' father was a leader of a military coup in 1968 that
overthrew the 11-day-old government of President Arnulfo Arias.
Torrijos stayed in power until he was killed in a plane crash in
1981.
	   Martin Torrijos will face Arias' widow, Mireya Moscoso,
candidate of the opposition Arnulfista Party, in the May 2
elections.
	   The election will be held seven months before the United States
turns over the Panama Canal on Dec. 31, 1999.
	   Torrijos, 35, is an economist and lawyer who graduated from the
U.S. university Texas A -and- M with a degree in political science.
	   Sunday's election marked the first time that the Democratic
Revolutionary Party selected its candidate in a primary.
	   President Ernesto Perez Balladares is prohibited by law from
seeking re-election. In a referendum in August, voters rejected a
constitutional amendment that would have allowed him to seek a
second consecutive five-year term.
	   In addition to its presidential nominee, the Democratic
Revolutionary Party also selected candidates for the national
legislature, Central American Parliament, mayoral seats and local
councils.

New German parliament opens with left in control
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ A month after Germany's left swept to power
in elections, the new parliament is ready to set out toward
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's agenda for change.
	   With the Social Democrats and ecology-minded Greens jointly
running the country for the first time, both parties have pledged
to buttress the social welfare state while promising continuity in
foreign policy.
	   On the eve of the legislature's opening session Monday,
Schroeder promised ``a new beginning for Germany'' after 16 years
of conservative rule by Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   Schroeder, 54, is to be formally elected chancellor Tuesday by
the new 669-seat parliament, which has a four-year term. He will
lead the nation through historic changes: the government's return
to the prewar capital, Berlin, next year, and the Jan. 1 debut of
Europe's single currency, the euro.
	   On Monday, parliament was expected to elect its first president
from former communist East Germany. Wolfgang Thierse, a 55-year-old
Social Democrat, was active in the East German democracy movement
that brought down the Berlin Wall in 1989.
	   Amid Schroeder's talk about the future, Fred Gebhardt will
provide the link to Germany's past when he opens parliament as the
new legislature's oldest member.
	   Gebhardt, 70, joined politics as a teenager after his
grandfather, a Social Democratic lawmaker during the 1920s, was
killed by the Nazis at the end of World War II. Gebhardt won his
seat on the ticket of the former East German communists.
	   Social Democrats and Greens, who have a comfortable 21-seat
majority, cleared the way for the new administration by approving
their coalition pact at weekend conventions.
	   The program includes pledges to close nuclear power plants, tax
relief for people with average incomes, and allowing more
foreigners to become German citizens _ projects that were blocked
or unthinkable during the Kohl era.
	   For the new parliament, the ex-communists have proposed a vice
president for the first time after increasing their share of the
vote above a 5-percent benchmark on Sept. 27.
	   Conservative opponents have vowed to challenge Petra Blaess'
nomination, but her approval seemed likely after Social Democrats
and Greens said Sunday they would back her.

Japanese stocks fall in early trading, dollar lower

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with mid-morning stock, bond, currency &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks fell in sparse trading Monday as
investors took profits following last week's gains. The U.S. dollar
was lower against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average tumbled 243.49
points, or 1.72 percent, to 13,901.21 at the end of the morning
session. On Friday, the average fell 150.86 points, or 1.06
percent.
	   In currency trading, the dollar bought 118.57 yen at
mid-morning, down 0.57 yen from late Friday in Tokyo but above its
New York level of 117.95 yen late Friday.
	   Before Friday's decline, the Nikkei had gained some 1,300
points, or 10 percent, in the preceding five trading days.
	   ``After the Tokyo market gained strongly last week, it is seeing
active profit-taking,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at
Tokyo Securities Co.
	   Traders also said foreign investors were selling to make up for
Wall Street's losses on Friday, when the benchmark Dow Jones
Industrial Average lost 80 points.
	   The selling weighed on the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of
all issues listed on the first section, driving it down 18.45
points, or 1.73 percent, to 1049.70. The TOPIX dropped 6.14 points,
or 0.57 percent, on Friday.
	   The dollar's relative strength from Friday's New York levels
came amid renewed concern about the health of Japan's financial
system after credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service placed
four Japanese banks under review last week for possible ratings
downgrades.
	   But such concerns were offset by signs the Japanese government
may finally be moving to tackle the banking industry's bad loan
problem, traders said.
	   In the first nationalization of a Japanese bank since World War
II, the government took control of the troubled Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan Ltd. using new bank rescue legislation passed into
law earlier this month.
	   Public money will be used to write off the bank's billions of
dollars in defaulted loans and a buyer will be sought for the
healthy operations.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond slipped to 0.850 percent from Friday's finish of 0.860
percent, driving its price up to 108.46 yen from 108.37.

U.S. television networks cutting back on international news
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID BAUDER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Television Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In the old days, newspaper reporter Jonathan
Randal dreaded competition from TV networks on the big stories
overseas, with their free-spending correspondents and camera crews.
	   Often the networks took over the story and other journalists
followed, said Randal, who spent 20 years as a roving international
correspondent for The Washington Post. ``They had a lot of money,
they weren't shy about spending it and the results were terrific.''
	   Those days seem more distant than ever with word that the three
main U.S. networks, ABC, CBS and NBC, have approached officials at
CNN _ the cable network they all sneered at fewer than 20 years ago
_ to explore ways of joining forces to cover news outside of the
United States.
	   No agreements seem imminent, mostly because of the thorny issues
involved in cooperating with a fierce competitor. But the talks
alone illustrate how interest in overseas news has flagged and the
business landscape changed for television.
	   Cutting back international spending was a key component in a
budget-slashing plan announced by CBS News this month. Bureaus in
Moscow and Tel Aviv were downsized and international management
will be consolidated in four hubs.
	   Networks need to cut costs because declining viewership has cut
into their advertising revenues. International news is a natural
place to look in the 1990s, as American interests turned inward
toward former football star O.J. Simpson and presidential sex
scandals.
	   ``Foreign bureaus are very busy when they're busy, but there are
long periods of time when they are not busy,'' said Bob Murphy, ABC
senior vice president for hard news.
	   After a peak in 1989 when the Cold War ended, network news has
spent much less time on foreign news, researchers say. News
executives say that except for the Bosnian conflict, there have
been fewer long-running stories.
	   It's also cheaper and easier to use more entertainment-driven
news rather than complex international stories, said Ed Turner, a
former CNN executive now a fellow at the Freedom Forum's Media
Studies Center in Arlington, Virginia.
	   CNN has 24 bureaus with correspondents outside of the United
States, more than ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox combined. The networks have
other overseas offices with staff but no full-time correspondents.
	   ``We think there is a need for more international coverage,''
said Tom Johnson, chairman of the CNN News Group. ``If it were up
to Ted (Turner, CNN founder), we'd probably have a bureau in every
country.
	   ``When the other networks pull away, it gives us more of an
opportunity to serve,'' he said.
	   News executives say they look for cost savings without
diminishing their ability to cover news. They've supplemented their
ability to get breaking news video by subscribing to news services
like Associated Press Television News or Reuters Television and by
striking agreements to share material with overseas broadcasters.
	   This can bolster a network's coverage by freeing a correspondent
to explore different facets of a story, said Marcy McGinnis, CBS
News vice president.
	   One way a network could potentially work with CNN would be to
share an office, a support staff, a technical crew _ everything in
a foreign city except for the correspondent, one executive said.
	   Sharing a correspondent isn't unprecedented _ CNN's Christiane
Amanpour also works for CBS's ``60 Minutes'' _ but that's
considered more problematic. Suppose a correspondent rushes back to
the office with a big story. Who gets it first?
	   ``It could be done,'' McGinnis said. ``But it has to be done on
an equal basis ... Where it won't work is if somebody says we'll do
it for you and put you out of business.''
	   Any CNN agreement with NBC would bring special problems, since
the cable network MSNBC is a direct competitor in the 24-hour news
business.
	   Experts warn, however, that cutting costs could leave the story
lacking. Video services provide important pictures, but the story
suffers without a correspondent familiar with a country, said
Randal, now a visiting professor at Harvard University's Joan
Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy.
	   And if networks have the same people researching stories and
setting up interviews, inevitably the stories will start sounding
the same, Turner said.

Elections: President's efforts to halt economic turmoil win strong
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's
efforts to halt Brazil's growing economic turmoil have received a
strong boost with the election of a key ally as governor of
Brazil's most populous and wealthiest state.
	   Of the 13 gubernatorial runoff elections Sunday, Sao Paulo's was
perhaps the most critical to the success of Cardoso's austerity
measures, expected to be announced on Tuesday.
	   The measures, which include spending cuts and tax hikes, must be
approved by Congress, and state governors have enormous sway over
local delegations.
	   Sao Paulo's incumbent governor Mario Covas was re-elected to a
second term in office with 56 percent of the vote against 44
percent tallied for two-time former governor Paulo Maluf.
	   Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse, has a
population of more than 34 million _ nearly equal to all of
neighboring Argentina. It alone accounts for more than one-third of
Brazil's economic output and 70 of the 513 congressional seats.
	   The election of Covas, a frugal administrator and friend of
Cardoso, is a tremendous boost for the president, who is trying to
rescue Brazil from the global financial crisis.
	   Covas told reporters that the partial results showed that the
electorate ``understands that you cannot spend more than you take
in.''
	   He said ``difficult decisions will have to be made,'' and that
there will be ``less money for social projects like health and
education.''
	   ``By electing Covas, the electorate voted in favor of
austerity,'' said Health Minister Jose Serra.
	   Brazil is a victim of the global financial crisis that began
last year in Asia and shifted to Russia before moving here. In the
past two months, investors have withdrawn some dlrs 25 billion from
the country.
	   Cardoso's economic team and the International Monetary Fund have
spent the past weeks working out ways to slash Brazil's deficit of
around dlrs 65 billion, or 7 percent of the gross domestic product.
	   But while the results in Sao Paulo represent a shot in the arm
for Cardoso's deficit-reducing efforts, Cardoso opponents were
elected in three other important states.
	   In Rio de Janeiro, Anthony Garotinho, a radio announcer of the
center-left Democratic Labor Party, was elected with 58 percent of
the vote. His opponent, former Rio mayor Cesar Maia, a Cardoso
ally, had 42 percent and conceded defeat.
	   ``I will support the (austerity) measures, but with
restrictions,'' Garotinho said. ``They are important for the
country, but they can't bring states to a standstill.''
	   Former President Itamar Franco, who broke with Cardoso during
the campaign, was headed to certain victory in powerful Minas
Gerais state.
	   With 87 percent of the vote counted, Franco was leading with 58
percent to 42 percent for incumbent Eduardo Azeredo of Cardoso's
Brazilian Social Democracy Party.
	   In the southern Rio Grande do Sul, an important farm state,
Olivio Dutra of the leftist Workers Party defeated incumbent
Cardoso supporter Antonio Britto 51 to 49 percent.
	   In the Federal District of Brasilia, Cardoso ally Joaquim Roriz
was elected with 52 percent against 48 percent for Cristovam
Buarque of the leftist Workers Party.
	   Cardoso opponents were leading in two other states, while allies
of the president led in six.
	   Twelve pro-Cardoso governors and two opponents were elected in
the first ballot on Oct.4.
	   For many Brazilians awaited the unveiling of the package, the
elections became a referendum on the austerity measures.
	   ``Without them, Brazil will collapse,'' said Adriano Ramos, a
financial analyst in Sao Paulo who voted for Covas.
	   But many voters were unwilling to vote for more cuts.
	   Osvaldo Severino Correia, a Rio telecommunications technician,
showed his paycheck of dlrs 116 (140 reals) a month. After taxes,
he has just dlrs 95 (113 reals).
	   ``Now they want to take out more taxes,'' he said. ``I wouldn't
vote for the government candidates for anything in the world.''
	   Although voting is mandatory, observers said the turnout seemed
low and voters were subdued. Cardoso was re-elected Oct. 4 by
receiving more than half the vote on the first ballot.

Maier: the man to beat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOELDEN, Austria (AP) _ Winning the season's inaugural giant
slalom with disconcerting ease, double Olympic champion Hermann
Maier has proven once again this year he's the man to beat.
	   Fastest down the snow-swept Rettenbach course in both legs, the
Herminator's 1.60 second lead left many wondering if they will ever
be able to catch up.
	   Though insisting he hadn't given all he could, Maier sailed to
victory Sunday with a two-run combined time of 2 minutes, 10.74
seconds, blithely leading an Austrian sweep of the podium.
	   Despite the Austrian team's mastery over the rest of the field,
even their performance paled in comparison to Maier's, with
runner-up Stefan Eberharter trailing by 1.60 seconds, and third
place Heinz Schilchegger lagging by a massive 2.34.
	   ``I surprised myself today,'' said Maier. ``I wasn't really
expecting to win and especially with such an advantage.
	   ``I'm feeling a bit tired and I know I can still go faster.''
	   Maier has done nothing but since he emerged last season, winning
11 World Cup races as a rookie last year to clinch the overall
World Cup crown and World Cup titles in super-G and giant slalom.
	   This year, Maier's teammates have decided the chase has lasted
long enough.
	   ``I didn't have a really good first run so I know I can still
get closer to Hermann,'' said Eberharter, the Olympic silver
medalist in Nagano. ``The race didn't really reflect training as we
were much closer then. But everyone knows Hermann deals well in
these conditions.
	   ``I know I can beat him with two solid runs.''
	   He's not the only one out to tame Maier.
	   While skiers from the rest of the world are all trying to
squeeze onto the podium between Austrians, Josef Strobl, Christian
Mayer, Hans Knauss and the rest of Maier's teammates are all out to
beat him to secure their place on the team.
	   ``There's an incredible fight within the team to be the best so
we can get places on the giant slalom team,'' said Schilchegger,
climbing onto the World Cup podium for the first time of his
career. ``In the giant slalom the team is so deep that it's tough
to show you deserve to be there.''
	   Demonstrating the depth of the team, Christian Mayer finished
fourth in Sunday's race, marking the fifth time since the start of
last season that the Austrians have swept the top four places.
	   Switzerland's Michael Von Gruenigen _ who had a lock on the
discipline for two years before Maier's arrival on the World Cup
scene last season _ was the fastest non-Austrian, the two-time
World Cup champion placing fifth, 2.54 seconds back.
	   In all there were six Austrians in the top-10.
	   Last season, Austria's men became the first to win all of the
World Cup titles with Andreas Schifferer winning downhill and
Thomas Sykora slalom.
	   The team's _ but especially Maier's _ supremacy is what kindled
ugly rumors concerning the Austrian squad the past few months.
	   Earlier in the week the Swiss daily Sport quoted Swiss ski boss
Theo Nadig questioning Maier's rapid physical development. Nadig
later softened his statement, saying he just wanted to provide his
team with the same techniques.
	   After the weekend races, the season takes almost a month off
before resuming for three weekends of racing in North America
beginning, Nov. 19-22 in Park City, Utah, with men's and women's
giant slalom and slalom.
	   The circuit returns to Europe Dec. 10-13 in Val d'Isere, France,
for men's downhill and super-G and women's super-G and giant
slalom.

	   GREENSBORO, North Carolina (AP) _ Sandy Moger scored with 2:54
left to give the Los Angeles Kings a 3-2 victory over the Carolina
Hurricanes on Sunday night.
	   Moger took a pass from Mattias Norstrom and fired a shot from 50
feet (15 meters) that skidded under goalie Trevor Kidd's stick.
	   Manny Legace, making his third appearance for the Kings with

Reported child abuse increasing in Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Reports of child abuse in Japan last year soared
fivefold from seven years ago, partly because greater awareness
about the problem has encouraged more honest reporting, a
government official said Monday.
	   Reports of child abuse received in 174 children's welfare
centers nationwide rose from 1,101 in 1990 to 5,352 in 1997, said
Health Ministry official Kazuo Ohta.
	   The ministry believes the climb was caused by changing social
attitudes that have helped encourage reports of child abuse from
family members and others.
	   ``There may be even more cases that go undetected,'' Ohta said.
	   Another reason is that mothers may resort to violence when they
are under more stress in Japan's increasingly isolated, smaller
nuclear families, it said.
	   Every year, a tally of reported child abuse must be reported to
local governments, which give the findings to the ministry.
	   Last year, violence made up about half of the reported abuse
cases, and about a third came from neglect, including failing to
feed the children or to give them needed medical care.
	   Psychological abuse made up 9 percent of the cases while sexual
abuse made up 6 percent.
	   In one out of five cases, the abuse was so serious children had
to be separated from that parent, either by placing them in
institutions or relatives' homes.
	   Children's rights are still a relatively new concept in Japan.
In the past, parents were viewed as possessing absolute power over
their children, and the government had little leverage in
protecting a child from abusive parents.
	   But last year, the ministry sent out an order reminding local
governments that seriously abused children need protection.
	   Cases of the government protecting seriously abused children
from their parents, even when the parents objected, totaled 36 last
year, about double the previous year, the ministry said.

Salmon, the king of fish, in danger in Scottish Highlands
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY310-314, Graphic SCOTLAND SALMON &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT SEELY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OBAN, Scotland (AP) _ There's been a farm called Raera since
1294, and a river long before that, filled with salmon that have
jumped the rapids and waterfalls since the last Ice Age to swim
upstream and spawn.
	   Once, the ``king of fish'' was so commonplace in the Euchar
River that Raera's landlords promised not to feed salmon to farm
laborers more than three times a week.
	   Now, as Raera owner Jeremy Inglis walks the banks of his
isolated river in the Scottish Highlands, he and others fear the
wild salmon that attracted anglers from throughout the world are
heading for extinction.
	   ``This is an environmental disaster,'' Inglis says. ``Salmon was
one of the glories of Scotland.''
	   The river's problem isn't its purity. The water _ which is the
color of clear, well-brewed tea, thanks to the peat it absorbs as a
mountain stream _ is ``pristine,'' Inglis says.
	   He blames the problem on the fish farm a half-mile (800 meters)
downriver in Loch Fyne, which Inglis says produces multitudes of
sea lice parasites that live on the farmed fish and kill salmon
when they swim through to the Euchar.
	   ``We had a total catch of two salmon last year,'' Inglis says.
``We used to produce between 50 to 100 a year.''
	   Amid some of Europe's most spectacular countryside, a bitter
battle is raging between fish farmers and the river owners and
sportsmen worried about saving the remaining wild salmon.
	   Anglers groups say the fish farms are destroying not only
Scotland's wild salmon stocks but also its sea trout. In addition
to problems caused by sea lice, they blame chemical treatments used
to kill the lice and pollution from the excrement produced by
farmed fish.
	   ``There's an almost certain link between fish farming and the
decline in western Scotland of migratory fish stocks,'' said Paul
Knight, spokesman for the Salmon and Trout Association, an anglers
group.
	   Fish farmers deny they are to blame.
	   ``In terms of statistics, this decline goes back to 1952. The
salmon industry in Scotland did not get going until the 1980s,''
said William Crowe, spokesman for the Scottish Salmon Growers
Association.
	   The commercial operations produce the Scottish salmon and smoked
salmon that sell in supermarkets worldwide _ competing with farmed
salmon from countries like the United States, Norway, Ireland,
Chile and Canada.
	   Supporters note the farms have lowered the price of salmon _
once the preserve of the wealthy _ so much that it now is cheaper
than many less glamorous fish.
	   The farms also have created jobs where there were few before.
Fish farmers say about 6,000 jobs; opponents say about 1,100.
	   From the surface, all that is visible of Scotland's 340 fish
farms _ located mainly along the northwestern coast _ are large
metal hoops and the walkways connecting them to river and loch
banks. Below the water, thousands of fish swim in packed cages held
in place by the hoops.
	   While game records, some 100 years old, clearly show that
catches for both salmon and sea trout are well down on Scotland's
rivers, there are many possible reasons besides fish farms, experts
say.
	   Commercial overfishing, a tripling of the fish-eating seal
population in the Atlantic Ocean and North Sea, and pollution at
sea are all cited as factors in the decline of salmon and sea
trout, both around Scotland and off the coasts of Norway, the
United States and Canada.
	   Successive British governments committed support to the growth
of salmon farming, seeing the industry as a generator of jobs for
the sparsely populated Scottish Highlands. Anglers initially
welcomed the development, hoping cheap salmon would kill off
poaching.
	   But the dream that the farms could be developed by the
Highland's poor tenant farmers proved an illusion because they
didn't have the capital. The industry is now largely owned by
British and Norwegian multinational companies.
	   Scientists employed by the government decline to discuss the
fish stock problem, citing governmental reluctance to let them talk
in public since a senior scientist said on television last year
that fish farms were killing off wild salmon and trout.
	   ``Immense damage is being done to wildlife, and it is being
protected by the authorities,'' said Walter Semple, a Glasgow-based
lawyer who is working with riverbank owners who are considering
suing fish farmers.
	   Semple's brother, Jim, said that when he fished along the
family's 2 1-2 -mile (4 kilometers) stretch of bank on the river
Shiel as a child, the season's annual sea trout catch would reach
2,000.

	   ``This season, we have had nine,'' he said. As a result, he
said, the value of the riverbank has collapsed.
	   Mark Vincent used to employ 10 ``gillies,'' or fishing guides,
at his Loch Maree Hotel, a former fishing lodge famous both for its
sea trout catch and a visit by Queen Victoria last century.
	   On a tour around the loch, via the island with the Viking graves
on it, Vincent shows the shallows where the fish used to be
plentiful. But in the past few years, the sea trout catch has all
but disappeared and he has let nine guides go.
	   Vincent blames two fish farms in neighboring Loch Ewe.
	   ``We know the problem is sea lice, because we are catching fish
with hundreds of sea lice on them with their fins eaten,'' he said.
	   David Windmill, managing director of Marine Harvest McConnell,
the company that owns the farms in Loch Ewe, concedes sea lice have
``had an impact on fish stocks.'' But he disputes that the fish
farms triggered the collapse in salmon and sea trout populations.
	   The farms have become targets of angler's anger because, unlike
acid rain or sea pollution, they ``are a visible case to point the
finger at,'' Windmill said.
	   Regardless of who is to blame, the real ``big fish'' _ the
fishing enthusiasts who came and spent thousands _ have taken their
business elsewhere.
	   ``The rich foreigners, the parties of Wall Streeters _ that
market has long gone,'' said Mark Farrer, a landowner whose River
Dionard in the northernmost tip of Scotland still manages to
produce a few fish a year.
	   Wealthy sportsmen now prefer to fish in Iceland and Argentina,
where stocks are still plentiful and a good catch guaranteed.
	   Farrer, who started to fish ``aged 5 with a worm and a bent
pin,'' said Scotland is losing one of its great natural assets.
	   ``The message Scotland is sending is: Will the guy who catches
the last salmon turn out the lights?''

Pinochet's lawyers argue in court that his arrest was illegal

	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawyers for former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet argue British authorities were acting illegally when they
arrested him Oct. 16 at the behest of a Spanish magistrate who
seeks his extradition.
	   On Monday, they have a chance to make those arguments in court.
	   The lawyers filed a motion Thursday seeking to have the arrest
ruled invalid. Lord Justice Konrad Schiemann refused to let
attorneys make any arguments during a brief hearing, instead
setting a hearing for Monday.
	   The Chilean government has urged Britain to release the
82-year-old Pinochet on humanitarian grounds, and argued that as a
senator, he is entitled to diplomatic immunity. Britain says he
does not have immunity and the government cannot intervene in the
legal process.
	   The Spanish warrant accuses Pinochet of genocide, torture and
terrorism. It cited 94 victims but could be broadened to include
some 3,000 people who were killed or disappeared during his
17-year-rule.
	   Pinochet remains under police guard at the London Clinic, where
he has been recovering from an Oct. 9 back operation.
	   Britain's Ministry of Defense disclosed Sunday night that a
Chilean military hospital aircraft landed Saturday at the Brize
Norton Royal Air Force base in Oxfordshire, 75 miles (120
kilometers) northwest of London, but said its arrival does not mean
any decision has been made on Pinochet's fate.
	   ``The Chileans have been given permission to use the airfield
under standard arrangements,'' said a spokesman for the Ministry of
Defense, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. ``The
reasons for the flight are a matter for the Chileans and should not
be taken to imply any decision one way or another on General
Pinochet which, in any case, is not a matter for the U.K.
Government.''
	   A delegation of right-wing Chilean senators arrived in Britain
Sunday to warn that the arrest could destroy democracy in Chile and
``seriously imperil'' relations with Britain.
	   Chilean legislators also were in Spain on Thursday warning
government officials to stop the extradition process.
	   Outside the London Clinic, scuffles broke out when a visitor,
reportedly Chilean Sen. Ignacio Perez Walker, left after seeing
Pinochet and made taunting gestures toward the protesters yelling
for a trial.
	   ``We have come to represent to the British authorities that as
long as they keep their hands in Chilean affairs, they are
seriously damaging the process of transition in Chile,'' said
Carlos Bombal, a right-wing senator, who arrived with six other
senators seeking Pinochet's release.
	   Pinochet ruled from 1973 until 1990 and remained army commander
until last March as part of a compromise in Chile's transition to
democracy. He now holds a special lifetime seat in Chile's senate.
	   The arrest has led to weeks of unrest in Chile. On Sunday,
police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse demonstrators at
the end of a massive rally celebrating Pinochet's arrest.
	   Police said 45 people were detained and an unspecified number
were injured, including two police officers. It was not immediately
known whether the detainees would face any charges.
	   About 6,000 people participated in the protest. A rally on
Saturday by some 22,000 Pinochet supporters demanding his release
also ended in clashes with police.

Minister: Anwar won't distract APEC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Asia-Pacific nations' summit next month
will not be overshadowed by disputes over the jailing of Malaysia's
fired deputy prime minister, a Singaporean leader has said.
	   Trade liberalization ``is an issue that concerns all members.
It's much bigger than the friction between any two participants,''
Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in an
interview with Dow Jones Newswires released Monday.
	   ``Anyway, from newspaper reports, none of the countries wants
the potential misunderstandings to get out of hand,'' said Lee, 46,
who is also chairman of Singapore's effective central bank and son
of the city-state's most powerful man, Senior Minister Lee Kuan
Yew.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, once the chosen successor of Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad, faces trial Nov. 2 on four corruption
charges.
	   After his Sept. 20 arrest under the Internal Security Act, which
allowed police to hold him indefinitely without access to lawyers
or family, Anwar appeared in court with a black eye and bruises
that he said were inflicted by police.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada and Indonesian President
B.J. Habibie, close friends of Anwar, had suggested they might
boycott the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in protest,
but later said they would attend.
	   ``I don't think anyone wants the situation to escalate out of
control,'' said Lee. ``The spectators always hope for excitement,
but the participants are quite careful.''
	   Lee, who is widely expected to succeed Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong, made no comment on Anwar's case.
	   The Singapore government, in the midst of several disputes with
Malaysia, also has not officially referred to Anwar, although Lee
Kuan Yew has said that if Anwar was beaten in police detention,
``it would be bad.''
	   Singapore has the same type of Internal Security Act as
Malaysia, which allows police to detain people for years without
charge or trial.
	   Lee Hsien Loong said he hopes the APEC summit will result in
agreement on Early Voluntary Sector Liberalization, a plan that
aims to open trade in nine industries.
	   However, he said, agreement on agriculture and fisheries will be
most difficult to achieve.
	   Lee expects a good discussion on strengthening the global
economic situation in light of the Asian financial crisis, although
major players such as Europe, the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank will not be present.
	   ``We are at a time when the whole global trading system is under
pressure _ not quite under siege, but under pressure,'' Lee said.
``If we don't make an effort to reaffirm the thrust of free trade
and move forward, we will lose ground and risk more serious
problems.''

Report: Indonesian exporters worried by fast rising rupiah
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian exporters fear the rapidly
strengthening rupiah could hit their cash flows, a newspaper
reported Monday.
	   The Jakarta Post said many had bought imported raw materials for
their exports at an assumed rate of more than 8,000 rupiah to the
dollar.
	   Export revenues might be lower because the rupiah was now
trading at around 7,500 rupiah to the dollar and could strengthen
further, it said.
	   The rupiah has strengthened by nearly 40 percent since the
beginning of October. It was earlier devastated by Asia's financial
meltdown.
	   ``Many exporters are now unsure about whether to purchase (raw
materials) because they fear the rupiah may jump to the 5,000
rupiah level,'' the paper quoted Firdaus Juven, a director of
export company PT Chempex Jaya.
	   The Post said some exporters have called for the government to
limit the rupiah's appreciation.
	   Government officials have made conflicting statements on whether
the rupiah's fast rise could hurt exports.
	   Senior economics minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said last week
that for export competitiveness, the ideal range for the currency
would be between 7,000 to 8,000 rupiah to the dollar.
	   However, Bank Indonesia governor Sjahril Sabirin said the rupiah
could reach a level of 6,000 to 6,500 rupiah to the dollar.
	   He said a stronger rupiah would not hurt export competitiveness,
but instead cut the cost of raw materials imported by exporters.

Elections: President's efforts to halt economic turmoil win strong

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with final results in Minas Gerais, ADDS details on
elections in smaller states. &QL; 
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's
efforts to halt Brazil's growing economic turmoil have received a
strong boost with the election of a key ally as governor of
Brazil's most populous and wealthiest state.
	   Of the 13 gubernatorial runoff elections Sunday, Sao Paulo's was
perhaps the most critical to the success of Cardoso's austerity
measures, expected to be announced on Tuesday.
	   The measures, which include spending cuts and tax hikes, must be
approved by Congress, and state governors have enormous sway over
local delegations.
	   Sao Paulo's incumbent governor Mario Covas was re-elected to a
second term in office with 56 percent of the vote against 44
percent tallied for two-time former governor Paulo Maluf.
	   Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse, has a
population of more than 34 million _ nearly equal to all of
neighboring Argentina. It alone accounts for more than one-third of
Brazil's economic output and 70 of the 513 congressional seats.
	   The election of Covas, a frugal administrator and friend of
Cardoso, is a tremendous boost for the president, who is trying to
rescue Brazil from the global financial crisis.
	   Covas told reporters that the partial results showed that the
electorate ``understands that you cannot spend more than you take
in.''
	   He said ``difficult decisions will have to be made,'' and that
there will be ``less money for social projects like health and
education.''
	   ``By electing Covas, the electorate voted in favor of
austerity,'' said Health Minister Jose Serra.
	   Brazil is a victim of the global financial crisis that began
last year in Asia and shifted to Russia before moving here. In the
past two months, investors have withdrawn some dlrs 25 billion from
the country.
	   Cardoso's economic team and the International Monetary Fund have
spent the past weeks working out ways to slash Brazil's deficit of
around dlrs 65 billion, or 7 percent of the gross domestic product.
	   But while the results in Sao Paulo represent a shot in the arm
for Cardoso's deficit-reducing efforts, Cardoso opponents were
elected in three other important states.
	   In Rio de Janeiro, Anthony Garotinho, a radio announcer of the
center-left Democratic Labor Party, was elected with 58 percent of
the vote. His opponent, former Rio mayor Cesar Maia, a Cardoso
ally, had 42 percent and conceded defeat.
	   ``I will support the (austerity) measures, but with
restrictions,'' Garotinho said. ``They are important for the
country, but they can't bring states to a standstill.''
	   Former President Itamar Franco, who broke with Cardoso during
the campaign, was elected in powerful Minas Gerais state with 58
percent against 42 percent for incumbent Eduardo Azeredo of
Cardoso's Brazilian Social Democracy Party.
	   In the southern Rio Grande do Sul, an important farm state,
Olivio Dutra of the leftist Workers Party defeated incumbent
Cardoso supporter Antonio Britto 51 to 49 percent.
	   The states of Amapa, Mato Grosso do Sul and Roraima also elected
Cardoso opponents, while in the state of Piaui the opposition was
leading.
	   In the Federal District of Brasilia, Cardoso ally Joaquim Roriz
was elected with 52 percent against 48 percent for Cristovam
Buarque of the leftist Workers Party.
	   Another Cardoso ally was elected in the state of Goias and
supporters led in the state of Para, Rondonia and Sergipe.

	   PASADENA, California (AP) _ D.C. United coach Bruce Arena is
accustomed to winning. He was definitely not a happy man Sunday
after United was beaten 2-0 in the MLS Cup by the Chicago Fire,
coached by his former assistant, Bob Bradley.
	   The United coach, who guided his team to the title in the MLS'
first two years, groused about the officiating and the fact his
team had to play three games in eight days and had just three days
off between its final playoff game and the title match.
	   ``I'm very disappointed with a couple of controversial calls in
the game,'' Arena said. ``It's hard for me to believe we are not
champions. The breaks went their way. A couple breaks go our way
and maybe we're champions again.
	   ``It seemed like we weren't given a chance in some way to defend
our championship, with the number of cards dealt against us.''
	   Arena, whose two MLS championships and five U.S. college titles
at Virginia have made him the frontrunner to become the next U.S.
national team coach, did try to sprinkle compliments among his
complaints about the loss to the expansion Fire.
	   ``I applaud the Fire's effort; they deserve to be champions,''
he said. ``There were controversial calls, but I don't want to take
anything away from Chicago's game.''
	   Bradley, Arena's close friend and an assistant under him first
at Virginia, then with D.C., agreed the chips fell Chicago's way in
the MLS Cup.
	   ``Bruce is right on those issues. The Fire ended up getting
breaks and that helped determine the game,'' Bradley said.
	   Arena contended the Fire's Ante Razov should have been called
offsides on Chicago's second goal. Referee Kevin Terry, however,
held that Razov did not interfere on the play, thus no call was
necessary.
	   Arena also complained about Lubos Kubik's tackle on D.C.
midfielder Marco Etcheverry in the Chicago penalty box four minutes
into the game, saying United should have been awarded a penalty
kick. There was no call on the play.
	   Jerzy Podbrozny and Diego Gutierrez scored goals 16 minutes
apart in the first half and goalkeeper Zach Thornton and the Fire
defense did the rest before a crowd of 51,350 at the Rose Bowl on a
warm, sunny day.
	   The victory was Bradley's first significant win over his former
boss _ his Princeton University team lost to Arena's Virginia
Cavaliers in the 1993 college semifinals and the Fire were beaten
3-1 and 4-1 by D.C. this season.
	   Thornton made eight saves as the Fire thwarted United's
high-powered offense, including league MVP Etcheverry and strikers
Jaime Moreno and Roy Lassiter. D.C. outshot the Fire 22-10 and held
an 8-4 edge in shots on goal, including 6-0 in the second half.
	   Chicago midfielder and captain Peter Nowak, a native of Poland
and one of a quartet of Chicago's ``Eastern Bloc'' players, was
voted MVP of the championship game, an honor that went to United's
Moreno last year and Etcheverry in 1996.
	   ``This is a very special day for me because I've never won a
championship,'' said Nowak, who assisted on both goals.
	   The first half featured continuing attacks by both sides, with
D.C. taking three shots in the opening four minutes, and Chicago
also came forward on the attack.
	   Podbrozny, another Polish player, finished what was a textbook
bit of passing to give Chicago the lead in the 29th minute.
	   Gutierrez began it just outside the D.C. box, passing to Kubik,
from the Czech Republic. Kubik passed the ball to Nowak, who fed
Razov as the United defenders tried an offsides trap. Razov rolled
a perfectly paced pass beyond the defensive line and Nowak sprinted
to the ball and dribbled toward the left post, with goalie Tom
Presthus forced to come out on him.
	   Nowak rolled the ball slowly across the goal mouth and the
charging Podbrozny tapped it into the open net to complete a
scoring sequence in which half the Fire's field players touched the
ball.
	   Gutierrez, a Colombian who missed all of last season with Kansas
City because of torn ligaments in his left knee, gave Chicago a pad
by being in the right place at the right time in the closing
seconds of the first half. Nowak got off a shot toward the center
of the goal that Presthus could have stopped, but the ball
deflected off Gutierrez and veered into the left rear corner of the
net.
	   With a two-goal lead in the second half, Chicago returned to the
defensive stance that was its trademark during the regular season
and a two-game sweep of Los Angeles in the conference playoffs.

Takanohana keeps sumo's top position in upcoming tournament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KOZO MIZOGUCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FUKUOKA, Japan (AP) _ Yokozuna (grand champion) Takanohana, who
clinched his 20th tournament title last month, was placed in sumo's
most respected east position, topping Hawaiian-born yokozuna
Akebono, according to rankings announced Monday.
	   Takanohana, 26, who finished with a 13-2 record, will vie for
his third consecutive title in the upcoming Kyushu Grand Sumo
Tournament, beginning Nov. 8 at the Fukuoka Kokusai Center, 899
kilometers (557 miles), southwest of Tokyo.
	   Akebono, 29, the first foreign-born wrestler to become yokozuna,
was ranked east yokozuna just below Takanohana, the Japan Sumo
Association said. Akebono, or Chad Rowan, ended the previous
tournament with 10 wins and five losses.
	   Wakanohana, who finished runner-up at 12-3, will be the top west
yokozuna in the next tournament _ the last for this year. The east
is considered more prestigious than the west in Japanese culture.
	   Wakanohana and Takanohana are the first brothers ever to hold
the traditional sport's top rank a the same time. Takanohana was
promoted to yokozuna in 1994, while Wakanohana was promoted in
June.
	   ``This is the last tournament for the year. In order to usher in
a good New Year, I will aim at winning another victory,''
Takanohana said in a nationally televised news conference.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani from Hawaii, will retain the
top ozeki (champion) spot in the east after winding up with a 11-4
record. Takanonami, 26, who finished 10-5, will hold the top ozeki
position in the west.
	   Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa, fell to No. 12
maegashira (senior wrestler) No. 5 for his 4-11 record in the
previous tournament.
	   Fellow Mongolian Kyokutenho, or Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, was promoted
to No. 2 from No. 5 in the juryo division, just below the makuuchi
division, for his 8-7 record in Tokyo.
	   Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo Salomon, rose to No. 10
from No. 13 for his 9-6 record performance last month.
	   In the top junior division of makushita, Hoshiandesu, or
Argentine Jose Antonio Juarez, was promoted to No. 5 from No. 20
after finishing at 5-2.
	   Wakaazuma, or Yoshinobu Kuroda from Brazil, rose to No. 11 from
No. 20. His record was 5-2.
	   Kyokutenzan, or Mongolian Enkhbat Batmunkha, fell to No. 56 in
makushita from No. 6 in the sandanme, the second-highest junior
division, for his 4-3 record last month.
	   Kitaazuma, or Brazilian Tetsuya Takeda, fell to No. 57 from No.
45. He was 3-4.
	   In sandanme, Ryuko, who previously used his ring name of
Ikemori, or Brazilian Luis Go Ikemori, fell to No. 15 from No. 2
for his 3-4 record. He changed his ring name recently since
obtaining Japanese citizenship, an association official said.
	   Azumakaze, or Brazilian Tussato Guiuliano Kotinda, (3-4) fell to
No. 47 from No. 33.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

Retail sector squeezed as Hong Kong tightens its belt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo HK102 &QL; 
 &UR; By TARA SUILEN DUFFY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The arrival of fall fashion hasn't sparked the
usual buying frenzy at Ting May Lung's shoe store this season.
	   In fact, sales are down 30 percent from last year, and Ting has
slashed prices on the new merchandise to try to sell it.
	   It's not the predominance of platform heels that is putting
customers off.
	   ``The economy's bad,'' the 35-year old shop-owner said. ``We've
ordered a little less stock, but not that much less because you
earn as much as you sell.''
	   Ting's plight is similar for retailers across Hong Kong, from
the small, family-run shops, to the retail chains, to the high-end
boutiques.
	   As the territory tightens its belt in a recession, the retail
sector is getting squeezed, if not strangled.
	   Profits have dwindled, and some companies are reporting losses.
The sector has taken a ``double whammy,'' said Arthur Woo, an
economist at HSBC Securities Asia Ltd.
	   Tourism has waned, while local consumers, faced with diminishing
asset values and soaring interest rates on mortgages, are spending
less in this former shopping mecca.
	   Retail sales, which include clothing, electronic goods, watches,
and jewelry _ items often on the shopping lists of visitors to the
territory _ declined for the ninth consecutive month in July. For
the first seven months this year, retail sales fell by 15 percent
compared with the same period in 1997.
	   Plunging retail sales don't bode well for the economy as a
whole. The retail sector only represents a small percentage of Hong
Kong's gross domestic product, but in some ways it is a key part of
the territory's identity.
	   The streets of Causeway Bay, a popular shopping center, are
littered with vacant shops, while most of those remaining are
plastered with signs advertising sales.
	   The streets are still bustling, just not with big spenders. Even
discounts of up to 90 percent aren't luring some people to pry open
their purses.
	   Just one year after retailers were bursting at the seams with
expansion plans, the plummeting sales have forced retailers to
close shops, cut salaries and lay off workers.
	   That has resulted in a 17 percent unemployment rate in the
retail sector, according to a recent survey by one union, compared
with the 5 percent total unemployment, a 15-year high.
	   Hoping to boost sales, several shops have even resorted to
deception. They hang up ``Last Ten Days'' signs outside, but 10
days pass and the stores remain open.
	   Makeshift stores have set up in recently vacated spaces, paying
half the regular rents for short-term leases and selling discounted
items for as long as they can make a profit.
	   For instance, Yan Jin Zhi has been renting a non-air conditioned
shell of a store with plaster walls and cement floors for several
months.
	   One evening, running his fingers down a notebook of the daily
tally, the 60-year-old bookseller shook his head.
	   At 7 p.m., the day's sales were about 1,000 Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 130) shy of the 3,000 Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 387)
daily rent for his shell of a store in one of the city's popular
shopping districts, Mong Kok.
	   ``We've cut prices by half, rented out space in front of the
shop to umbrella and cell phone accessory vendors, which looks bad,
but there's no other way,'' Yan said. ``There's just no money to
earn.''
	   Several retailers, unable to make ends meet after closing shops
and laying off staff, asked employees to take pay cuts. That led
the Labor Department to issue public statements reminding stores
about workers' rights in the territory.
	   When 16 employees of casual clothes retailer Apple Shop refused
to sign agreements on salary cuts, they were fired, local
newspapers reported. Management refused to even discuss the case.
	   Meanwhile, at the top of the line, luxury retailer Dickson
Concepts (International) Ltd., whose operations include the Warner
Brothers Studio Stores and Polo/Ralph Lauren outlets in Hong Kong,
fell victim to the recession and cut salaries by 10 percent.
	   Yet for as many retailers cut back or fold, there may be a
silver lining to the downturn, or maybe a silver-plated lining.
	   Discount stores, once an exception in this name-brand conscious
city, are taking advantage of cheaper rents and more cost-conscious
consumers to finally set up shop.
	   ``Ten dollar'' stores, where everything costs just 10 Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.30), are doing a brisk business with choosier,
cost-conscious customers.
	   For instance, although it is reluctant to brand itself a
``discount'' store, Watson's Wine Cellar opened a few months ago to
offer wines at prices as low as 39 dollars (U.S. dlrs 5).
	   ``There's still growth, but maybe the growth is not at the top
end,'' said Jeanette Peterson, the store's wine liaison. ``In the
retail sector across the board, people are looking for a price
point, and if they don't find it they don't buy it.''

Most Vietnam HIV carriers are drug addicts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Drug addicts account for 70 percent of the
10,563 people known to be infected with the AIDS-causing HIV virus
in Vietnam, the National AIDS Committee said Monday.
	   Ninety-four percent of those testing positive for HIV are men,
it said. The committee also found that 30 more people tested
positive last week and that all were drug addicts.
	   The number of cases could be up to 10 times higher than the
official figure, it said.
	   Overall, 1,901 people have full-blown AIDS, and 1,013 have died
since Vietnam's first case was detected in 1990, the committee
said.
	   Ho Chi Minh City tops the list with 2,640 HIV carriers, followed
by the northern province of Quang Ninh with 1,280. Hanoi reported
311 cases.
	   The disease has spread to all but one of Vietnam's 61 provinces
and cities.
	   The Hanoi AIDS committee said 249 people have tested positive
for HIV so far this year, compared with just 62 during 1993-97.
	   The government has allocated more than dlrs 4 million to fight
AIDS, mostly in education programs.

Report: Indonesian exporters worried by fast rising rupiah
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS five final grafs to UPDATE with report on currency band. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian exporters fear the rapidly
strengthening rupiah could hit their cash flows, a newspaper
reported Monday.
	   The Jakarta Post said many had bought imported raw materials for
their exports at an assumed rate of more than 8,000 rupiah to the
dollar.
	   Export revenues might be lower because the rupiah was now
trading at around 7,500 rupiah to the dollar and could strengthen
further, it said.
	   The rupiah has strengthened by nearly 40 percent since the
beginning of October. It was earlier devastated by Asia's financial
meltdown.
	   ``Many exporters are now unsure about whether to purchase (raw
materials) because they fear the rupiah may jump to the 5,000
rupiah level,'' the paper quoted Firdaus Juven, a director of
export company PT Chempex Jaya.
	   The Post said some exporters have called for the government to
limit the rupiah's appreciation.
	   Government officials have made conflicting statements on whether
the rupiah's fast rise could hurt exports.
	   Senior economics minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said last week
that for export competitiveness, the ideal range for the currency
would be between 7,000 to 8,000 rupiah to the dollar.
	   However, Bank Indonesia governor Sjahril Sabirin said the rupiah
could reach a level of 6,000 to 6,500 rupiah to the dollar.
	   He said a stronger rupiah would not hurt export competitiveness,
but instead cut the cost of raw materials imported by exporters.
	   Meanwhile, the newspaper Bisnis Indonesia said Bank Indonesia,
the central bank, is considering the reimposition of a currency
trading band if the rupiah strengthens to between 5,000 and 6,000
rupiah to the U.S. dollar.
	   The daily quoted an unidentified source ``close to the central
bank'' as saying it would not peg the rupiah at a certain exchange
rate.
	   Indonesia abolished a currency band in August 1997. At that time
a massive slide in the value of the rupiah resulted in a dramatic
drain of its foreign exchange reserves as the central bank tried to
defend the band.
	   Bisnis Indonesia quoted its source as saying Bank Indonesia
would limit the rupiah holdings of non-residents to safeguard the
country's foreign exchange reserves if a trading band is
reintroduced.
	   Such a move would limit speculation against the rupiah by
foreigners, the source said.

Poll indicates Charles' popularity is improving
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A poll published Monday indicates Prince Charles's
popularity continues to improve, but that there is still opposition
to his companion Camilla Parker Bowles becoming queen.
	   The survey, conducted by research group MORI for The Sun,
Britain's top selling tabloid newspaper, shows that the number of
people naming Charles as one of their favorite royals has increased
9 percent over the last four years.
	   Of the 600 people surveyed in the telephone poll conducted Oct.
23-24, 25 percent placed him in their top two or three royals, up
from 16 percent in December 1994.
	   The results appear to be consistent with another poll conducted
by MORI this summer that indicated Prince Charles' popularity has
soared since the death of Princess Diana in a Paris car crash on
Aug. 31, 1997. He then had an approval rating of 62 percent, up
from 42 percent before Diana's death.
	   But in Monday's poll, three-quarters opposed the idea of Mrs.
Parker Bowles, Charles' longtime companion, becoming queen.
	   The findings came after a telephone poll of 500 people published
in this week's Sunday Mirror indicated 54 percent wanted to see
Charles become king, up from 46 percent last year.
	   That poll, conducted by survey company ICM on Oct. 22, also
showed opposition to the idea of Mrs. Parker Bowles becoming queen,
with 78 percent rejecting the idea.
	   But both surveys suggested respondents don't think Charles
should be disqualified from inheriting the throne if he marries
her.
	   In Monday's poll, 53 percent said he should still be crowned,
while the Sunday Mirror survey showed the number saying he should
not take the throne as her husband had dropped from 55 percent a
year ago to 48 percent.
	   The Sunday Mirror poll also suggested public may be moving
toward approval of Charles marrying Mrs. Parker Bowles, with 43
percent backing such a move, compared with just 30 percent surveyed
by the same newspaper a year ago.
	   But Monday's poll for The Sun suggested the notion is becoming
less appealing to the public, with 32 percent saying they should
marry, down from 53 percent from an August 1997 survey.
	   Neither poll stated a margin of error.

Indonesian government says allegations of clashes in East Timor are
</HEADLINE>
false

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Allegations of armed clashes in
disputed East Timor are inaccurate and are part of a campaign to
undermine efforts to negotiate a peace deal, the government said
Monday.
	   In a statement, the foreign ministry said recent remarks by a
spokesman for United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan about
unrest in the former Portuguese colony were misguided.
	   Separatist guerrillas have been fighting the Indonesian military
ever since it invaded East Timor in 1975, but Indonesian officials
said there have been no confrontations in the past four months.
	   ``These allegations do not correspond with the reality on the
ground,'' the ministry statement said. ``The security apparatus in
East Timor has exerted extraordinary self-restraint in dealing with
the security situation in the province.''
	   The ministry accused the charges of being ``part of a sustained
campaign of disinformation by dubious elements wishing to sabotage
the momentum towards a peaceful settlement of the East Timor
question.''
	   The Indonesian statement did not identify who was behind the
alleged campaign to stall the peace talks.
	   Communities of East Timorese dissidents in Australia, the United
States and elsewhere have been highly critical of Indonesian
policy.
	   Reform-minded President B.J. Habibie has tried to ease tensions
in East Timor, offering a measure of autonomy in exchange for
recognition of Indonesian sovereignty. His authoritarian
predecessor, President Suharto, had taken a hard line on the
half-island territory.
	   Many separatist activists have rejected Habibie's offer and are
demanding a referendum on independence as well as unconditional
freedom for their jailed rebel leader, Xanana Gusmao.
	   The United Nations is sponsoring peace talks between Indonesia
and Portugal, East Timor's former colonial master.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976 after invading during a
civil war. The United Nations does not recognize Indonesian
sovereignty.

	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Rain squalls spawned by Hurricane Mitch
forced churches to cancel services, flooded streets in the Jamaican
capital of Kingston and sent residents scurrying for provisions.
	   Under dark, menacing skies, seaports closed and buses and taxis
stayed off Kingston's streets Sunday as Mitch, the 13th named storm
of the Atlantic hurricane season, swirled in the western Caribbean
Sea south of Jamaica.
	   Packing 150-mph (240-kph) winds, Mitch was a powerful Category 4
hurricane that threatened Honduras and Colombia's tiny islands off
Central America, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.
	   As Mitch moved westward, hurricane warnings were lifted for
Jamaica and eastern Cuba. Hondurans, however, should take
precautions, the hurricane center said late Sunday, and a tropical
storm watch was in effect for the Caymans.
	   At 10 p.m. EST (0300 GMT Monday), Mitch was 200 miles (320
kilometers) south of Grand Cayman. Crawling west at 8 mph (13 kph),
its hurricane-force winds extended 70 miles (112 kilometers) from
the center.
	   Sheets of rain reduced visibility to a few yards (meters) while
squalls pelted Kingston and Jamaica's eastern districts. With rain
expected at least through Monday, authorities warned of mudslides
and flash floods, especially in the mountains.
	   Prime Minister P.J. Patterson appealed for calm, shelters opened
and Jamaica's defense forces went on alert. Residents cleared
shelves of bakery items, batteries and other goods at the few
Kingston markets open Sunday.
	   Several airlines canceled flights, although the Kingston and
Montego Bay airports remained open.
	   In western Jamaica, hoteliers and tourists kept a wary eye on
the storm's progress.
	   ``It's not a very good beach day,'' said Rohan Watson, a manager
at the Negril Inn in the western resort of Negril. Employees
stockpiled food and plywood to board windows in case Mitch
threatened, he said.
	   ``People are still coming in. I think most people think the
weather's going to pass,'' said an optimistic Marcia Tomlinson, a
receptionist at the Montego Bay hotel in the northwestern coastal
resort of Montego Bay.
	   In 1988, Hurricane Gilbert killed 45 people in Jamaica. The
island was spared, however, by Hurricane Georges, which killed more
than 500 people in the northeast Caribbean last month.
	   In the Cayman Islands, a British colony of about 28,000, some
boat owners secured their vessels and residents stocked up on
essentials. The government allowed markets _ normally closed by law
on Sunday _ to open.

Two workers killed in elevator crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A cable snapped on an elevator over a
river in Vietnam, sending two workers plunging 80 meters to their
deaths, the Labor newspaper reported Monday.
	   One worker died instantly in the accident Friday in the southern
province of Dong Nai. The other died on the way to a hospital, and
a third worker remains hospitalized, the paper said.
	   The workers were going up a 144-meter-high (472-foot-high)
electrical pole supporting a cable over the Thi Vai river that
brings power to Ho Chi Minh City from the Phu My thermo power plant
in Vung Tau.
	   It was the first time that the Electricity Installation Co. No.
2 had used the elevator.

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam has 10,563 people who have tested
positive for the AIDS-causing HIV virus, but the actual figure
could be up to 10 times higher, the National AIDS Committee said
Monday.
	   It said 30 people tested positive last week and all were drug
addicts.
	   Overall, 1,901 people have full-blown AIDS, and 1,013 have died
since Vietnam's first case was detected in 1990, the committee
said.
	   Ho Chi Minh City tops the list with 2,640 HIV carriers, followed
by the northern province of Quang Ninh with 1,280. Hanoi reported
311 cases. The disease has spread to all but one of Vietnam's 61
provinces and cities.
	   The Hanoi AIDS committee said 249 people have tested positive
for HIV so far this year, compared with just 62 during 1993-97. It
said men make up 94 percent of the cases, and that drug addicts
account for 70 percent.
	   The government has allocated more than dlrs 4 million to fight
AIDS, mostly in education programs.
