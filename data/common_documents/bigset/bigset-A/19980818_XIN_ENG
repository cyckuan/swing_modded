<HEADLINE> Wen Jiabao Inspects Flooded Province on Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINGZHOU (Hubei), August 17 (Xinhua) -- Wen Jiabao, head of the
State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, went to the
city of Shashi today to direct the anti-flood fight on the Yangtze
River embankments.
</P>
<P>
Entrusted by President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji, Wen
returned to Hubei Province, the worst-hit area in central China,
on Sunday night when the sixth and most disastrous of the flood
crest pushed the water level at the Jingjiang section of Yangtze
above the 45-meter mark.
</P>
<P>
When he arrived at the Guanyinji measuring point, one of the
most dangerous sections on the river at 10 a.m. today, the water
level remained at 45.22 meters, which topped the 1954 record by
0.55 meters.
</P>
<P>
Wen said the water level was not only the highest of the year,
but also a historic high. Embankments at the Jingjiang, Honghu and
Wuhan sections have been undergoing a severe test.
</P>
<P>
"As long as we implement the directive of Jiang Zemin, united
as one and make redoubled efforts, the final victory is sure to be
won," Wen said.
</P>
<P>
By 11 a.m. today, the water level had begun to drop and was at
45.1 meters at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
While in Hubei, Wen heard reports on the flood situation given
by local government leaders and analyzed weather and flood
forecasts. He urged civilians and officers and men of the Chinese
People's Liberation Army to do their utmost in defending the main
dikes on the Yangtze, pay attention to the key and weak points,
and assist the people evacuated from the Jingjiang diversion
zone.

<HEADLINE> Former Gurkha Soldiers Press for Equal Pensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 17 (Xinhua) -- About 400 Nepalese who had
served in the British army, better known as the Gurkha soldiers,
on Monday staged a sit-in in front of the British Embassy here to
press for the meeting of their four-point demands.
</P>
<P>
Padam Bahadur Gurung, president of the Gurkha Army
Ex-Servicemen's Organization (GAESO), said his organization would
be staging a peaceful sit-in for three days and if the demands are
not met, it will launch new protest programs soon.
</P>
<P>
The ex-servicemen are demanding pensions for all former Gurkha
soldiers and their families who were sent back to Nepal
"empty-handed and bare-footed" after the Second World War, the
GAESO said in an appeal for support issued on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
The other demands include equal pensions with their British
counterparts, arrangement of residential visas for Britain and
arrangement of education and employment for the half-educated
children of former Gurkha soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The sit-in blocked traffic before the British embassy and
neighboring Indian embassy.
</P>
<P>
The appeal for support stated that "our just movement will go
ahead ceaselessly unless all our demands are met."
</P>
<P>
It noted that after retirement, a British soldier receives 475
British pounds (760 U.S. dollars) per month but his Nepalese
counterpart gets only 21 pounds (32 dollars) per month.
</P>
<P>
For the past four years, the former Gurkha soldiers have been
pushing for pension parity with their British counterparts.
</P>
<P>
In mid-June, the British embassy here announced that the
British government had decided to increase the pensions for former
Gurkha soldiers ranging from 23 percent to 51 percent. The
increases would be distributed from October 1998 and are
retroactive from January 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
But the Gurkhas responded the next day that they were demanding
an increase of 500 percent, so their demands had not been met.
</P>
<P>
The British army started to draft the Nepalese in 1816 under
the Sugauli Treaty signed between Nepal and the East India Company
of Britain.
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 Nepalese soldiers fought during the First and
Second World Wars and 15,000 of them were killed.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 2,500 to 3,000 Nepalese are serving in the British
army.

<HEADLINE> Albright Flying to Tanzania, Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Monday left here for East Africa to pay a
one-day visit to Kenya and Tanzania to show solidarity with
bomb-struck embassy workers and for local people caught in the
terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
"To America's embassy personnel in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, I
will bring a message of solidarity in their sorrow, admiration for
their courage and support for their continued efforts on behalf of
our country," Albright said on her departure.
</P>
<P>
"To the people of Kenya and Tanzania, I will bring a message of
friendship, made deeper by our shared grief, and of support in
doing all we can to ease their suffering and help them start
anew."
</P>
<P>
Albright's visit to East Africa was designed in part to
demonstrate U.S. resolve in the face of growing terrorist threats
to Americans.
</P>
<P>
Albright is scheduled to spend five hours on the ground in Dar
es Salaam, her first stop Tuesday morning, and then about five and
a half hours in Nairobi later in the day before returning home.

<HEADLINE> Floodwater Roars to Daqing Oilfield After Breaching Defense Barrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAQING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Floodwater from the Nenjiang
River is roaring toward China's largest oilfield of Daqing after
it breached the second defense barrier near Zhaoyuan County in
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province this evening.
</P>
<P>
A 10-meter-long breach was discovered at the Zhaoyuan defense
barrier early Sunday. The Shenyang Military Area Command
immediately sent 1,000 officers and soldiers to plug it, bringing
the total number of officers and soldiers on the embankment to
20,000.
</P>
<P>
Despite rush repairs by civilians and soldiers, the rupture had
widened to 50 meters by noon today, because of the powerful
current and inadequate filling materials.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,500 soldiers and workers at the Daqing Oilfield are
building a third defense embankment.
</P>
<P>
The number of inundated wells at Daqing has risen to 1,391 by
9:30 pm today. Another 280 wells halted normal production.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Govt Calls for Exposing Sexual Abuse in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government Monday
called on any individual or group in possession of information on
instances of sexual abuse during the mid-May riots in the country
to come forward and present it to the government's Joint
Fact-Finding Team (TGPF).
</P>
<P>
"Only through such public cooperation can the TGPF carry out
its responsibilities in a manner that is both comprehensive and
timely," the Foreign Ministry said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The government recently set up the TGPF to conduct thorough and
overall investigation into atrocities or human rights violations
widely reported to have taken place during riots on May 13-15 in
Jakarta and other Indonesian cities. The team is led by Marzuki
Darusman, vice chairman of the National Commission on Human Rights
(Komnas HAM).
</P>
<P>
The government was also working with organizations and
institutions to provide facilities and services in the capital
city of Jakarta where victims and families can receive counseling
from psychologists, legal experts, and religious experts, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It said Indonesia strongly condemned all incidents of sexual
assaults and rapes of ethnic Chinese women during the May riots.
</P>
<P>
Beside the TGPF, the government had also set up an all-women's
team called Women Protection Against Violence on July 8, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government would work to ensure that the human
rights of Indonesians of all ethnic groups are continually
protected, the release said.
</P>
<P>
According to Komnas HAM, about 1,200 people were killed and
more than 5,000 shops and houses were damaged or burnt during the
May riots. The rioters also raped 168 women, most of them ethnic
Chinese.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Air Traffic Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Passenger, cargo and mail traffic
in all the 19 airports in Nigeria declined in the first quarter
of this year due to the unpredictable political and economic
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Airport operation statistics compiled by the Federal Airports
Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) showed that all airports recorded a
11.6 percent decrease from January to March in passenger
movement.
</P>
<P>
About 794,770 passengers were recorded in first quarter
compared with 899,044 in the same period of last year, Nigeria's
newspaper The Guardian Monday Monday quoted the statistics as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Cargo movement fell by 24.4 percent from 7,422 tons to 5,610
tons while mail traffic declined from 334 tons to 259 tons during
the period under review.
</P>
<P>
However, the statistics said, aircraft movement increased by
12.6 percent from 24,002 to 27,021.
</P>
<P>
FAAN attributed the air traffic decline to the unpredictable
political and economic situation and to the stunted growth of the
aviation industry since the early part of the current decade in
the west African country.

LAGOS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Vehicle imports in Nigeria rose
by 403 percent to 16,906 in the first half of this year, compared
with 3,358 in the same period of last year, according to the
statistics issued recently by Apapa Port of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>

Government of Nigeria included used vehicles in the list of goods
to be accompanied with Import Duty Report (IDR), the Business
Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The IDR document is issued on goods that have been inspected
for value, quality and quantity by pre-shipment inspection
agents.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pakistan FM Cites Urgency in Resolving Kashmir Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz on Monday urged the international community to see the
"heightened sense of urgency" to reduce tensions in South Asia and
play an effective role in settling the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is ripe for a heightened action of the
international community as there is a heightened sense of urgency
for reducing tension in the region and addressing the Kashmir
dispute," he told visiting British Member of Parliament Tom Cox.
</P>
<P>
Aziz briefed the British MP about recent developments in the
region including the "unusually aggressive" statements from the
Indian leadership and the "unprovoked" Indian shelling along the
Line of Control, said the official Associated Press of Pakistan
(APP).
</P>
<P>
"We are in a slightly new situation, the urgency and the
importance of the Kashmir dispute has increased," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
He said the world should make New Delhi accept the reality of
the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that while the international community has come
forward with humanitarian assistance in other conflict-hit areas,
in the case of Kashmir it is "singularly missing."
</P>
<P>
Aziz also underscored the importance of Britain's role in the
issue. Britain, he said, should urge the United States to play an
active role in Kashmir, which will be very important as President
Bill Clinton is scheduled to visit South Asia later this year.
</P>
<P>
Aziz also said Pakistan was ready to discuss any option
acceptable to Kashmiris "because the future of Kashmir has to be
decided by the Kashmiris."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Farmers to Be Trained in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A group of 13 Zimbabwean farmers
left here Monday for Jakarta, Indonesia, for a two-month
practical agricultural training course.
</P>
<P>
The farmers from all the Zimbabwean provinces will join 14
others from Mozambique under a cooperation agreement brokered by
the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Lands and Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai told
the Zimbabwe News Agency that the farmers would be trained under
the Agency for Agricultural Education and the Indonesian
Agricultural Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The scheme would boost agricultural production in the
Zimbabwean and Mozambican small-holder sector by increasing
technical know-how of selected farmers, he said.
</P>
<P>
It would also promote solidarity and mutual understanding
among farmers through the "farmers-teach-farmers" training method
used, Kangai added.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe also decided to develop farmer training programs to
make the small-holder farmers more business-oriented in the new
environment of liberalized marketing, the minister noted.

<HEADLINE> Indian Geneticists Claim to Breed Nutritious Potato </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Indian genetic engineers at
the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in New Delhi claimed to have
turned the starchy potato into a wholesome nutritive food, the
Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The transgenic tuber was produced by Subhra Chakraborty and her
husband Niranjan, and Asis Datta, director of JNU's Center for
Plant Molecular Biology.
</P>
<P>
The transgenic potatoes grown at the center had a much higher
amino acid content than ordinary potatoes, according to the PTI.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Subhra Chakraborty as saying that "they contain all
the essential amino acid the body needs including some that
ordinary potatoes do not have."
</P>
<P>
What made the nutritious potato possible was a unique gene
isolated by Datta and his team from grain amaranthus, said PTI.
</P>
<P>
The gene which has been patented in the United States codes for
a seed storage protein named AMA1 which is rich in all essential
amino acid.
</P>
<P>
Datta and his colleagues transferred this gene into ordinary
potato to make it nutritious. They believed the new breed is a
step forward in eradicating protein malnutrition in developing
countries where potato is a staple diet.
</P>
<P>
However, PTI said, the new potato would take some time to reach
the consumers since large-scale field trials are yet to be done.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Ghana has disassociated itself
from a shooting accident Sunday on its border with Togo, saying
it would not allow its territory to be used for hostile
activities against Togo.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Monday by the Ghanaian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs said that the two countries have been in consultation
since the shooting accident in early Sunday morning, accordaing
to reports reaching here from Accra.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also agreed on joint measures aimed to
maintain security along the border and to apprehend those
involved, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry also said that Ghana's Chief of Defense
Staff and Inspector-General of Police had traveled to the border
to meet their counterparts to review the situation.
</P>
<P>
"Ghana will continue to follow a policy of good neighborliness
with Togo in the interest of the peace, progress and welfare of
our two countries and peoples," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
A group of unidentified gunmen attacked a border point on the
Togolese side early Sunday morning, and were fought back by
Togolese soldiers, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The fighting lasted about two hours. No casualties were
reported on either side.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a report from Lome, the capital of Togo, said the
gunmen were oppositions led by Gilchrist Olympio, who failed in
Togo's June 21 presidential election and is now in exile in
Ghana. Incumbent President Gnassingbe Eyadema were re-elected in
the election.
</P>
<P>
Togolese officials said Sunday that authorities in Ghana had
arrested two persons and four more were arrested in Togo in
connection with the shooting accident. But that was not

<HEADLINE> Romania Welcomes Formation of New Kosovo Negotiating Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Foreign Ministry
Monday gave a hopeful welcome to the formation of a new
negotiating team by Kosovo's ethnic Albanian political leader
Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said in a release that it hopes the team
would be backed by the Albanian community in Kosovo and that those
who are not represented by it would be wise enough to let the
negotiation process go on.
</P>
<P>
The ministry reiterated its head Andrei Plesu's statement,
following a recent visit in Tirana, that a military solution will
do good to neither of the conflicting parts. The Foreign Ministry
also took note of the NATO member countries' statements, following
their ambassadors' meeting in Brussells on August 12, on the
Alliance's preparations for a possible military intervention in
Kosovo, in case the crisis evolution would make such an extreme
measure compulsory.
</P>
<P>
"Romania's Foreign Ministry voices hope that the Yugoslav
government officials will consider NATO's statements in full
responsibility and understand that such a choice would be harmful
to the entire nation", the release said.
</P>
<P>
After the negotiation team representing Kosovo's Albanian
population has been formed, it will be Belgrade's turn to prove
the international community its readiness to negotiate, to
peacefully and quickly solve the conflict, said the release.
</P>
<P>
Romania's Foreign Ministry welcomes the efforts undertaken by
the Contact Group (Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the United
States) and both the European Union and OSCE's chairmanship to
make Belgrade's government officials and Kosovo's population
representatives start immediate negotiations and stop violent
actions.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the new negotiating team, to negotiate with
Belgrade leaders on a new statute for Kosovo, was announced last
Friday in the Kosovo capital of Pristina in the presence of
representatives of the Contact Group.

<HEADLINE> Lower Temperatures Affect Resettlement of Flood-Hit Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The resettlement of flood-hit
residents in Qiqihar, a major industrial city in northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province, could become more critical as temperatures
begin to drop.
</P>
<P>
Qiqihar will enter a low-temperature season in less than one
month and the hundreds of thousands of residents whose houses have
been destroyed by floodidng are going to be tested by the upcoming
cold, a civil affairs official said.
</P>
<P>
The worst flooding in more than 100 years has affected 60
percent of Qiqihar's population of 5.5 million, according
to official figures.
</P>
<P>
The temperature in Qiqihar, which falls within the
temperate-frigid zone, usually drops to around 10 degrees Celsius
at night in September, according to meteorologists.
</P>
<P>
The lower temperatures will be extremely hazardous for flood
victims living outdoors, officials said, adding that people are
badly in need of grain, medicine, clothing, quilts and fuel.
</P>
<P>
After a long period of overcast and rainy days as well as lower
temperatures, the problems of flood victims in eating, medical
care and keeping warm have become even more critical, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Assistance from other parts of the country is being sought to
prevent them from hunger and cold, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
So far, authorities have sent 200 tons of food to the flood-hit
areas, in addition to 120,000 yuan worth of medicine, 16,270
pieces of clothing, 360 tons of grain and 780 tons of plastics.
</P>
<P>
However, drinking water, lighting equipment, medicine and many
other items are still in short supply.

<HEADLINE> Ronaldo Admits Sedative-Taking before World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian soccer star Ronaldo
took a tranquilizer hours before Brazil's 3-0 defeat to France in
the World Cup final, according to the World Soccer magazine.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo took the sedative after suffering a convulsion a few
hours before kick-off, the British magazine quoted Brazil's
doctor, Lidio Toledo, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"He gave me half a blue tablet before I went to the clinic,"
Ronaldo was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo had been quitted from Brazil's original team sheet.
Then his name appeared on a revised team sheet released before
kick-off. In the meantime, Brazil did not warm up on the field
amid speculation of a rift between players over the exclusion, or
inclusion, of Ronaldo.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old star, rated the best player in the world last
season, had a very sluggish game.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's World Cup '98 assistant manager Zico said emergency
tests gave Ronaldo a clean bill of health but he was doubtful the
player should have taken the field.
</P>
<P>
"It's always a mistake to play somebody who's not 100 percent
fit," he was quoted as saying. "It was proved that even if he's
the best player in the world, he can't go onto the field if he's
not well."
</P>
<P>
"Ronaldo was sleepy, really groggy. He was in no condition to
play. The medical department could have said no. If they had said
'Don't play him,' (coach Mario) Zagallo wouldn't have played him.
At no time did the doctors say no." Zico said.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo, who plays at Italian Serie A club Inter Milan this
week, says medical tests showed he is in perfect shape.
</P>
<P>
"I think there's been an exaggeration in all this," he was
quoted as saying. "I can't explain what caused that (the fit).
Only God knows what made me ill. In principle, I'm not doing any
more tests."

<HEADLINE> Sudan's Opposition Parties Pledge Further Dialog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Ending a three-day meeting here,
Sudan's opposition leaders Tuesday affirmed the "special"
relationship between Egypt and Sudan and stressed the need to
deepen it for the benefit of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt and Sudan have legitimate interests in the two
countries," said a final statement released by the National
Democratic Alliance (NDA), an umbrella group of Sudan's opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese opposition leaders pledged to continue dialog with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who invited them to Cairo after
the peace talks between the Sudanese government and the rebels in
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, failed to make progress.
</P>
<P>
The statement accused Khartoum of being "a threat to security
and stability in Sudan and Egypt, to the Arab national security
and Arab-African integration."
</P>
<P>
The Eritrea-based NDA groups armed rebels in southern Sudan and
former Sudanese leaders ousted in a 1989 military coup launched by
Omar Hassan al-Bashir.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by John Garang, leader of the Sudan
People's Liberation Army, which has been fighting against the
Islamic north since 1983 for greater autonomy for the south's
animists and Christians.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Othman Al-Mirghani, head of NDA, and former Prime
Minister el-Sadeq el-Mahdi were also at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leaders affirmed that they rejected Sudan's new
constitution, which is based on Islamic law. But they said they
will uphold Sudan's national unity and respect the cultural and
ethnic diversity and equal rights for all Sudanese in the north
and south without discrimination.
</P>
<P>
They have assigned the joint NDA military command with
activating moves for coordinated military actions.
</P>
<P>
The second congress of the NDA leaders is slated for September
26 in Asmara, Eritrea, to resume discussions and preparation for
a statement on the future of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's parliament has protested Egypt's move to host the
opposition meeting, accusing Cairo of fostering the rebels.
</P>
<P>
But Egypt has argued that by hosting the meeting it aimed to
keep Sudan unified.
</P>
<P>
Egypt fears that a possible disintegration of Sudan could
endanger the Nile, its main source of water.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright left Tanzania for Kenya
Tuesday afternoon, changing another plane.
</P>
<P>
Albright was forced to overstay in Tanzania for more than two
hours because of the technical problems of her first aircraft,
said Shooter Green, crew chief of the plane.
</P>
<P>
Green said that a pipe in the No. 4 engine was damaged, making
the plane unable to fly to Kenya. The pipe, or crossover duct,
about 12 centimeters in diameter and 50 centimeters long, was
damaged because of exhaustion, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary of State finally took off with the help of a
U.S. aircraft coming from Nairobi. The "Gulfstream" plane left
from the Dar es Salaam International Airport at 14:53 local time.
</P>
<P>
Another Gulfstream plane from Nairobi left 10 minutes earlier
before Albright's departure, carrying equipment and some of her
entourage.
</P>
<P>
Her first plane, a Boeing-747, is waiting for the arrival of
spare parts for repair.
</P>
<P>
Albright comes to Africa to express the nation's grief for
African and U.S. victims in the bombing of U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania that happened almost simultaneously on August
7.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, she visited the bombed US embassy, residence
of the Charge d'Affaires, consoled the injured at the Muhimbili
Medical Center and paid a courtesy call on Tanzanian
Vice-President Dr. Omar Ali Juma. President Mkapa is on a visit
to the Nordic countries.
</P>
<P>
She laid a wreath at the crater produced by the powerful blast
and paid tribute to the victims. The blast in Dar es Salaam
killed 10 people and injured 76 others. No Americans died but
several suffered injuries.
</P>
<P>
The car bomb attack in Nairobi caused much heavier casualties,
killing 247 people and injuring 5,000 others, including 12 U.S.
citizens.
</P>
<P>
Although the bombs were targeted at the U.S. embassies, the
overwhelming number of the dead and injured were ordinary Kenyans
and Tanzanians, and the United States has been accused of caring
more for its citizens during the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
Washington has denied the charge, but Albright's visit is seen
by analysts as an attempt to make up for the matter.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary of State revealed that the U..S government has
provided emergency relief worth 100,000 U.S. Dollars to Tanzania
for the bombing and will grant more funds to compensate the
victims.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she said the government has requested a contingency
budget from the Congress for the construction of new embassy
buildings in the two east African countries.
</P>
<P>
She said the United States will not be intimidated by
terrorist bomb attacks and will go on investigating the
perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian foreign minister Jakaya Kikwete, told reporters that
the bombing was done by terrorists. Therefore, it will not arouse
the hatred of Tanzanians toward Americans.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister thanked the United States for its
perennial assistance to Tanzania and wished the friendship
between the two countries will last. He also welcomed U..S
businessmen to invest in tourism, ports and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Secretary of State during her inspection at the
wrecked embassy, Kennith Piernick, head of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) team here, said they are still making efforts
to assemble pieces of the wreckage, and the "picture is getting
clearer."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Foreign Reserves Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's foreign currency
reserves level now stands at one and a half months import cover,
the Zimbabwe News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ideal level for the reserves is projected to be three
months import cover.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict that the situation is not likely to improve
since inflows from tobacco earnings will soon stop as the
marketing season nears its end.
</P>
<P>
They said the reserves would remain at the current level until
February/March next year when the new tobacco selling season
opens.
</P>
<P>
''The tobacco sales are about to close and there will be a
marked reduction in export earnings in the period from September
to February/March next year, the time when reserves are at their
lowest,'' said a money market analyst with a local bank.
</P>
<P>
''The best we can hope for is the stabilization of the
reserves at the current levels,'' the analyst said.
</P>
<P>
However, there are strong beliefs in the market that the
levels being given by the authorities are inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
''We suspect that the official figure is much lower that the
actual level which we believe to be two to three weeks import
cover,'' an analyst said.
</P>
<P>
Although tobacco prices, which opened soft at the beginning of
the season, have generally improved, they have remained 30
percent below those of last season.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is one of Zimbabwe's main foreign currency earners,
accounting for 30 percent of the country's total export receipts
annually.

<HEADLINE> Situation in Lesotho Capital Back to Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The situation in Lesotho
capital Maseru has returned to normal after Monday's clash by
police and opposition party protesters which claimed two lives,
Lesotho police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The shops are open today and even the traffic is flowing
normally," South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted Lesotho
police spokesman Sekoateng Serabeli as saying.
</P>
<P>
Opposition party members are still gathering at the gates to
King Letsie III's royal palace for the 15th day in protest
against the electoral results of the May 23 general elections.
</P>
<P>
They are demanding the annulment of the results, which they
claim had been rigged in favor of the ruling Lesotho Congress for
Democracy (LCD).
</P>
<P>
The LCD won 79 of 80 seats in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
After the shooting on Monday, an advisor to Lesotho's
opposition parties, Mamello Morrison, appealed to South African
President Nelson Mandela to intervene in his capacity as Chairman
of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Opposition spokesmen claimed that two people died when police
moved in to disperse the protesters and attacked a supporter of
the opposition Basotholand Congress Party who refused orders not
to join the crowd.
</P>
<P>
The police claimed, however, the protesters fired the first
shot.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the three-nation commission investigating
opposition claims of election irregularities, Monday indicated
that the commission could complete its work by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho Independent Electoral Commission Chairman Sekara
Mafisa testified before the commission Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The commission chaired by Deputy President of South African
Constitutional Court Pius Langa comprises members from South
Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> S. African Ministers Go to Rwanda on Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 18 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo and Defense Minister Joe Modise Tuesday left
for Rwanda on a secret mission, South African Press Association
(SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The mission was shrouded in secrecy, with ministry officials
declining to confirm the ministers' whereabouts and the nature of
the mission, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
"I can't say where he (Nzo) is; I've checked right up the line
and I can't say at the moment where he is," SAPA quoted a Foreign
Ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Nzo, who was due in Cape Town on Tuesday morning,
left instead for Kigali after initial problems in getting
clearance for the flight, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
A Defense Ministry official confirmed that Modise had
accompanied Nzo, but was unable to say when the ministers were
due back.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know the duration of the meeting," an official was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official declined to give further details.
</P>
<P>
The visit appears to be a follow-up to earlier South African
efforts to mediate a solution to the rebellion in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), and follows a visit two weeks ago to
Lubumbashi, where both ministers held talks with embattled DRC
President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Kabila was reportedly in Zimbabwe Tuesday at a meeting of
defense ministers, seeking help from that country as well as from
Angola and Namibia, to defeat his Rwandan-backed rebel foes.

<HEADLINE> Iran's FM Rules out Recognition of Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi here Tuesday rejected rumors that Tehran intends to
recognize the Taliban militia as the ruler of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the official news agency IRNA, Kharrazi said "we do
not have any intention of recognizing the Taliban, but believe
that a broad-based government should come to power in Afghanistan
and rights of all tribes, including Pashtuns, Tajiks, Shiites and
Uzbeks, should be honored."
</P>
<P>
Iran has been backing the opposition Northern Alliances headed
by ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani in the fighting against
the Taliban, which reportedly boosted Pakistani support.
</P>
<P>
Eleven Iranian diplomats, a correspondent and dozens of drivers
reportedly fell into the hands of the Taliban, which lately
conquered Mazar-e-Sharif, a main stronghold of the opposition.
Iran has been sending warnings to the Taliban, which rejected the
claim, and urge it to release them.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Iran is against the Taliban's acts and moves, as
well as the danger it has posed to the region, but added that as a
tribe mainly made up of the Pashtuns, the group is entitled to
play a role in the future Afghan government.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Majlis (Parliament) on Tuesday held a closed-door
session attended by Kharrazi and Information Minister Qorbanali
Dorri Najafabadi, to discuss the situation in Afghanistan and
Tehran's corresponding policies.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the conservative-dominated Majlis criticized
the government's foreign policy towards Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
However, Kharrazi stated Iran will continue its efforts both at
international and regional levels and in holding contacts with
Pakistan "to ensure the formation of a government in Afghanistan,
which honors the rights of all the minorities."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Iranian nationals captured by the Taliban,
Kharrazi said that according to available information, these
people are all alive and in good health condition.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Iran has taken various diplomatic initiatives for
their release from "clutches of the Taliban," and talks are
underway with Pakistan, regional states and the United Nations in
this respect. He promised the use of "all means available to secure a
speedy release."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he ruled out the possibility of a war breaking out
between Iran and the Taliban, though reports said that Tehran has
deployed more armed forces along the border with Afghanistan.

</P>
<P>
Troussier, who guided South Africa at the World Cup finals in

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The German economy is set to grow
this year by 2.9 percent over 1997 due to strong exports and a
strengthening domestic demand, German Economics Minister Guenter
Rexrodt said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rexrodt told reporters that the current German economic growth
stood on a solid and broad base. "The upswing is not a straw fire;
it's sustainability is without question," he said.
</P>
<P>
The continuing export boom and expanding domestic demand, which
is expected to grow by 2.5 percent this year, had also become a
driving force behind the economic growth, Rexrodt added.
</P>
<P>
The economics minister also said that Germany could expect
350,000 fewer unemployed people by the end of this year compared
to the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
But for the year as a whole, the average jobless total would
remain as high as 4.3 million, he added.

<HEADLINE>   Hoddle Shrugs off Cup Book Furore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Glenn Hoddle has rejected
criticism over his book on the World Cup, saying he wants to lead
England into the next one on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Hoddle made his opinion public
since the recent furore over his controversial 1998 World Cup
Diary.
</P>
<P>
His current contract expires after Euro 2000 and discussions
have already begun with FA bosses as to whether or not he will
remain in the job to lead England into the next World Cup.
</P>
<P>
But the England coach said: "None of this controversy will
affect my decision as to whether or not I sign a new contract.
</P>
<P>
"I have two years of my current contract still remaining and
that is how things stand at this moment in time."
</P>
<P>
Hoddle has come under fire from his predecessors, former
internationals and the players' union for deciding to publish the
details of the talk with Gascoigne during which the midfielder
smashed a bedside lamp and "went berserk".
</P>
<P>
But Hoddle, speaking at Bisham Abbey where England are
training, said it had not affected the team.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I am very surprised by all the fuss and when people
read the book they will be able to make their own decisions.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no adverse feelings among the players, they
have been very positive and there have been no problems.
</P>
<P>
"I asked any players to come and see me if they had a problem
(with the book) and not one came forward."
</P>
<P>
Hoddle has been working with a squad of players since Sunday
evening in preparation for England's first Euro 2000 qualifying
match against Sweden early next month.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Dips Slightly in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit dipped
slightly to 14.2 billion U.S. dollars in June, but still near an
all-time high, the U.S. Department of Commerce said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit in June was down 8.9 percent from a record of
15.5 billion dollars set in May, which was the first decline in
the deficit since January.
</P>
<P>
Despite the small decline, the trade deficit for the second
quarter in goods and services was the highest in history at 44
billion dollars. The surging trade deficit this year is blamed
primarily on the serious economic trouble in Asia, which has cut
sharply into U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
For the first six months of this year, America's trade deficit
is running at an annual rate of 158 billion dollars, far
surpassing last year's imbalance of 110 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
While the overall deficit declined in June, the deficit with
the Pacific Rim continued to surge, totaling 73 billion dollars
for the first six months of this year, 45 percent higher than the
first six months of last year.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with the newly industrialized countries of Asia,
including South Korea, jumped to 2.4 billion dollars in June, the
highest monthly imbalance since October 1989.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Japan was up 6 percent in June to 5.3 billion
dollars and totals 31 billion dollars for the first half of the
year, 19 percent higher than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In June, U.S. exports of goods and services fell 0.5 percent to
76.2 billion dollars, but managed to make a one percent increase for
the first six months of this year, far below the 9.6 percent
growth rate turned in during the first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Imports in June were down 2 percent to 90 billion dollars after
reaching an all-time record in May. The drop in imports reflected
a decline of 8.1 percent in oil imports, which fell to 4.3 billion
dollars as the price per barrel of crude oil dropped to 11.23
dollars, the lowest level since September 1986.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of imported cars were also down in June, declining by
707 million dollars to a total of 11.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the export side, farm shipments managed a small increase of
95 million dollars to 3.8 billion dollars in June, but for the
first six months of this year are down 2 billion dollars,
reflecting the loss of Asian markets and lower crop prices.
</P>
<P>
In a separate economic report, the Labor Department said
that inflation remained low in July with the consumer price index
edging up just 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, consumer prices have been rising at an annual
rate of just 1.5 percent as the Asian economic crisis has helped
to stem global prices for such commodities as oil.
</P>
<P>
The rising trade deficit was a main factor slowing overall
economic growth in the spring to an anemic 1.4 percent annual rate
as U.S. manufacturers and farmers have seen exports to Asia
plummet.

<HEADLINE> China Gets ADB Loan for Railway Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
said Tuesday that it has approved a loan of 140 million U.S.
dollars for the construction of a railway in the southwestern
Chinese province of Guizhou.
</P>
<P>
The railway project is expected to enhance poverty reduction
and employment generation in landlocked Guizhou, one of the six
poorest provinces in China, the Manila-based financial institution
said.
</P>
<P>
The project will significantly increase employment and incomes
by creating over 20,000 new jobs, and provide basic social
services such as health, education and communication, it said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB will finance 37 percent of the 381 million dollars'
cost for the railway which will be built to link Liupanshui and
Baiguo in western Guizhou.
</P>
<P>
The ADB loan will be financed from the ADB's ordinary capital
resources with an interest rate determined in accordance with the
bank's pool-based variable lending rate system for U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The loan is repayable over 25 years including a grace period of
five years.

<HEADLINE> Defense Embankment to Be Built to Protect Daqing Oil Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAQING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Heilongjiang Province,
worst-hit by flooding in northeast China, plans to build an
11.5-kilometer barrier at a section between Baituozi and
Machangtun to protect the seventh drilling team of Daqing Oil
Field.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at an emergency meeting held here
today. Some 3,000 soldiers of the People's Liberation Army were
transferred here today and construction will begin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The drilling team is endangered by possible breaches of the
Nanyin Reservoir, which covers an area of 260 square kilometers
with a water storage capacity of 600 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
At present, the water level in the reservoir has climbed to
130.26 meters, only 24 centimeters from the danger mark.
</P>
<P>
To date, 38 drilling teams at Daqing have been forced to stop
normal production due to floodwaters from the Nenjiang River.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Inflation Remains Low in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The inflation in the United
States remained tame in July, the Labor Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2
percent in July. For the year so far, inflation is running at a
modest 1.5 percent annual rate, compared with 1.7 percent for all
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite steady U.S. economic growth, inflation has remained
contained, largely due to the Asian economic crisis which has
contributed to a decline in world prices for commodities ranging
from petroleum to pork.
</P>
<P>
In July, energy prices were unchanged as declines in fuel oil,
gasoline and natural gas offset a small rise in electricity costs.
Gasoline prices were 10 percent lower than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Food prices rose 0.2 percent. Fresh vegetables cost 1.3 percent
more than the month before, with the seasonally adjusted price of
tomatoes shooting up 11.3 percent. Poultry prices jumped 0.7
percent, reflecting a drought and heat wave across the South. Pork
and beef costs rose modestly while coffee prices fell 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, prices rose 0.2
percent. For the year, these "core" prices were advancing at a 2.4
percent annual rate, compared with 2.2 percent for all of 1997,
according to the department's report.
</P>
<P>
Computer prices fell 6 percent while clothing costs declined
0.3 percent, reflecting a surge in inexpensive Asian imports.
</P>
<P>
Because dealers suspended buyer incentive programs, new car and
truck prices jumped 0.5 percent, the steepest rise since April
1995. But, these prices had fallen in previous months, reflecting
competition from Asia, and were still 0.7 percent lower than July
1997.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco costs jumped 2.6 percent and are up 12.9 percent for
the year, showing tobacco companies' efforts to pay the high cost
of settling liability lawsuits filed by smokers.
</P>
<P>
The cost of medical services rose a modest 0.2 percent in July,
but for the year so far it's been a trouble spot, with inflation
running at a 3.6 percent annual rate. Last month, hospital costs
jumped 0.6 percent, the largest rise in two years.

<P>
COLOMBO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Indian crewmen from a
foreign merchant ship hijacked by Sri Lanka's Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) will be handed over to representatives of the
Indian High Commission here Tuesday night, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
The 17 Indian crewmen, accompanied by representatives of the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), were due in
Colombo Tuesday evening and will then be handed over the Indian
High Commission.
</P>
<P>
LTTE gunmen on Friday morning hijacked a Dubai-owed merchant
ship with 21 crewmen on board, including 17 Indian nationals and
four Sri Lankans.
</P>
<P>
The ship was on its way to the Jaffna Peninsula from Colombo
when it was hijacked near Mullaithivu coast in the east of Sri
Lanka. The ship was carrying cement and general cargo for traders
of Jaffna city.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka air force jets bombed the ship Friday evening in a
bid to destroy it to prevent the cargo from falling into the LTTE
rebels' hands.
</P>
<P>
LTTE said on Saturday that the Indian crewmen would be handed
over to the ICRC after interrogations were over. The four Sri
Lankans have not been released.
</P>
<P>
LTTE has been fighting a war since 1983 for a separate state in
the north and east of the country where the minority Tamil
community is concentrated.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Urges Moscow to Speed Up Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- German politicians urged Russia on
Tuesday to carry out the necessary economic reforms immediately to
stem the financial crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to Russia's decision on Monday to allow the
devaluation of the ruble by about 34 percent against the
U.S. dollar, German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said a sustained
stabilization of Russia's finances will be possible only when
investor confidence is restored.
</P>
<P>
Waigel, as quoted by the German newspaper Bild, said it was
necessary for Russia to implement the reforms outlined in the
Russian stabilization program they had agreed on with the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Waigel also hoped that the Russian government would make
special efforts to restructure its taxation system and get its
budget in order through trustworthy and visible measures.
</P>
<P>
In the face of an increasing cash crisis, the Russian central
bank announced Monday that it would raise the upper limit of the
ruble's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar from 6.3 rubles to
9.5.
</P>
<P>
Russia's government and the central bank have also imposed a
90-day moratorium, starting Monday, on the repayment of foreign
loans.
</P>
<P>
German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said he hoped to see
a financially stable Russia. "An unstable, collapsing Russia is
much more dangerous for us than a Russia we can support on the
difficult path to the market economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rexrodt also urged Russia to take its own initiative to get the
current situation under control and conduct fundamental reforms in
a bid to count on further international aid.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Lashes out at Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei Tuesday lashed out at the Taliban militia for
capturing Iranian nationals in Afghanistan and urged it to release
them.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban must make up for the ugly act of seizing the
Iranian citizens and return them home very respectfully," Khamenei
said in a speech to a group of former Iranian prisoners during the
eight years of Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian nation, government and armed forces do not
tolerate the act of "this bunch of lowly people," he warned,
quoted by the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret over the bloodshed in Afghanistan and its
fate, which he said now falls in the hands of "a bunch of ignorant
people."
</P>
<P>
He also criticized foreign interference and said "past
experience shows that a government and country which interferes in
this kind of affairs and renders assistance to aggressive and
criminal elements would be the first and biggest loser."
</P>
<P>
It was apparent that his words were directed against Pakistan,
which has reportedly backed the Taliban in its swift rise to
prominence and sweeping victory over opposition forces.
</P>
<P>
The student militia has now won control over most of
Afghanistan and imposed a strict form of Islamic rule there.
</P>
<P>
Iran claimed that the Taliban forces have taken captive 11
Iranian diplomats, an IRNA correspondent and 35 drivers after they
conquered Mazar-e-Sharif, a key stronghold of the Iranian-backed
opposition in northern Afghanistan more than a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban conceded the captivity of 35 Iranian drivers but
rejected the alleged arrest of any Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Tehran said it has enough evidence to prove these Iranian
diplomats are in the hands of the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
In the days past, Iranian leaders repeatedly urged the Taliban
to free its captives. They even threatened that Iran has the right
to resort to any means to secure the release of these Iranians.

<HEADLINE> Plane Problems Force Albright to Postpone Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was forced to postpone
flight to Kenya from Tanzania after "technical problems" occurred
to her aircraft, sources said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Sources said that Albright, who arrived at the airport at
12:40 local time (0940GMT), may board another plane, but they did
not say what kind of aircraft it will be or when it will take
off.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing-747 aircraft that carried Albright to Africa
belongs to the U.S. air force, marked "31677" on the tail
surface. It landed at the the Dar es Salaam International Airport
at 8:20 a.m. local time (0520GMT) after 16 hours of non-stop
flight from the Andrews Air Force Base in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Albright comes to Africa to express the nation's grief for
African and U.S. victims in the bombing of U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania that happened almost simultaneously on August
7.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, she visited the bombed U.S. embassy, residence
of the Charge d'Affaires, consoled the injured at the Muhimbili
Medical Center and paid a courtesy call on Tanzanian
Vice-President Dr. Omar Ali Juma. President Mkapa is on a visit
to the Nordic countries.
</P>
<P>
She laid a wreath at the crater produced by the powerful blast
and paid tribute to the victims. The blast in Dar es Salaam
killed 10 people and injured 76 others. No Americans died but
several got wounded.
</P>
<P>
The car bomb attack in Nairobi caused much heavier casualties,
killing 247 people and injuring 5,000 others, including 12 U.S.
citizens.
</P>
<P>
Although the bombs were targeted at the U.S. embassies, the
overwhelming number of the dead and injured were ordinary Kenyans
and Tanzanians, and the United States has been accused of caring
more for its citizens during the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
Washington has denied the charge, but Albright's visit is seen by
analysts as an attempt to make up for the matter.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary of State revealed that the U.S. government has
provided emergency relief worth 100,000 U.S. Dollars to Tanzania
for the bombing and will grant more funds to compensate the
victims.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she said the government has requested a contingency
budget from the Congress for the construction of new embassy
buildings in the two east African countries.
</P>
<P>
She said the United States will not be intimidated by terrorist
bomb attacks and will go on investigating the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian foreign minister Jakaya Kikwete, told reporters that
the bombing was done by terrorists. Therefore, it will not arouse
the hatred of Tanzanians toward Americans.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister thanked the United States for its
perennial assistance to Tanzania and wished the friendship
between the two countries will last. He also welcomed U.S.
businessmen to invest in tourism, ports and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Secretary of State during her inspection at the
wrecked embassy, Kennith Piernick, head of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) team here, said they are still making efforts
to assemble pieces of the wreckage, and the "picture is getting
clearer."

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Call For Arab Backing to Deter Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Permanent
Representative to the Arab League Mohamed Sobeih said on Tuesday
that Palestinians need stronger support from the Arab world to
confront Israel's hardline policy on the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians are in need of an Arab stance backing them so
as to create an international stance deterring Israel and forcing
it to go back to the Middle East peace process before it is too
late," Sobeih said in an interview with Egypt's Middle East News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is playing a major role in maintaining the peace process
and safeguarding the rights of the Palestinian people, he added.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that Palestinians have lost patience with the
Israeli stance of refusing to withdraw from more of the occupied
territories.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have been frustrated over Israel's resistance
to an American initiative calling on Israel to hand over another
13.1 percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians have accepted the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
"Frustration and disappointment are now prevailing the region
due to the dangerous Israeli practices on expanding Jerusalem and
building settlements despite United Nations Security Council
resolutions on halting these measures," the Palestinian diplomat
said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace process has been stalled since
March 1997 after Israel began construction of a Jewish settlement
in Arab East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as the capital
of their future independent state.

<HEADLINE> Water Level in Northernmost Provincial Capital Hits Historic High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- As the third flood crest on the
Songhua River approached Harbin, the capital of China's
northermost Heilongjiang Province, the water level there rose to
120.44 meters at noon today, 36 centimeters above the historic
high.
</P>
<P>
Floodwater has broken three sluice gates at Qunli Township, 50
km from Harbin. The Songhua River water flowed backward from the
six-m-wide outlet, inundating a large tract of saline-alkali
land and posing a threat to Harbin Airport.
</P>
<P>
Local residents and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army
(PLA) rushed to plug the gaps with sandbags and boards. They also
dropped a steel framework at the flood relief gates and poured
stone and sandbags into the opening.
</P>
<P>
But the repair efforts were inadequate and the local government
decided to abandon the effort in the afternoon. Flood fighters
were evacuated from the dikes and are preparing to build a second
defense embankment.
</P>
<P>
A 1.5-km section on the approach to the Songhuajiang Bridge, a
key communication line between Harbin, the Daqing Oilfield and
Qiqihar, has been immersed by floodwater to a depth of 20-to-80
centimeters. Police have marked both edges of the bridge with
belts to keep motor vehicles out of the river.
</P>
<P>
Traffic is still operating normally, but traffic jams occurred
several times today lasting up to 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Water conservation experts predict that the third flood crest
will arrive in Harbin on Friday. By then, the water level is
expected to reach 120.6 m with a flow rate of 16,000 cubic meters
per second.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Touching Two-Month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar fell
through 59.00 U.S. cents Tuesday for the first time in two months.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended the day at 59.01 U.S. cents, slightly
weaker than 59.13 here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday morning, the unit fell through 59.00 .U.S cents
for the first time in two months, touching a low of 58.75 U.S.
cents.
</P>
<P>
Traders said this morning's fall was a hangover from offshore
selling which petered out quickly, leading the unit into tight
range trading for the remainder of the session.
</P>
<P>
Scant attention was paid to the release of the Reserve Bank of
Australia's (RBA) quarterly report on the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank chief economist Craig James said the RBA
had done "its best impression of tip toeing through a minefield."
</P>
<P>
The central bank said monetary policy has to take into account
the crisis in Asia "as best it can", and balance it against purely
domestic factors.
</P>
<P>
In its report, the RBA also questioned the Australian dollar's
recent strong link to the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
"While it is understandable that the exchange rate of the
Australian dollar reflects developments in Asia, the closeness of
the link to the yen that has developed over the past year seems
difficult to justify on the behavior of the two economies," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The domestic currency has moved tightly in tune with the yen
for almost the past year as traders and analysts have emphasized
Japan's pivotal role in the region.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar was buying 85.87
Japanese yen from 86.49 and 1.0591 German marks from 1.0704.

HONG KONG, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa met with Peter Beattie, premier of Australia's Queensland
state, Tuesday to exchange views on the latest economic
developments in the region and in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tung briefed the guest on the latest measures taken by the
Special Administrative Region (SAR) government in the stock and
futures markets to counter speculative activities which were
distorting the markets.
</P>
<P>
Tung emphasized that the SAR government would only contemplate
such measures when there was ample evidence for an abundantly
clear linkage between speculative activities in the Hong Kong
dollar market and those in the stock and futures markets.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to take these measures after very careful
consideration," Tung said, adding that the government had no
intention of supporting the stock market at a certain level.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive told Beattie that Hong Kong is undergoing a
painful but necessary economic adjustment, which would help
enhance the city's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the measures we have taken will help provide a
healthy environment for our economy to go through an effective
adjustment," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong was the first stop of Beattie's first Asian trip as
the Queensland premier.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expect Haixia In 2000 Games, But Not Worried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Nell Fortner, the head coach of
the defending champion United States women's basketball team,
said Tuesday here she expected China's giant center Zheng Haixia
plays in the 2000 Olympic Games, but Fortner is not worried.
</P>
<P>
"Haixia is a great player. She changed the style of the
Chinese national team," said Fortner. "She's a good scorer, but
not a good defender. She's slow, and opponents could run around
her and make shots."
</P>
<P>
The 2.04-meter-tall Haixia, playing the WNBA for Los Angles
Sparks, is one of the best players in China's women's basketball
history with her accreting shooting threat and under basket
power.
</P>
<P>
Haixia led the Chinese team to win the silver medal in the
1992 Olympic Games and the second place in the 1994 World
Championship, where she was named the best center and selected to
the best lineup of the world.
</P>
<P>
Fortner is guiding the 1998 U.S. R. William Jones Cup Team on
a China warm-up tour. They lost to the Chinese national team
66-62 Monday night in Tangshan, Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
"They (the Chinese team) didn't execute well last night, but
they will be better, nevertheless, they played better defense
without Haixia," Fortner said.
</P>
<P>
Haixia and her young teammates fell to a disappointing 12th
place in last May's world championship. She is now in Los Angles
with the L.A. Sparks recovering from a knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
"But she is so big that it's a hard decision to leave her out
of the national squad if I'm the (Chinese) coach," she said.
</P>
<P>
Fortner, who recently piloted the U.S. 1998 Women's World
Championship Team to a perfect 9-0 record to win the gold medal
in Berlin, Germany, said defense is the winning point in nowadays
basketball matches.
</P>
<P>
"You can shoot, we can shoot, too, so defense decides the
winning team."
</P>
<P>
The USA national team will also play the Pan-America Games in
Canada next summer during the period when Fortner is on the post.
</P>
<P>
Fortner, USA Basketball's 1997-2000 National Team coach, said
right now the American team is the best in the world, and they
will do well in the Sydney Games and the Pan-America.
</P>
<P>
Australia and Russia will be their toughest opponents in
women's basketball, Fortner added.
</P>
<P>
The Jones Cup team also lost to the Chinese national junior
team 81-77 in overtime on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Fortner and her Jones Cup team will fly Thursday to Chinese
Taipei for the annual tournament slated from August 23-27, which
brackets Chinese Taipei, South Korea, Japan, Senegal and
Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Capital Declares War on Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Romania's capital city of
Bucharest is determined to declare war on air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Squads of traffic police will make frequent checks on vehicles
producing high levels of pollution.
</P>
<P>
Pollution check-points are already in place in the downtown
area, Deputy Mayor Paul Radu Popovat said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles with exhaust emissions that exceed established
pollution levels will have their registration or licenses
temporarily suspended until evidence is produced showing that the
malfunctioning auto exhaust system has been repaired or replaced.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, vehicles weighing more than 3.5 tons will be banned
from city traffic. Delivery vehicles will be required to operate
exclusively during the night.
</P>
<P>
The official said the measures were intended to reduce
pollution and protect public health.
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency alerted the authorities to
an alarming increase in the ozone tropospheric concentration in
the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Excessive ozone rates affect the eyes, the mucous membranes and
causes pain to people suffering from poor blood circulation.
</P>
<P>
Since the ozone concentration has reached the alert level,
Popovat said the traffic in downtown Bucharest will be banned
gradually.
</P>
<P>
Heavy vehicles traveling in the downtown area will be forbidden
during the hours of 6 a.m. till 6 p.m., while all downtown traffic
will be forbidden from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., except for public
transportation, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the remaining hours of the day, cars may be banned from
the city on alternating days, depending on whether they have odd-
or even-numbered license plates, Popovat said.

<HEADLINE> Banned List May Increase for 2000 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The number of substances on the
banned list may be increased for the Sydney 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The current list of banned substances was too long but was
only possible to grow before the next Olympics, Australian Phil
Coles, a member of the IOC and AOC, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"There is an extensive list called prohibit substances which
is too long and very complicated," Coles said. "The list belongs
to the IOC and its medical commission. It will be very hard to
reduce, in fact they might even add to it."
</P>
<P>
Leading Australian officials want the IOC to remove substances
found in common medicines which provide no real performance-boost
but cause unwary athletes to test positive.
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty hard to put a handle on it. You and I can go to a
chemist when we have got a headache but athletes can't." Coles
said.

<HEADLINE> Antje Vollmer Ends Visit to Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Antje Vollmer, vice-president of
the Federal Assembly of Germany, left here for home after winding
up a week-long visit to the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
This was Vollmer's third trip to Tibet since 1987.
</P>
<P>
During her stay in Tibet, Vollmer visited several temples,
monasteries, the Tibet Library and the renovation site of the old
residential quarters in Lhasa as well as some peasant families. She
also held talks with local officials and managers of German-funded
projects.
</P>
<P>
Pu Qiong, vice-chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Regional
People's Congress Standing Committee, met with Vollmer and her
party here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pu Qiong briefed the German visitors on the social and economic
development of Tibet. Ninety-six percent of the 2.4 million people
in the region are of Tibetan nationality, he said.
</P>
<P>
The annual economic growth in Tibet has surpassed 10 percent
for the past four years, which is higher than the average economic
development in China, Pu Qiong told Vollmer.
</P>
<P>
He added that the annual average income of the urban residents
in Tibet reached 5,300 yuan (640 U.S. dollars) last year while
the annual average income of peasants and herdsman hit 1,081
yuan (about 125 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Vollmer told Pu Qiong that she had visited more places on her
present trip and had learned more about the current situation in
the countryside in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The two also exchanged views on issues such as the exiled Dalai
Lama, the condition of temples and the return of overseas
Tibetans.

<HEADLINE> Americans Flocking to Canada This Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Exchange rates are bringing more
Americans into Canada, but keeping more Canadians at home,
Statistics Canada said in a recent report.
</P>
<P>
Americans made a record of 1.2 million overnight car trips to
Canada in June, an increase of 2.2 percent over May. However,
overnight car visits by Canadians to the United States fell 2.3
percent to 1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
Single-day trips between the two countries followed the same
pattern. Same-day car trips by Americans increased 2.3 percent
between May and June. While Canadians made the fewest same-day
trips, 2.4 million, since February of 1987.
</P>
<P>
In Toronto, hotels have been sold out on many weekends. The
occupancy rate will be up 2 to 3 percent by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The jump in American tourism is compensating for a decline in
visits from overseas. Visits by Asian residents are down 12.8 percent
to 135,000 from June of last year, according to Statistics Canada.
</P>
<P>
Visits from Europe fell 2.9 percent in June compared to one
year earlier. But there was an increase in the number of visitors
from the United Kingdom as the British pound remained strong.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Government, NLD Party Leaders Meet in Yangon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Myanmar government
and the National League for Democracy (NLD) met here Tuesday
afternoon, according to an official information sheet.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar State Peace
and Development Council (SPDC) and U Aung Shwe, chairman of the
NLD party had a 45-minute meeting, which officials described as
"the first in a series of meetings."
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to which an invitation was sent by the government
to the NLD on Monday, came three days ahead of the deadline set by
the NLD for a demand to the ruling SPDC that the parliament, which
was elected in the 1990 multi-party general election, meet for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
Participants described Tuesday's meeting as "open, frank and
cordial," the information sheet said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope this is the first in a series of confidence-building
talks between the government and the NLD," Khin Nyunt was quoted
as saying. "We have had a fruitful meeting and we also have
appreciated the NLD's acceptance of our offer of a meeting."
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by SPDC Third Secretary Lt. Gen.
Win Myint, Chief Justice U Aung Toe and Attorney General U Tha Tun
from the government side. But it was not clear who else from the
NLD side other than its chairman also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The NLD also issued a statement Tuesday evening, confirming the
 meeting.
</P>
<P>
But neither disclosed the details of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
On August 7, Myanmar Deputy Minister of Home Affairs Brig. Gen.
Myint Maung, on behalf of the government, extended an invitation
to the NLD chairman for a meeting on August 8. But the invitation
was turned down on account of the government's exclusion of three
key NLD party leaders including Aung San Suu Kyi, the party's
general secretary.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting took place as Aung San Suu Kyi has been
prevented since August 12 by the authorities for the second time
from traveling to Pathein, a southwestern city in the country, to
meet her party members.

<HEADLINE> China Issues Circular to Stabilize Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- China today issued an urgent
circular calling for efforts to stabilize prices during the
flood-control period.
</P>
<P>
Flood control is the No.1 task of the whole Party and the
entire nation and the pricing departments at all levels must do a
good job of contributing to the flood-control effort, stated the
circular issued by the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Exceptionally large floods on the Yangtze, Songhua and other
rivers have resulted in grave losses of life and property since
this summer.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, pricing departments must beef up
management to stabilize the prices of daily necessities, and no
increases should be introduced among products whose prices are
determined by the government during the flooding season,
</P>
<P>
The pricing departments at the provincial level are empowered
to impose ceilings on daily necessities such as staple food and
non-staple foodstuffs, materials essential to flood control, and
to the resumption of production and rebuilding of houses, the
circular added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, pricing departments should also step up efforts for
price supervision and severe punishment will be dealt to those
units and individuals engaged in hoarding and speculation and to
those who randomly raise products and traffic prices and charge
arbitrary fees.
</P>
<P>
And efforts should also be made to study the impact of flooding
on the national economy and market prices, the circular urged.
</P>
<P>
In a similar development, the State Bureau of Pharmaceutical
Supervision and Management today issued an urgent notice calling
for still greater efforts to guard against the flow of fake and
inferior medicine to the flood-damaged areas.
</P>
<P>
Those who produce and sell fake and inferior medicine will be
brought to justice, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen public supervision, a telephone hot line, (010)
88372260), has been opened to accept complaints.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's External Reserve Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's external reserve
dropped to 7.9 billion U.S. Dollars in June, about a six percent
slide from the 8.4 billion Dollars recorded last March, the
newspaper This Day reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted economic analysts here as saying that the
slide might be due to government's recent disbursement of cash
call funds to its joint venture partners.
</P>
<P>
Following pressure from the Multi-national oil companies,
which are joint venture partners with the Federal Government,
about the crippling effect of accumulated cash call debts on
their operations, Nigerian Head of State Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar
recently paid 630 million Dollars as its own share of the joint
venture operations.
</P>
<P>
If Nigeria keeps up the pace for meeting these financial
obligations, economic analysts said, the stock of the country's
external reserves may continue to drop.
</P>
<P>
With its present level of official reserves, Nigeria can
comfortably finance more than five months' imports, they noted,
adding that this means Nigeria will increase her credit rating in
the international market since it has the financial muscles to
meet its obligations.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Central Bank of Nigeria were quoted as saying
that the reserves may not be stable again as the Federal
Government has been drawing on it.

<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The number of cellular phone
subscribers of China Telecom, the largest telecommunications
operator in China, surpassed 20 million on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June this year, China Telecom's mobile phone
networks had covered the country's 31 provinces, municipalities
and ethnic autonomous regions, 308 prefectures and
prefecture-level cities, and 1,856 counties and county-level
cities, according to Li Xiuchuan, deputy director of the mobile
phone bureau of China Telecom.
</P>
<P>
Cellular phones in China were first introduced by China Telecom
in 1987. By July 1, last year, the number of China Telecom mobile
phone users had reached 10 million.
</P>
<P>
Of the 100 million Global Satellite Mobile (GSM) phone users in
the world, one-seventh are from China Telecom. Currently, China
Telecom GSM users can roam in 32 countries and regions the world
over.
</P>
<P>
Until Unicom came into being in the '90s, China Telecom had
been the sole operator of civil telecommunications in China. But
Unicom, which was founded by a number of Chinese enterprises, is
still considered too small to pose a substantial threat to China
Telecom.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Since the first case of HIV
infection was reported in Chinese capital 13 years ago, the total
has risen to 241, according to local health authorities.
</P>
<P>
Among those infected by HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus,
33 have developed into acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS),
the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Health said today.
</P>
<P>
Prostitution and drug abuse with contaminated syringes are the
leading causes of transmission of the virus among Beijing
residents, and the rapid growth of a young migrant population in
the city may increase the problem, warned Xu Keyi, director of the
Beijing AIDS Clinical Research Center.
</P>
<P>
Xu has called for increased surveillance among high-risk people
such as prostitutes, drug users and illegal blood sellers. He also
suggested easier access for the public to knowledge about HIV/AIDS
prevention.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has three hospitals with about 2,000 beds for AIDS
patients and sufferers of sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
However, drugs commonly used against AIDS in Western countries
are not affordable for most Chinese patients, which means China
must look for cheaper methods with traditional medicines, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
The number of reported HIV/AIDS cases in China had reached
10,676 by the end of June, and all 31 Chinese provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities have been afflicted,
according to the Ministry of Health.

<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>

market forces.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton's legal strategy of denying any perjury
and offering relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky appears to be a

without enough evidence to bring a criminal case or convince
Congress to launch impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
-- Republican lawmakers Monday commended President Clinton for
admitting his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, but dismissed
any possibility that the president's brief speech could put the
scandal to rest.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- China's first nationwide
air-ground data link network opened today for civil aviation
transportation.
</P>
<P>
With an investment of 45 million yuan, (5.4 million
U.S. dollars), the network is the first step China has taken in
the transition to a new aviation system designed to improve the
quality of service and safety level.
</P>
<P>
The network, from Jiamusi City in northernmost Heilongjiang
Province to Haikou City in south China's island Province of
Hainan, contains 25 ground stations as well as a network
management and data processing center. It covers the air routes of
Beijing-Guangzhou, Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Guangzhou and
Beijing-Harbin.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the network is capable of carrying out
air-ground automatic communications using VHF (very high
frequency) transmissions, which will provide the location of
aircraft even without radar.
</P>
<P>
Jointly developed by the Aviation Data Communication Corp. and
the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the
network has been applied to airlines including Air China, China
Southern and China Eastern airlines.
</P>
<P>
The system is also connected with the airlines' ground network,
international network, and post and telecommunications network.
</P>
<P>
As the second step of this program, the Civil Aviation
Administration of China plans to set up 100 ground stations that
will cover all air routes except Tibet by the year 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
met today with visiting Djiboutian President Hassan Gouled Aptidon
and noted that Sino-Djiboutian relations have progressed smoothly
in spite of rapidly changing international and domestic situations.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have continuously enhanced political,
economic and cultural cooperation, and have supported each other
in international affairs since the forging of diplomatic ties some
20 years ago, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that all sovereign countries are equal regardless
of their size, and said all developing countries, including China
and Djibouti, should strengthen their unity and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China places high value on its traditional friendship with
Djibouti and firmly believes that joint efforts will steadily
promote long-term Sino-Djiboutian friendship and cooperative
relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang appreciated the Djiboutian government and people for
their efforts in probing a development path suited to unique
conditions in the country, as well as for maintaining national
peace and promoting understanding between the country's ethnic
minorities.
</P>
<P>
Djibouti has not only succeeded in stabilizing its political
situation and promoting economic growth, but has also played
an important role in safeguarding peace and stability in countries
around the Horn of Africa by engaging in active endeavors to ease
regional conflicts, according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed the hope that Djibouti will record new
achievements in national construction, and briefed his guests on

friend, and expressed gratitude for the generous support and
assistance it has provided to add impetus to his country's
development.
</P>
<P>
Djibouti will steadfastly support the one-China policy and
reunification effort, and will continue to develop friendly
relations with its close friend, according to Aptidon.
</P>
<P>
He expressed great solicitude for flood-stricken areas in
China, and further expressed admiration for the braveness and
perseverance the Chinese people have exhibited battling the worst
flooding in decades. China will win the battle, according to
Gouled, who also presented a personal donation of 10,000 US
dollars for flood victims.
</P>
<P>
Aptidon presented Jiang with the Great Star Medal, the highest
award Djibouti presents to leaders of friendly countries.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Struggles to Settle Computer Glitches by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is sparing no efforts to
check the computer Millennium Bug before it strikes at the coming
of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri has put January 1999 as the
deadline for completing adjustment of computer systems in
government departments, and mid-1999 as the date for ensuring
smooth operation of all these systems.
</P>
<P>
Institutions and governments around the world are trying every
means to tackle the Year 2000 problem or Millennium Bug (Y2K).
</P>
<P>
The problem arises from the inability of old computer systems
to distinguish between the years 2000 and 1900 because their codes
represent years simply as 00. The bug could cause various problems
and even shut down the whole systems when it strikes.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette reported Tuesday that a special
ministerial committee has suggested 13 ministries and departments
adjust their computers. This move will cost around 226 million
pounds (66.47 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to a committee report submitted to the prime minister
Monday, all the computer systems in the civil aviation, the
banking and reconstruction sector and 90 percent in the
telecommunication sector have completed adjustment.
</P>
<P>
And only 5 percent of the equipment in the information sector
faces the disturbance of the Millennium Bug.

<HEADLINE> Flood Crest Passes Jingjiang Section of Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The sixth flood crest this year
passed the Jingjiang Section of the Yangtze River in central Hubei
Province without major incidents Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The flood peak, which is also the largest this year, pushed the
water level to 45.22 meters at the city of Shashi, compared with
44.67 meters recorded in 1954 and 44.95 meters recorded on August
8, during the year's fourth flood crest.
</P>
<P>
Shashi, about 2 1/2-hours' drive upriver from Wuhan, also
recorded its largest flow rate ever of more than 50,000 square
meters, according to Tang Congsheng, director of the Jingjiang
Hydrometric Bureau of the Yangtze River Water Conservation
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The passing of the sixth flood crest through the Jingjiang
embankments with such a high water level indicates that the dikes
have been well-built and reinforced in the past decades, according
to local officials.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the safety of the embankments during the flood peak,
more than one million soldiers and civilians were patrolling the
levees to find and seal leaks.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest report from the State Flood Control and
Drought Relief Headquarters, as the flood crest moved downward
Tuesday's water level recorded at 2 p.m. dropped to 44.96 meters
at Shashi, while the water levels rose to 29.23 meters at Hankou,
part of Wuhan city, and 35.55 meters at Chenglingji, up by 0.19
meters and 0.23 meters day-on-day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a flood crest on the Nenjiang River in the country's
northernmost Heilongjiang Province has moved into the mainstream
of the Songhua River to raise the water level to 120.44 meters at
Harbin, the provincial capital, 0.39 meters higher than the
record. The flow rate reached 14,900 cubic meters per second.

BRUSSELS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union is closely
following economic developments in Russia as the news of Moscow's
intention to devalue its currency rocked the European markets.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive arm of the 15-nation
body, is studying the Russian case "very carefully" and is
following the situation "closely," Verros Constantin, a spokesman
for the commission, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman did not elaborate but said the Russian
devaluation would not affect the economy of the EU much for the
time being. He also said he expected the Russians would soon put
their house in order.
</P>
<P>
Russia announced Monday that it would allow its currency, the
ruble, to fall by as much as 34 percent this year. Russia said it
would also extend the repayment of its 43 billion U.S. dollars in
short-term debt to ease a cash crisis.

<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Since the first case of HIV
infection was reported in Chinese capital 13 years ago, the total
has risen to 241, according to local health authorities.
</P>
<P>
Among those infected by HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus,
33 have developed into acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS),
the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Health said today.
</P>
<P>
Prostitution and drug abuse with contaminated syringes are the
leading causes of transmission of the virus among Beijing
residents, and the rapid growth of a young migrant population in
the city may increase the problem, warned Xu Keyi, director of the
Beijing AIDS Clinical Research Center.
</P>
<P>
Xu has called for increased surveillance among high-risk people
such as prostitutes, drug users and illegal blood sellers. He also
suggested easier access for the public to knowledge about HIV/AIDS
prevention.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has three hospitals with about 2,000 beds for AIDS
patients and sufferers of sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
However, drugs commonly used against AIDS in Western countries
are not affordable for most Chinese patients, which means China
must look for cheaper methods with traditional medicines, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
The number of reported HIV/AIDS cases in China had reached
10,676 by the end of June, and all 31 Chinese provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities have been afflicted,
according to the Ministry of Health.

<HEADLINE> Iran Threatens to Punish Afghan Taliban Militia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official warned
Tuesday that the Afghan fundamentalist Taliban militia would face
"heavy punishment" if they continued to hold the Iranians in
captivity.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the State Expediency Council, the powerful
government arbitrary body, Mohsen Rezai said that Tehran would
show the Taliban its determination to secure the release of the
captured Iranian citizens, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Rezai, the former commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps (IRGC), urged Iranian Foreign Ministry to show
"effective reactions" to Taliban's hostile action.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government must prove that any one to abuse Iran's
"tension-easing" policy would face "heavy punishment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran has accused the Taliban of capturing 11 Iranian
diplomats, an IRNA correspondent and 35 drivers after their
seizure of Mazar-e-Sharif, the main stronghold of the Iran-backed
Northern Alliance, led by former President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
The student militia, ousting Rabbani and capturing capital
Kabul in 1996, has seized most of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban has reportedly admitted the holding of 35 Iranians,
but rejected the claim that the missing 11 Iranian diplomats were
in its hands.
</P>
<P>
After the incident in Afghanistan, senior Iranian officials,
including President Mohammad Khatami, have warned that Tehran
would not tolerate the captivity of its nationals.
</P>
<P>
Iran was able to defend its borders and the lives of its
nationals but preferred to solve the problem through diplomatic
channels, Khatami said on Sunday, "we hope that there would be no
need for resorting to other means" to release the captured
Iranians.
</P>
<P>
Vice Speaker of the Majlis (Parliament) Hassan Rouhani also
stated Sunday that Iran reserved the right to take any action to
secure the release of the Iranians.
</P>
<P>
An IRGC commander has recently revealed that the IRGC would
launch a military exercise along the Iran-Afghanistan borders
"because of the problems posed by the Taliban."
</P>
<P>
The IRGC is "fully prepared to engage in any attack or
counter-attack," the commander said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Government to Be Reshuffled After Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government is
expected to undergo a reshuffle early next week following a water
pollution scandal, the semi-official Jordan Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted an official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, as saying that seven to 12 ministers of the 24-member
cabinet will be replaced.
</P>
<P>
The water pollution incident in Amman last month has set off
strong criticism from King Hussein, the parliament and the
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, residents in western Amman complained that
water flowing out of their taps has odor and contains worms.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Water and Irrigation Munther Haddadin resigned on
August 9 under pressure.
</P>
<P>
After the water incident, Hussein, who is in the United States
for cancer treatment, criticized the government for negligence of
duty.
</P>
<P>
Besides the water pollution scandal, Jordan has also seen a
string of other incidents recently, such as the collision of two
jumbo jets and the explosion of the Aqaba power plant.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties, which have long complained about the
government's impotence in dealing with domestic problems, demanded
the resignation of the whole cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The government, headed by Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali,
adopted a reform package after it was appointed in March 1997
aimed at boosting economy through measures such as privatization,
alleviating poverty and unemployment and supervising parliament
elections. But all these plans suffered setbacks.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the reshuffle will be conducted by Crown Prince
Hassan, the Regent, during Hussein's absence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the leading Arabic Al Ra'I said ministers who were
held responsible for the incidents will be sacked.
</P>
<P>
Though Majali has submitted his resignation to Hussein, the
paper said that the prime minister will not likely be fired before
the return of the king.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official: Clinton's Sex Scandal to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
testimony about his sex scandal could further affect the stalled
peace process, said a Palestinian official on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hanan Ashrawi, member of the Palestinian Legislative Council,
told the Israel Radio that due to Clinton's sex scandal, the
United States did not pay enough attention in the past to the
peace process, particularly to the peace talks between the
Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The United States did not put enough pressure on Israel in the
past and the Palestinians are more concerned that the
U.S. President could not spare more time to care about the peace
process after his testimony, Ashrawi said.
</P>
<P>
In a closed hearing on Monday, Clinton answered questions for
four hours in his Washington office about his sexual relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. After the
testimony, he addressed the nation about this relationship,
admitting that he had improper relations with the intern.
</P>
<P>
But the Israeli side gave a different picture about the
testimony, saying the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks had never
been effected by it.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, director for policy planning and communication

it to hand over 13.1 percent of the West Bank territories to the
Palestinians during the second stage redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side refused to continue the direct talks with
Israel, urging it to accept the U.S. initiative.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Making Sustained Efforts to Relieve Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The provisional seasonally
adjusted unemployment rate for the period of May to July 1998 was
4.8 percent, and the provisional underemployment rate was 2.6
percent, according to the latest labor force statistics released
Tuesday by the Census and Statistics Department of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
For the period of April to June 1998, the seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate was revised marginally downwards from the
earlier provisional figure of 4.5 percent to 4.4 percent, while
the underemployment rate remained the same as the earlier
provisional figure of 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the period of May to July with that of April to June
1998, the increase in unemployment rate occurred mainly in the
construction, import/export trade, retail trade, restaurants and
business services sectors.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the statistics, a government economist, K. Y. Tang
said that in face of the continued economic downturn and an
uncertain business outlook, some employers had moved to downsize
their workforce even more. Moreover, the increased entry of fresh
graduates and school dropouts into the labor market more recently
had added further to the labor supply. Both factors taken together
had lifted unemployment further.
</P>
<P>
Acting Secretary for Education and Manpower Matthew Cheung
Kin-Chung said that the Government continued to be very concerned
about the rise in unemployment, and was deeply sympathetic towards
those facing employment difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the government's commitment to do everything it
could to help the unemployed return to the workforce as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is going through a painful economic adjustment and
consolidation process brought on largely by the regional financial
turmoil. Unemployment will remain on the high side for some time,"
the official said.
</P>
<P>
"However, we must not go into despair. Our economy has been
adjusting efficiently. We remain confident that once the regional
financial situation has stabilized, Hong Kong will be back on the
recovery path," Cheung said.
</P>
<P>
"We are making good and sustained progress on a wide ranging
series of measures to help the unemployed re-enter the labor
market and hold down their jobs. The Task Force on Employment led
by Financial Secretary Donald Tsang will continue to explore ways
and means of easing unemployment, and providing more training and
education opportunities for young people before they enter the
labor market. We are tackling the problem on all fronts," Cheung
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Number of Tourists From Asia to Australia Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The number of Asian tourists
visiting Australia continued to fall last month, preliminary
official figures revealed here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tourist numbers from Southeast Asia plunged by more than a
quarter (28.8 percent) from the July 1997 figure to 39,600, while
the number of tourists from northeast Asia fell by 16.7 percent to
115,000, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said.
</P>
<P>
The bureau blamed the current Asian financial crisis for the
falls.
</P>
<P>
South Korea recorded the highest fall (70.1 percent), with
15,500 fewer tourists visiting Australia last month compared with
July 1997.
</P>
<P>
This was followed by falls from Indonesia (58.4 percent),
Thailand (24.0 percent), Malaysia (22.9 percent), Japan (15.4
percent), and the Philippines (13.8 percent).
</P>
<P>
Japanese tourists accounted for 19 percent of all the overseas
tourists to Australia during the first seven months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The overall number of tourists visiting Australia from overseas
fell 7.5 percent in July compared with the same month in 1997 to

MADRID, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Croatian international Robert
Jarni has signed a three-year contract with Real Madrid after
refusing to join English premier league Coventry City.
</P>
<P>
Jarni has enjoyed a successful three seasons at Betis, which
had reached an agreement with the English club, but Jarni
preferred staying in Spain to England.
</P>
<P>
Real Madrid agreed to pay Betis 800 million pesetas (5.3
million U.S. dollars) for Jarni.
</P>
<P>
"This decision was really to do with family matters," Jarni
explained, "and in particular my daughter."
</P>
<P>
"It's easier for her to adapt to life in Madrid than life in
England. I'm happy that everything's settled now. I've signed for
the biggest club in the world."
</P>
<P>
Real Madrid will finalize the signature and ensure that Jarni
is eligible for the club's European Champions' League campaign
until August 20.
</P>
<P>
If there are no problems with the move, the 29-year-old
midfielder will meet fellow Croatian international Davor Suker at

<HEADLINE> Tax Plans Close Australian Rivaling Parties' Poll Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian ruling coalition
parties have caught up with the Australian Labor Party, the
nation's major opposition party, in the latest opinion polls as an
upcoming federal election is drawing near.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the change to the tax reform package
unveiled last week by the coalition government, which offers
income tax cuts totaling 7.8 billion U.S. dollars to middle- and
low-income families and other benefits to farmers.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of latest three opinion polls taken
last weekend, the support for the coalition parties, which consist
of the Australian Liberal Party and the Australian National Party,
increased by almost six points to exactly the same level as the
Australian Labor Party (ALP).
</P>
<P>
The polls found support for the ALP had also risen slightly
since the launch of the tax package on August 13, with voters
deserting Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party.
</P>
<P>
Three major polls include the Morgan poll taken for Australia's
major weekly news magazine Bulletin, the Newspoll and AC Nielsen
conducted for Australia's leading newspapers The Australian and
The Sydney Morning Herald, respectively.
</P>
<P>
An average of the three polls puts support for the coalition at
41.2 percent, up 5.7 points in a month, while the support for the
ALP also rose over the past month to 41.2 percent, exactly the
same level as the coalition and up 1.2 points since mid-July.
</P>
<P>
The clear loser has been Pauline Hanson's One Nation, whose
support fell by more than one-third from 13.3 to 8.7 percent over
the same period, the lowest level since the party's stunning
performance in the Queensland election two months ago.
</P>
<P>
The polls indicate many of those backing One Nation Party at
that time were disillusioned coalition voters who have been won
back by the tax package.
</P>
<P>
The tax package launch has been clearly good news for Prime
Minister John Howard whose approval rating soared last weekend,
putting him four points ahead of ALP leader Kim Beazley as
preferred prime minister.
</P>
<P>
However, as the ALP is scheduled to release its own tax reform
plans next week and pre-election publicity campaigns by the
competing parties still going on, it remains to be seen whether
the coalition government can maintain or even win more support
from voters.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed Prime Minister John Howard may call a
federal election as early as October if his government can
convince the Australian voters that its tax reform package is
better than the ALP's.
</P>
<P>
The current term of the Howard cabinet expires in March, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Special Bonds to Ensure Healthy Banking Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Ministry of
Finance today said the issuance of the 270 billion yuan in special
treasury bonds is designed to ensure healthy operations of
state-owned commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
He noted that revenues from the issue will be used solely for
replenishing the capital funds of related commercial banks which
are currently burdened with insufficient capital due to rapid
expansion of assets over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that state-owned commercial banks are major
players in China's financial system and enjoy high credibility in
terms of public opinion. The bond issuance will provide related
banks with adequate capital.
</P>
<P>
"The move will be relatively significant in improving the
credit and competitiveness of the state-owned banks on the
international monetary market, in addition to effectively reducing
financial risk and promoting economic development and social
stability," according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The special treasury bonds will be distributed to four
commercial banks solely owned by the state -- Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, the Bank
of China and Construction Bank of China. Respective shares of the
bonds will be determined in line with risk assets, net current
capital, bad loans, available capital and various related factors.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that the special treasury bonds can be
traded on the interbank securities market and noted that detailed
measures will be drafted by the Ministry of Finance and the
People's Bank of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the bond issuance as an exceptional measure the
government has adopted to support state-owned commercial banks,
and noted that a mechanism will be established to enable related
banks to replenish capital funds. He stressed that state-owned
commercial banks should constantly raise their capital adequacy by
engaging in self-improvement and self-development.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that, when necessary, state-owned
commercial banks will also be able to increase their capital funds
through the issuance of a specified volume of medium- and
long-term bank debentures.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Welcomes Return of Overseas Tibetans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior official in the Tibet
Autonomous Region said Monday that Tibetans living outside China
are welcome to return home so long as they refrain from activities
designed to split China.
</P>
<P>
"The door remains open to the Dalai Lama clique if they
abandon their stance advocating the independence of Tibet and
attempts to split China," said Pu Qung, vice-chairman of
the standing committee of the Tibet Autonomous Regional People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Pu made the remarks during a meeting with Antije Vollmer, vice
president of the Federal Assembly of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Pu said that both the central and regional governments would
like to see the Dalai Lama return to Tibet and contribute to the
well-being of the Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
However, the Dalai Lama continues to court the support of
hostile western forces and has exhibited an unwillingness to
abandon his stance, according to Pu.
</P>
<P>
He said the vast majority of Tibetans living abroad have not
been involved in activities directed at the independence of
Tibet. "They are welcome to return to Tibet at any time, and the
Tibetan governments at all levels will help them solve problems
arising from resettlement."
</P>
<P>
Vollmer, on his third visit to Tibet since 1987, said Germans
are extremely interested in China and are also deeply concerned
with the development of the regional economy and culture, as well
as Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
Pu told Voller that the Tibetans, just as all Chinese citizens,
enjoy the constitutional right of freedom in religious
belief. However, China's Constitution contains articles protecting
the rights of minors to a compulsory education, and temples and
lamaseries in Tibet cannot accept children as monks and nuns until
they reach the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
The region's over 1,800 temples and lamaseries are home to over
46,000 monks and nuns who basically fulfill the needs of the
region's over 10 million religious followers.
</P>
<P>
The relatively underdeveloped regional economy limits the
number of monks and nuns to a level which reduces burdens on
Tibet's population to an absolute minimum, said Pu, adding that
many people have scripture halls and nitches for statues of
Buddhas in order to carry out religious activities in their homes.
</P>
<P>
"This fully demonstrates the extensive freedom in religious
belief in Tibet," said Pu.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh's Rubber Farming Has Bright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's rubber farming has a
bright prospect since the climate, chemical components of soil and
yearly rate of rainfall in the northern, northwestern,
northeastern and southeastern parts of the country are favorable
for rubber cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Rubber plantation first started in Bangladesh in 1955 on an
experimental basis, and it was proved that both the soil and
climate there are very suitable for rubber plants.
</P>
<P>
And then 16 hectares of land in the southeastern district of
Cox's Bazar was brought under rubber plantation in 1960-61.
</P>
<P>
Later, a comprehensive program was undertaken in 1975 in the
country to attain self-sufficiency in rubber.
</P>
<P>
The present demand for raw rubber in the country is 30,000 tons
of rubber a year, and its demand is expected to reach 41,000 tons
by the year 2000 and 70,000 tons by 2010, according to experts in
this sector.
</P>
<P>
A total area of 4,108 hectares of land has been brought under
rubber plantation from 1987 to 1997 in northwestern districts of
Tangail and Rangpur, with five rubber estates being set up there,
according to the Bangladesh Forest Industries Development
Corporation (BFIDC).
</P>
<P>
At present, about 13,000 hectares of land has been brought
under rubber plantation by the BFIDC in the Chittagong Rubber
Development Zone, southeast of here, and 12,600 hectares of land
under private rubber plantation in the country.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,200 hectares of land has been brought under rubber
plantation in the Sylhet Rubber Development Zone, 208 kilometers
northeast of Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Another 20,000 hectares of land can be brought under rubber
plantation in the country, and 15 billion taka (about 319 million
U.S. dollars) of foreign currency can be earned a year, the BFIDC
said.
</P>
<P>
The BFIDC can now produce only 3,200 tons of rubber worth 240
million taka (about 5.1 million U.S. dollars) per annum. As per
volume of plantation and age of trees, the yearly production would
be increased at 10,000 tons, BFIDC officials stated.
</P>
<P>
The output of rubber in Bangladesh is very low with only 200
kilograms per acre, while the figure of Malaysia on the same
acreage is 1,200 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the cost of production is also extremely high due to
backward technology.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the block rubber processing system should be
introduced for extracting 100 percent rubber from the latex to
make quality rubber at cheaper rate within a short time, experts
suggested, saying the system might help earn maximum profit and
lessen dependence on firewood and it would also help the country
to compete with foreign rubber and save the country from the
environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
The officials engaged in rubber cultivation should be trained
at home and abroad to develop this sector, the experts stressed.
</P>
<P>
The sub-tropical Bangladesh can attain self-sufficiency in
rubber so long as the government takes more incentive measures for
rubber farmers, introduce some modern technologies and train
workers in this sector, they said.

<P>
PARIS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Julien Green, a famous American
writer who wrote in French, died at the age of 97 in Paris last
Thursday, announced his son Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Described by the daily Le Figaro as "a legend of the century,"
Green was born in Paris in 1900 of parents from the south of the
United States and was elected to the French Academy for his
literary achievements in French.
</P>
<P>
Among his most known works are "Mont-Cinere," "Moira,"
"Adrienne Mesurat," "Leviathan," "Pays Loitains," "Etoiles du
 Sud," and "Dixie," all having been translated into a dozen
languages.
</P>
<P>
He also wrote a monumental work of diary "Journal" since 1919,
the longest of this type in world literature.
</P>
<P>
Throughout his works, Green contemplated on the problem of good
 and evil in human life and he admitted having been greatly
influenced by the 19th century Russian writer Fyodor Dostoyvsky.
</P>
<P>
In a homage paid to Green, President Jacques Chirac said his
death was a great loss to French and world literature.

<P>
NANJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
has reiterated its firm determination to fulfil annual economic
goals in spite of the heaviest flooding in more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The province's bold aspirations will not come easily since
eight Yangtze River cities suffering the heaviest flooding account
for 70 percent of the local gross domestic product and over 80
percent of total revenues.
</P>
<P>
Provincial leaders are engaged in an all-out flood control
campaign and are at the same time urging concerted efforts to
ensure realization of the nation's eight percent economic growth
rate.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing, the provincial capital, plans to increase fixed asset
investments to ensure the fulfilment of the targeted 12 percent
growth. Districts and counties have been asked to contribute 13.2
billion yuan (1.6 billion US dollars), with the municipality set
to contribute 15.1 billion yuan (1.8 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Nantong, on the north bank of the Yangtze, continues to stress
readjustments to product structures and technical inputs as the
backbone of the machine-building sector.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, the hardest hit sector, remains the focus of
attention.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Halts Rice Export as Yield Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Prime Minister Phan Van
Khai has decided to suspend rice exports because of low rice yield
caused by bad weather and pests, Vietnam News Agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision, announced on August 14, says that rice can
exported only with the prime minister's permission.
</P>
<P>
The 59,400 hectares of summer-autumn and autumn rice crops,
which are in Vietnam's central provinces of Nghe An, Ha Tinh,
Quang Binh, Quang Tri and Thua Thien-hue, withered under
unrelenting drought by July 25th, of which 24,130 hectares of
paddy fields were completely devoid of grain.
</P>
<P>
About 67,000 hectares of rice fields in Vietnam's northern
midland, mountainous region and the Red River delta, along with
another 37,000 hectares crops in the southern central provinces
stretching from Da Nang to Phu Yen, are now facing water shortage.
</P>
<P>
In the Mekong delta, nearly 44,000 hectares of rice were
parched by droughts.
</P>
<P>
Around 100,000 hectares of the current summer-autumn rice crop
was destroyed by pests in the central province of Thua Thien-hue
and the southern provinces of Kien Giang, Ben Tre, Bac Lieu, Can
Tho and Tay Ninh.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has exported nearly 2.76 million tons of rice during
the first seven months of this year. But from now on the
government's priority will be given to national food security.

<HEADLINE> SADC Defense Ministers's Meet over Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Defense ministers of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) Tuesday began a
meeting in Harare to decide on how to tackle the deepening
conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The meeting followed consultations by defense ministers of
Zambia, Namibia, Angola and Zimbabwe Monday and was to be briefed
by Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge who led a
fact-finding mission to the great lakes region to check on claims
of foreign involvement in DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
The venue of the meeting, Zimbabwe's Army Headquarters, was
completely sealed off with reporters or any other people being
barred from entering.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether embattled DRC President Laurent
Kabila, who is blaming Rwanda for backing Tutsi rebels trying to
oust him in the same fashion he removed former Zaire leader
Mobutu Sese Seko from power, was attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The discussion on the escalating DRC crisis would be based on
the fact-finding mission's report.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge led a verification committee comprising foreign
ministers from Zambia, Namibia and Tanzania to study the
situation in central Africa and try to substantiate Kabila's
allegations that the rebels were being backed by Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are expected to come up with recommendations on
how to deal with the crisis for consideration by heads of state
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Monday and Tuesday's meetings are a follow-up to the one
attended by seven heads of state from African countries two weeks
ago in Zimbabwe's resort center of Victoria Falls on the Great
Lakes crisis.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Current Account Balance Nears Break-Even Point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Germany's long-term current account
deficit has been narrowed to near break-even point thanks to a
sharp rise in the country's trade surplus in the first half of
this year, German Federal Statistics Office announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Germany's current account, the broad measure of trade both in
goods and services, ran a deficit of just 700 million German marks
(391 million U.S. dollars) in the first half of this year, down
sharply from the six billion marks (3.4 billion dollars) measured
in the same period of last year, the Wiesbaden-based office said
in its latest trade report.
</P>
<P>
The shrinking current account deficit came after Germany
achieved a 66.4 billion mark (37 billion dollar) trade surplus in
the first half year, with exports up 11.5 percent to 474 billion
marks (264.8 billion dollars) and imports up 9.1 percent to about
408 billion marks (227.9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
In June alone, Germany chalked up a trade surplus of 11.2
billion marks (6.3 billion dollars). The current account also
showed a monthly surplus of 3.1 billion marks (1.7 billion
dollars), according to the office.

<HEADLINE> Ashrawi Voices Frustration Over Frozen Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Hanan Ashrawi, former Palestinian
minister of Higher Education, has voiced her frustration over the
long-frozen peace process and criticized the U.S. for its
ineffective role in reactivating the peace-making.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of peace with Israel has turned into a false myth,"
she said in an exclusive interview with Egypt's Arabic Al Ahram
daily published Tuesday, accusing Washington of failing to face
Israel or question it.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council,
called on the Palestinians to unite on Jerusalem issue and never
succumb to Israeli threats.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want the Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of
their future state, but Israel claims Jerusalem as its undivided
and eternal capital.
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest issues in
Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks have been deeply stranded due to Israel's move
to build Jewish settlements in the East Jerusalem in March, 1997
and its intransigence in refusing to withdraw its troops from the
West Bank in line with signed peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi, praising Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat for his historic decisions in the peace
process, said Arafat is still the leader and no one demands that
he be replaced.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi was appointed Minister of Tourism and Archaeology in
Arafat's new cabinet, but she resigned shortly after the
nomination to protest against his failure to tackle the widely
reported corruption within the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi said there is quite a cloud shrouding the PNA and that
things should be straightened up with courage and honesty.
</P>
<P>
"The real building of the state must depend on the supremacy of
law and the full dependence on the able persons in order to
achieve a real reform," she said.

<HEADLINE> Southern African States to Boost Peace-Keeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) Monday entered a second phase of building an
national military peace-keeping force with the beginning of a
two-week course in Nyanga of east Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-seven SADC defense representatives attended the course
in readiness for a broader exercise dubbed Blue Crane to be
hosted by South Africa in November, the Daily Herald reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Following the format of last year's Blue Hungwe held in Nyanga
and the first African initiative on international peace-keeping
training, the Blue Crane exercise will enhance the region's
capacity in handling peace-keeping missions.
</P>
<P>
The difference between Blue Hungwe and Blue Crane is that the
latter will be held at brigade level and fully backed by the
naval and air support while the Zimbabwean exercise was at
battalion level.
</P>
<P>
Blue Crane will be held jointly with Zimbabwe which was chosen
because of its experience from the previous exercise and
peace-keeping in countries like Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The two-week course in Nyanga funded by the Nordic countries
will be conducted by 22 instructors from Angola, Mozambique,
Tanzania, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Swaziland, Zambia, South
Africa and Zimbabwe and will prepare respective SADC country
representatives for Blue Crane.
</P>
<P>
All SADC countries except the Democratic Republic of Congo
where rebels are fighting against President Laurent Kabila's
government have confirmed their participation in the exercise.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army to Cut Salary for Anti-HIV Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda People's Defense
Forces (UPDF) command has proposed cutting their salaries to buy
anti-HIV drugs for military people and civilians.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made in response to the high price of the
anti-retrovirus, the New Vision reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, junior officers are to give 15 percent of
their salaries for the fund while the senior army officers are
advised to offer 20 percent of their salaries.
</P>
<P>
If the proposal is accepted, both armymen and civilians will
benefit from the pool.
</P>
<P>
Under the new UPDF salary structure effective this month, an
army general is to get 1.2 million Uganda Shillings (about 1,000
U.S. Dollars) a month and Lt. General one million Shillings (800
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Uganda is one of the few countries in the world which have
been most affected by AIDS. Nearly 10 percent of its 20 million
population are HIV positive and an estimated 500,000 people have
died of the killer disease since the first case was made public
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Many AIDS parents leave their children unattended after they
die. The orphans become street children who try to survive by
begging.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Meets With Arafat in Mediterranean Resort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat arrived in Egypt's northwestern Mediterranean resort of
Mersa Matrouh Tuesday morning for talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak on the long-stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat did not speak to reporters upon arrival at the airport
of Mersa Matrouh, about 400 kilometers northwest of Cairo. He was
driven to an undisclosed place for talks with Mubarak, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa attended the talks,
together with Arafat's retinue, including Palestinian Minister of
Local Government Saeb Erekat, Advisor Nabil Abu Rdeina and
Palestinian Ambassador to Egypt Zohdi al-Qedra.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Qedra said Arafat and Mubarak will discuss ways to
overcome the current deadlock in light of the failed attempts to
persuade Israel into accepting a U.S. peace proposal.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have been frustrated over months of Israeli
resistance to the U.S. initiative calling for a further 13.1
percent Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank in return for
Palestinian security guarantees. Arafat has accepted the
U.S. proposal.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is working with France on a joint initiative on convening
an international conference for rescuing the Mideast peace, in
case that the U.S. efforts collapse.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks were frozen over Israel's
settlement expansions in Arab East Jerusalem and long delays in
troop redeployment. The recent direct contacts between the two
sides fail to make a breakthrough.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kenyan Economy Worse off as Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's economic downturn
continued in July, with inflation soaring to a double-digit
level, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) said.
</P>
<P>
The inflation climbed from 4.6 percent in May to 11.7 percent
last month, the CBK reported in its July edition of the Monthly
Economic Review.
</P>
<P>
The bank report attributes the inflation trend to, among
others, the rising transportation costs.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth also declined as the gross domestic product
grew by only 1.6 percent in the year ending April, 1998, compared
with 2.3 percent in the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"The depressed performance was evident in virtually all
sectors," the CBK said, assessing the economic operation of the
east African country as "weak".
</P>
<P>
The economic downturn constrained production in agriculture,
resulting from adverse weather, with coffee dropping by 48.4
percent in the year to April, compared to 22.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector suffered a drop of 1.4 percent due to
cheaper imports, high interest rates and low investor confidance.
</P>
<P>
Poor infrastructure and reduced working capital in local and
foreign investment were also cited as reasons for reduced
manufacturing performance.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates on the 91-day treasury bill fell further to
24.7 percent in July from 25.5 percent in June, in line with CBK
efforts to stimulate drop in commercial banks 'lending rates.
</P>
<P>
However, the Shilling has strengthened by 15 percent since
July last year, averaging 59.3 Shillings against one U.S. Dollar,
compared with 60.5 Shillings in June.
</P>
<P>
The central bank says the Shilling has gained following
inflows of foreign cash from exports of tea, coffee and
horticultural produce.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged strengthening of the Shilling has led to concern
by exporters and the tourism industry who regard a strong
Shilling as a threat to their markets abroad.
</P>
<P>
The bank said its policy towards the exchange rate is to
maintain it at a level that is competitive, stable and
market-driven and only intervene when exchange fluctuations are
caused by non-economic factors.
</P>
<P>
The interest rates on Government paper declined in July, the
report said, citing a trend among commercial banks in the
country to reduce base lending rates, sparked by the drop on the
91 day treasury bill yields.
</P>
<P>
Reduced base rates have also led to a declining overdraft rate
in banks by at least one percent. On savings, the rate dropped
from 11.2 percent in May to 10.8 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks have reduced their base lending rates from
one to three percent since treasury bill yields began to fall in
May. This is after reduced government borrowing set in.
</P>
<P>
The reduced borrowing lessened pressure on liquidity in the
money market, causing interbank rates to drop to 17.6 percent in
July from 21.7 percent in June. The rate in May stood at 25.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
The reduced Government borrowing has led to a decline in the
net domestic debt, which dropped by 8.7 billion Shillings in June
to 145.4 billion Shillings. This is the third month in a row to
record a drop in the debt.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Half-Year Economic Growth Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's economic growth rate
fell to 2 percent in the first half of 1998 from 3 percent in the
same period of 1997, the Daily Star reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a report issued Monday by the country's
leading bank Audi as saying that the government's austerity
measures were among the main causes of the drop in the gross
domestic product (GDP), since the measures had hit public
investment and consumption.
</P>
<P>
As Lebanese budget deficit rate witnessed a record 59 percent
last year, the government took an austerity financial policy this
year with the deficit target of 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government has successfully contained the deficit at around
35 percent in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Marwan Barakat, Audi's head of economic research, said the
decline in economic growth was the price of improving public
finances, a pre-requisite for the long-term stability of
Lebanon's financial market.
</P>
<P>
He said the contribution to GDP made by government spending
fell to 23 percent in the first half of this year from 27.5
percent in the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Consumer spending didn't compensate because of the general
sluggishness in advance of the presidential elections which falls
in October this year," Barakat said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the public deficit to GDP ratio had
been almost cut in half, dropping from 18.3 percent in the first
half of last year to 10.7 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
"Taking away debt servicing, we can say the government
succeeded in increasing revenues over expenditures for the first
time since the 1975-1990 civil war," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has a public debt estimated at more than 15.5 billion
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir: Speculative Attacks May Prompt Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Tuesday warned that speculative attacks on
currencies which began over a year ago and have reached a
dangerous level may prompt countries to fight back.
</P>
<P>
If the attacks on currencies and stocks continue on developing
countries, there would be a point in time where "such attacks
would hit countries that could fight back", Mahathir said at a
Workers Day celebration here.
</P>
<P>
He said that several countries and regions whose currencies
were attacked had taken drastic measures to protect their
economies.
</P>
<P>
In countries receiving IMF (International Monetary Fund) aid
such as South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand, their economies had
to be restructured as one of the conditions for the financial aid,
Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that the speculators, apart from wanting to
dictate the economy, also want to decide on who should lead
countries.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said more foreign pressure could be expected to force
Malaysia to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund
to fully expose its economy to foreign banks and companies.
</P>
<P>
As an example of mounting pressure on the country, he said when
Malaysia planned to raise funds overseas, its sovereign ratings
were downgraded so that it would have to pay high interest on its
external loans.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, they are not supporting but are obstructing efforts
to revive the economy," Mahathir said.

<HEADLINE> Ruble Devaluation Not to Have Big Impact on Swedish Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The devaluation of the Russian
ruble is not expected to make a big influence on Swedish banks,
newspapers cited a chief banker as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Our exposure in Russia is small. It is a matter of only 100
million Swedish krowns (about 12.5 million U.S. dollars)," said
Arne Martensson, president of Svenska Handelsbanken, Sweden's
largest bank.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation of the ruble may prove a bitter pill for
Finnish firms which export to Russia, said the banker. Last year,
Finland exported goods worth over 23 billion Swedish krowns (2.875
billion U.S. dollars) to Russia.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
 in leading French newspapers on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The Russian money was finally devalued Monday morning,
creating a wind of panic in Moscow first, and in world financial
markets later. But the spirit was calmed soon, and some
specialists, including American speculator George Soros,
described this decision by the government of Boris Yeltsin as
"necessary, courageous and timely."
</P>
<P>
-- In an interview with Liberation, American feminist Camille
Paglia strongly criticized President Bill Clinton for his
relations with Monica Lewinsky as "infantilism," and also because
he did it within the White House itself. She also pointed out that
the Americans are more and more adopting the European approach in
respect of the private life of their leaders.
</P>
<P>
-- The famous American writer who wrote in French, Julien
Green, died at the age of 97 in Paris on August 13, announced his
son on Monday. He left behind a set of monumental diary works,
"Journal," which he began in 1919.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- In order to save his office at the White House, President
Bill Clinton worked hard on Monday for more than five hours to
convince the grand jury that he did not commit perjury. His
defense also rested on the subtle distinction between sexual game
and sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
-- After Asia, it is Russia which has the financial
crisis. Threatened with a collapse of its banking system, the
government of Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko let the ruble float
and suspended for three months the repayment of foreign debts.

<HEADLINE> Officials: Russian Crisis Not to Harm Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The current Russian financial
crisis will not make a substantial negative impact on Turkey's
economy, according to senior Turkish officials.
</P>
<P>
The Daily News newspaper Tuesday quoted Gunes Taner, state
minister for economic affairs, as saying that the Turkish
government will take effective measures to restrict the spread of
the crisis' damage.
</P>
<P>
Taner said that the devaluation of the shaky currency ruble
did not come as a surprise given the fluctuations in the global
economy but it would not greatly affect Turkey's economy.
</P>
<P>
Admitting the purchasing power of the Russian consumers would
fall as a result of the financial turmoil, Taner said that the
Russian economy would recover in 1999 and this would have a
positive effect on Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Minister Isin Celebi noted that all the
necessary measures had been taken to protect Turkey from the
financial crisis in Russia, adding that the government would make
efforts to ensure macroeconomic balances.
</P>
<P>
Calling on Turkish business circles to be calm, the official
said that Turkey would only be affected by the Russian crisis to a
small degree.
</P>
<P>
"We have signed free trade agreements with 12 countries. We
are diversifying our markets and our export producers," Celebi
explained.
</P>
<P>
The financial market of Turkey was rattled by Monday
announcement on Monday that it would sharply devalue the ruble and
halt payment on government treasury bonds and impose a 90-day
moratorium on payments of foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
The National-100 index plunged 5.47 percent Monday, or 181.31
points, to close at 3,170.61 point, with the trading volume
reaching 258 million U.S. dollars.

LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British and Irish ministers Monday hatched a three-pronged
strategy of crushing the self-styled Real IRA (Irish Republican
Army) in the wake of the Omagh bomb.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British police in Northern Ireland on Monday night
questioned five people in connection with Saturday's Omagh bombing
as the British and Irish governments outlined new measures to root
out terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- After seven months of denials, U.S. President Bill Clinton
was reported on Monday night to have admitted "an improper
physical relationship" with the former White House trainee, Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Russian President Boris Yeltsin was on Monday night facing
the destruction of the two lone achievements of his seven-year
rule -- a strong currency and low inflation -- amid Russia's most
serious financial crisis of the post-Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- The British government Monday approved the culling of about
10,000 badgers over the next two years as part of a study into
links between the animal, tuberculosis and cattle.

<HEADLINE> Ashrawi Voices Frustration Over Frozen Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Hanan Ashrawi, former Palestinian
minister of Higher Education, has voiced her frustration over the
long-frozen peace process and criticized the U.S. for its
ineffective role in reactivating the peace-making.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of peace with Israel has turned into a false myth,"
she said in an exclusive interview with Egypt's Arabic Al Ahram
daily, accusing Washington of failing to face Israel or question
it.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi, also a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council,
called on the Palestinians to unite on Jerusalem issue and never
succumb to Israeli threats.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want the Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of
their future state, but Israel claims Jerusalem as its undivided
and eternal capital.
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest issues in
Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks have been deeply stranded due to Israel's move
to build Jewish settlements in the East Jerusalem in March, 1997
and its intransigence in refusing to withdraw its troops from the
West Bank in line with signed peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi, praising Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat for his historic decisions in the peace
process, said Arafat is still the leader and no one demands that
he be replaced.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi was appointed Minister of Tourism and Archaeology in
Arafat's new cabinet, but she resigned shortly after the
nomination to protest against his failure to tackle the widely
reported corruption within the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi said there is quite a cloud shrouding the PNA and that
things should be straightened up with courage and honesty.
</P>
<P>
"The real building of the state must depend on the supremacy of
law and the full dependence on the able persons in order to
achieve a real reform," she said.

<HEADLINE> Reactions Mixed on Clinton Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Early reactions to U.S.
President Bill Clinton's Monday night public admission of
inappropriate relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky are different between political parties.
</P>
<P>
Democrats joined Clinton in saying it was time for the nation
to move on from the Monica Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore said in a statement from Hawaii, "I
believe it is time to put this matter behind us -- once and for
all -- and move forward with the business of the United States of
America."
</P>
<P>
He said, "I am proud of him -- not only because he is a friend
-- but because he is a person who has had the courage to
acknowledge mistakes."
</P>
<P>
Similar statements of cautious support came from Senator Tom
Harkin of Iowa and Representative John Lewis of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
"We are all human. We all make mistakes -- even a president.
Most Americans share my belief that it's in our best interests to
put this behind us and move on," Harkin said.
</P>
<P>
Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, told
MSNBC, "He did have a sexual relationship he should not have had.
It was wrong, it was poor judgment. He lied about it. He shouldn't
have done that. He's apologized for it. That would seem to me not
to rise to the level of impeachment."
</P>
<P>
"The American people are sophisticated enough to say, 'I
disapprove of his personal behavior, I don't like what he did, but
I approve of the policies," he added.
</P>
<P>
But Republicans reacted differently with anger over Clinton's
attack on special prosecutor Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the president explained his behavior. He used a
new set of phrases. We have another set of words," Republican
Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri said on television only minutes
after Clinton had ended his speech.
</P>
<P>
"It was rhetorically very powerful but not a speech we can
accept at face value," Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania
said. "There's a lot of wiggle room on the issue of perjury which
needs a lot of technical analysis," he added.
</P>
<P>
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah told
ABC that it was an appropriate confession and an appropriate way
for Clinton to speak to the American people.
</P>
<P>
But speaking on CNN, he added, "I was really offended when he
started to attack Ken Starr at the end. If I hear another Democrat
complaining about the 40 million U.S. dollars (spent on the
investigation), I am going to blow my cork.... It is really
offensive."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he had misled people about his relationship with
Lewinsky partly out of concern that Starr's investigation was
politically motivated -- an allegation vigorously denied by
Clinton's critics.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans said they reserved judgment on whether Clinton
had now told the whole truth and would wait to see what Starr said
in his report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
"I'm interested in the evidence, not in what the president
wants us to believe," said Representative Bob Barr of Georgia, a
Republican who led an attempt to impeach Clinton after the
Lewinsky case surfaced in January.
</P>
<P>
Clinton went through more than four hours of questioning under
oath in the White House Monday afternoon about his relationship
with Lewinsky, transmitted by closed circuit television to a
federal grand jury.

TOKYO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rebounded in Tokyo
Tuesday after the previous day's plunge of more than 300 points,
with the key Nikkei index recovering to the 15,000 level.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rallied 269.13 points, or 1.82
percent, from Monday's close to finish at 15,063.79.
</P>

The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, rebounded 14.69 points, or 1.28 percent to

</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section fell to an estimated 320 million
shares from Monday's 398 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB) was the most heavily
traded issue on that day.
</P>

Bolstered by the strong performance on Wall Street where the

Investors found a chance to cover short positions as fears of

<HEADLINE> Former Iranian Ministers Found Guilty of Taking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian Minister of Mines
and Metals Hussein Mahluj and his deputy Ali Shekarriz have been
found guilty of taking commissions, the latest issue of Arzeshha
(Values) weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
And the State Audit Office (SAO) has ordered the two former
ministers to return the money to state treasury, the weekly said.
</P>
<P>
The case of Mahluj and Shekarriz surfaced when SAO launched
investigation into alleged embezzlements in the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Mahluj and Shekarriz were found to have accepted 540,000 German
marks (about 956,000 U.S. dollars) in commission in a purchase
deal of aluminum machinery from Germany for their ministry.
</P>
<P>
Mahluj and Shekarriz have confessed to the offense.
</P>
<P>
Mahluj said that he received the commission on a recommendation
by Hassan Ghafurifard, the then vice president and chairman of the
Physical Education Organization (PEO).
</P>
<P>
Part of the money were spent on the football team of the
Pirouzi (Victory) Club, including paying for the treatment of
Ahmad Reza Abedzadeh, the goalkeeper of the Iranian national
football team, Mahluj said.
</P>
<P>
Some was given to Faeze Hashemi, vice president of the PEO, and
daughter of former President Hashemi Rafsanjani to launch women's
cycling, he added.
</P>
<P>
The weekly said that Mahluj was trying to convince the SAO to
abort the ruling on him as he is reportedly to be appointed
ambassador to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to relevant law in Iran, government officials are
prohibited from taking commissions on state dealings.
</P>
<P>
However, the SAO only has the right to ask for the handover of
the money and the judiciary will decide if to punish the
violators.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Some 60 scholars from China, the
United States and Australia are attending a three-day Beijing
conference on "Globalization and the Future of the Humanity".
</P>
<P>
Cultural globalization is the direct result of economic
globalization. Allowing globalization to replace localization will
lead to the disappearance of Chinese culture, according to Wu
Yuanmai, director of the Institute of Foreign Literature at the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS)
</P>
<P>
However, Professor Wang Ning, director of the Institute of
Comparative Literature at the Beijing Culture and Language
University, believed that globalization will increase the impact
of Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
The scholars agreed that the new pattern in 21st century
culture will center on interaction and dialog between different
cultures.
</P>
<P>
The conference, the first of its kind, is sponsored by the
CASS, Beijing Language and Culture University, Duke University in
the United States and Murdoch University in Australia.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Domestic Animal Opens in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Fourth Global Conference
on Conservation of Domestic Animal Genetic Resources opened here
Tuesday, drawing 172 scientists from 32 countries in all the six
continents.
</P>
<P>
Nepali King Birendra inaugurated the conference by lighting the
traditional lamp "Panas."
</P>
<P>
In his speech on the occasion, Nepali Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala said that plant and animal lives have a great
diversity known as gene pool which is a common heritage of
mankind.
</P>
<P>
"The global community should recognize the importance of the
genetic diversity of domestic animals, there is a need for a
greater global awareness against the systematic depletion of the
diversity all over the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Nepal enjoys a wide diversity of plants and animal
species in hot and sub-tropical climates of the lowlands as well
as in the cold and temperate climates of mountains.
</P>
<P>
"However, this diversity is shrinking due to the introduction
of exotic blood and lack of the promotion of indigenous animal
germplasm," he noted.
</P>
<P>
One of the main objectives of the conference is to highlight
the conservation and use of domestic animal genetic diversity to
secure future food and fiber supply, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
At the four-day conference organized jointly by the Nepal
Agricultural Research Council and the Rare Breed International,
the scientists are scheduled to hold discussions on 73 working
papers and work out future strategies.
</P>
<P>
The last conference was held in Canada in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Approves Three-Year Poverty Alleviation Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
approved a three-year national program aimed at reducing the
number of poor households nationwide to 10 percent by 2000, the
Vietnam News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Official estimation showed about 20 percent of households in
the country are below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese people living in urban areas are considered poor if
per capita consumption is below 25 kilograms of husked rice a
month, below 20 kilograms for those living in rural areas in the
plains, and below 15 kilograms for those in rural mountainous
areas.
</P>
<P>
The national program for poverty alleviation and hunger
elimination for the 1998-2000 period will implement projects
helping ethnic minorities to lead a sedentary life and increase
production to improve their living standards.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the program, part of Vietnam's strategy for
socio-economic development, will focus on remote, mountainous and
border areas as well as islands.
</P>
<P>
About 10 trillion Vietnamese dong (700 million U.S. dollars)
will be needed to invest in implementing the various projects
under the program, the Vietnam news said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the sum will be sourced from the state budget and
international assistance.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Stresses Need to Balance Inflow of Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has stressed the need to balance the inflow of investments
in industries in highly-urbanized areas with the capital flowing
into the countryside.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines News Agency reported Tuesday that the Estrada
administration recognizes the need to implement policies that will
provide incentives to big-time investors to shed their capital for
agriculture development and other businesses in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a rally Monday night, Estrada said that the absence
of necessary infrastructure such as roads, bridges and
communications and transportation facilities have discouraged
investors from investing their money in rural-based industries.
</P>
<P>
To address this, the government will undertake programs for
communal irrigation systems, marine reserves, seed banks, potable
water supply and microhydro power plants in about 100 rural areas
all over the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although the government's financial capacity to undertake such
programs is limited, the President said, the state of the national
coffers is no excuse for his administration to do nothing.
</P>
<P>
Estrada believes the country can weather the economic crisis
and address the concerns of the countryside if all sectors will
unite.

<HEADLINE> Giant Pandas Born in Sichuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Two giant pandas -- No.1 and
Yingying -- recently gave birth to cubs in southwest China's
Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
No.1, an 11-year-old panda, has birthed cubs in four
consecutive years, with her most recent offspring, born on August
13, currently weighing 120 grams.
</P>
<P>
Climate changes during 1998 have resulted in an earlier estrous
cycle for giant pandas, and it is quite rare for summer rather
than autumn births, according to Zhang Hemin, an expert with the
China Giant Panda and Research Center at the Wolong Nature Reserve
in Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Three female giant pandas at the center have mated naturally
during 1998, with two of three artificially inseminated pandas
birthing cubs, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Pandas have a low reproductive capacity and only 10 percent of
male giant pandas raised in captivity have produced offsprings
since China artificially bred its first giant panda cub in 1963,
according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The center, established by the Chinese government and the World
Life Foundation in 1980, has successfully bred 21 panda cubs since
1991, with 15 cubs surviving.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda, widely regarded as a "living fossil", is one
of the most well-known endangered rare species. The estimated
1,000 giant pandas are mainly found in mountainous areas around
southwest China's Sichuan Basin.

He added that while it is almost impossible to prevent floods,
what the government and the citizens can do is to mitigate its
devastating effects.
</P>
<P>
Cleaning the sewers now is one way of mitigating the effects of
floods, he said, lamenting that Filipinos, particularly those in
Metro Manila, dispose their garbage into sewers and rivers.

Mercado appealed to the people to stop doing so to prevent
flooding when the rain comes.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Expertise Contributes to China's Economic Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The broad introduction of
foreign expertise has contributed so much to China's economic
development that economists here are comparing it to Japan in the
1950s which experienced economic take-offs by receiving a massive
infusion of outside technology and talent.
</P>
<P>
During the past two decades, China has spent over 100 billion
U.S. dollars introducing advanced technology and elite foreign
experts for a wide range of domestic projects. The funds for this
purpose totaled 5 billion U.S. dollars in the first half of this
year alone.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that, since 1979, China has introduced
21,575 items of technology and 600,000 overseas experts -- mainly
from Japan, Germany, the United States and Britain. And this year
the country expects to invite another 100,000 foreign experts.
</P>
<P>
Mainly involved in management, development and supervision,
foreign professionals have played their roles nationwide in
nuclear power generation, automobile manufacturing, the Three
Gorges water conservancy project, and even agricultural and
infrastructural projects.
</P>
<P>
Foreign expertise has been widely introduced in China's nuclear
power industry, which will help ease the power shortage in the
country's better-off coastal provinces in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Russian nuclear technicians have shown their state-of-the-art
nuclear power knowledge in the Lianyungang Nuclear Power Plant in
east China's Jiangsu Province, while Canadian engineers are doing
their part at the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in south China's
Guangdong Province.

<P>
With the help of a Japanese diesel engineer, it only took China

</P>
<P>
Su Ning, an economist, said: "China's achievement in
introducing foreign expertise in the past 20 years owes a great
deal to its innovation while learning from advanced science and
technology. The move has saved time and cost in its economic
development and greatly boosted the country's economic
development."
</P>
<P>
"More and more foreigners are becoming attracted to China's
fast development," said Walter M. Kranz, deputy-manager of
Yaxing-Benz Co. Ltd., who has witnessed the dramatic increase in
the number of long-term foreign employees living in his hotel in
Jiangsu in a year.

BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- China's total number of mobile
phone subscribers has doubled over the past 13 months, with over
20 million Chinese users accounting for close to 14 percent of GSM

<HEADLINE> Eastern Chinese Province's Aquatic Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The aquatic industry in the
Chinese coastal province of Fujian has become a major source of
economic growth, providing some 4.3 million tons of marine
products worth 41.2 billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
This accounted for about a quarter of the province's
agricultural sector as a whole. Per capita net income of
fishermen was 3,815 yuan, or 1,029 yuan more than for farmers.
</P>
<P>
The province has 3,300 km of coastline and 1,200 islands. It
began an ambitious program for off-shore Fujian a few years ago,
according to a provincial official, with priority being given to
processing aquatic products. Some 1,100 processing plants have
been set up, with a 510,000-ton capacity, and a number of fish
farms breeding large yellow croakers, abalone, and oysters in
coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
The province has sent 1,100 fishing vessels, nearly 200 of them
ocean-going trawlers, outside Chinese waters or to other parts of
the world, a move that has produced 255,000 tons of aquatic
products in the first half of this year.

<P>
TOKYO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi said Tuesday Russia's announcement to devaluate ruble is
"regrettable."
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned that it could have a major effect on the global
economy," Obuchi told a parliamentary committee session.
</P>
<P>
Russia devalued ruble against the U.S. dollar Monday and
announced a 90-day moratorium on repayments for ruble-dominated
external debt in an effort to stabilize its financial system.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said at a press
conference that he expects the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
to continue to help Russia get over its financial crisis and Tokyo
will in return stick to its support for IMF's efforts.
</P>
<P>
Japan's International Trade and Industry Minister Kaoru Yosano,
however, said that the devaluation of the Russian currency will
have little impact on Japan because its trade with Russia is
limited.

<HEADLINE> IMF Agrees to Cuts in Philippine Economic Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has in principle agreed to reductions in the Philippines'
fiscal and macro-economic targets of this year, Business World
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu
as saying that the IMF has conceded to a 40-billion-peso (930
million U.S. dollar) budget deficit this year, a turnaround from
the earlier commitment of a 5-billion-peso (116 million dollars)
surplus.
</P>
<P>
"IMF officials have agreed to a 40-billion-peso deficit,
representing 1.4 percent of GNP (gross national product). They
also agreed that for countries like us who are still developing,
the ideal deficit is 2 percent of GNP including the consolidated
public sector deficit," Espiritu said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is now preparing for a coming review of the
economy by the IMF beginning next week. Maintaining the country's
growth pace with those measures prescribed by the IMF until 1999
will be crucial in availing of the 1.37-billion-dollar fund
facility granted by the IMF last March.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the finance chief said that the IMF has agreed to
adjustments in the macro-economic goals, acceding to a GNP growth
rate of 2-3 percent from the original 3-4 percent; a gross
domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 1.5-2.5 percent from 2.5-3
percent; and an inflation rate of 9.25-9.75 percent from the
previous 7.5-8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's agreement to these revisions was largely due to the
general economic slowdown which can, in turn, be blamed on
external pressure such as the Japanese economic recession and the
impact of the El Nino weather phenomenon, Espiritu said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the ongoing financial crisis and the El Nino,
the Philippine GNP grew 2.5 percent in the first quarter this year
while its GDP increased by 1.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Defense Ministers to Meet over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Ministers of Defense from the
Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) will meet here
Tuesday to decide on how the region can intervene in the
escalating conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Tutsi rebels, who started the war against Kabila government,
are said to be advancing towards the capital, Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe last night said he was
waiting for a full briefing by Minister of Foreign Affairs Stan
Mudenge, who was expected home last night from a fact-finding
mission to the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Depending on the news, the region would then act on the
problems bedevilling that country, he told the Daily Herald.
</P>
<P>
The tone of discussion at the ministers' meeting will depend
on the findings of the verification committee of foreign
ministers of Zambia, Namibia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe who have been
studying the situation in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
On the home front, consultations among SADC defense ministers
started in Harare Monday although the "real" meeting is set for
Tuesday when all the invited ministers are expected to have
arrived.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Defense Minister Moven Mahachi last night
down-played the importance of Monday's consultations, preferring
to call them routine inter-state and security meetings with his
regional counterparts.
</P>
<P>
However, sources said the ministers were hastily called to
convene a meeting following conflicting reports of who was on top
of the situation in the DRC.

BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- China's Liaoning Province will
hold special language classes for the children of Chinese scholars
who come back from study overseas.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese studying or working abroad are worried that their
children who have been educated in English for several years
abroad will have trouble with the language-switch when they return
to China. But, classes that use both Chinese and English may help
solve the problem, some provincial government specialists decided
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
After doing some surveys across the province, the provincial
education committee has decided to set up dual-language classes in
the cities of Shenyang, Dalian and Anshan where there are large
numbers of children who have come back from overseas. Foreign
teachers are being invited.
</P>
<P>
All the province's cities are being required to provide this
education for children of overseas Chinese scholars, according to
a committee official.
</P>

There are already Chinese-English classes for junior and senior
students at the Experiment School of Liaoning.

<P>
MANILA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada condemned Tuesday the killing of 19-year-old student
Alexander Miguel Josef Icasiano, a victim of fraternity hazing at
the University of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Estrada extended his condolences to the family of the young
student and ordered the authorities to track down all those
responsible for the tragic accident.
</P>
<P>
"The death of young Alexander snuffed out whatever dreams that
he and his family had for him because some of his peers have a
wrapped, barbaric idea of what brotherhood should be. Violence has
no place in a civilized society like ours. These people should be
punished and charged in court," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it was ironic that Icasiano had to die at the
hands of persons he considers as his future fraternity brothers,
when barely two weeks ago, fraternities based in the university
agreed to ban violence on campus.
</P>
<P>
"Fraternities should foster the true spirit of kinship among
its members and inspire them to aim high and bring honor, not
shame, to their organization," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
The president ordered police authorities to remain vigilant to
put an end to crimes such as hazing and other forms of violence.
</P>
<P>
Icasiano is the fourth victim of fraternity hazing in Metro
Manila during the past few years. He was declared dead Monday at a
fraternity initiation rite.

WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Houston Comets rebounded
from a rare loss by scoring the most points in WNBA history and
snatching the league's biggest margin of victory, 110-65 over the
Washington Mystics on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Houston suffered its third loss in 28 games Saturday against
the New York Liberty, but came back strongly to chalk up the

</P>
<P>
The Rockers (20-10), who have won four straight and six

bombing of the U.S. embassy here has made some progress, Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kennith Piernick, head of the FBI team here, who was
accompanying U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in the
morning, said they are still making efforts to assemble pieces of
the wreckage, but the "picture is getting clearer."
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived in Dar es Salaam Tuesday morning to inspect
the site of the bomb attack on the U.S. embassy in Tanzania on
August 7.
</P>
<P>
This is her first visit to Tanzania since she came to office
as the Secretary of State in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S. and Tanzanian national flags, she laid a wreath
at the crater produced by the powerful blast that killed 10
people and wounded more than 70 others.
</P>
<P>
However, Piernick said the co-driver of the water tanker,
which is crucial to the investigation, has not be found, and his
families say they do not know his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
The suspect extradited from Pakistan to Kenya, Mohammed Saddiq
Odeh, is still being questioned, he said.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Charge de Affaires John Lange, Albright, who
wore a white construction site helmet, carefully inspected the
main building and compound of the embassy.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Turns Down Allegation of Supplying Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Investigations show that
South Africans were not supplying arms to the rebels fighting
President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC), the South African Intelligence Ministry has said.
</P>
<P>
"At this point there are no indications whatsoever of either
South African individuals or former South African officers being
involved personally or in supplying weapons," a spokesman for
Deputy Intelligence Minister Joe Nhlanhla said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry was aware of allegations that South Africans were
smuggling arms to rebel forces in the DRC, but investigations had
shown the claims were false, The Citizen newspaper Tuesday quoted
the spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have looked into these allegations. We regard them in a
very serious light, but on the ground there is really nothing."
</P>
<P>
The investigations also found no truth to rumors that South
Africans were supplying arms to former Angolan rebel forces, the
UNITA (national union for the total independence of Angola), said
the report.

<HEADLINE> Tyson's Hearing Slated on Sept 9 in Nevada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson, who withdrew his
application for a new license in New Jersey, will have a hearing
before the Nevada Athletics Commission on September 9.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Elias Ghanem, chairman of the commission said last
Thursday a decision would come quickly. "We vote on it on the
spot and we don't delay our decision," Ghanem said.
</P>
<P>
Ghanem said Tyson would have to prove to the five-member
Nevada commission that he is fit to return to the spot.
</P>
<P>
Tyson was banned by the commission in July 1997 after biting
Evander Holyfield's ears during their heavyweight title fight.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, 32, was eligible to reapply for a license in Nevada
July 9, but instead, he went New Jersey to seek the chance. Last
Thursday, the former world boxing king surprisingly withdrew his
application hours before the decision was going to make. Then he
turned back to Nevada to seek license.
</P>
<P>
Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada commission
expects Tyson to attend the hearing because commissioners will wan
 t to question him.
</P>
<P>
Ratner said the hearing "will be fair and impartial."
</P>
<P>
According to a press report, citing unidentified sources, two
of New Jersey's three board members might have opposed Tyson and
the third member was not expected to vote.
</P>
<P>
Last month, New Jersey regulators attended a hearing, but
Tyson got angry and cursed in front of them.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's license was revoked and he was fined 3 million
U.S.dollars for biting Holyfield's ears.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Economy Slows Down in First Half of 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) of Israel grew by a rate of just 1.7 percent during the
first six months of 1998, local daily The Jerusalem Post reported
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics as
saying that this growth rate was slightly lower than in the
previous six months, when the GDP grew by 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The per capita GDP of Israel also fell by 0.5 percent in the
first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
This is the second six-month period in a row that per capita
GDP has fallen. In the last half of 1997, it was also down by 0.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The low growth figures are indicative of the deepening
economic slowdown. In comparison, growth was 2.8 percent in the
first half of 1997 and 3.9 percent in the first half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Finance Ministry has forecast a growth rate as low as
1.5 percent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
But the ministry promised it will take measures to spur the
growth of the economy, saying that the GDP will grow by 2.5
percent next year.

<HEADLINE> Breastfeeding Rate Declining in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The breastfeeding rate in New
Zealand has been declining remarkably in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics recently released by the New Zealand
Ministry of Health, 83 percent of two-week-old babies were
breastfed in 1993, but the rate dropped to 72 percent by last
year.
</P>
<P>
Figures for the same years, but for six-week-old babies, fell
from 75 percent to 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health statistics for 1997 showed an even more
rapid decline for three-month-old babies to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
"This fell well short of the Public Health Commission's aims to
have 75 percent of three-month-old children fully breastfed by the
year 2000," an Auckland-based newspaper quoted Massey University
medical anthropologist Annette Beasley as saying.
</P>
<P>
She told the New Zealand Herald that the New Zealand culture
failed to encourage breastfeeding.
</P>
<P>
According to her own research, she has found that many New
Zealand mothers wouldn't breastfeed their babies in front of their
friends.
</P>
<P>
Annette Beasley, who has edited a new book about the social
factors affecting breastfeeding, said women themselves bought into
the idea that their breasts are sex symbols and increased pressure
on women, including their breasts being seen as sex symbols, has
led to a decline in breastfeeding.
</P>
<P>
More women returning to the workforce after giving birth and
the misconception that formulas are as good for the babies as
breast milk are other reasons, she noted.

KIEV, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's foreign trade in the
first half of this year decreased 2.3 billion dollars, or 13
percent, to 15.79 billion U.S. dollars, on figures of the same

China's first large construction project to open to international
bidding.
</P>
<P>
The 28.5-billion-yuan (3.4 billion US dollars) power facility,
which began partial operation last week, is an example of
international involvement in large construction projects. It used
930 million US dollars in World Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank loans meant the introduction of
internationally-recognized project supervision, resettlement of
people, and organizational and financial reforms, and a series of
documents, procedures, rules and regulations were formulated to
comply with international norms. In 1995, the power developer
became a limited corporation.
</P>
<P>
The project has used technicians and construction workers from
40 countries, and is called an "international project."

<HEADLINE> Fujian To Expand Economic Cooperation With Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, August 18 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province will
further its multilevel cooperation with Macao which is due to
return to Chinese sovereignty on December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation with Macao, especially in trade, science and technology,
finance and tourism, is a major part of the province's economic
development strategy for the future.
</P>
<P>
Governor He Guoqiang made these remarks while speaking at a
seminar held recently on Fujian-Macao economic cooperation. Fujian
will make full use of the opportunity of Macao's forthcoming
return to bring cooperation to a broader, deeper and higher level.
</P>
<P>
Fujian will manufacture more marketable commodities for
consumers in Macao and take substantial measures to improve its
investment environment to draw more investment from Macao,
the governor said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the province plans to establish a special
experimental zone in Xiamen City for financial cooperation with
Macao, in order to raise more funds from Macao. He added that
efforts will also be made for Fujian and Macao banks to open
outlets in each other's respective localities.
</P>
<P>
The governor said he appreciated the importance to Macao's role
as a bridge for cooperation between Fujian and Hong Kong, Taiwan,
and Portuguese-speaking countries.
</P>
<P>
Macao, with one-fourth of its 400,000-plus population tracing
its roots back to Fujian, has long been the province's close
trading partner.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, investors from Macao had set up 418
enterprises in Fujian, with a total contracted investment of 770
million U.S. dollars. During the 1991-95 period, imports and
exports between the two sides reached 130 million U.S. dollars,
with an annual average growth of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, an indirect air route opened between Fujian and Taiwan
via Macao.

<P>
SHANGHAI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A 7-year-old Chinese girl who
was raised entirely on nutrient solution is beginning school this
year.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Qisi, the mother of the girl, Cai Wei, is a technician in
Shanghai who had all of her small intestine removed
because of acute bowel problems in 1986 and had to be fed
intravenous injections of man-made nutrients.
</P>
<P>
She became pregnant 5 years later and had the daughter in 1992,
but because of the mother's problem, Cai was fed slowly and it
usually takes her an hour to complete a meal, her father Cai
Hanyao says.
</P>
<P>
Cai Wei is quite small and weighs only 15.5 kilograms, while
other children of the same age are about 20 to 25 kilograms, and
she is only about one meter tall. Her parents have tried oral
nutrient solutions, medicines, and physical exercises, to help
her. And Cai has got assistance from elsewhere and from teachers
and friends at kindergarten, and gets 2,000 US dollars a year from
companies that provide nutrient solution.
</P>
<P>
She plays the piano well and can speak fluent Chinese and a
little English and like other children, she loves cartoons on TV
and playing with friends.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Media Criticizes Japanese Ministers' Shrine Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korean newspapers Tuesday
published articles criticizing the weekend visit by Japanese
ministers to Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine to honour war dead, including
World War II criminals.
</P>
<P>
An article in the Oriental Daily News described the visit as
unfortunate, adding that an intention to revive nationalism had
appeared in Japanese society.
</P>
<P>
If Japan wished to restore the trust of the international
community and become a friend of its neighbors, it had to
sincerely self-examine and confess its conduct during the World
War II.
</P>
<P>
South Korea hoped to be a friendly neighbor of Japan, but Japan
needed to show its sincerity in solving historical problems.
</P>
<P>
The visit to the shrine by some Japanese cabinet ministers
would seriously erode the mutual trust between the two countries,
said the article.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean National newspaper and Cultural Daily also
published articles critical of ultra-right forces in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Eight Japanese ministers visited the Yasukuni Shrine, which is
a bastion of the wartime military government-sponsored Shintoism
and a symbol of militarism in Japan before and during World War II.

<HEADLINE> More Romanian Children Infected with AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The first six months of this
year saw a rapid increase in the number of children infected with
AIDS in Romania, with children accounting for 71 percent of the
273 new victims, a senior doctor said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
A.S. Cercel, president of the Epidemic Hospital of Bucharest,
said that so far 3,262 Romanians were found to have contracted
AIDS, including 2,854 children. Last year 10 new child AIDS
victims were detected.
</P>
<P>
AIDS also claimed higher death tolls among Romanian children
than adults, 1,866 Romanian children and 199 adults have died of
Aids since 1985, when the first case of AIDS were reported in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Romanian medical experts have been advocating education
campaigns as a method of AIDS prevention and called for the
termination of pregnancies when and if the women were found to be
HIV-virus carriers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that most Romanian children got AIDS from
their mothers rather than medical injections and blood
transfusions.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Urges Settling Kosovo Crisis With Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kosovo issue should be
resolved only through political dialogues on the basis of equality
for all ethnic groups, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Tanjug news agency reported that Milutinovic made the
remark in his talks with United States presidential envoy
Christopher Hill, who agreed on the stance.
</P>
<P>
Both sides hoped that the negotiations, which started in
mid-May, would continue, considering the fact that the ethnic
Albanians had named a new team for peace talks and the Serbian
government had invited them to restart talks.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that all the remaining problems over Kosovo
should be settled on the basis of respecting the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Republic of Serbia and the Yugoslav
Federation.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, a province of Serbia, became the focus of international
attention when ethnic Albanian separatist forces clashed with
Serbian police in February.
</P>
<P>
Following mediation by U.S. special envoys Richard Holbrooke
and Robert Gelbard, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic met
ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova on May 15 and agreed to
begin peaceful talks.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from both sides held immediate negotiations in
Pristina, the capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
However, the Albanian representatives left the negotiating
table just days later, accusing the Serbian police of attacking
ethnic Albanians. The stalled negotiations were followed by
escalating conflicts.
</P>
<P>
On August 13, Rugova announced a new five-member team for peace
talks while Ratko Markovic, deputy premier of Serbia and head of
the Serbian delegation, initiated a resumption of talks this week
in a letter to Pehmi Agani, advisor to Rugova.
</P>
<P>
Agani expressed the hope that talks will be resumed as soon as
possible in his reply to Markovic.

<HEADLINE> Two Thai Banks Reduce Lending Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Two Thai commercial banks have
reduced their lending rates by up to 50 basis points, reflecting
an easing in the liquidity situation of the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Local televisions reported Tuesday that Thai Farmers Bank (TFB)
has trimmed its lending rates by 25-50 basis points and Siam
Commercial Bank (SCB) followed by slashing its rates by 50 basis
points.
</P>
<P>
TFB's minimum lending rate is now at 14.75 percent from 15.25
percent previously.
</P>
<P>
The cut in lending rates follows the recent sharp falls in the
short-term money market rate amid the slackening of local
corporate loan demand.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's benchmark one-day repurchase rate remained
at 10.75 percent Monday against 18-19 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here expected other banks to follow TFB and SCB's
moves given the easing in liquidity. Thai Military Bank and
Bangkok Metropolitan Bank Monday cut their fixed deposit rates by
50 basis points, which is generally considered as a move paving
the way for lending rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy, which is now crippled by liquidity
crunch resulted from high lending rates, might see an accelerated
recovery if rates were cut further.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said that it might be nine to 12 months before
there was a positive impact on investment and consumer spending.

DHAKA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina has asked her cabinet colleagues to separately assess the
flood-caused damages to country so that the Foreign Ministry can
make a presentation before the donor community, media reports said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad will brief the donor
community sometime this week on the devastation caused by the
flood, the reports quoted cabinet sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Since early last month, this South Asian country has been
seriously hit by flood, which has already affected 37 of its 64
districts, with about 20 million people becoming flood victims and
the death toll rising to about 300.
</P>
<P>
As the flood situation in the country's six flood-hit districts
and in the capital city is worsening, the government has therefore
decided to seek outside aid for the flood victims.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, flood has also washed away and damaged about 0.5
million hectares of cropland, over 5,000 kilometers of roads,
about 2,400 kilometers of embankment with over 2,200 bridges and
culverts, Disaster Management and Relief Ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
In some flood-hit districts, Diarrhea, dysentery and other
water-borne diseases have broke out, with the number of patients
rising to about 73,000, and the government departments concerned
have sent thousands of medical teams to the flood-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
The government departments concerned have already distributed
over 15 million taka (about 0.32 million U.S. dollars), about
50,000 tons of foodstuff and large quantities of other relief
materials to the flood-affected people.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Tuesday the
public will be kept informed of special steps being taken towards
building the foundation of sustained economic recovery in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The National Economic Action Council (NEAC) set up especially
for dealing with the current economic problems will provide a
fortnightly progress report on the implementation of
recommendations in the recently announced National Economic
Recovery Plan (NERP) to keep the public informed of special steps
being taken to revive the economy, MEAC said in a statement here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The progress report of the plans to revive the economy would be
released to the media on the first and third Tuesday of each
month, it said, adding the fortnightly NERP review would be a
summary of reports brought before the Cabinet from ministries, the
Federal and State Governments, as well as feedback from various
sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
NEAC's Executive director and Special Functions Minister Tun
Daim Zainuddin said, "The NERP involved an on-going process of
implementation and the public should be informed of the progress
made. By releasing a fortnightly update, Malaysians can keep track
of the government's continuos efforts and commitment to bring
about a speedy recovery."
</P>
<P>
The progress report also highlights the main actions taken to
date in line with recommendations spelt out in the NERP.
</P>
<P>
Daim said that urgency in implementing NEAC recommendations is
vital for success as is the unity and support of the people, as
pointed out by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad recently.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I hope that by confirming Malaysia's determination to
implement positive actions for economic recovery, confidence in
Malaysia from Malaysians will be bolstered."
</P>
<P>
The actions outlined under the NERP include the establishment
of the Pengurusan Danaharta Bhd (Assets Management Corporation) to
deal with bank's non-performing loans, special guidelines on
relaxation of conditions for acquisition of property by
foreigners and to improve the effectiveness of the small and
medium-scale industries (SMIs) funds.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include the implementation of Bilateral Payments
Arrangements (BPA), relaxation of the car hire purchase
guidelines, the establishment of the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)
to recapitalize weak banks, reduction of the cost of loans by
banking institutions by lowering the Base Lending Rate (BLR) as
well as improving the dissemination of economic information by
Bank Negara (State Bank) Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Admits Relationship with Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
told the Americans Monday night that he had a relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, former White House intern, that was "not
appropriate", but refused to give detailed answers to some
questions about the explicit nature of the contacts.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, I did have a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was
not appropriate. In fact, it was wrong," Clinton said in a
nationally televised address hours after his testimony in the
White House before a grand jury investigating his relationship
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he took "complete responsibility" for his actions
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
"This has gone on too long and cost too much and hurt too many
people," Clinton said of Independent Counsel Menneth Starr's
investigation. "It's past time to move on."
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors were assessing whether to call him back because
he refused to fully answer specific questions about the nature of
his contacts.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that he never asked anyone to lie or to obstruct
justice. And he asked prosecutors and Americans to let the matter
rest.
</P>
<P>
"I intended to reclaim my family life for my family," Clinton
said. "It's nobody's business but ours."
</P>
<P>
He added, "This matter is between me, the two people I love
most -- my wife and our daughter -- and our God. I must put it
right and I am prepared to do whatever it takes to do so."
</P>
<P>
Some of Clinton's advisers, including members of Congress, had
urged him to answer all the questions posed to him as a way to
stave off the possibility of impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
"For over four hours, the president responded truthfully to the
questions of prosecutors from the Office of Independent Counsel,"
Clinton's lawyer David Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
"He made the painful admission that he had inappropriate
contact with Ms. Lewinsky. As to a very few highly intrusive
questions with respect to the specifics of this contact, in order
to preserve personal privacy and institutional dignity, he gave
candid, but not detailed answers," Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's testimony was transmitted in a scrambled signal to a
federal grand jury watching on television monitors at the federal
courthouse. He was the first president to testify before a grand
jury investigating his own conduct.

</P>
<P>
"I misled people, including my wife I deeply regret that,"

<P>
Clinton said part of the reason he did not come forward earlier
was to save himself from embarrassment and because of his mistrust
of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Benefits Thai Fish Meal Exporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Thai fish meal exporters are
enjoying benefits of El Nino since the weather phenomenon hit
other major producing countries and made production costs there
higher.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Post Tuesday quoted Thai Fish Meal Producers
Association as saying that 11,753 tons of fish meal were exported
in the first half of this year, compared to 724.18 tons in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The main export markets are Chinese mainland, Taiwan and India.
</P>
<P>
El Nino led to a rise in fishing in the Andaman Sea with the
catch in the first half of this year doubling that of the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, productions in countries like Chile, Peru and
Denmark dropped due to the effects of El Nino.
</P>
<P>
The export prices of fish meal produced in these countries rose
to 700-800 U.S. dollars per ton, which are no longer competitive
with Thailand, whose price is 600 dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
Fish meal made in Thailand has a high protein content of 60-65
percent. Fish meal is a raw material used to produce feed for
shrimps.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is expected to produce 675,000 tons of fish meal this
year, up 11.93 percent from 603,115 tons last year. In the first
six months of the year, the country produced 331,383 tons.
</P>
<P>
The association said Thailand is expected to export 10 percent
of its total production this year.

meeting presided over by Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad here
Monday, which discussed the latest situation arising out of the
"push-back" of so-called Bangladeshis by India.
</P>
<P>
About 300 people were reportedly sent to Calcutta from India's
southwestern state Maharashtra recently, from where the people
would be deported to Bangladesh, and the authority in India's West
Bengal state bordering Bangladesh identified 17 of them as
Bangladeshis.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to accept them as Bangladeshi - if they (the
Indian authorities) suspect anybody as Bangladeshi, they have to
follow internationally accepted norms and procedure for
repatriation," as "push-back is not a legal procedure," the report
quoted the source as saying.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing last Thursday, the foreign minister said
that there were no illegal Bangladeshi nationals living in India
and so there was no question of repatriating Bangladeshis from
India. He urged India not to take any unilateral decision on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the present Indian government would
not do anything that would jeopardize the "excellent relations"
existing between the two countries. "We hope that they would
continue with the relations of cooperation, friendship and
understanding between India and Bangladesh," he said.
</P>
<P>
In late July, a deputy chief minister of the government of
India's Maharashtra state said his government would expel
"illegal" Bengali-speaking residents from the state to Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
And at a press conference early this month, Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina also denied that there were any illegal Bangladeshis
in India.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Continue Arms Inspection in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Monday reiterated its full support for the
U.N. weapons inspectors in Iraq and instructed them to carry on
with all their operations.
</P>
<P>
In replying to letters from the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) and the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM),
Security Council President and Slovenian Ambassador to the
U.N. Danilo Turk said the members of the council considered Iraq's
announcement to suspend its cooperation with the IAEA and UNSCOM
totally unacceptable, and contravening the relevant Security
Council resolutions and the Memorandum of Understanding on
February 23, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The council said Iraq was obliged under the relevant
resolutions to provide the IAEA and UNSCOM with the cooperation
necessary for them to undertake their activities and encourage
them to continue to report on all occasions that they deem
necessary.
</P>
<P>
The council also expressed the hope that the visit of the
Secretary-General's Special Representative in Iraq Prakash Shah
will result in the full resumption of cooperation with the IAEA
and UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced its decision to suspend its cooperation with the
IAEA and UNSCOM after the collapse of the disarmament talks
between Iraq and UNSCOM on August 3. It vowed not to change its
position until its concerns were addressed by the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA and UNSCOM informed the president of the council last
week that their inspection had been blocked significantly by Iraq
after its announcement and requested the council to give
instructions on their work.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lanka Tries to Achieve Self Sufficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government is
trying to end the country's milk shortages and improve the genetic
quality of the milch animals in the country.
</P>
<P>
A major effort to this end is a 20-million-U.S.-dollar joint
venture named "Kriya Milk Industries of Sri Lanka," to which the
National Dairy Development Board of India will provide 3.85
million U.S. dollars to help Sri Lanka achieve self-sufficiency in
milk, Food Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
Under its proposed program, the joint venture will establish a
dairy plant producing 300,000 liters of milk per day, a
state-of-the-art powder plant and a cattle feed plant. It will
also refurbish and renovate the existing plants in the island
nation.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to increase Sri Lanka's milk processing
capacity from 170,000 liters per day to 400,000 liters in the
immediate future.
</P>
<P>
The long term goal is to realize a 600,000-liter daily
capability and set up milk cooperative societies throughout the
country, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture also aims to improve the genetic quality of
milch animals as the milk yield in Sri Lanka, particularly in the
dry zone, is very low.
</P>
<P>
At present there are 300,000 dairy farmers in Sri Lanka and the
aim of the Sri Lankan government is to increase their number to 1
million in a phased manner.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture project also seeks to provide an assured
market for milk producers at remunerative prices to encourage milk
production.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has advantages in terms of intensive labor, its large
number of livestock and rich crop residues for producing cattle
feed, economists here said.
</P>
<P>
The government will establish with professional management a
vertically integrated structure to provide direct linkage between
those who produce milk and those who consume it.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka also aims to integrate milk production, processing
and marketing to provide tangible economic, social and
psychological incentives to all participants in the industry.
</P>
<P>
At present, Sri Lanka imports 80 percent of the milk consumed
and spends 106 million U.S. dollars on import annually.

<HEADLINE> China Allocates 17 Billion Yuan for Water Conservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- China has allocated 17 billion
yuan for this year's water conservation work.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission called water
conservation and flood-control work a priority before the flood
season hit in May and asked for a substantial increase in
flood-control funds for major rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
Special funds were added for emergency treatment of dykes and
embankments in the worst-hit parts of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui
and Jiangsu provinces in the past three months.
</P>
<P>
Despite the effort, floods have already led to the biggest
losses since the founding of the People's Republic of China in
1949. Experts say that the floods may have caused more than 200
billion yuan in damage.
</P>
<P>
The commission plans to continue placing emphasis on water
conservation and environment protection in the national economic
development for the next few years.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Clinton's Statement on Relations with Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) - Following is the full text of
U.S. President Bill Clinton statement on his relations with White
House intern Monica Lewinsky which was telesvised nationwide:
</P>
<P>
"Good evening. This afternoon in this room, from this chair, I
testified before the Office of Independent Counsel and the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
"I answered their questions truthfully, including questions
about my private life, questions no American citizen would ever
want to answer. Still, I must take complete responsibility for
all my actions, both public and private. And that is why I am
speaking to you tonight.
</P>
<P>
"As you know, in a deposition in January, I was asked questions
about my relationship with Monica Lewinsky. While my answers were
legally accurate, I did not volunteer information.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, I did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was
not appropriate. In fact, it was wrong. It constituted a critical
lapse in judgment and a personal failure on my part for which I
am solely and completely responsible.
</P>
<P>
"But I told the grand jury today and I say to you now that at
no time did I ask anyone to lie, to hide or destroy evidence or
to take any other unlawful action.
</P>
<P>
"I know that my public comments and my silence about this
matter gave a false impression. I misled people, including even
my wife. I deeply regret that.
</P>
<P>
"I can only tell you I was motivated by many factors. First, by
a desire to protect myself from the embarrassment of my own
conduct.
</P>
<P>
"I was also very concerned about protecting my family. The fact
that these questions were being asked in a politically inspired
lawsuit, which has since been dismissed, was a consideration, too.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, I had real and serious concerns about an
independent counsel investigation that began with private
business dealings 20 years ago, dealings I might add about which
an independent federal agency found no evidence of any wrongdoing
by me or my wife over two years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The independent counsel investigation moved on to my staff and
friends, then into my private life. And now the investigation
itself is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
"This has gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many
innocent people.
</P>
<P>
"Now, this matter is between me, the two people I love most --
my wife and our daughter -- and our God. I must put it right, and
I am prepared to do whatever it takes to do so.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is more important to me personally. But it is private,
and I intend to reclaim my family life for my family. It's
nobody's business but ours.
</P>
<P>
"Even presidents have private lives. It is time to stop the
pursuit of personal destruction and the prying into private lives
and get on with our national life.
</P>
<P>
"Our country has been distracted by this matter for too long,
and I take my responsibility for my part in all of this. That is
all I can do.
</P>
<P>
"Now it is time -- in fact, it is past time to move on. We have
important work to do -- real opportunities to seize, real
problems to solve, real security matters to face.
</P>
<P>
"And so tonight, I ask you to turn away from the spectacle of
the past seven months, to repair the fabric of our national
discourse, and to return our attention to all the challenges and
all the promise of the next American century.
</P>
<P>
"Thank you for watching. And good night.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Interrogate Mass Rape "Rumor Mongers" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian police are planning
to interrogate people disseminating reports on mass rapes in which
an estimated 160 ethnic Chinese women were abused during riots in
May in the country.
</P>
<P>
While calling on non-government organizations (NGOs) to
continue to gather evidence of women rapes in riots, National
Police chief Lt. Gen. Roesmanhadi said on Monday that his office
may summon and investigate leaders of NGOs that have "exaggerated"
reports on the sexual assaults, the country's leading newspapers
Tuesday reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after attending Independence Day celebrations at the
Merdeka Palace here, Roesmanhadi said that if they failed to come
up with evidence and continued to "exaggerate" their claims, then
the NGO activists could be charged with spreading rumors.
</P>
<P>
He did not name any NGOs, but said one organization that
claimed to have got information about the rapes and sexual
assaults had refused to hand it over to the police for fear that
the victims would be exposed or suffer further distress.
Roesmanhadi said the excuse appeared to be contrived.
</P>
<P>
Activists, including those in the Volunteers for Humanity led
by priest Sandyawan Sumardi, have said that around 160 Chinese-
Indonesian women were gang-raped and sexually assaulted during the
May riots.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement
strongly condemning "all alleged incidents of sexual assault and
rape", saying that the government has moved to organize public and
private sector investigations of the riots, which claimed 1,200
lives.
</P>
<P>
State Secretary/Minister Akbar Tanjung said over the weekend
that the government will invite foreign intelligence agents here
to investigate reports that more than 100 ethnic Chinese women
were raped during the May riots.
</P>
<P>
"The perceptions of foreigners (about the rapes) are not
consistent with the results of our investigations. To create some
objectivity, we're inviting foreign intelligence agents so they
can check the reports themselves," Tanjung said.
</P>
<P>
He said reports on the rapes have further tarnished Indonesia's
already paltry image abroad, because foreigners believe the
incidents really happened.
</P>
<P>
But Tanjung seems keen to stand by the ruling Golkar group's
unofficial policy of playing down bad news to the extent of
pretending it didn't happen, the Observer daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Government officials are now discussing how foreigners should
be allowed to investigate the mass rapes.

science and technology, culture and finance, Slovak Prime Minister
Vladimir Meciar said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meciar made the remarks when meeting Peng Peiyun, visiting vice
chairwoman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
He said Slovakia hopes to cooperate with China in mechanical
engineering, hydroelectric and chemical industries, finance,
science and technology, culture and sports, and is ready to import
Chinese products and export its own products to China.
</P>
<P>
Meciar reaffirmed Slovakia's "One China" stance, saying that
his country insists that there is only one China in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said Slovakia and China each cherishs its traditional
friendship with the other. As one of China's friends in Central
Europe, Slovakia is very pleased with the frequent political
dialogues between leaders and parliaments of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia and China share the same views on foreign diplomacy,
extending cooperation and support to each other, the Slovak prime
minister said.

<P>
Slovakia highly appreciates China's achievements and respects
the road China has opted for, Meciar said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China's enhanced status in the international
arena plays an important role in peace, development and stability
of the world.
</P>
<P>
Peng first extended Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's reguards to
Meciar. She said China attaches importance to developing friendly
and cooperative ties with Slovakia and speaks highly of Slovakia's
persistent support to China on the issues of Taiwan, Tibet and
human rights.
</P>
<P>
She said since the establishment of diplomatic ties, the
friendly bonds between China and Slovakia had undergone steady
development, with further expansion of cooperative spheres and
frequent exchanges of contacts on various levels.
</P>
<P>
China respects Slovakia's foreign policy and is willing to work
with it in an effort to bring into the 21st century a relationship
of mutual benefit based on the five principles of Peaceful
Coexistence, Peng noted.
</P>

The visiting Chinese official also met Ivan Gashparovic,
chairman of the National Council of Slovakia, who said Slovakia
will do its utmost to promote the friendly ties between the two
countries.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Preventing Epidemic Diseases In China's Flooded Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council, at a
meeting presided over by Vice-Premier Li Lanqing Monday night,
discussed the epidemic disease prevention drive in flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Zhang Wenkang and State Flood Control
and Drought Relief Headquarters officials took part, and said that
the incidence of intestinal diseases is on rise in flooded areas,
but major epidemic diseases have not increased. They warned of a
possibility of epidemic diseases in the coming months because
environmental pollution in the flooded areas will become worse.
</P>
<P>
Anhui provincial health officials discussed their
experience in preventing an outbreak of epidemic diseases in
flooded areas during the floods of 1991.
</P>
<P>
Many medical teams have been sent to flooded areas along the
Yangtze, Songhua, and Nenjiang rivers in response to President
Jiang Zemin's call for efforts to prevent the outbreak of epidemic
diseases in flooded areas and to a call from the General Office of
the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The most urgent task is to ensure the quality of food and
drinking water, Li Lanqing said, and warned against the use of
medical materials designated for disease prevention for other
purposes, or the use of fake or shoddy goods.
</P>
<P>
He asked government departments and medical universities in
flooded areas to give medical help and told the Ministry of Health
to supervise prevention of epidemic diseases, under the leadership
of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
He said that medical workers in flooded areas need to report
epidemic disease and problems in flooded areas immediately to the
State Council.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Shows Steady Growth in Financial Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- China's largest trade and
financial city has reported steady growth in financial revenue
during the first half of this year, topping 18.78 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The figure was up 12.7 percent from the same period last year,
said Liu Hongwei, director of the Shanghai Municipal Financial
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The figure was 3.3 percent higher than the city's growth rate
in its gross domestic product in the first half of this year, Liu
said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the negative effects of the financial crises in
Southeast Asia on Shanghai's economy will become visible in the
second half of this year, such as a declining demand for
industrial products on the domestic market and increasing
difficulties in attracting overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis in Southeast Asia and the devaluation of
their currencies will undermine the competitiveness of local
foreign-funded enterprises in exporting their products, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the city will take measures in the latter half of
this year to sustain a further increase in revenues and abolish
illegal levies upon local enterprises.

<HEADLINE> British PM Determined to Fight for N. Ireland Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, following what he called "a harrowing visit" to the victims
of the Omagh bombing on Tuesday, has expressed his determination
to continue the fight for peace in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
In an article written for the Belfast Newsletter and the Irish
News, the leading pro-British and pro-Irish nationalist dailies in
the province, Blair said what he had seen at Belfast's Royal
Victoria Hospital "will stay with me all my life."
</P>
<P>
"I know this and understand it, and feel it too. So I sat there
with them, alternating between a sense of helplessness and my
innermost self telling me what I know to be true: that even now,
especially now, we cannot give up," he said in the article which
was published on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Blair said the relatives had urged him not to give up, and that
politicians must not lose their nerve in the face of anger at the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
However, he ruled out the idea that the Irish Republican Army
(IRA) and its political wing Sinn Fein -- both trying to end
British rule in the province -- were responsible for the Omagh
bomb last Saturday, which killed 28 people and injured some 200.
</P>
<P>
The renegades responsible for the bombing were trying to wreck
the peace process, Blair wrote.
</P>
<P>
"We can defeat it, if we refuse to be deflected. We must and
will take whatever sensible security measures we can to crush the
rump of dissidents.
</P>
<P>
"But we must also carry on the process of establishing real
democracy and dialogue in which all political opinions can argue
their case in peace. That is the only alternative to this
violence. There is no other. And I know that my duty, even now,
amongst the carnage and the tragedy, is to carry on," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Britain and Ireland announced plans to step
up security to take those behind the Omagh bomb "off the streets."
</P>
<P>
British Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said the measures
were aimed at strengthening security in areas along the border
between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic and would make it
easier to convict people of being members of banned guerrilla
organizations, according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein, in
an interview with ABC's Good Morning America television show,
said, "I don't think anyone really believes ... that internment or
that type of Draconian measure will work."

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Stops Deportation of Nicaraguans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica has decided to stop
the deportation of illegal immigrants from Nicaragua to ease
border tensions, although about 600,000 are believed to be living
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The immigration department ordered its agents to stop the
search for illegal aliens at properties and factories last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Foreign Affairs Minister Roberto Rojas believed
that there were 600,000 Nicaraguans living in the country, most of
them without proper documentation.
</P>
<P>
The country had been intensifying its efforts to expatriate
illegal Nicaraguans, with 120,000 deported during the first half
of this year, until a dispute arose over navigation rights on the
San Juan River, which separates the two countries, and forced the
Costa Rican government to reconsider its polices.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua, which has sovereignty over the river, decided to
prohibit the transit of armed Costa Rican forces along the river,
a move opposed by Costa Rica which has navigation rights on the
river.
</P>
<P>
As tensions mounted, Costa Rica decided to reduce the pressure
on illegal Nicaraguans on the border areas.
</P>
<P>
New negotiations to resolve the disputes are still pending.

<HEADLINE> Zhengzhou Seeks New Home for Water Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 18 (Xinhua)-- Residents in Zhengzhou, capital
of central China's Henan Province, have long exhibited pride for
egrets which are facing a serious test with heated debates
concerning the nuisance created by bird droppings.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing debates center on whether or not to drive the
birds from the city.
</P>
<P>
A local evening newspaper recently opened a telephone hotline
to discuss problems caused by hundreds of egrets roosting in
trees in a downtown area.
</P>
<P>
Street cleaners complain that "bird droppings make it all but
impossible to keep the city clean". Related workers are thus in
favor of driving the birds from the city.
</P>
<P>
Their opinions are echoed by many residents who worry that the
droppings carry parasites and pathogens harmful to human beings.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, however, a large number of local residents
exhibit great concern for the egret population. A unnamed biologist
stressed that people should protect the birds. "The fact that
egrets remain in Zhengzhou clearly indicates the city's
environmental quality," according to the biologist.
</P>
<P>
Parents never abandon their children simply because they get
dirty, said one local woman, adding that she enjoys sharing blue
skies with the birds in spite of their droppings.
</P>
<P>
A local man suggested that Zhengzhou designate egrets as the
city bird and establish a nearby "nature reserve" for the species.
</P>
<P>
Two engineers with the Zhengzhou Zoo have drafted a
comprehensive plan to establish a park sanctuary to lure egrets
from downtown areas. Bird-watchers applauded the plan carried in a
recent edition of the evening newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Zhengzhou residents are searching for an ideal habitat for
egrets, and sincerely hope a workable plan can be found to enable
birds and people to coexist in harmony. Endithem

<HEADLINE> Philippine Agricultural Output Drops to 20-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine agricultural
growth dropped by 7.15 percent to a 20-year low during the first
half of this year due to the El Nino phenomenon, the Business
World reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report, quoting a memo submitted to President Joseph
Estrada by Agriculture Secretary William Dar, said the big
setbacks suffered by the sector during the same period in 1983,
1985 and 1988 paled in comparison with this year's performance.
</P>
<P>
"The big slump in crop production brought down agriculture to
its worst performance record in 20 years," Dar said.
</P>
<P>
At current prices, the overall value of agricultural production
for the period dropped by 1.9 percent to 245.1 billion pesos
(about 5.7 billion U.S. dollars) from the year-ago 249.9 billion
pesos (some 5.8 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Among sectors, only the livestock and poultry industries
registered positive growth while the production of paddy rice,
corn, fishery and other sectors fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
"The effects of the El Nino weather phenomenon on crop farms
translated into a 14.61-percent contraction in aggregate output
this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the setback, Dar expressed confidence that the
agricultural production will recover in the second half.
</P>
<P>
However, some economists and business leaders predicted that
the growth target of 2-3 percent this year will not be met. They
urged the government to put up safety nets and increase
importation of rice, sugar and corn.
</P>
<P>
Economist Rolando Dy projected that the agricultural losses
will translate into a 3-percent cut in the growth of the domestic
economy.
</P>
<P>
"In effect, we foresee the total food production slumping by
about 20 percent for the whole year of 1998, one of the highest
declines in history," he said.

BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers are as follows:
</P>
<P>
 "People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- Wen Jiabao, head of the State Flood Control and Drought
Relief Headquarters, went to the city of Shashi Sunday to
direct the anti-flood fight on the Yangtze River embankments.
</P>
<P>
Entrusted by President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji, Wen
returned to Hubei Province, the worst-hit area in central China,
on Sunday night when the sixth and most disastrous of the flood
crest pushed the water level at the Jingjiang section of Yangtze
above the 45-meter mark.
</P>
<P>
-- China will be issuing 270 billion yuan (32.5 billion US
dollars) of special treasury bonds beginning today, according to
the Ministry of Finance.

The 30-year special treasury bonds will carry an annual coupon
rate of 7.2 percent, with interest paid on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
 "Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- The water level of the Yangtze River began to decline
yesterday at Shashi, Hubei province, two hours after a sixth flood

China's largest oilfield, Daqing, after it breached the second
defence barrier near Zhaoyuan County in Northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province yesterday evening.
</P>
<P>
A 10-meter-long breach was discovered at the Zhaoyuan barrier
early yesterday. The Shenyang Military Area Command immediately
sent 1,000 officers and soldiers to plug it, bringing the total
number of officers and soldiers on the embankment to 20,000.

<HEADLINE> 33 Percent of Chilean Children Live in Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-three percent of Chilean
children live in extreme poverty and have to begin work at very
young age.
</P>
<P>
A report, entitled "Boys and Girls Are Always Persons" and
written by Chile's National Peace and Justice Commission, revealed
that about 400,000 children in the country live a very poor life.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some 50,000 kids under 15 years of age have to
work to support their families, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Another problem with many families is the lack of father, who
has either abandoned the family or does not spend time with their
kids.
</P>
<P>
Worse still is child abuse. The document pointed out 12 percent
of kids are beaten by their mothers and 10 percent by their
fathers.
</P>
<P>
The report said children are citizens of the future and their
rights should be respected.

<HEADLINE> Arsenal Wins Opening Match in Premier League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A spectacular goal from Marc
Overmars gave the premier league defending champion Arsenal a 2-1
victory over newly-promoted Nottingham Forest Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
With just 11 minutes on the clock and Forest holding out for a
n unlikely point, the Dutchman picked up the ball in his own half.
</P>
<P>
He out-paced Steve Chettle and raced half the length of the
pitch,before firing a shot from the edge of the area.
</P>
<P>
Forest keeper Dave Beasant was equal to the strike, but the
ball rebounded off his legs and Overmars somehow twisted himself
in mid-air and sent a looping overhead kick into the back of the
net.
</P>
<P>
Forest, who have been written off as relegation fodder by
many critics since losing first-choice strikers Kevin Campbell
and Pierre Van Hooijdonk, provided determined opposition for the
Gunners.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Overmars' wonder goal overshadowed a similarly
thrilling effort from Forest's Geoff Thomas just three minutes
beforehand.
</P>
<P>
The former England man played a one-two with striker
Jean-Claude Darcheville and tore through the heart of Arsenal's
defence, before curling a superb shot past David Seaman.
</P>
<P>
The home side had the majority of the chances, but they never
looked thoroughly convincing, with Dennis Bergkamp in subdued mo
od.
</P>
<P>
Emmanuel Petit put the Gunners ahead with his first goal
since the World Cup final on 58 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Petit, who helped France win the World Cup with the third
goal against Brazil, provided the final touch after two of the
Gunners'other France 98 stars had punished the Forest defence.
</P>
<P>
Bergkamp crossed a perfect free-kick from the right and Tony
Adams rose above his marker to send a thunderous header against
the bar.
</P>
<P>
Petit was quickest to react to the rebound and nodded into a
gaping goal.
</P>
<P>
The opening goal gave the Double-winners an extra
impetus,following a sluggish first half in which they were
frustrated by a spirited effort by Forest.
</P>
<P>
Arsene Wenger's side had their chances early on, but Forest
survived the scares and, as the half went on, they began to find
their top-flight feet.
</P>
<P>
Beasant was in fine form, keeping out efforts from Nicholas
Anelka and Marc Overmars as his defence was caught napping at the
start.
</P>
<P>
The veteran keeper was beaten in the 23rd minute, but was
relieved to see Anelka's shot rebound back off the woodwork.
</P>
<P>
Anelka chested down Patrick Vieira's cross with an exquisite
first touch, before brushing aside Chettle and smacking a
close-range shot against the post.
</P>
<P>
David Seaman had to be at his sharpest in the 34th minute to
deny Darcheville opening the scoring for the visitors.
</P>
<P>
Wing-back Thierry Bonalair laid on a precise through-ball for
the French striker, who raced clear of the defence and fired in a
shot at the near post, which Seaman did well to save with his
legs.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal are joint favourites for the title with Manchester
United, who drew 2-2 at home to Leicester on Saturday.

Meanwhile, Italy is launching a nation-wide probe into Zeman's
allegations.

<HEADLINE> Big Earthquakes Predicted in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand scientists have
said that Sophisticated satellite-measurements of tectonic plate
movements under the southern North Island of New Zealand show
significant land deformations, pointing to the inevitability of
big earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
In a paper recently published in the Civil Defense Ministry's
journal Tephra, seismologists Martin Reyners and John Beavan
predicted big earthquakes in the region, as well as in more
southern regions that are subjected to strains under the Southern
Alps along the west coast of the country's South Island.
</P>
<P>
In the paper, they are unable to predict when, but said the
high build-up of strain means that "one or more big earthquakes
are inevitable."
</P>
<P>
in the northern North Island, they said, the Pacific and
Australian plates are grinding away without too much strain. This
is because the movements on the Australian boundary of the
dividing Hikurangi trench go in different directions from those on
the Pacific side.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that the motion of the Pacific Plate is not
being transmitted into the overlying Australian Plate, so that the
Pacific Plate must be subducting fairly smoothly beneath the
northern North Island without causing too much strain or
deformation in the overlying plate," the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
"In the southern North Island the situation is different," they
added.
</P>
<P>
According to their analysis, there is little change in velocity
across the trench under the southern North Island.
</P>
<P>
"This means that much of the Pacific Plate motion is being
transmitted into the overriding Australian Plate, causing it to
squash and deform throughout the region.

<HEADLINE> Police to Investigate Bosnich Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Aston Villa goalkeeper Mark
Bosnich is facing a police investigation following allegations
that he swore at fans in his side's Premiership opener at Everton
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
And the controversial Australian star could be reported to the
Football Association over the matter.
</P>
<P>
Merseyside Police confirmed that they received two complaints
during the 0-0 draw.
</P>
<P>
"If it is considered that the offence is serious enough, then
we will pass on the information to the FA for them to deal with,"
a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Bosnich is booked for making gestures to Spurs fans in 1996.
Police officers from the football task force will collect all the
evidence and then decide if there is sufficient cause to report
it to the FA.
</P>
<P>
"We do not prosecute in these situations, but pass everything
on to the FA."
</P>
<P>
Tony Williamson, one of the two fans who was watching the game
with his 11-year-old son, complained: "Bosnich should know
better. It was offensive and insulting behaviour."
</P>
<P>
He told The Sun newspaper on Monday: "I was disgusted by his
language, which was heard by a lot of youngsters. He started
swearing loudly when the ball was thrown back to him by a young
lad after it had gone into the crowd behind his goal."
</P>
<P>
It is not the first time Bosnich has been accused of clashing
with opposition fans.
</P>
<P>
He was warned by the FA about his future conduct two years ago
after he delivered a Nazi-style salute at Tottenham, enraging the
club's Jewish supporters.
</P>
<P>
Bosnich later said he did not realise the significance of his
actions and apologised to the fans.

<HEADLINE> Old Street in Shenyang Restored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A 1,300-meter-long street with
buildings in the style of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) has been
restored in this capital of northeast China's Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
The street, Shengjingcheng, was built in the Western Han
Dynasty (206 B.C.-24 A.D.) and remained the city center in later
dynasties.
</P>
<P>
It became more attractive when the early Qing Dynasty made
present-day Shenyang its capital and built its imperial palaces at
one side of the street.
</P>
<P>
The street, with the palaces in the middle, now has more than
60 Qing-style buildings along both sides and is called "a street
of the Qing Dynasty."
</P>
<P>
Qing imperial processions and folk-arts performances will be
featured along the street as part of a local tourist program.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said the restoration of the street is also an
effort to conserve the environment of the imperial palaces.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, August 18 ((Xinhua)) -- The capital city of Lanzhou in
northwest China's Gansu Province is expected to become the center
of a telecommunications network in West China by linking four
major optic-fiber trunks in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Xi'an-Lanzhou-Urumqi and Beijing-Hohhot-Yinchuan-Lanzhou
optic-fiber lines have already gone into operation, and the
Lanzhou-Xining-Lhasa and Lanzhou-Chengdu lines are expected to
become operational this year.
</P>
<P>
Lanzhou is also a major crossroad for the international
information expressway.
</P>
<P>
The city, which has a population of more than one million, now
has 340,000 telephone users in urban areas, 60,000 mobile phone
subscribers, and 170,000 beeper owners.
</P>
<P>
There are 8,658 public telephones in the city, which leads West
China in the number of telephones available for every 100 people.
</P>
<P>
In Lanzhou, people can dial more than 100 countries and regions
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Business turnover generated by the Lanzhou telecommunications
bureau exceeded 400 million yuan in 1996, topped 600 million yuan
in 1997 and is expected to hit 800 million yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunications sector has so far become a key force for
local economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to add 750 million yuan in fixed-asset
investment in the sector this year to help make Lanzhou into the
telecommunications hub of West China.

<HEADLINE> Report: U.S. Detects Nuclear Site in DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. intelligence agencies have
detected a secret underground complex in the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), the New York Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Spy satellites have photographed a "huge work site" 25 miles
northeast of the Yongbyon nuclear center, with thousands of DPRK
workers "swarming around the new site, burrowing into the
mountainside," the report said, quoting U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
White House and Pentagon officials fear that it may be an
effort to revive the DPRK's frozen nuclear weapons program, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
However, a senior Administration official said the DPRK had not
yet technically violated a 1994 accord, as there is no evidence
that Pyongyang has begun pouring cement for a new reactor or a
reprocessing plant that would convert nuclear waste into
bomb-grade plutonium, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The 1994 agreement, called the Agreed Framework, requests the
DPRK to abandon its nuclear weapons program in exchange for
billions of dollars in Western aid.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has complained that the United States is reneging on
its side of the pact because Congress has failed to authorize
money for fuel shipments to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
The shipments constitute the U.S. portion of a 6 billion U.S.
dollar electric energy scheme including also contributions from
Japan and South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Names Former Critic as Economic Adviser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
Monday selected one of his former critics to head a new council of
economic advisers in his chancellory office to help chart future
economic reforms in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Lothar Spaeth, who is chief executive of the German optical
industry giant Jenoptik AG and former premier of the western
German Baden-Wuerttemberg state, would serve as chairman of the
newly-established council of economic advisers in Kohl's
chancellory office, German government spokesman Otto Hauser
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Spaeth, a pro-business member of Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union (CDU) party, has long been a critic of Kohl's economic
policies.
</P>
<P>
According to Hauser, some other German business leaders would
also join the council which is expected to work out strategic
concept for Germany's modernization in an increasingly globalized
world economy.
</P>
<P>
Kohl's move came as German political parties are intensifying
their election campaigns with just six weeks away from the
country's general elections on September 27 this year.
</P>
<P>
Both Kohl's center-right ruling coalition and the main
opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) claimed that it was their
party which could bring about the necessary changes in Germany to
cope with increasing challenges on the world market.
</P>
<P>
The SPD, which is hoping to put an end to Kohl's 16-year grip
on power, adopted a 100-day governing program Monday pledging to
immediately launch their own tax reform in case of an election
victory and to reverse some reform programs introduced by Kohl's
government to ensure more social justice.
</P>
<P>
As the election day is approaching, opinion polls showed that
Kohl's party is still trailing the SPD though the gap has been
narrowed to about three to five percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Richardson Reports No Policy Shift on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Bill Richardson, U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, said Monday that "there is no
policy shift on Iraq" and the sanctions against the Mideast
country will remain "until Iraq complies with all U.N. resolutions."
</P>
<P>
"The United States policy is to reverse Iraq's action by the
U.N. Security Council and Secretary-General (Kofi Annan)," Richardson
told reporters outside the hall where the Security Council is
holding a closed-door discussion.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq is now saying `no`" to the Security Council and the
secretary-general, Richardson said, "It's up to the Security
Council and secretary-general to respond adequately" to the Iraqi
move.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador made the remarks as the 15-member Security
Council is studying how to respond to letters from both Richard
Butler, head of the U.N. Special Committee (UNSCOM), and Mohamed
el-Baradei, director-general of the Vienna-based International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
</P>
<P>
The two heads are reported to have notified the Security
Council that their activities had been largely blocked. The
UNSCOM is in charge of disarming Iraq while the IAEA is
monitoring the nation's nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the Security Council began a meeting over Iraq
Monday afternoon, the Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations,
Nizar Hamdoon, said that Iraq has made no policy change in the
current standoff over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"The UNSCOM has been injustice and unfair to Iraq, that's why
we stopped the cooperation," the Iraqi envoy said, "Iraq would
like to see some action by the (Security) Council."
</P>
<P>
Iraq on August 5 announced an end to its cooperation with the
UNSCOM until the U.N. team was restructured to reduce what it
called American influence and its headquarters moved from New
York to Geneva or Vienna.

<HEADLINE> Shell Joins Daimler-Benz in Developing Fuel Cell Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Shell International Oil
Products BV and Germany's Daimler-Benz AG announced Monday that
they have signed an agreement on cooperation in the development of
the environment-friendly fuel cell cars.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation of the two companies would help pave the way to
early introduction of a new era of cleaner and more efficient
cars, said Daimler-Benz in a statement issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
Daimler-Benz, which described itself as a leading company in
the development of fuel-cell-powered cars, has already developed a
number of prototype vehicles based on the new technology which
converts hydrogen gas to electric power.
</P>
<P>
A major advantage of the fuel cell car is that it can sharply
reduce harmful emissions of a traditional car and can run with
almost no noise.
</P>
<P>
Shell said that it could make a contribution to the new concept
through the use of its Catalytic Partial Oxidation technology
which is said to be able to convert liquid fuels into a hydrogen
rich gas.
</P>
<P>
The agreement concluded between Shell and Daimler-Benz was
aimed to find ways to harness the two technologies. The result
could be a car which has the environmental advantages of fuel cell
power plus the convenience of filling up at an existing petrol
station, Daimler-Benz said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., IMF Call on Russia to Stick to Reform Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Monday urged Russia to stick to
its promises made last month to continue its reform plan.
</P>
<P>
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus
and U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin both said Moscow should
follow IMF recipes, which include painful measures to increase tax
collection, and talk to creditors.
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is critically important that the Russian
authorities move quickly to take action to restore confidence,
including the adoption of a careful and cooperative approach to
dealing with its creditors and the full implementation of the
measures outlined in the Russian stabilization program agreed with
the IMF," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The statements were made following the Russian government's
policy moves, allowing the currency to fall.
</P>
<P>
Russia became the IMF's biggest debtor last month after the
fund approved a 22.5 billion U.S. dollar package to restore market
confidence and hold the rouble steady.
</P>
<P>
Markets climbed as the rescue package was announced, but then
spiraled lower. Share prices hit two-year lows and debt plunged to
levels which priced in the risk of default, to the obvious
surprise of those who put the deal together.
</P>
<P>
The Russian policy switch came after days of denials from
government officials that they were prepared to contemplate a
rouble devaluation.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Victims Increase Pressure on German Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Holocaust victims Monday stepped up
pressure on two major German banks to settle a multi-billion-U.S.
dollar claim they made in compensation for assets seized by German
Nazis during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Michael Witti, a Munich-based lawyer who said he represented
about 30,000 claimants, told reporters in Frankfurt Monday that
Holocaust victims wanted the German banks to settle the dispute as
soon as possible after the two biggest Swiss banks last week
agreed to pay 1.25 billion dollars in compensation for lost assets
deposited by Holocaust victims in Switzerland during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Witti spoke to reporters just outside the headquarters
buildings of the Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt in a
bid to increase pressure on the two biggest German commercial
banks.
</P>
<P>
Witti was also accompanied by an 85-year-old woman who urged
the Dresdner Bank to clarify what happened to the bank account of
her father who died at the Auschwitz death camp in Poland.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the lawyer Monday asked the two German
banks to open their archives to independent investigators in order
to shed light on their war-time activities.
</P>
<P>
A class-action suit was launched by Holocaust survivors in June
in New York, charging that the two German banks had profited from
Holocaust victims' personal assets like gold teeth fillings, gold
jewelry and coins seized by German Nazis during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The claimants demanded 18 billion U.S. dollars in compensation
from the two German banks.
</P>
<P>
According to Witti, Holocaust victims would also seek
compensation from German industrial and insurance companies.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
is being questioned before a grand jury on Monday about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The president began his testimony at 12:59 p.m., the white
House said.
</P>
<P>
"The president is confident as he goes into today's session,"
White House press secretary Mike McCurry said earlier Monday. "I
wouldn't say he's exactly looking forward to it."
</P>
<P>
He said Clinton was certain about the testimony he would give,
and that it would be the truth.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, said Monday Clinton would improve his
situation by being straightforward. But he said that if the
allegations of a sexual relationship between the president and
Lewinsky were true, the behavior could not be excused as
"consensual."
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how he can possibly hide behind 'It's
consensual,'" news reports quoted Hatch as saying in Iowa. "The
most powerful man in the world and a 21-year-old intern.
Consensual or not, it's still abysmal, if it happened."
</P>
<P>
Democratic National Committee Chairman Roy Romer, the Colorado
governor, said people want to see the investigation wrapped up so
the government can focus instead on substantive issues like Social
Security and health care.
</P>
<P>
"People are saying: `Get this out of the way so we can get to
the business of America,'" reports quoted Romer as saying at a
news conference in Denver.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's secret testimony from the White House was carried
live via closed-circuit television to the grand jurors at the U.S.
Courthouse who have investigated the Lewinsky case. Officials took
great care to ensure no one could listen in.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain's aero engines
manufacturer Rolls-Royce has won a 240 million pounds (390 million
US dollars) deal to provide engines for 15 new aircraft for
American Airlines, according to a new release made available to
the press today.
</P>
<P>
The Trent 800 engines, which are scheduled for delivery in 2000
and 2001, will power the new Boeing 777 aircraft. The engines,
among the largest ever made, have up to 104,000 pounds of thrust
each, and also power the Airbus A330.
</P>
<P>
John Cheffins, head of Rolls-Royce's airlines division, said he
was pleased to be able to extend his company's relationship with
American Airlines, which is one of the engineering group's largest
global customers.
</P>
<P>
"Today's order confirms the strong demand for Rolls-Royce
engines in North America, which enables us to mitigate the effects
of the slowdown in Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The order means that by 2001 almost 250 aircraft with
Rolls-Royce engines will be flying as part of the American
Airlines fleet.
</P>
<P>
The agreement follows the two companies' formation of an engine
repair company, Texas Aero Engine Services, in January.
</P>
<P>
Rolls-Royce has been trying to expand its presence in North
America in competition with US rivals Pratt &AMP; Whitney and General
Electric. The Trent competes directly against the GE90 engine.

WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
is being questioned before a grand jury on Monday about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The president began his testimony at 12:59 p.m., said deputy
press secretary Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
"The president is confident as he goes into today's session,"
White House press secretary Mike McCurry said earlier Monday
morning. "I wouldn't say he's exactly looking forward to it."
</P>
<P>
He said Clinton was certain about the testimony he would give,
and that it would be the truth.
</P>
<P>
Outside the courthouse where grand jurors would hear the
testimony via closed-circuit TV, Starr's spokesman Charles Bakaly
signaled prosecutors are nearing an end to their investigation.
"We are trying to complete the investigation as quickly as
possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's secret testimony from the White House would be
carried live via closed-circuit television to the grand jurors at
the U.S. Courthouse who have investigated the Lewinsky case.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Tactics for Opposing UN Inspection Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Monday acknowledged that she opposed an
unannounced U.N. inspection of suspected weapons sites in Iraq
earlier this month but the purpose was to avoid a deep split in
the U.N. Security Council on the issue.
</P>
<P>
In a column in Monday's New York Times, Albright said tactical
reasons prompted her to believe that the surprise inspections
planned recently by UNSCOM, the U.N. weapons inspection group,
would be unwise.
</P>
<P>
On August 3, Iraq announced it was suspending all inspections.
With this decision, Albright said, "It was clear that Saddam
Hussein had done something which even his backers in the Security
Council could not defend."
</P>
<P>
After that decision, Albright said she consulted with UNSCOM
chairman Richard Butler who, she wrote, "came to his own
conclusion that it was wiser to keep the focus on Iraq's open
defiance of the Security Council" rather than insist on going
ahead with the inspection.
</P>
<P>
She said, "had UNSCOM gone ahead with the intrusive
inspections, they would have been blocked anyway, but some in the
Security Council would have muddied the waters by claiming that
UNSCOM had provoked Iraq."
</P>
<P>
She said the U.S. goal is to get the Security Council to face
up to its responsibilities to both the U.N. special commission and
the International Atomic Energy Agency, both of which are
responsible for monitoring Iraq's weapons-related activities.
</P>
<P>
"If the council fails to persuade Saddam to resume cooperation,
then we will have a free hand to use other means to support
UNSCOM's mandate," Albright said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Tax Chief Promoted to Vice Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian State Tax Service head
Boris Fyodorov became vice-prime minister Monday, the second time
to assume the post.
</P>
<P>
According to a decree signed by President Boris Yeltsin,
Fyodorov will be in charge of macroeconomics and state debt
management, the presidential press service said.
</P>
<P>
Fyodorov, who served as deputy prime minister of the Russian
Federation in 1993-1994, will continue to head the State Tax
Service, presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
Fyodorov's appointment came after the government and the
Central Bank's announcement to raise the upper limit of the
ruble's exchange rate against the dollar to 9.5 rubles to the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed head of the State Tax Service last May.
</P>
<P>
Fyodorov, 40, graduated from the Moscow Finance Institute in
1980 with a doctorate in economics.
</P>
<P>
He was finance minister of the Russian Federation in 1993-1994.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Alexander Livshits, deputy head of the
Russian Presidential Administration, has submitted a letter of
resignation to Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
"I have been working alongside the president for six years,"
Livshits, a former finance minister, told the Interfax news
agency. "I have done my best for Russia. Possibly I bear a share
of responsibility for what has happened on the financial market."
</P>
<P>
"I have failed to help the president and therefore I am
leaving," Livshits said.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known whether Yeltsin has accepted
Livshits' resignation.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) said on Monday that multiple threats to
the health, well-being and basic education of Indonesia's children
constitute nothing short of an international emergency.
</P>
<P>
Carol Bellamy, Executive Director of UNICEF said "The fate of
millions of Indonesian children and women is at stake. Some 4
million Indonesian children below the age of 2 are already
severely malnourished and more than 30 percent of the country's
children are at risk of failing to complete Primary school."
</P>
<P>
Bellamy expressed concern that over 50 billion U.S. dollars in
emergency loans to Indonesia by the International Monetary
Fund(IMF), the World Bank ans other lending agencies may not be
enough to turn things around."
</P>
<P>
"It will take years for Indonesia to recover and sustained
international aid is critically important to saving lives of
children. The world community must do what is necessary to resue
the potential of Indonesian children through good nutrition and
schooling that will enable them to participate in the competitive
world of the 21st century," the Executive Director said.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy also expressed concern for human rights in Indonesia
and urged vigorous prosecution of those responsible for the rape
of more than 150 ethnic Chinese women and girls, mainly in and
around Jakarta, during days of rioting last May.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri is scheduled to visit Syria on Wednesday to launch
comprehensive agricultural cooperation, Lebanon's National News
Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Hariri and his Syrian counterpart Mahmoud
Zouebi will co-chair a meeting on agricultural cooperation. The
meeting will be attended by agricultural officials and experts of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will focus on ways to trade more agricultural
produces between the two countries and to reduce customs duties
and taxes on them.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Agricultural Minister Shawki Fakhoury told the local
Orient radio that the proposed cooperation also involves avoiding
collision of the two countries in world markets as they grow
identical products in a similar climate.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has close ties with Syria. Under a pact of
"brotherhood, cooperation and coordination" signed in 1991, they
agree to forge common stances on key international and bilateral
issues.
</P>
<P>
According to an industrial agreement signed last February, the
two countries set a goal to finally abolish customs duties on each
other's industrial products with an annual reduction rate of 25
percent.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is due to visit Tanzania
and Kenya on Tuesday following the bomb attacks on U.S. embassies
in the two countries 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
A Tanzanian Foreign Ministry statement said Monday that upon
arrival in the Dar es Salaam International Airport on Tuesday
morning, Albright will go straight to the new site of U.S.
embassy where she will stay for half an hour before proceeding to
the devastated U.S. embassy building.
</P>
<P>
After inspecting the wrecked embassy, she will visit the
Muhimbili Medical Center to console two victims who are still
hospitalized there. She is also expected to have a small meeting
with doctors and nurses of the hospital, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Then the U.S. Secretary of State will pay a courtesy call on
Vice-President Omar Ali Juma at the State House before flying to
Nairobi. President Benjamin Mkapa is currently on an official
visit in Nordic countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. embassy in Tanzania held a memorial
service Monday for those who died in the tragic explosion. The
ceremony took place at the temporary embassy office in the Toure

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Israeli Defense Minister's Remarks Spark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai stirred up a political storm Monday after he
reportedly said Israel is willing to leave the occupied Golan
Heights in exchange for security guarantees by Syria.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, regarded as a moderate within the rightwing
government, was quoted by the German magazine Focus published
Monday as saying that the extent of Israeli withdrawal from the
Golan Heights was linked to the level of security that Israel gets
from Syria.
</P>
<P>
This stance was in conformity with the formula created by the
previous Labor government, which agreed to pull out from the Golan
Heights if security arrangments were worked out with Syria.
</P>
<P>
"It's simple: the more security we receive, the more land we
can give back," Mordechai was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai's remarks drew a storm of protest from other cabinet
ministers who charged him for violating the government's basic
guidelines, which stated that Golan Heights, which Israel seized
from Syria in the 1967 war, is vital to Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday in the
northern city of Tiberias, where he was on summer vacation, that
Israel has not changed its policy on the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
But he turned down a request by the centrist coalition party
The Third Way, which supports Israeli withdrawal from large part
of the West Bank but opposes giving up the Golan Heights, to
publicly reprimand the defense minister.
</P>
<P>
In a damage-control effort, Mordechai, speaking on local radios
and televisions late Saturday, said that he was misquoted by the
Focus.
</P>
<P>
But this was not enough to silence the furor among the
government. The hawkish Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon said
that although the talks with Syria were important, the Golan
Heights should remain an integral part of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani, leader of the
centrist of the coalition party The Third Way, said the cabinet
ministers were on the same wagon and if someone was "pulling the
reins in a wrong way, then I'll grab the reins."
</P>
<P>
Two other Third Way lawmakers Yehuda Harel and Alexander
Lubotsky urged Netanyahu to publicly criticize Mordechai and
declare that his words do not represent the government's policy.
</P>
<P>
But not everyone is opposed to the reported Mordechai formula
on the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
An unammed former army intelligence official said Monday that
following long time study, one conclusion was very clear: Israel
has to choose between peace with Syria without Golan and keeping
Golan without peace with Syria.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if no peace with Syria was made, then the risk
of war would increase.
</P>
<P>
His view was echoed by an organization representing hundreds
of senior reserve military officers. Shilom Lahad, chairman of the
Council for Peace and Security, said there would be definitely a
war if no progress was made in negotiations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
"It is just a matter of time," Lahad said.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai is also expected to receive strong support from the
leading opposition Labor Party, which has so far kept silence on
the reported Mordechai's comments.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Sarid, leader of another moderate opposition party Meretz,
was quoted by the Yediot Aharonot daily as saying Monday that
Mordechai's remarks signaled that the government has come close to
accepting the leftist camp's position on the Golan issue.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel and Syria have broken down since
early 1996 after making considerable progress on the informal
promise by the previous Labor government to fully withdraw from
the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The talks have failed to resume due to the Netanyahu-led
government objection to any land compromise on the Golan
Heights. Although Netanyahu has repeatedly called for resuming the
talks without any preconditions, but Syria insists that the talks
be resumed from where they were left off two years ago -- an
Israeli promise on a full withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> 4 Million Ethiopian Farmers Join Cooperatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Ministry of
Agriculture said Monday that 155 new farmers' cooperatives were
established in the country in the just-ended 1997/98 fiscal year,
bringing the total members of the cooperatives to about four
million.
</P>
<P>
Takele Zegeye, cooperatives and market assessing team leader
in the ministry said that the newly set up farmers' cooperatives
have brought the total number of cooperatives across the country
to 3,896, reported the Ethiopia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Takele said the farmers' cooperatives render loan services and
facilitate the provision of fertilizers and select-seeds to their
members.
</P>
<P>
Farmers' cooperatives are instrumental in bolstering country's
agriculture and economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official also cited Kenya as a country which secures 45
percent of the total national income from farmers' cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's 1997/98 fiscal year ended on July 7 this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is reported that this year's satisfactory
rainfall distribution in Ethiopia which started from June is
believed to result in bumper food grain production.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government Monday
expressed the hope that the possible meetings between President
Glafcos Clerides and U.S. officials would boost efforts to settle
the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
It was reported here that the Cypriot president will meet with
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Presidential
Emissary for Cyprus Richard Holbrooke next month.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Christos Stylianides said "both the Cyprus
government and the President of the Republic would welcome such
meetings, when the President will be in New York for the U.N.
General Assembly."
</P>
<P>
Clerides will fly to New York on September 20 and will address
the General Assembly on September 25.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said such meetings "would benefit consultations
now taking place on the Cyprus issue." The consultations must
focus on issues such as a resumption of peace talks and
demilitarization of the island, in order to bear fruit, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus peace talks reached a deadlock after Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash insisted in January that his
self-styled, breakaway state in northern Cyprus be recognized.
</P>
<P>
Denktash also said he would not return to the negotiating
table unless Cyprus withdraws its application for the European
Union (EU) membership. Cyprus started accession talks with the EU
in Brussels last March.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since the island
was divided in 1974 when Turkey landed its troops and took over
the northern third of the island in the wake of a failed coup
seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the divided
island in a bizonal, bicommunal federation through peace talks,
but so far no tangible results have been achieved.

DAR ES SALAAM, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The refugees fleeing from

Reached by telephone, J. F. Durieux, the head of the UNHCR
sub-office, said in west Tanzania's Kigoma Region that by Sunday
the refugees escaping battles between the rebels and the
Congolese government had reached 210.

<P>
After getting registered at the Kibirizi refugee reception
center, the refugees were sent to the Nyarugusu Camp in the

<P>
PARIS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- France Monday evacuated by ferry
some 100 foreigners from the capital of the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) Kinshasa to Brazzaville, the capital of the
neighboring Congo Republic.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted French diplomats in
Brazzaville as saying that among the evacuees were 12 French
nationals, 35 people of other nationalities with residency rights
in France, some 60 Chinese and the staff of the Turkish embassy.
</P>

They were received by French diplomats when disembarking in
Brazzaville before being transferred to the airport, from where
they were flown to Libreville, Gabon, by the Transall military
aircraft of the French army, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
About 50 French soldiers helped maintain order at the customs
in check-ups and other formalities, said AFP.

Meanwhile, some 50 French nationals evacuated from Kinshasa
since last weekend are expected to arrive home early Tuesday
morning on board an Air France Boeing 747 rented by the French and
Belgian governments, said French Foreign Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Two People Killed in Maseru as Tension Mounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Two opposition protesters
were killed in a shoot-out in Lesotho's capital Maseru early
Monday morning, sparking fresh tension in the tiny mountain
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties said police started shooting protesters
outside the royal palace in Maseru without provocation, but
police said the crowd started the shooting, South African
television reported.
</P>
<P>
A young man and a 16-year-old girl were killed and between 30
and 40 were injured.
</P>
<P>
The investigation by a regional commission into alleged
electoral irregularities was delayed as opposition party leaders
visited the scene.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties said the shooting was a plot by the
government to derail the commission, which is chaired by South
African Constitutional Court Deputy President Pius Langa and
comprises members from South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The work of the commission resumed at mid-day and Lesotho
Independent Electoral Commission Chairman Sekara Mafisa Monday
testified before the commission, according to South African Press
Association (SAPA).
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted opposition spokeswoman Mamello Morrison as saying
between 500 and 600 people were still at the palace gates Monday
night, where they have been camping for the past two weeks to
demand the annulment of the May 23 general election results.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties claim the elections were rigged, resulting
in the Lesotho Congress for Democracy winning 79 of 80 seats in
the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
There was little traffic in Maseru's streets Monday. A lot of
shops were closed, and many of those that did open closed early.

<HEADLINE> Economic Growth Slightly Up in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product
(GDP) was slightly up in the first quarter of the year for the
15-nation European Union, Eurostat reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based statistical bureau of the European
communities said that the EU GDP rose by 0.6 percent in the
January-March period, compared with the fourth quarter of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product for the 11-nation euro zone
increased by 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat attributed the slight increase to rises in gross fixed
capital formation -- 2.5 percent for the European Union and 2.1
percent for the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
Private consumption also continued a "relatively good trend"
with a 0.7-percent increase in both the EU and euro zone,
according to Eurostat.
</P>
<P>
Trade surplus for the EU, however, fell to account for 1.9
percent of GDP compared with 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter
last year.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat said that the fall was caused by a "quasi-stagnation"
of exports. EU exports grew by 0.2 percent compared with 1.3
percent for the fourth quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, imports grew by 2.1 percent compared with 2.0
percent in the fourth quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat reported a good news for the euro zone by stating that
its trade surplus still accounted for 2.7 percent of its GDP
despite a 0.6-percentage-point drop.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Reiterates Opposition to Cyprus Missile Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will not allow the
Cypriot government to deploy the Russian-made S-300 missiles on
the divided island, Turkish State Minister Sukru Sina Gurel said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the semi-official Anatolia News Agency, Gurel
said there was no change in Turkey's position on the
controversial missile plan.
</P>
<P>
His words came only one day before U.S. State Department
Special Coordinator for Cyprus Thomas Miller's visit to
Ankara. "We perceive the missiles as a threat and all necessary
countermeasures are being taken," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a deal with Russia early last year to buy the
surface-to-air missile system, triggering harsh reaction from
Turkish Cypriots and Turkey, who has vowed to take pre-emptive
measures to prevent its deployment.
</P>
<P>
Last week, it was announced that the S-300 missiles would
arrive in the divided island within three months for deployment.
</P>
<P>
Gurel said the missile plan is not a bargaining chip for the
Greek Cypriots in the south, and Turkey will not move an inch
backward from its position.
</P>
<P>
Miller's mediation is considered crucial to the thorny problem
since Cypriot President Glafkos Clerides and Greek Prime Minister
Costas Simitis are scheduled to fix a final date for the
deployment next week.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy, during his visit, is expected to meet Gurel and
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem on Tuesday and Deputy Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As one party of the S-300 issue, Russia has repeatedly stated
that it will go ahead with the deal which it describes as a normal
arms contract between two sovereign states.
</P>
<P>
Turkey landed troops and took over the the northern third of
Cyprus in July 1974 when the Greek Cypriot military officers
attempted to seek union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The island remained divided into the internationally recognized
the Republic of Cyprus in the south and the self-declared
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in the north, which is
recognized only by Turkey.

<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Zine Al-Abedine
Ben Ali held talks Monday in Tripoli, capital of Libya, with
Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi to discuss boosting bilateral
cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed ways of boosting trade and economic
cooperation as well as issues related to the Maghreb (Arab
Western) countries and other international issues of common
concern, the Tunisia Africa News Agency (TANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
They expressed satisfaction with the results of the dialog and
consultation on ways of consolidating interaction and integration
between the two neighboring countries and peoples, TANA quoted a
Tunisian presidential spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
They underscored the importance of implementing the
integration agreements and joint development projects and
promoting the bilateral trade, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Ben Ali called for further enhancing of the
joint investment projects to serve the common interests of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Tunis' support for the Libyan efforts to reach a
fair settlement with the Western countries on the Lockerbie affair
so to achieve an early lifting of the U.N. embargo on Libya.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has imposed an air embargo on Libya six years ago
to force Libya to hand over two men accused of plotting the 1988
bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, which
killed 270 people on board.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian leader reiterated that Tunis always supports the
Arab solidarity and rapprochement among all Arab brothers to unify
their positions in the face of current challenges, the spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ali arrived in Tripoli this afternoon to inquire about the
health of Gaddafi, who has recently undergone a surgery on his
left femur.

<HEADLINE> Four African Defense Ministers Discuss Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Defense ministers from Namibia,
Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe met here Monday in a bid to find a
solution to the deepening crisis in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) where the minority Tutsi rebels are trying to oust
the government.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held at the Zimbabwean army headquarters, did not
however reach a conclusion or find a solution to the crisis, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from the above-mentioned nations are
expected to join the defense ministers meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the meeting said the defense ministers would only
make recommendations on the matter Tuesday after a briefing by
the foreign ministers who are on a mission in Rwanda and Uganda.
The foreign ministers are trying to check on embattled Kabila's
allegations that the revolt against him was being backed by the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
"What the foreign ministers are going to bring to the meeting
in terms of their findings is what would form the basis of the
talks and recommendations that would be made to heads of states
to find a lasting solution to the deepening crisis," one source
who attended Monday's meeting said.
</P>
<P>
"The Kabila government may fall if it is not given the full
support it deserves by the SADC (Southern African Development
Community) or the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) states," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was a follow-up to the one attended by seven
African heads of states held two weeks ago in Zimbabwe's resort
Victoria Falls town to find a possible solution to the crisis in
the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Defense Minister Moven Mahachi said Tuesday's
meeting, to be attended by all SADC defense ministers, was an
ordinary intra-state defense and security meeting to discuss
problems facing the region.
</P>
<P>
He denied allegations that Zimbabwe was arming the Kabila
army, dismissing reports that Zimbabwe had sent an unspecified
number of jet fighters to the central African country.
</P>
<P>
"Those rumours are false, they are not true," said Mahachi in
response to questions by local reporters.
</P>
<P>
Laurent Kabila seized power from Mobutu Sese Seko last year
with the help of the rebelling Tutsi soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Central Asian Leaders Discuss Afghan Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of Kazakhstan,
Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan on Monday voiced their
support of a foreign and defense ministers' meeting in Tashkent on
Afghanistan in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached in telephone conversations between
Tajik President Nursultan Nazarbayev and Uzbek President Islam
Karimov, Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev and Tajik President Emomali
Rakhmonov, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The four leaders were "unanimous in the opinion that the
military conflict in Afghanistan must be discussed in detail from
the point of view of stepping up security in Central Asia,"
Interfax quoted Nazarbayev's press service as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, first
deputy chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces,
said top officials of the Russian Defense Ministry believe that
hostilities in Afghanistan may spill to other neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken certain steps" to respond to the situation as it
develops in Afghanistan, Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
"Under the Collective Security Treaty, Russia will look after
the Commonwealth of Independent States borders.
</P>
<P>
"We must be prepared to prevent and, if necessary, counter the
radical development of the situation in the region," Interfax
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, he also called on the parties to exhaust political
means to settle the conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Everything must be done to end the bloodshed in Afghanistan.
Talks attended by both the conflicting parties and all countries
interested in stability are the key to the solution," Manilov
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 17 (Xinhua) -- An Angolan envoy of President
Eduardo dos Santos delivered Monday a special message to
Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe on the situation in Angola which
has been embroiled in civil war since 1975.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters after meeting with Mugabe, Jose Leitao, the
minister in the Angolan president's office, said the situation in
Angola was very serious as the rebel UNITA (National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola) movement was refusing to abide
by the 1994 Lusaka peace protocol.
</P>
<P>
"The current situation is extremely tense since UNITA, by
refusing to abide by the Lusaka protocol, is upholding its
strategy to establish conditions to go back to war and this is of
serious concern to us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Leitao warned the Jonas Savimbi-led UNITA that the government
would "retaliate sooner or later" whatever path the rebel
movement would take to destabilize the nation.
</P>
<P>
Leitao, who was accompanied by Angolan Deputy Foreign Minister
Joe Miranda, urged some African countries to stop arming and
supporting UNITA.
</P>
<P>
A truce between the Angolan government and UNITA brokered by
Zambia in 1994 has been violated by UNITA on several occasions
with reports last month saying the rebel movement had massacred
hundreds of people in the country.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Senate Endorses Controversial Press Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Senate on Monday gave its
endorsement to a controversial press and publications law, which
has been criticized as a government attempt to restrict press
freedom, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives passed the draft law on August
9. The draft will not go into effect until it is approved by King
Hussein, the ultimate authority in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, fines ranging from 5,000 Jordan dinars (more
than 7,000 U.S. dollars) to 10,000 dinars (over 14,000 dollars)
will be imposed on journalists who violate provisions of state
security, and social and economic stability.
</P>
<P>
Fines will also apply to journalists who publish reports
considered disparaging to the king, his family, world leaders, the
Jordanian army as well as on crimes and cases under investigation
or before court.
</P>
<P>
The law demands that a weekly newspaper have a registered
capital of no less than 100,000 dinars (over 140,000 dollars)
before it begins publication.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has more than 20 weekly newspapers, most of which are
believed to be unable to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
While the law was debated in the parliament, strong protests
against it were staged by the press, professional associations and
opposition parties, which accused the government of killing press
freedom.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Stock Market Rocked by Russian Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Russian financial crisis
rocked Turkey's Istanbul Stock Exchange Monday, causing a sharp
fall in share prices.
</P>
<P>
The National-100 index plunged 5.47 percent, or 181.31 points,
to close at 3,170.61 points, with the turnover reaching 258
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This fall was triggered by Russia's announcement that it would
permit the ruble to devalue by 50 percent against the U.S. dollar,
halt payment on government treasury bonds and impose a 90-day
moratorium on payments of foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
The Istanbul stock market is especially sensitive to Russia's
financial situation due to the closer economic link between
Turkey and Russia, financial experts said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Turkish companies doing business in Russia would
suffer heavy economic loss because of the financial crisis there.
</P>
<P>
Okan Oguz, president of the Turkish Exports Assembly, urged
the government to take emergency measures, including devaluing the
Turkish currency lira to bolster the country's exports.
</P>
<P>
Some leading businessmen are concerned that orders will
decline sharply from Russia and other former Soviet republics
which have maintained close economic ties with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Conflicting views were expressed Monday about the future of
the Turkish stock market.
</P>
<P>
Some brokers predicted that the drop in share prices would
continue for another two or three weeks while others said the
market would recover after a short time.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The President of Burkina Faso and
current chairman of the Organization of African Unity, Blaise
Compaore Monday expressed his worry over ongoing conflicts in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Compaore, who arrived in Accra, capital of Ghana, Monday, for
a three-day visit, said the current stability that African
countries are enjoying could be eroded if the pockets of
conflicts in some parts of the continent are not resolved
immediately.
</P>
<P>
"Even though Ghana and Burkina Faso are now enjoying both
political and economic stability, there is no way this could be
sustained if their neighbors are embroiled in conflict," Compaore
said upon his arrival.
</P>
<P>
He urged African leaders to work closely to ensure full
political and economic development of the continent, according to
a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Compaore is accompanied by a 34-member ministerial and
business delegation, which will exploit business opportunities in
the areas of transport, energy, commerce, agriculture and water
resources, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chairman said he will use the opportunity as current
chairman of the organization to learn and share ideas with
Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings to help solve the problems of
the continent.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings mentioned in particular the insurrection in the
Democratic Republic of Congo and Guinea Bissau which, he said,
needed urgent diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
Even Ghana itself, which has been relatively calm in recent
years, is not completely immune to the seemingly unending
conflicts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
It was just on Sunday that a Togolese opposition group led an
armed attack from the Ghanaian territory to a border point on the
Togolese side of the border.

Asked at the noon briefing if the U.N. chief has any plan to

UNITED NATIONS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations should not focus on the outcome of the current
situation and should look at the roots of the Iraq's seven-year

Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's permanent representative to the United

inspection.
</P>

Speaking to reporters, Hamdoon said the United Nations Special

years.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said Iraq would like to see some acts from the
Security Council regarding to the current standoff.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
both reported to the president of the Security Council last week
that Iraq blocked in a wide range their mandate in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on August 5 announced its decision to suspend its
cooperation with the UNSCOM and the IAEA, a move branded by the
council as totally unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
The council is meeting now on replies to the letters by the
UNSCOM and the IAEA.

LUANDA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Prime Minister Fernando
Jose Van-Dunem met here Monday with a Russian ministerial
delegation led by Defense Minister Igor Sergueev and expressed
the hope that bilateral ties on military science and technology
be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
The visit this June to Russia by Angolan President Eduardo dos
Santos has turned a new chapter on bilateral relations, said
Van-Dunem. The Angolan prime minsiter wishes that such relations
be promoted by Igor Sergueev's visit, especially in the fields of
military technology and economy and finance.
</P>
<P>
Voicing his agreement, Sergueev said, "Currently cooperation
in military technology should be a priority and an engine for
bilateral economic relations."
</P>
<P>
The Russian delegation arrived in Luanda Monday morning for a
24-hour working visit. Also in the delegation were ministers of
energy, natural resources and fisheries. They will hold separate
meetings with their Angolan counterparts and sign cooperation
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Defense Minister Pedro Sebastiao has given up his
meeting scheduled in Harare, capital of Zimbabwe, Monday
afternoon with defense ministers from the Democratic republic of
Congo and Namibia, and held private talks with Sergueev on the
current tension in Angola and bilateral military ties.
</P>
<P>
Angola had close relations with the former Soviet Union. But
at present, the debt issue has been the main problem in military
cooperation between the two countries with Angola owing to Russia
two billion U.S. Dollars, of which most had been used to to buy
Soviet weapons.

Uganda be liberated from the bondage of hunger and poverty, she
said.
</P>
<P>
She also condemned those who kidnap, maim children, destroy
property and kill innocent people, accusing them of doing a
disservice to this nation.
</P>
<P>
All Ugandans should promote a spirit of true reconciliation
and look at others as brothers and sisters so as to collectively
shape a better future for posterity, she said.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Delegation in Guinea Bissau for Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A delegation from the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) arrived in
Guinea-Bissau Monday in an effort to end a fighting between the
government and rebels there.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here Monday said the delegation led by
Ivorian Foreign Minister Amara Essy went straight to the
presidential palace to meet representatives of the Guinea Bissau
government and was expected to meet army rebels.
</P>
<P>
Essy told reporters that the delegation was aimed at
consolidating a ceasefire negotiated by members of the Community
of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP) on July 26 and,
encouraging both sides to hold talks in order to settle their
disputes.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued in Nigerian capital Abuja last Friday said
that the talks would be a follow-up to meetings in Bissau on
August 8 involving the government and rebels.
</P>
<P>
Both the ECOWAS and the CPLP have tried to play down
suggestions of rivalry between them in securing an end to the
fighting erupted in the west African country on June 7.
</P>
<P>
The report said it was unclear whether Guinea Bissau
government officials would take part in peace talks sponsored by
the CPLP to be held in the Cape Verde Islands on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The military wing of the ECOWAS dominated by Nigerian soldiers
has already agreed to send troops to Guinea Bissau to undertake
mediation as it did in Liberia and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
But the rebels of the Atlantic seaboard state want a military
buffer force as part of the truce agreement, to be sent by CPLP
states because, the rebels claimed, ECOWAS members Senegal and
Guinea are already involved in the conflict on the side of the
government.
</P>
<P>
The fighting between the government and rebels occurred after
Guinea Bissau President Joao Bernardo Viera sacked former armed
forces commander Brigadier Ansumane Mane over accusations of arms
smuggling to rebels in neighboring Senegal.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Shilling Recovers from Slide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Shilling regained
some of the ground lost against the U.S. Dollar in light trading
ahead of last weekend, according to a Standard Chartered Bank
bulletin issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decline earlier was precipitated by the August 7 bomb
blast hitting the Kenyan capital, coupled with panic-buying by
importers and settlement of large trade finance bills, said the
bulletin.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, stock brokers at the Nairobi Stock Exchange have
expressed frustration at the stalemate between the striking bank
staff and their employers, saying the crisis would discourage
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The Central Organization of Trade Unions (COTU) asked all
striking bank workers to return to work immediately following
their demonstration Monday outside the Kenyan Treasury building
in which 22 people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
The bankers' strike was called to protest against government
plans to tax interest-free or low-interest loans available to
bank staff. Employers then sacked the striking bank workers.
</P>
<P>
On equities, turnover at the Nairobi Stock Exchange rose
Monday, with a total of 387,200 shares worth 16.8 million
Shillings traded, from 146,200 shares valued at 5.4 million
Shillings dealt last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Commercial and services counters led with 186,600 shares,
which represented 48 percent of the day's traded volume.
</P>
<P>
The industrial and allied sector had 132,400 shares, which
accounted for 34 percent of the day's trading.
</P>
<P>
Finance and investment counters moved 54,300 shares, while the
agricultural sector sold 13,700 shares, which accounted for 14
percent and four percent of the day's traded volume respectively.

<HEADLINE> Two People Killed by Dogs in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A woman and her son were killed
by a pack of dogs on a remote island in Canada's east coast
province of Newfoundland, said reports Monday.
</P>
<P>
The mother and son were picking berries Sunday on Zacharias
Island when they were attacked by eight sled dogs.
</P>
<P>
The woman was swarmed and killed by the dogs just a few meters
away from her common-law husband and two boys, who defended
themselves with sticks, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Later, her 10-year-old son went down toward their boat to get
matches to build a fire to keep the dogs away from her remains.
</P>
<P>
"Then the gentleman realized that the dogs had left the area.
He ran down to the beach area where he discovered that the dogs
had attacked and killed the 10-year-old boy there," police was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is common practice for dog owners on the island to let their
animals roam free.
</P>
<P>
"Usually when you approach the island with a boat, the dogs
will come running because they will just naturally assume that
there's food coming for them," police said.
</P>
<P>
Later, police returned to the island and destroyed the dogs,
the reports said.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Unscathed by Russia's Devaluation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Share prices in major European
stock markets were left unscathed by Russia's devaluation on
Monday, as they relied on a Wall Street rebound and recorded
modest gains.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index in London finished the day 12.2 points
higher at 5467.2. The volume of shares traded was relatively light
with 640.5m shares traded, while the Footsie briefly dipped below
support at the 5400-level.
</P>
<P>
The morning's slump was caused by the decision of the Russian
government to effectively devalue the rouble, restructure its
domestic debt and introduce some special capital controls to ward
off speculators.
</P>
<P>
But then a Wall Street rally provided enough support to help
the the London market close with a modest gain. However, it was
not a clear running, and many had expected larger losses "when S&AMP;P
futures were looking very wobbly at one stage," according to
market analysts.
</P>
<P>
Things didn't improve until Wall Street avoided the temptation
to selloff, aided particularly by gains in DuPont, amid reports of
European interest in its Conoco energy unit.
</P>
<P>
With the Dow relatively stable, attention will now swing again
to Asia, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's devaluation cast a cloud over Frankfurt, as German
banks are considered heavily exposed to Russia, accounting for 42
percent of all private bank loans to the country. But consequent
dollar strength helped mitigate the bearishness as did an early
rally on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The floor-traded DAX index closed at 5,456.58 points, up 8.68
or 0.16 percent points, staging a big rebound towards the close as
Wall Street embarked on an early rally.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC-40 index closed down 14.02 points at 3980.89,
recovering from earlier lows. Investors are worried about the
impact the rouble devaluation will have on Germany and the
indirect consequences Germany's ills will have on France,
according to analysts.
