<HEADLINE> UK's Productivity Is Still Uncompetitive, Says Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 19 (Xinhua) - Despite years of privatizing,
delayering and downsizing, Britain's productivity performance
remains poor compared with its competitors, according to a study
published Monday.
</P>
<P>
The UK was outperformed by the United States, France, Germany
and Japan in almost all sectors of the economy - from the service
sector to manufacturing, the research finds.
</P>
<P>
The report published by the Economic &AMP; Social Research Council,
asserts that unit labor costs in the mid-1990s were substantially
below those of France, Germany and Japan, at 40 percent, 30
percent and 95 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that labor productivity levels in the UK in the
1950s were above those in France and Germany, although below those
in the US.
</P>
<P>
The UK also has serious shortcomings in terms of the skills of
its workers. It has proportionately fewer graduates than the US
and falls far behind Germany in intermediate vocational
qualifications, the report says.
</P>
<P>
However as the higher capital investment of its competitors is
taken into account, Britain fell behind in terms of productivity
by only 10 to 15 percent, although the gaps in some sectors,
notably manufacturing and most service activities, remained large.
</P>
<P>
The only positive conclusion by the report is that Britain's
decline relative to its main European competitors appears to have
halted.

<HEADLINE> Increased Business Failures in UK Bring Call for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 19 (Xinhua) - The number of business failures
in Britain increased in the third quarter, prompting one of
Britain's leading accountancy firms to call for a further rate cut
following quarter point cut October 8.
</P>
<P>
Research by KPMG shows the number of companies going into
receivership rising 14 percent in the three months to September.
</P>
<P>
Mike Wheeler, head of corporate recovery for KPMG, said: "A
continued slowdown of high street sales and low inflation figures
should make it easy for the Bank of England to cut interest rates
further..."
</P>
<P>
Almost half Britain's marketing managers expect to miss sales
targets this year because of the economic slowdown, says a report
Monday from the Chartered Institute of Marketing.
</P>
<P>
Another report from Dun &AMP; Bradstreet, the business information
group, shows confidence among 1500 of its clients has dropped to
the lowest level since the end of 1992.
</P>
<P>
The latest quarterly analysis of profit warnings produced by
Ernst &AMP; Young's corporate recovery practice shows 86 companies
were added to the list in the third quarter compared with 75 in
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Roger Lyons, general secretary of MSF, the science and
manufacturing union, called on Sunday for immediate action.
</P>
<P>
He accused the Monetary Policy Committee of "behaving like
ostriches, burying their heads in the sand, ignoring the advice of
unions, employers and economic commentators that industry needed
interest rate cuts and not increases".

<P>
CAIRO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Gulf Cooperation Council states have agreed to
provide 35 percent of the capital for the first phase of a planned
unified power grid.
</P>
<P>
United Arab Emirates Minister of Electricity and Water Humaid
Nasser al-Owais said in Dubai on Sunday that the remaining 65
percent of the cost will be covered through bank loans.
</P>
<P>
Al-Owais said the total cost of the first phase is estimated at
1.1 billion U.S. dollars to link the power networks of Bahrain,
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Executive Manager of the Saudi-U.S. Business Council
Medlig Al Medlig has said the United States has invested 7 billion
dollars in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Al Medlig said the U.S. investment account for more than half
of the foreign investments in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
He added that the U.S. is also the main trade partner of Saudi
Arabia. The trade volume between the two countries stood at 15.4
billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili
has said that Egypt and Turkey are making joint efforts to
increase the trade volume to 1 billion dollars from last year's
700 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gowaili said the goal will be attained due to the facilities
extended by the two countries to encourage trade and the positive
results of the implementation of a free trade zone agreement.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Al Akhbar daily Monday quoted him as saying that
agreements on avoidance of double taxation, investment guarantee
and technical and technological cooperation will lead to a big
stride in the economic relations, mutual investments and trade.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes U.S. Envoy's Remark on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has welcomed a
U.S. envoy's statement blaming Turkish Cypriots for the deadlock
in finding a settlement to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
U.S. envoy for Cyprus, Richard Holbrooke's comments are
"correct" and they "touch the core of the issue," Government
Spokesman Christos Stylianides told reporters Monday at his press
briefing.
</P>
<P>
In an interview Sunday with the Greek newspaper "To Vima",
published in Athens, Holbrooke said he expects no progress in the
Cyprus problem at this stage because the Turkish Cypriot side has
no intention of changing its positions.
</P>
<P>
He also explained that he interrupted his mediating effort in
May because of this position adopted by the Turkish Cypriot side,
but added that he would continue to be in touch with the leaders
of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities.
</P>
<P>
"It appears that the U.S. are apportioning blame on Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash for the deadlock in efforts to settle
the Cyprus question," Stylianides said.
</P>
<P>
"We would like the world community and specifically the U.S. to
exert more pressure to bring about a shift in the intransigent
position of the Turkish side, which the U.S. considers as an
obstacle to a comprehensive settlement in Cyprus," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia. The Turkish Cypriots
unilaterally declared a republic in norther Cyprus in 1983, which
is only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus peace talks have remained deadlocked since Denktash
walked out of U.N.-sponsored direct talks between the two
community leaders in Switzerland a year ago to protest against a
European Union decision to start accession talks with the Cypriot
government.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-led international community has been trying for
decades to reunite the island through a bizonal, bicommunal
federation formula, but so far no tangible results have been
achieved.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fighting Breaks out in Guinea Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting has broken out in
the capital of Guinea Bissau between government forces and rebels
soldiers holding different parts of the city, the British
Broadcasting Corporation said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted diplomats in Bissau as saying that sporadic
shooting which began Sunday had degenerated into sustained
exchanges of rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons
fire.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of refugees are reported to be heading to the east
and lining the shoreline as they seek shelter on offshore
islands.
</P>
<P>
The government has accused rebels of breaking the ceasefire
agreed by both sides in late August, brokered by the Community of
Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP) and the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
The crisis in Guinea Bissau started in June when soldiers led
by sacked Chief of Army Staff General Ansumane Mane rebelled
against President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
</P>
<P>
Mane was sacked by Vieira because of the involvement of senior
army officers in the armed revolt.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had been due to sign a new ceasefire agreement
Monday, the report said.

<HEADLINE> WHO Launches Campaign to Combat Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) Monday launched a global campaign that aims to reduce the
global cancer cases by five million a year by 2020.
</P>
<P>
The WHO, announcing the campaign at an international conference
in London, said it also plan to cut the death toll from 10 million
to six million a year.
</P>
<P>
The campaign aims to "considerably reduce" cancer at a low cost,
said professor Karol Sikora, the chief of the WHO Cancer Program.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that, by the year 2020, there will be 20
million new cancer patients each year, with 70 percent of them
living in the developing countries and having less than five
percent of the treatment resources.
</P>
<P>
The soaring cases of cancer around the world is due to rapidly
aging populations in most countries, the WHO said.
</P>
<P>
The strategies of the WHO's cancer program are aimed to call on
governments to negotiate with private firms to set up national
cancer programs with clear priorities for care.
</P>
<P>
The priorities could include tobacco control, infection control
and promotion of healthy eating. They could also ensure the
availability of basic cancer surgery, radiotherapy and
chemotherapy as well as specialist nurse education.
</P>
<P>
"We could potentially prevent a quarter of all cancer simply by
applying existing knowledge," said professor Sikora.
</P>
<P>
He added that a third of current cases are curable with modern
technology and this could rise to a half over the next 25 years if
action is taken now.

<HEADLINE> 24 Coup Convicts to Be Executed in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-four officers and
soldiers convicted of involvement in the May 1997 coup will be
executed in Sierra Leone Monday, the British Broadcasting
Corporation said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted official sources as saying that their
execution order has been signed by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah
and that 24 coffins had been made and graves dug in preparation.
</P>
<P>
The executions would be the first death sentences carried out
in connection with the coup in 1997 that overthrew elected
President Kabbah, who was reinstated last March by the
Nigerian-led west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Though Major Johnny Paul Koroma who emerged the new leader
after the coup was driven out of Freetown in February, he and his
men have been since engaged in a guerrilla warfare against the
ECOMOG in the mountainous areas in northern and eastern Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
The 24 persons to be executed are among the 34 members of the
armed forces sentenced to death last week by a military court for
treason in connection with the coup.
</P>
<P>
The other 10, all officers, have reportedly had their
sentences commuted to life imprisonment.

<HEADLINE> Irish Government Urged to Spend More on Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government Monday was
urged to put more of its financial surpluses to fund transport,
utilities and telecommunication infrastructure, according to press
reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Ireland's economy is set to grow by around 10 percent this year
but its roads, rail and public transport system have yet to catch
up with demand.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Business and Employers Confederation (IBEC) said in a
statement issued in Dublin: "This is the most prudent way of
exploiting Ireland's current extraordinary growth. IBEC recommends
the establishment of an economic infrastructural fund to harness
some of the current tax buoyancy."
</P>
<P>
IBEC statement also called on the government to keep public
spending under control, maintain low inflation, consider tax cuts
for the lower paid, extra spending on training and capital
allowances for businesses providing childcare facilities.
</P>
<P>
The Dublin government announced early this month it expected a
budget surplus of around 800 million Irish punts (about 920
million U.S. dollars) at the end of his year.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Threatens Penalty on Free-Riders After Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- In the aftermath of a deadly
train accident, Egypt's transportation minister said Monday that
those who hitch a free ride on the train roof will face severe
punishment in the future.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Transportation and Communication Soliman Metwalli
Soliman made the remarks while inspecting the scene of the train
crash which has killed 53 people and injured 150 others. Rescue
teams ended their search for survivors Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The train, which was traveling south from Egyptian northern
port city of Alexandria, derailed and crashed into a square in
Kafr al Dawar, a town about 30 kilometers southeast of Alexandria
at 5:10 p.m. local time (1510 GMT) Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry said in a statement that the driver lost
control of the train when he changed tracks at high speed because
the brakes between the locomotive and the carriages were broken by
some hitchhikers on the train.
</P>
<P>
Those free-riding passengers on the roof of the train and
between the carriages will be subjected to "strict punishment" in
the future, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Railway Authority Mahmoud Marei, who was also on
the site, said the train's engineer was unable to stop the train
when he used the brakes, because the air tanks operating them had
been damaged.
</P>
<P>
Michel Fahmy Ibrahim, the engineer who died in the accident,
was driving at a speed of 80 kilometers per hour before pulling
into the Kafr al Dawer station, according to an official
Alexandria prosecution source.
</P>
<P>
The train's recording tape is in prosecution custody for
further investigation, the source added.
</P>
<P>
The movement of trains was affected only for half an hour by
Sunday's accident, a senior railways official said Monday. Damage
is estimated at about 500,000 Egyptian pounds (147,000
U.S. dollars), he added.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa al-Thani Monday sent a
cable of condolences to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak over the
victims of the accident.
</P>
<P>
It is not uncommon in Egypt for people to hitch a ride on the
roof and between the carriages of such commuter trains.
</P>
<P>
The train crashed through a wall beside the railway, hit a war
memorial in the square and slammed into seven shops, witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
Nabih Yousef Shaltout, head of health care in the local
province of Buheira, said most of the dead were bystanders in the
town, while most of the injured were passengers on the train.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian railway suffered a series of accidents in recent
years. Three weeks ago, a driver and his assistant were killed
when their train bumped into a truck on the Alexandria-Cairo line.
</P>
<P>
The most deadly was in December 1995 when two trains collided
in fog south of Cairo, killing 75 people and injuring 76 others.

<HEADLINE> INTERPOL Conference to Discuss Strategy for Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Members of the International
Criminal Police Commission (INTERPOL) will convene here Thursday
to discuss the organization's strategy for the coming century.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based INTERPOL is an international grouping of
criminal police aimed at developing a system to prevent and
prohibit crimes within its 188 member states.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the INTERPOL General Assembly last year
gave Egypt the approval to host the event in appreciation of its
strong stance against any criminal act.
</P>
<P>
Egypt beat Australia, Korea and Greece in competition to host
the event.
</P>
<P>
The six-day INTERPOL meetings are to deal with a number of
topics including the development of fight against criminal gangs
and efforts to confront international terrorism and organized
crime.
</P>
<P>
This would be the first time for Egypt to host meetings of the
INTERPOL, which was set up in Vienna, Austria in 1923 with only
seven countries in its membership then.
</P>
<P>
Habib Al-Adly, Egypt's interior minister and chief-delegate to
the 67th Conference of the INTERPOL General Assembly, will address
the inaugural session of the meeting on Thursday, the Middle East
News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Adly will stress Egypt's cooperation with various international
organizations in the anti-crime field, and underline the
importance of exchanging information, extraditing criminals and
international cooperation in pursuit of terrorists and criminals.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Rebels in Sierra Leone to Lay Down Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday strongly condemned the executions, torture,
mutilations, rapes, looting and other acts of barbarism carried
out by former junta elements in Sierra Leone and urged them to lay
down their arms and surrender.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report on the situation in Sierra Leone, Annan
said he was outraged by the senseless acts of terror perpetrated
against children, such as the amputation of limbs of boys and
girls as young as six years of age, and supported the efforts to
bring to justice the authors of these especially abhorrent crimes.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the long-term stability of the country would depend
vitally on the successful implementation of he disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration program adopted by the
Government of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief reiterated his plea for the international
community to lend every possible assistance to the Government in
carrying out its plan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the continuing commitment of the Economic Community
of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) had been
essential in assisting the Government of Sierra Leone to restore
peace and security throughout the country, Annan welcomed the
efforts by ECOMOG to deploy additional troops in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Africa to Give More Attention to Internally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A two-day workshop on
internal displacement in Africa is being held here at the United
Nations Conference Center here.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, jointly organized by the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR), is aimed to focus on internal displacement in Africa and
identify ways to tackle the problem at regional level.
</P>
<P>
The problem of internal displacement is one of the most
challenging problems now facing the world, especially in Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to Francis M. Deng, representative of the
U.N.Secretary-General on internally displaced persons, Africa,
with an estimated internally displaced population of 20 million,
is by far the worst affected region.
</P>
<P>
The number of internally displaced people in Africa is more
than twice that of African refugees who escaped their original
countries.
</P>
<P>
At least 15 African countries are facing the problems of
internal displacement. According to the UNHCR, there are about
four million internally displaced people in the Sudan, over one
million in Angola, about half a million in Burundi, Sierra Leone
and Liberia respectively.
</P>
<P>
Unlike people who cross a border and have an international
refugee system to turn to, those uprooted in their own countries
have no assured source of protection or assistance.
</P>
<P>
Many of those internally displaced are beset by hunger,
disease and inadequate shelter. Large numbers can be found in
camps and settlements, but substantial numbers also crowd into
urban areas where tremendous pressure is placed on social
services, water and sanitation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, OAU Assistant Secretary-general
Daniel Antonio noted: "The internally displaced persons live in
very miserable conditions. In some cases, the conditions of such
displaced persons are worse than those of refugees."
</P>
<P>
It is noteworthy that a large proportion of the internally
displaced are women and children. Large numbers of displaced
children are separated from their families or orphaned.
</P>
<P>
The issue of displaced persons poses great problems to the
countries concerned. Since many of the African countries
affected are among the poorest in the world, they are least
equipped to deal with the problems.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the workshop called on the international
community, including the United Nations and regional
organizations, to bring pressure on warring parties and make more
efforts for resolution of the conflicts in Africa which have
been the rootcause of a large number of displaced people in
the continent.
</P>
<P>
They also urged humanitarian organizations to respond more
consistently and rapidly to protect and assist the displaced.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that Africans must play a more active role in
addressing the problems in their own region.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fighting Breaks out in Guinea Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting has broken out in
the capital of Guinea Bissau between government forces and rebels
soldiers holding different parts of the city, the British
Broadcasting Corporation said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted diplomats in Bissau as saying that sporadic
shooting which began Sunday had degenerated into sustained
exchanges of rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons
fire.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of refugees are reported to be heading to the east
and lining the shoreline as they seek shelter on offshore
islands.
</P>
<P>
The government has accused rebels of breaking the ceasefire
agreed by both sides in late August, brokered by the Community of
Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP) and the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
The crisis in Guinea Bissau started in June when soldiers led
by sacked Chief of Army Staff General Ansumane Mane rebelled
against President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
</P>
<P>
Mane was sacked by Vieira because of the involvement of senior
army officers in the arms smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had been due to sign a new ceasefire agreement
Monday, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Extends Loans to Lebanon for Road Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Monday agreed to
grant Lebanon loans of 40 million U.S. dollars to help fund a
large road construction project in the country, the official
National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Badr al-Hamid, Chairman of the Kuwaiti National Fund for
Economic Development (NFED), and Nabil Jisr, President of Lebanese
Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR), signed the
agreement here on behalf of their governments.
</P>
<P>
The loans, repayable on a 20-year-old period, will be used to
fund part of the construction of the five-kilometer-long
al-Wuzaia Road connecting the capital with southern areas.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the total cost for the road, which is due
to be completed before April, 2000, is about 100 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Following the signing ceremony, al-Hamid told reporters that
the Kuwaiti fund is proud of being the first foreign organization
to provide aid for Lebanon's post-war reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the 15-year-old civil war in 1990, Lebanon has
embarked on a multi-billion dollars drive aimed at rebuilding the
crisis-ridden national economy, especially the war-devastated
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to sign a new agreement with Lebanese government
in the first half of next year in a bid to fund another road
project, which will connect Lebanon's northern coastal city of
Tripoli and the Syrian border," Hamid added.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Jisr thanked the Kuwaiti government for its
continued efforts to help Lebanon's reconstruction process.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, Lebanon has received 331 million dollars in loans
and grants from the Kuwaiti government and the NFED.
</P>
<P>
Jisr said that negotiations between Lebanon and Kuwait on
cooperation to construct more roads in the rest of the country
are still continuing.

<HEADLINE> Relations between Moldova and Romania Get Warmer: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A juridical framework,
allowing to more efficiently value all possibilities to intensify
the relations between the Republic of Moldova and Romania, as well
as the summits, most frequent lately, have largely contributed to
boost the cooperation between the two countries, the Moldovan
Prime Minister Ion Ciubuc Monday said in Chisinau.
</P>
<P>
Ion Ciubuc made the remark in his meeting with the Romanian
Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu, who is currently attending the 8th
joint work meeting of the Committees for the relations between the
two countries. "The relations between our countries have become
warmer, which gives us hope for the future," Ciubuc said.
</P>
<P>
The Moldovan Prime Minister found it appropriate for the
meeting to take place ahead of the one between Presidents Petru
Lucinschi and Emil Constantinescu, due in Chisinau, over October
22-23, on the occasion of the Trilateral Republic of
Moldova-Romania-Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu told the press after the
meeting that problems of the bilateral relations and their
international context, as well as the two countries's economic
difficulties were approached. "It is important for the ones that
are able to cooperate, to support and to help each other in this
respect," he said.
</P>
<P>
Plesu stressed the necessity for both parties to make efforts
to boost mutual investments.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Church Leader Calls for Debt Relief for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Evangelical
Church Mekane-Yesus has launched a nationwide campaign to have
poor countries relieved of their debt burden, the Ethiopian News
Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Reverend Yadesa Daba, president of the
church, as saying that Africa and other Third-World countries are
suffering heavy debt burdens which resulted in loss of security
for life.
</P>
<P>
Africa alone owes the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) 227.2 billion Dollars, Rev. Yadesa said. The
nation-wide campaign launched by the church demands the
cancellation of the debt in the year 2000, he added.
</P>
<P>
The campaign has already begun by signing a petition, said
Yadesa, who called on all religious institutions, governmental
and non-governmental organizations as well as concerned parties
to join hands in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Every African child, youth, adult and elderly takes as his
share 379 Dollars of the debt the continent owes to the
borrowers, he said.
</P>
<P>
For every Dollar Africa receives in development relief, it
pays 1.31 Dollars in debt servicing, Rev. Yadesa noted,
therefore, Africa is virtually receiving no aid at all.
</P>
<P>
The people of Africa are suffering from lack of sufficient
food, clothing, education, shelter, health care and other social
services.
</P>
<P>
The church president urged the international community at
large to press the international monetary institutions for the
cancellation of the debts of Africa and other poor countries of
the world before the year 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 19 (Xinhua) -- For the sake of the interests of
the country Russian President Boris Yeltsin will not resign ahead
of time, presidential first deputy chief of staff Oleg Sysuyev
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Ekho Moskvy radio station Sysuyev said
that in response to the numerous calls for the president's
resignation Yeltsin "clearly" stated that he will work until 2000
for the sake of calm and stability in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Asked why Yeltsin did not appear in the Kremlin today, Sysuyev
said that "it is nothing unusual, simply his doctors managed to
persuade the president not to go to the Kremlin today."
</P>
<P>
He believed the president is in working condition and doctors
have no doubts that he will be able to discharge his duties until
the end of this term.
</P>
<P>
According to Sysuyev, Yeltsin is working on the documents
before his trip to Vienna and has already had several contacts
with some Russian and foreign leaders.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was confident that presidential elections will
take place in 2000 and cited the appearance of numerous candidates
for presidency as "convincing proof" of his point.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was reelected as the Russian president in July 1996.
Facing the economic and political crisis in Russia, he stated on
August 28 that he would not step down from the presidential post.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Peace Talks Making Headway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Burundi peace talks
moved Monday to the second item on agenda -- peace and security
in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"The first item of democracy and good governance ended on a
fine note at the weekend," Hashim Mbita, spokesman for peace
talks mediator, Julius Nyerere, former president of Tanzania,
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are now tackling the second item on agenda and we are also
hopeful that it will wind up to our expectations," Mbita told
reporters in north Tanzania's Arusha town, where the talks are
held.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which began last Tuesday, are aimed at ending the
five-year bloodshed in the central African nation.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed
in Burundi since 1993 in a series of massacres and in armed
conflicts between the Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu rebels.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the talks revealed that a rebel group, Palipehutu,
has demanded for a reconstruction of the army.
</P>
<P>
"The army has to be reformed to incorporate all ethnic
groups," the Palipehutu urged in the talks, which are attended by
various opposition parties and the government of President Pierre
Buyoya as well as the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group claimed that the army's role has degenerated
from that of protecting the masses to suppressing people fighting
for their rights.
</P>
<P>
Another smaller party, the Social Democratic Party, has called
for tightening of sanctions to force military strongman Buyoya to
sign a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Major Buyoya came to power in a military coup in July of 1996,
toppling a civilian government led by Sylvestre Ntibantunganya.
East and central African countries have imposed economic
sanctions on Burundi shortly after the incident.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya has time and again appealed to lift the economic
embargo on the land-locked central African nation as people's
living has become more and more difficult.
</P>
<P>
Mbita also said the democracy and good governance committee
and the nature of Burundi conflict committee have been set up and
started to work. Altogether five committees will be formed to
discuss different aspects of the Burundi conflict.

JOHANNESBURG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela met his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni in
Pretoria Monday in a renewed bid by South Africa to broker peace
in the Great Lakes region, presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana
said.
</P>
<P>
The confidential talks focused on the situation in the Great
Lakes region, particularly the continued fighting in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Mandela still believed that a peaceful solution to the
situation the region was in sight, South African press reports
quoted Mankahlana as saying.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of Southern African Development Community foreign
affairs and defense ministers, which is to take place in Lusaka,
Zambia, on October 26, will carry the process forward, Mankahlana
said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela will also hold talks with other key figures in the
war in the Great Lakes region, and in the next few days, he is
expected to meet Vice-President Paul Kagame of Rwanda in

Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
"The South African government is in contact with the
leadership of the Congolese rebel movement. Preparations are
underway to receive a delegation representing the movement in the
country soon," Mankahlana said.
</P>
<P>
With the context of this broad consultation, Mandela will
confer with Namibian President Sam Nujoma in Windhoek on October
28, which will be another attempt to broker peace in the
Congolese civil war.

not be made against Russia, but for reasons concerning the
countries willing to be part of the Alliance and caring about
their own security, Romanian Defence Minister Victor Babiuc said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the national Rompres news agency, Babiuc Monday
had talks with his Lithuanian counterpart Ceslovas Stankevicius,

cooperation was signed between the Romanian and Lithuanian Defence
ministries.
</P>

could see with his Lithuanian counterpart a clear will to develop
specific cooperation between the two armies in all fields
approached.
</P>
<P>
As regards NATO accession, the two countries will grant support
to each other, especially since "we agreed to advocate, during the
talks we are due to have with partners in the Alliance, the
implementation of the open doors policy, the NATO officials claim
to promote," Victor Babiuc added.
</P>
<P>
"Lithuania's security policy does neither depend on nor fight

Stankevicius believed Russia has changed its stance and will no
longer oppose to the NATO's expanding project.

UNITED NATIONS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday began a visit to Japan, where he will attend
a three-day international conference on African development, a
U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Hiro Ueki, U.N. spokesman told a press conference that "the
main purpose of his visit is to attend the Second Tokyo
International Conference on African Development," which opened on
Monday in the Japanese capital.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to chair the closing ceremony of the

</P>
<P>
During his stay in Tokyo, Annan will hold talks with Japanese
leaders on a wide range of issues, including the relations between
Japan and the United Nations, the U.N. reform and the humanitarian
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General will arrive in Seoul on Thursday on a
two-day visit to South Korea "as a guest of the Korean
Government," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He will exchange views with Korean leaders on the situation in
both Asia and the United Nations, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Annan on Monday delivered a speech at the
annual convention of the American Association of Magazine
Publishers and Editors in Orlando, Florida.
</P>
<P>
"I must say I am disappointed, and indeed disturbed, in the
light of that record and those achievements, that today the United
States is failing to keep faith with the other 184 member states
by honouring its legal obligation and paying what it owes," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I also believe that we can meet the challenge only if the
United States plays its due part in the effort, and provides once
again the leadership we saw in the days when the United Nations is
founded," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which owes some 1.6 billion U.S. dollars to
the United Nations in arrears, was threatened to loose its vote in
the General Assembly early next year if it still refuses to pay
its back dues.

<HEADLINE> More Foreigners Visit Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- More foreigners, especially
Americans, are flocking to Canada to take advantage of the low
dollar, Statistics Canada said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The number of overnight trips to Canada by non-residents
surpassed the number of trips abroad by Canadians for the third
straight month in August.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners made 1.6 million overnight trips, while Canadians
had 1.3 million trips abroad. Canadian travel out of the country
has declined steadily since the high of 2 million trips recorded
in December 1991. On the other hand, the number of foreign visits
has been rising since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The statistics Canada attributed the visiting boom to the
steady influx of Americans. In August, they accounted for 1.3
million trips, or 81 per cent of the total. Tourism from countries
other than the United States slipped slightly, by 0.4 per cent to
319,000 overnight trips in August.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry credits the weak dollar with luring
Americans. In August, an American dollar was worth 1.54 Canadian
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Canadians made 5 per cent fewer overnight trips abroad in
August compared with July. Visits to the United States were down
6.4 per cent and trips to other countries dropped 0.9 per cent.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Marks Samora's 12th Death Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Mozambicans from around the
country Monday commemorated the 12th anniversary of the death of
their former president Samora Machel who was killed in a plane
crash on October 19, 1986 in Mbuzini, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
In the capital Maputo, government officials led by Prime
Minister Pascoal Mocumbi laid wreaths to the Heros' Monument at
the Heros' Square.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi reiterated afterwards that the then apartheid
regime in South Africa was the main suspect of the Mbuzini tragedy.
</P>
<P>
He said Mozambique and South Africa are still investigating in
the incident so as to clarify the causes of the plane crash.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Mozambique Liberation Front (Frelimo) issued a
communique Monday calling on the Mozambican people to participate
in activities aimed at building a better future for the children
as "a lasting way to commemorate the former president."
</P>
<P>
Samora was Mozambique's first president. He died in 1986 on
his way from Zambia back home along with 33 others.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Embassy Bombing Suspects Get Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Two suspects alleged to
have been involved in the bombing of the United States embassy in
Dar es Salaam who are charged with murder have acquired defense
counsels.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Mwengera will defend the first accused person, Mustafa
Mahmoud Said Ahmed, who is claimed to be an Egyptian national,
while Twaib Fauz will defend Rashid Saleh Hemed, a Tanzanian from
the Pemba Island.
</P>
<P>
The case related to the August 7 bombing incident which killed
11 people and wounded more than 70 others, resumed Monday at the
Dar es Salaam-based Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court in a third
mention.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Leonard
Mashaka, requested the court to have Ahmed, the first suspect in
the case, who is at Segerea Remand Prison, sent back to the
police for further interrogation.
</P>
<P>
He said the interrogation will take seven days at the Central
Police Station in the city.
</P>
<P>
Mashaka also requested his defense advocate Mwengera to be
around for the whole period of interrogation.
</P>
<P>
However, Mwengera objected the request saying he did not find
any law which gives power to the court to transfer the accused
person from remand prison back to police custody for
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
He said the interrogation department had an opportunity to
investigate and interrogate the accused persons over the case
before taking them to court.
</P>
<P>
Principal Resident Magistrate Projestus Lugazia who is
presiding the case will deliver a ruling on October 21 on whether
the first accused person will be handed back in police custody or
not.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
have expressed disbelief about the theory that the bomb was
planted in a water tanker.
</P>
<P>
They said the vehicle which carried the bomb was a Nissan
Atlas refrigeration truck. Another vehicle, a white 1989 Suzuki
Samurai, was also used by suspects.

<HEADLINE> 29 Bodies in Egypt's Railway Accident Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-nine bodies in Sunday's
railway accident in northern Egypt have been identified, of which
27 were handed to their families, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
There are different reports on the number of the killed in the
accident. The latest one put the casualties of the fatal train
crash at 43 killed and 94 injured. This was released by a security
source in the Buheira province where the accident took place.
</P>
<P>
In previous reports, 54 were reportedly dead and 150 others
injured as rescue teams ended their search for survivors Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The train, which was traveling south from Egyptian northern
port city of Alexandria, derailled and crashed into a square in
Kafr al Dawar, a town about 30 kilometers southeast of Alexandria
at 5:10 p.m. local time (1510 GMT) Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen of the injured checked out of the hospitals after
having received first aid, said the source in Buheira Security
Department.
</P>
<P>
A non-partisan member of the People's Assembly Monday served
notice at the legislature to question Minister of Transportation
and Communications Soliman Metwalli Soliman over Sunday's train
crash.
</P>
<P>
"The crash panicked people and caused them damage," said member
of parliament Abdul-Moneim Al-Eleimi in his notice, requesting an
urgent meeting of the parliament's concerned committees.
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the deadly train crash, Soliman inspected
the crash scene for a detailed report on the causes behind the
accident and threatened severe punishment against those who hitch
a free ride on the train roof in the future.
</P>
<P>
He ordered initial compensations of 1,000 Egyptian pounds (294
U.S. dollars) to the families of those killed, 500 pounds (147
dollars) and 200 pounds (58 dollars) to those seriously or slightly
injured. The money will be delivered Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry said in a statement that the driver lost
control of the train when he changed tracks at high speed because
the brakes between the locomotive and the carriages were broken by
some hitchhikers on the train.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Railway Authority Mahmoud Marei, who was also on
the site, said the train's driver was unable to stop the train
when he used the brakes, because the air tanks operating them were
damaged.
</P>
<P>
The driver, Michel Fahmy Ibrahim who died in the accident, was
driving at a speed of 80 kilometers per hour before pulling into
the Kafr al Dawar station, according to an official Alexandria
prosecution source.
</P>
<P>
The train crashed through a wall beside the railway, hit a war
memorial in the square and slammed into seven shops, witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
Nabih Yousef Shaltout, head of health care in the province of
Buheira, said most of the dead were bystanders in the town, while
most of the injured were passengers on the train.
</P>
<P>
The train's recording tape is in prosecution custody for
further investigation.
</P>
<P>
The movement of trains was affected only for half an hour by
Sunday's accident, and all signals and traffic lights at the
station were sound, a senior railways official said Monday. Damage
is estimated at about 500,000 pounds (147,000 dollars), he added.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa al-Thani Monday sent a
cable of condolences to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak over the
victims of the train accident.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian railway has suffered a series of accidents in recent
years. Three weeks ago, a driver and his assistant were killed
when their train bumped into a truck on the Alexandria-Cairo line.
</P>
<P>
The most deadly was in December 1995 when two trains collided
in fog south of Cairo, killing 75 people and injuring 76 others.

KAMPALA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- South African farmers are
interested in carrying out agricultural activities in Uganda,
especially in coffee planting.
</P>
<P>
Hans Herbt, who spearheaded a group of South African farmers,
expressed this interest to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
who is on a working visit to South Africa, according to a
press release issued Monday evening by the President's Office.
</P>
<P>
Museveni told the farmers that since Uganda has liberalized
the economy, entrepreneurs are free to undertake economic
activities of their choice. He also encouraged them to
contribute to fruit farming in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Museveni held talks with President Nelson Mandela on
matters of bilateral interest and the situation in the region.

MOSCOW, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The anti-government Georgian
servicemen led by Akaky Eliava are ready to return to their bases
in Senaki, the Itar-Tass news agency reported on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The Eliava-led unit have released the president's envoy to
Imereti, Teimuraz Shashiashvili, Security Minister Dzhamal

press center said.
</P>
<P>
Now the rebels are still holding several high-ranking
officials, including several generals and servicemen from the
interior and defense ministries.
</P>
<P>
Early on Monday, all of the above officials were taken hostage
after their negotiations with the rebels' representatives in
Samtredia and Khoni had failed.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 servicemen revolted Sunday night with 13 tanks and
armored vehicles near the western Georgian town of Samtredia,
saddling a motor road from Senaki to Samtredia, so that cut off
the Black Sea port of poti.
</P>
<P>
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze on Monday called on the
rebels lay down their arms and return to their bases, warning that
he may have to declare a state of emergency in the country and
"take all legitimate measures to protect the interests of the
state."
</P>
<P>
Eliava, the head of the mutinous force, was a former commander
of an armed faction supporting late president Zviad Gamsakhurdia.
</P>
<P>
Georgian Defense Minister David Tevzadze, who arrived in

<HEADLINE> Reppas: Greek Government Not to Change Current Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Although the Greek government
was dissatisfied with the outcome of the local government
elections, it would not change its current policies, government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Reppas said that the result of
the local government elections fell short of government
expectations, but it did not presage any change in the
government's policies.
</P>
<P>
He added that the outcome of the municipal and prefectural
elections was not a defeat for the Greek government, which was not
being judged during the poll.
</P>
<P>
The result showed that the Greek government must place more
emphasis on the resolution of citizens' daily problems and
improving the quality of life, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
To meet the target of joining the European Economic and
Monetary Union (EMU) in 2001, Greek government has carried out a
policy of economic austerity.
</P>
<P>
During the elections which took place over the past two
Sundays, Greece's main opposition New Democracy Party (ND) had won
27 of the 54 prefectures in the elections while the ruling
Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) had won 25 prefectures.
</P>
<P>
PASOK-backed candidates carried 433 of a total of 900
municipalities throughout the country, and the ND-backed
candidates carried 368.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Failure in Peace Process Prompts Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt warned Monday that
frustration with the Mideast peace process is fueling a new wave
of terrorist bombing attacks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa denounced
the bombings in the occupied territories which coincided every
time with signs of progress in the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"But as long as the unresolved Mideast problem feeds a feeling
of frustration, incidents of the kind will continue to flourish in
such a favorable climate," he warned.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came hours after an assailant threw two hand
grenades into the central bus station in the southern Israeli city
of Beersheba Monday morning, injuring 64 people.
</P>
<P>
This incident occurred as Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, hosted by U.S. President Bill Clinton, were trying to
work out a land-for-security deal at Wye Plantation outside
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Moussa expressed the hope that a balanced deal could be sealed
at the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli talks which he said have
entered a "crucial stage."
</P>
<P>
"I hope the talks would arrive at an acceptable and balanced
formula taking into account the interests of the parties
concerned," Moussa said, adding that Cairo is being generally
briefed on the Wye plantation's talks.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on Israel's attempt at undercutting
Cairo's efforts in the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations,
Moussa said Israel is "in no position to dismiss or keep the
Egyptian role."
</P>
<P>
"The situation is far too serious in terms of regional
dimensions for Israel to handle it alone," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to sign peace treaty with
Israel, but ties have been cool. Egypt is also accused by Israel
of obstructing the Palestinians from signing the deal.

WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
rejoined a Middle East peace summit in Maryland Monday, saying
the talks were tough and a grenade attack in Israel was deplored.
</P>
<P>
"The issues are difficult. The distrust is deep. The going has

<P>
The U.S., which originally planned to finish the talks Sunday,

</P>
<P>
In Beersheba, Israel, a grenade explosion earlier Monday
wounded dozens of Israelis, casting clouds over the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"I want to begin by saying how much I deplore the grenade
attack earlier today on a bus station in Beersheba, Israel. No
cause, no grievance justifies terror," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"Now I am convinced that reaching a secure, just, and lasting
peace between Israelis and Palestinians is the best way to ensure
that terrorism has no future in the Middle East," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to meet Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who have been
staying for five days in the Wye Plantation, which is 110 km away
from Washington.
</P>
<P>
"I'm now returning to the Middle East peace talks to encourage
the Israelis and the Palestinians to make the hard decisions
necessary to move this peace process forward," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"As I said when we launched the talks last week, the United
States will do everything we can to help. But ultimately, only the
parties themselves can bridge their differences and put their
people on a more hopeful course," he added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Study Light Soliton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from Weizman
Institute of Science,Israel, are studying light soliton that may
help make the best use of communication lines to transmit images
in real times.
</P>
<P>
Solitons are ripples, waves or pulses that travel, sometimes
for great distances, without any distortion in shape or size. Once
believed to be limited to water, solitons can also be formed by
pulses of light.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have long hoped that light would one day replace the
electricity that now ferries sound waves or images through the
telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
The development of fiber optics provide a solution to the first
problem: optical fibers do not absorb much light but keep it
bouncing along until it reaches its destination. The second
problem of light pulses breaking up, may be solved by the
controlled use of solitons.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Tomorrow's Technology by Weizman
Institute of Science, Professor Yaron Silberberg of the Physics of
Complex Systems Department of Weizman Institute and his coleagues
have found that a laser-generated light pulse of 1.5 micrometers
can create a soliton in a fiber-optic cable. This soliton remains
stable over thousands of kilometers, also retains its integrity:
send two solitons down the travel over much larger distances at
many more bits, or pulses, per second than electric current.
</P>
<P>
Until recently however there were two major problems in working
with light: first it is absorbed by many substances and therefore
quickly lost; second over distance light pulses tend to disperse,
breaking into their component colors or wavelengths, leading to
the distortion of the signal.
</P>
<P>
The development of fiber optics provide a solution to the first
problem: optical fibers do not absorb much light but keep it
bouncing along until it reaches its destination. The second
problem of light pulses breaking up, may be solved by the coame
fiber and they will travel without merging or otherwise disturbing
each other. this finding holds great promise for increasing the
capacity of any single line, said the Israeli scientists.
</P>
<P>
Now the Israeli scientists are also working on controlling
light using light, studying how one optical soliton can be
manipulated by another. The results of this work may one day make
it possible to create circuits that use optical switches, rather
than the electronic switches available today to relay data along
communication lines.

<HEADLINE> Plants May Have Absorbed "Missing" Carbon in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A team of U.S. atmospheric
scientists wrote on Science that American forests and crops are
efficient at soaking up carbon dioxide released by factories,
cities and automobiles, The Washington Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In their new study, the U.S. researchers said that plants are
absorbing twice as much pollution each year as has been believed,
taking in the carbon equivalent of all fossil-fuel emissions in
the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
This finding could help settle one of the great mysteries of
global climate science: the fate of millions of tons of "missing"
carbon from smokestacks and tailpipes.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say levels of heat-trapping carbon dioxide are
steadily building in the atmosphere, but about half the world's
emissions are disappearing into vaguely understood "sink." Much of
the missing carbon is absorbed by the ocean and some is absorbed
by plants, although the exact amount is the subject of intense
debate.

WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
rejoined a Middle East peace summit in Maryland on Monday as
Israel postponed a set of talks in response to a grenade explosion
in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel said on Monday it would discuss only security and drop
all other issues on the agenda at its U.S. summit with the
Palestinians following the grenade attack, according to reports

</P>
<P>
"We will not discuss all the other subjects anymore -- only
security issues," David Bar-Illan, a spokesman for Israeli Prime

summit site at Wye Plantation, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for the plantation, Clinton told reporters at

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Closed Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets closed
mixed Monday after recovering early losses as Wall Street rallied
after a weak start, but the markets were much subdued after last
week's strong gains.
</P>
<P>
The London market detached itself from global trends, as gains
in New York and Tokyo failed to galvanize London shares, which
drifted lower in thin volume.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 ended down 55.6 at 5,077.5, having seen a 5,055.7
low just after Wall Street opened. Volume was low at a touch over
700 million shares traded by the close.
</P>
<P>
Any lingering enthusiasm from Thursday's surprise U.S. rate cut
was only a memory Monday morning, despite the assistance of a 2.2
percent Nikkei advance in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
"Volumes haven't been too good and on Friday there wasn't much
follow-through from the gain which followed the U.S. rate cut,"
noted Charterhouse's Robert Dickson. "Also the European markets
did little to inspire us today."
</P>
<P>
Wall Street's key share index built up an 80-point lead, before
fading slightly, but that only inspired London stocks to climb off
their lows.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares traded slightly lower in thin
volume, as a run up on Wall Street fails to inspire Frankfurt
traders.
</P>
<P>
The dollar's improvement also helped sentiment for the
continent's exporters. It was trading at DM1.6282, up from
DM1.6165 at 7.00 am. The leading Dax index finished up 30 points
at 4,458.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what they're waiting for," said Klaus Tafferner
of Delbrueck &AMP; Co. in Frankfurt, referring to an apparent wariness
among investors on the heels of a round of profit-taking earlier
in the session.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French stock prices closed little changed, shedding
some lunchtime gains with little inspiration from a steady opening
on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The leading Cac 40 index finished up 5 points at 3,395.
"There's no volume," said a trader at a French brokerage house.

<HEADLINE> Voters Registration Ends in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The registration of voters for
Nigeria's on-going democratization ended Monday amid massive
complaint of shortage of voters' cards and despite calls for
extension by some politicians.
</P>
<P>
In Lagos, Nigeria's largest city, there were queues in front
of many registration centers as people rushed to beat the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, which started on October 5, has been marred by
complaints of shortage of voters' cards, alleged buying of cards
by politicians for the purpose of rigging and non-turn-up of
registration officials.
</P>
<P>
Several registration officials were arrested for alleged
irregularities during the exercise.
</P>
<P>
The Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) which was
responsible for the exercise had insisted however that there are
enough voters' cards for everyone who wants to register.
</P>
<P>
According to the INEC, a total of 60 million voters' cards
were released, whereas about 56 million people out of Nigeria's
104 million population were registered as voters in the last such
exercise under the abolished transition program of late leader
General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The INEC also increased the number of registration centers
from 75,000 in the last exercise to more than 111,000 to make
easier access to potential voters.
</P>
<P>
According to the timetable announced by the military
government led by General Abdulsalam Abubakar, Nigeria will hold
presidential elections in the first quarter of 1999, while the
new civilian president will be inaugurated on May 29, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Syria Start Talks to Ease Tensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- High-ranking officials of
Turkey and Syria started a special security meeting Monday
afternoon aimed at easing tensions between the two neighbors, a
Turkish official statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the Foreign Ministry said that the
meeting will continue Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is being held in the town of Seyhan, southern
province of Adana, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Monday's meeting focused on the PKK issue, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has urged Syria to stop supporting the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK), not to shelter PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan
and to ban PKK's activities in Syria.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors have long been at odds over issues including
the PKK, river water sharing and the Turkish-Israeli military
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of harboring the PKK, which has
been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since
1984. Syria has rejected the charge.
</P>
<P>
Syria has lashed out at Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country,
for forming a military alliance with Israel, which it says is
targeted against the Arab world, especially itself.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued last Friday, Turkish Foreign Ministry
rejected an offer from Syria for wide-range talks with Turkey,
saying what concerns Ankara now is only the issue of Kurdish
rebels.

<HEADLINE> 700 Nigerians Die in Oil Pipeline Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian police said Monday that
the death toll in the weekend explosion and fire from a petroleum
pipeline at Jesse in southern Nigeria's Delta State had risen to
700.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) quoted police sources as
saying that more than 100 people, who were critically injured and
taken to hospitals in Sapele and its environs, were reported to
be dead.
</P>
<P>
The disaster occurred Sunday when a burst oil pipeline caught
fire as hundreds of people from the local community were
illegally scooping fuel from the scene, killing some 300
villagers instantly.
</P>
<P>
About 250 others who were trapped in the fire were also killed
in the inferno.
</P>
<P>
Many people were said to have drowned in a nearby river in the
attempt to quench the fire on their bodies by jumping into the
river.
</P>
<P>
The Warri Area Management of Pipelines and Products Marketing
Company which uses the pipeline to pump fuel from Warri to the
northern part of the country claimed that the leakage was caused
by saboteurs.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar left
capital Abuja about 13:00 p.m. (local time) Monday for Warri on
an unscheduled visit to Jesse.
</P>
<P>
Delta State Administrator Navy Commander Walter Feghabo Sunday
ordered an immediate mass burial for about 120 victims of the
weekend fire who were burnt beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
The mass burial would serve to protect the health of local
residents, he said, adding an epidemic could break out if the 120
bodies still lying around were allowed to decompose.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Cabinet Discusses Relations with U.N. Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Cabinet met on Monday
to discuss whether to resume cooperation with the United Nations
weapons inspectors, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
But the news agency did not say whether a decision was made in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
President Saddam Hussein, who chaired the meeting, briefed the
ministers on the leadership's discussion about a proposal put
forward by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's ruling Revolutionary Command Council and the Baath Party
have held two joint meetings to discuss the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Annan has proposed that comprehensive review be conducted about
Iraq's relations with the world organization once it resumes
cooperation with the arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources told Xinhua that Iraq may have made decision
on resuming cooperation with the arms inspectors. The sources said
that Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz met with the Chinese,
French and Russian ambassadors in Baghdad on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided in August to suspend cooperation with the U.N.
Special Commission (UNSCOM) overseeing Iraq's disarmament and
the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
It blamed the two agencies for being dominated by the United
States and attempting to prolong U.N. sanctions on it.
</P>
<P>
In response to Iraq's decision, the U.N. Security Council
adopted a resolution in September, freezing periodic reviews of
the economic sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution, the Security Council agreed to accept
Annan's proposal to review the progress that Iraq has made in
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed the crippling sanctions on
Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions will not be lifted unless UNSCOM certifies that
Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction - long-range
missiles, chemical and biological weapons.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The National Institute of
Pharmaceutical Rearch and Development (NIPR) of Nigeria is to
research into eight samples of herbal drugs on HIV/AIDS, the
official News Agency of Nigeria said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the samples were presented to the Federal
Ministry of Health by Abubakar Gailor, a herbalist based in
Jos, capital of Plateau State in northern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Gailor acknowledging the receipt of the
samples, Chief Executive of the Abuja-based institute, Charles
Wambebe, said he had assigned K. Gamaliel, the Director-General of
Pharmacology and Toxicology, to work with the herbalist to
enchance effectiveness of the research.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Gailor as saying that he had treated AIDS
patients from across the country as well as from Chad, Cameroon,
Cote d'Ivoire and Niger with the drugs under the supervision of
doctors from government hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The herbalist said his treatment lasts from six months to one
year, depending on the response of the patients, but he did not
elaborate on its effect.

<HEADLINE> Germany's SPD, Greens Reach Deal on Coalition Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 19 (Xinhua) -- After two weeks of negotiations,
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democratic Party (SPD)
and the ecologist Greens party announced Monday they had reached
the final agreement to form a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The center-left coalition, if approved by both parties at their
conventions later this week, would be the first ruling coalition
between the SPD and Greens in Germany's post-war history.
</P>
<P>
A 70-page coalition accord will be signed by the two parties on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the final round of negotiations on Monday, the SPD and
Greens agreed on the formation of the incoming cabinet, officials
attending talks said.
</P>
<P>
Among 16 cabinet posts, 12 will go to the SPD, which replaced
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) as
Germany's strongest party after its victory in general elections
on September 27.
</P>
<P>
SPD Chairman Oskar Lafontaine will head an expanded finance
ministry with additional competence gained from the economics
ministry such as Europe-related economic policy.
</P>
<P>
SPD parliamentary leader, Rudolf Scharping, will be defense
minister.
</P>
<P>
The ecologist Greens, which will enter government for the first
time since its founding in 1979, has won three ministerial posts
with its leader, Joschka Fischer, to become foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Werner Mueller, an independent and ex-manager of the VEBA
energy and telecom group, will head the economics ministry after
the previous minister nominee, Jost Stollmann, rejected the post
in protest over its downsized competence.
</P>
<P>
Five women have made their way into Schroeder's cabinet, but
only one eastern German, Christine Bergmann, has made it to be
family minister.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder is due to be formally elected chancellor by the new
parliament on October 27 and his cabinet will be sworn in soon
afterwards.
The complete lineup of Schroeder's cabinet is as followings:

Chancellor: Gerhard Schroeder (SPD)

Foreign minister and vice-chancellor: Joschka Fischer (Greens)

Finance minister: Oskar Lafontaine (SPD)

Defense minister: Rudolf Scharping (SPD)

Interior minister: Otto Schily (SPD)

</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestine blamed Israel for
its decision to postpone a set of talks in response to a grenade
explosion in Israel as the Middle East summit enters a fifth day
in the Wye Plantation in Maryland without any sign of a deal.
</P>
<P>
Israel said it would discuss only security and drop all other
issues on the agenda at its U.S. summit with the Palestinians
following the grenade attack in Beersheba, Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the Wye Plantation after the Israeli
"kitchen cabinet" discussed the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's office also said that the Israeli delegation would not
stay at the summit indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
In response, a Palestinian delegate told reporters that the
Israeli statement was an attempt to blackmail the Palestinians
into making concessions.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this is the traditional way of the Israelis to try
and blackmail the Palestinians to make concessions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to stay at Wye and continue negotiations.
Otherwise, we can go home and then come back to the States and
negotiate a whole package," said the Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side said in the statement that a meeting had been
planned for Monday to discuss opening an airport in the Gaza Strip
but Israel had now decided to postpone that meeting.
</P>
<P>
"After the consultations conducted in the kitchen cabinet, it
was decided that Israel will demand that the Palestinians fulfill
all of their commitments so that there can be progress on other
issues and there is a need to focus on issues of security and
terror," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
As the grenade attack, which wounded more than 60 people
earlier Monday, cast a shadow over the summit talks, U.S.
President Bill Clinton rejoined the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for the plantation, Clinton told reporters at
the White House that he deplored the attack and the talks were
becoming complicated and tough.
</P>
<P>
"The issues are difficult. The distrust is deep. The going has
been tough. But the parties must consider the consequences of
failure and also the benefits of progress," he told reporters
before flying to the Wye Plantation.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and other senior
U.S. officials spent a whole day on the negotiations, which
started last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, which originally planned to finish
the talks on Sunday, decided to extend the summit to Monday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged the Israelis and Palestinians to continue their
talks for a lasting peace, which is the best way to remove
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Now I am convinced that reaching a secure, just, and lasting
peace between Israelis and Palestinians is the best way to ensure
that terrorism has no future in the Middle East," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to meet Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and Netanyahu, who have been staying for five days in the Wye
Plantation, which is 110 km away from Washington.
</P>
<P>
"I'm now returning to the Middle East peace talks to encourage
the Israelis and the Palestinians to make the hard decisions
necessary to move this peace process forward," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"As I said when we launched the talks last week, the United
States will do everything we can to help. But ultimately, only the
parties themselves can bridge their differences and put their
people on a more hopeful course," he added.

In response, a Palestinian delegate told reporters that the
Israeli statement was an attempt to blackmail the Palestinians
into making concessions.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this is the traditional way of the Israelis to try
and blackmail the Palestinians to make concessions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to stay at Wye and continue negotiations.
Otherwise, we can go home and then come back to the States and
negotiate a whole package," said the Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side said in the statement that a meeting had been
planned for Monday to discuss opening an airport in the Gaza Strip
but Israel had now decided to postpone that meeting.
</P>
<P>
"After the consultations conducted in the kitchen cabinet, it
was decided that Israel will demand that the Palestinians fulfill
all of their commitments so that there can be progress on other
issues and there is a need to focus on issues of security and
terror," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
As the grenade attack, which wounded more than 60 people
earlier Monday, cast a shadow over the summit talks, U.S.
President Bill Clinton rejoined the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for the plantation, Clinton told reporters at
the White House that he deplored the attack and the talks were
becoming complicated and tough.
</P>
<P>
"The issues are difficult. The distrust is deep. The going has
been tough. But the parties must consider the consequences of
failure and also the benefits of progress," he told reporters
before flying to the Wye Plantation.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and other senior
U.S. officials spent a whole day on the negotiations, which
started last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, which originally planned to finish
the talks on Sunday, decided to extend the summit to Monday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged the Israelis and Palestinians to continue their
talks for a lasting peace, which is the best way to remove
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Now I am convinced that reaching a secure, just, and lasting
peace between Israelis and Palestinians is the best way to ensure
that terrorism has no future in the Middle East," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to meet Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and Netanyahu, who have been staying for five days in the Wye
Plantation, which is 110 km away from Washington.
</P>
<P>
"I'm now returning to the Middle East peace talks to encourage
the Israelis and the Palestinians to make the hard decisions
necessary to move this peace process forward," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"As I said when we launched the talks last week, the United
States will do everything we can to help. But ultimately, only the
parties themselves can bridge their differences and put their
people on a more hopeful course," he added.

<HEADLINE> Palestine Blames Israel for Suspending Some Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestine blamed Israel for
its decision to postpone a set of talks in response to a grenade
explosion in Israel as the Middle East summit enters a fifth day
in the Wye Plantation in Maryland without any sign of a deal.
</P>
<P>
Israel said it would discuss only security and drop all other
issues on the agenda at its U.S. summit with the Palestinians
following the grenade attack in Beersheba, Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the Wye Plantation after the Israeli
"kitchen cabinet" discussed the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's office also said that the Israeli delegation would not
stay at the summit indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
In response, a Palestinian delegate told reporters that the
Israeli statement was an attempt to blackmail the Palestinians
into making concessions.

<HEADLINE> Annan: U.N. is Hostage of U.S. Abortion Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said Monday in Florida that the United Nations has become a
hostage of the U.S. domestic debate on abortion issues, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
In remarks following a speech to the Magazine Publishers of
America, Annan said he was frustrated that after two years of
intensive reforms at the United Nations, the U.S. Congress has
tied the payment of U.S. dues to abortion concerns.
</P>
<P>
The United States owes the United Nations 1.6 billion U.S.
dollars, according to U.N. figures.
</P>
<P>
Annan complained that the reason given for U.S. funding delays
was that the United Nations was a "bloated bureaucracy," but now
they added the abortion issue which is not related to the dues at
all.
</P>
<P>
"Reform is not mentioned any more. I will be bold enough to say
that the United Nations has gone through more reform in the past
few months as we have in many many decades... Then the abortion
amendment was introduced," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are hostage. The U.N. has become a hostage of the domestic
abortion struggle," Annan added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Democrats and Republicans in U.S.
Congress reached an agreement that would have paid about one
billion U.S. dollars in arrears to the United Nation, beginning
with 475 million U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the funding was made conditional on a provision
barring U.S. aid to international family planning groups that
lobby countries to liberalize their abortion laws while U.S.
President Bill Clinton has said he will veto such a legislation.

<HEADLINE> UK' Blair Meets Northern Irish Party Leaders Over Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair held separate talks with leaders of the two major political
parties in Northern Ireland Monday in a bid to break the deadlock
over decomissioning.
</P>
<P>
But neither side seemed ready to back down from their positions
on the thorny issue hampering the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Following a one-hour meeting at 10 Downing Street with Tony
Blair, Northern Ireland's First Minister David Trimble, the Ulster
Unionist leader, warned Sinn Fein that republicans must start
handing over weapons before they can take seats in the Northern
Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The shadow executive on the assembly cannot be formed until
arms have begun to be handed over, he said. "Our judgment is there
would not be sufficient confidence for an executive to come into
being without evidence of people being committed to exclusively
peaceful and democratic means and so far Martin McGuinness has not
satisfied that requirement."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to make progress as best we can with or
without Mr McGuinness," he said, highlighting Sinn Fein's
"refusal" to implement the decommissioning section of the Good
Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Blair held talks with Martin McGuinness, chief
negotiator of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican
Army (IRA). McGuinness emerged from 10 Downing Street after two
hours to say he would not compromise to end the stand-off.
</P>
<P>
He again insisted that under the Good Friday Agreement, Sinn
Fein was entitled to take up positions on the new Northern Ireland
executive body regardless of progress on decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
He attacked the refusal by Trimble to establish the executive
until the IRA and other paramilitaries begin disarming.
</P>
<P>
"This meeting was not about decommissioning, it was about how
we implement the Good Friday Agreement and whether people who gave
their word on Good Friday will keep it," he said.
</P>
<P>
McGuinness argued that Trimble's hand had been strengthened by
winning the Nobel Peace Prize. He said that Trimble should use
this extra prestige to oppose those in his Ulster Unionist Party
who were pushing for "destruction" of the peace process by
pressing for decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
He said that the responsibility for dealing with the handover
of arms lay with John de Chastelain, the Canadian general
appointed to chair the decommissioning body.
</P>
<P>
"That job was not given to David Trimble. His job was to
implement, with the rest of us, the Good Friday Agreement," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The executive and cross-border bodies are scheduled to be
established by the end of this month. McGuinness said that in his
talks with Blair he had stressed the importance of keeping to that
deadline.
</P>
<P>
However, Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam admitted last
week that it was possible there could be some "slippage" from this
timetable.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern has asked Northern Ireland
paramilitaries to "adopt a generous and forthcoming approach" on
arms, saying it would be "perverse" if the issue was allowed to
destroy the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Trimble's position has been boosted by a recent poll which
found that 54 percent of the Irish Republic's electorate believed
it was "reasonable" to delay the agreement over decommissioning.
The poll was carried out by Ireland's Sunday Independent
newspaper.

<HEADLINE> China Hold Japan 2-2 in Under-19 Soccer Tourney (updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHIANG MAI, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China held tournament
favorites Japan to a 2-2 draw in their second match at the 13th
Asian Under-19 Football Championship here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In front of a 10,000 crowd at Chiang Mai's 700-Year Main
Stadium, China played brilliantly in the first half, scoring one
goal in the 13th minute. Japan had some opportunities,
particularly one clear chance when Tatsuya Ishikawa fired a
11-yard shot onto the bar.
</P>
<P>
The first part of the second half was dominated by Japan.
After only four minutes, Masashi Motoyama pushed the ball into
the net, and about 10 minutes later he scored again to put Japan
2-1 ahead.
</P>
<P>
But the Japanese dominance was diminishing after Junichi
Inamoto got a red card for a rough tackle.
</P>
<P>
China took its best chance superly and were awarded a penalty
kick. Li Yan converted from the spot to give his team a
hard-fought draw.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Chen Jingang said after the match that although
with a one-man advantage in the second half, China did not
control the mid-field. "We should have won the match," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen cited fatigue and lack of experiences as the main reasons
that blocked the Chinese way to victory.
</P>
<P>
In another match Tuesday, South Korea and Qatar fought to a
goalless draw.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Jordan's King Join Mideast Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Both U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Jordan's ailing King Hussein are joining Middle East
summit in the Wye Plantation in Maryland, which has entered the
sixth day on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There are still gaps, significant ones," said State Department
spokesman James Rubin, referring to the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, who signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, will
try to use the good offices of Jordan to help bridge the gap
between the two sides, a diplomatic source said. Hussein has been
offering his advice by telephone for several days.
</P>
<P>
The king, who has good relations with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and better relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu than any other Arab leaders, can symbolize that Arabs
and Israelis can join together to overcome differences.
</P>
<P>
"We think he has the unique ability to bring home to the
delegations the necessity for making peace," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the White House announced that Clinton would attend
the summit at mid-day.

<HEADLINE> China Beat XNBA to Lead Series 2-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, China, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China's national team
survived a last minute scare to beat the XNBA Legends Team 75-71
in the third game of the exhibition series on Tuesday in Hefei,
Anhui Province of China.
</P>
<P>
China won the closely contested first game 98-96, while the
American XNBA Legends took control of the second to win 86-73
last weekend in Shanghai. The hosts now lead the four-game
series 2-1 heading to the final game in Beijing on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Averaging 41-year-old, the American team, which is consisted
of the greatest basketball players retired from the National
Basketball Association (NBA) years before, could be proud of
putting the much younger Chinese team into hard working.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jinsong, who earned the game's MVP honor Tuesday night,
sunk a victory-clutching three-pointer with less than one second
left.
</P>
<P>
Five minutes into the game, the host team built up an early
lead of 15-2 before the XNBA stormed back to within two points.
</P>
<P>
Coming into the second half with 45-38 down, the XNBA closed
the gap with magnificent play at both ends of the court from
former Utah Jazz player Tom Chambers and Denver Nugget Alex
English.
</P>
<P>
"I hate it when we make the other team look good. We made a
lot of mistakes out there tonight," Chambers said.

<HEADLINE> Czech Officials Urge UK not to Impose Visa Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Senior Czech government
officials Tuesday urged the British government not to impose visa
restrictions on its citizens to counter large numbers of Roma
(gypsies) claiming asylum in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Britain imposed visa restrictions on
Slovaks after a big increase in the number of asylum applications
from Slovak gypsies who claimed they are discriminated against at
home and often subject to racist abuse.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
Czech Foreign Minister Jan Kavan and Human Rights Commissioner
Petr Uhl said that they had been assured that Britain had no
immediate plans to require Czech visitors to obtain visas.
</P>
<P>
"(British) Home Secretary Jack Straw told us there were no
current plans to impose visa restrictions on Czech citizens and
the situation would stay under review," Uhl said.
</P>
<P>
"During our talks we expressed our determination to do
everything we could to ensure the Roma (gypsies) stay at home,"
Uhl told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
"I think establishing a visa regime for Slovaks and the
possibility of one for Czechs could have negative consequences. It
could stir up anti-Roma feelings in the general population and
spread anti-Western and anti-democratic feelings," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kavan said that the Czech Republic's chances of joining the
European Union could well be hit if its citizens were required to
obtain visas before entering Britain.
</P>
<P>
"It would not follow that other EU states would do the same
because Britain is in a different position, since it has not
signed the (EU) Schengen agreement," he said.

<HEADLINE> Institutes Revise Germany's 1999 GDP Growth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The German economy will see
lower-than-expected growth in 1999 due to the negative impact of
the economic crises in Asia and other regions, six leading German
economic research institutes said in a report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The autumn economic report released by the institutes predicted
that Germany's gross domestic product (GDP) would grow only by 2.3
percent in 1999 compared with their previous estimate of 2.7 percent
made in spring.
</P>
<P>
German exports to Southeast Asia dropped by one third since
autumn 1997, while exports to all crisis-hit regions went down by
15 percent, which has translated into a 0.5 percent drop in GDP
growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the German economy is benefiting from a revival in
private consumption, low inflation and stable interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"The crises in several regions of the world will considerably
impair export dynamics. This will serve to slow the economy, but
there is no threat of a recession," the report said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Legislators Support Arafat to Reach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Legislative
Council (PLC) Tuesday announced its support to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to reach a comprehensive agreement with the Israelis
during the on-going peace talks in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
This came in a statement issued in the West Bank city of
Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
During its Tuesday session in Ramallah, the PLC heard the
reports about the peace talks at Wye Plantation outside
Washington, the U.S., urging Arafat and the Palestinian delegation
to reach a comprehensive agreement with Israel so that the peace
process can be moved forward, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace summit entered its sixth day at
the plantation on Tuesday. Palestinian sources at the summit were
quoted by Palestinian reporters as saying that so far progress has
been made pertaining to the issue of Gaza airport and the safe
passage linking the West Bank and Gaza Strip and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Both the Palestinian and Israeli negotiators now have entered a
serious phase of discussions about the security issues in the
presence of U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
The PLC believes that the peace process has been facing crisis
during the last 18 months due to Israel's refusal to implement the
signed agreements, the statement said, adding that it is very
important to achieve a comprehensive agreement during the Wye
summit.
</P>
<P>
While expressing confidence that Arafat could handle the peace
talks well, the PLC also reiterated that it will back Arafat to
declare an independent Palestinian state next May.
</P>
<P>
"The next May should be the end of Israel's intransigency
policy," the statement pointed out.

<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The second defense
consultations between China and the United States ended here this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had in-depth exchange of views on international
and regional security issues of common concern, discussed
bilateral military contacts for next year, and found consensus on
annual high-level exchanges of visits and promoting exchange in
all areas and at all levels to enhance mutual understanding and
trust, according to sources from the Chinese military.
</P>
<P>
Both sides held that the consultation was conducted in the wake
of the successful exchange of visits between China and the United
States, and in a period when Sino-U.S. relations has been elevated
to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
Both parties decided to make joint efforts to establish a
constructive strategic partnership oriented towards the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
General Zhang Wannian, vice-chairman of China's Central
Military Commission (CMC) and Chinese Defense Minister General Chi
Haotian met respectively with U.S. under secretary of defense
Walter Slocombe, who presided at the consultations.
</P>
<P>

wide contacts with military and governmental officials have
promoted mutual understanding and trust.
</P>
<P>
Zhang pointed out that fruitful results have been obtained in
implementing agreements on military matters reached between the
two countries' leaders, adding his belief that this will help
promote the exchanges and cooperation of the two armed forces, and
further develop bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also CMC vice-chairman and state councillor, spoke highly
of the consultations and the defense consultation mechanism. He

maintaining good momentum in Sino-U.S. relations and speeding up
the achievement of a constructive strategic partnership.
</P>

state-to-state and army-to-army relations between the two
countries now face historical opportunities. The momentum for

<HEADLINE> Consultations Mechanism Pushes Sino-U.S. Army Relations Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The second defense
consultations between China and the United States, which ended
here this morning, was the third Sino-U.S. military consultation
since Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited the U.S. last year.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that these consultations, held in accordance
with agreements between Chinese and U.S. leaders, mark the
normalization of exchange mechanisms between the two armed forces,
and the initial establishment of mutual understanding and trust.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
pointed out that the consultations have achieved the purpose of
increasing understanding and laying a sound ground for further
exchanges and cooperation between the two armies.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian in meeting today with
Walter Slocombe, U.S. under secretary of defense, pointed to the
regular consultations mechanism as "a hotline for the
Sino-U.S. armed forces" that could help reduce their divergences
and increase common ground.
</P>
<P>
The American guests attending the consultations agreed that the
mechanism was an important "tool" for enhancing mutual
understanding between the two defense departments.
</P>
<P>
The only one among the Americans to attend both the maritime
safety consultation in July and the second defense consultations,
Admiral Earl Hailstone of the Pacific Command, expressed his
delight over the atmosphere, describing it as friendly, frank and
open. He said he agreed with Jiang Zemin's words during Jiang's
visit to Hawaii that the two sides have to understand each other
before establishing trust and contact.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed today to hold the third defense consultations
and the second maritime safety consultations next year.

<HEADLINE> Expert Says Sino-U.S. Army Exchanges Head for Stable Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese senior researcher for
strategic studies Peng Guangqian today expressed his belief that
the Sino-U.S.army relationship will enter a period of stable
development as the two countries have found common ground for
strategic security.
</P>
<P>
Peng, a scholar with China's Academy of Military Sciences, said
that Sino-U.S. army exchanges are now entering into the third
important phase of development, following the first phase in the
1940s when the U.S. army stationed an observer group in Yan'an,
and the second when exchanges occurred in the early years after
two countries established diplomatic ties more than twenty years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Peng pointed to the second Sino-U.S. defense consultations
which concluded here this morning as a sign that Sino-U.S. army
relations are on a track of steady development.
</P>
<P>
That two countries have found a new basis for strategic
security in the new historical period provides impetus for the
military exchanges, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Peng went on to note that some unstable factors arising in the
past year have made those common grounds more obvious. The Asian
financial crisis which has spread to northeast Asian countries
poses a threat to U.S. benefits in the world's largest booming
market, and the nuclear tests in south Asia seriously infringe
upon the U.S. military strategy of opposing nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
"As an important country in the Asia-Pacific region, China has
adopted a responsible attitude and measures towards both crises,
which in turn makes the Americans more aware of the necessity for
keeping friendly ties with China", he noted.
</P>
<P>
Peng noted that through consultations with the U.S., China has
exhibited its responsible attitude toward regional security.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-U.S. military relationship is based on the principle
of equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect, and exchanges
between China and the U.S. are not directed at the third country,
and differ from any form of a military alliance, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Shoots to Record High in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit hit a
new record of 16.8 billion U.S. dollars in August as the Asian
economic crisis brought exports down for a fifth straight month,
the Commerce Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The deficit for August was 15.3 percent higher than a revised
14.5 billion dollars deficit in July as exports of U.S. goods and
services dropped 0.3 percent while imports rose by 2.2 percent,
according to a report by the department.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of this year, the deficit in goods
and services is running at an annual rate of 165 billion dollars,
50 percent above last year's 111-billion-dollar imbalance.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the loss of export markets, the U.S. domestic
manufacturers increased competition from foreign goods made
suddenly cheaper for American consumers by the steep decline in
Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. deficit with Pacific Rim countries rose by 5.6 percent
in August to 15.7 billion dollars, and at the figure of 103.5
billion dollars, it is 41 percent higher than in the first eight
months of last year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. deficit with Japan was up 0.5 percent in August to 5.2
billion dollars and is running 16 percent higher than the 1997
pace.
</P>
<P>
The 0.3 percent drop in U.S. exports of goods and services
marked the fifth straight month that exports have declined. The
total amount of 74.84 billion dollars in August was the lowest
since January 1997.
</P>
<P>
Exports of U.S. agricultural products fell 3.9 percent to
3.57 billion dollars, the lowest level since July 1994. American
farmers are suffering this year from depressed export demand and
lower commodity prices, both reflecting in large part the global
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports jumped 2.2 percent to 91.6 billion dollars,
led by the increase in shipments of automotive products with the
ending of the strikes at General Motors (GM).
</P>
<P>
The deficits with both Canada and Mexico, partners in the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), were up in August,
reflecting the end of the GM strike, which had depressed imports
of automotive products in July.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Mexico was up 53.9 percent to a record 1.76
billion dollars, with half the surge in imports coming in the
automotive area. The deficit with Canada rose 4.5 percent to 1.82
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The August trade performance would have been even worse if
there had not been a continuing decline in world oil prices. Total
oil imports dipped 0.4 percent to 4.04 billion dollars. That
reflected an increase in volume to 9.33 million barrels per day on
the average, but a drop in the price to 10.63 dollars per barrel,
compared to 10.71 dollars in July. The August price was the lowest
since August 1986.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Not to Yield to Pressure: Official Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will not yield to
pressure while it has chosen its own path to establish a modern,
peaceful and prosperous democratic state and steadfastly march
towards the goal, an official Information Sheet Tuesday quoted a
press release of the Myanmar Embassy in London as saying.
</P>
<P>
In response to recent remarks by Derek Fatchett, minister of
state of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the United Kingdom
(UK), Monday's press release said that Fatchett's remarks are
"fatally flawed, totally unjustified and most deplorable".
</P>
<P>
Fatchett made a statement in London last Thursday on the
situation in Myanmar, saying that the UK will seek suspension of
Myanmar's membership in the International Labor Organization and
urge the European Union (EU) member states to impose restrictions
on trade, investment and tourism in the country and on issuance of
transit visas to Myanmar officials.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed in 1996 sanctions on Myanmar, banning visas to
Myanmar high-ranking officials, freezing contacts at ministerial
or senior-official level and imposing an embargo on the sale of
military equipment to the country. The sanctions were extended to
another six months since April this year.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar press release categorically rejected the
allegations of the use of forced labor in Myanmar, and firmly
reiterated that there are no incidents of the use of forced labor
in the country.
</P>
<P>
It charged that Fatchett's remarks are reminiscent of the
British policy and tactics towards Myanmar way back in the 1880s,
just before its military invasion and final annexation of Myanmar
into the British Empire in 1886.
</P>
<P>
It also accused Fatchett of having infringed on the fundamental
 principles of diplomacy and the accepted international norms in
inter-state relations under the Vienna Convention on Friendly
Relations among States.
</P>
<P>
It warned that no sovereign state would allow or tolerate a
breach of the principles of non-interference in the internal
affairs of another state, enshrined in an article of the United
Nations Charter with regard to its internal situation.
</P>
<P>
It also pointed out that most of the major long-standing
problems and difficulties in Myanmar are legacy of the British
colonial rules, citing the insurgency problem which is a legacy
of the divide and rule policy of the British colonialists.
</P>
<P>
Another legacy is the problem of narcotic drugs, which was
unknown in Myanmar before the British annexation of the country in
the 19th century, It added.
</P>
<P>
The press release further pointed out that the pressure tactics
and the coercive measures leveled at Myanmar would only be
self-defeating and counter-productive.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another Myanmar government statement claimed Monday
that no amount of pressure from the UK, EU or UN will deter the
country from its chosen path, warning that if the British
government decides to impose sanctions on Myanmar, it will merely
be following the infamous path laid down by the Americans.

<HEADLINE> 16 Zimbabwean Soliders Captured by Congolese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen Zimbabwean soldiers
were captured Monday by the rebels fighting to oust President of
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Laurent Kabila, according
to Zimbabwean newspaper The Herald.
</P>
<P>
The paper Tuesday quoted Zimbabwean Defense Minister Moven
Mahachi as saying that the 16 soldiers have been taken prisoner
Monday near Kabalo in eastern Congo (K) after flying into the
town in the belief it was controlled by Kabila's forces.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi said that "we have told the rebels to treat them in
accordance with international humanitarian law and the Geneva
Convention governing the treatment of war captives."
</P>
<P>
The soldiers landed in a transport plane near Kabalo, nearly
200 km south of Kindu which was seized by the rebels last week,
and did not know the town had also been taken over by the rebels,
the paper said, adding that the aircraft took off from the
airfield safely.
</P>
<P>
But a rebel spokesman said that the soldiers were captured
during a ground battle, denying any aircraft was on site,
according to another report reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the spokesman as saying that they killed
four other Zimbabwean soldiers Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe sent its troops along with Angola and Namibia to
Congo to back Kabila soon after the Tutsi-led rebels rose up
against him on August 2. They helped rout the rebels in the west
in late August.
</P>
<P>
At first Zimbabwe was reluctant to sent its troops to the
east, but perhaps after the seizure of Kindu, a government
forward base to crush the rebels in the east, Zimbabwe changed
mind and President Robert Mugabe promised to dispatch soldiers to
eastern Congo during a recent visit to lubumbashi recently.

MOSCOW, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia "unconditionally" adheres
to the "One China" policy, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmanin said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a briefing on the visit to Taiwan by Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, the leader of Russian's Liberal Democratic Party

one China, the People's Republic of China, and its government is
the only legitimate government in all of China, which includes
Taiwan.
</P>

The spokesman said Zhirinovsky's trip was prompted, first of
all, by his own desire to promote mutually beneficial contacts
between Russian and Taiwanese business communities.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's official stand with respect to Taiwan is determined
by the Russian president's decree of September 15, 1992, and the
relevant provisions of the Russian-Chinese documents resulting
from the bilateral summits," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin emphasized that "Russian-Taiwanese ties and contacts
in the trade, economic and cultural spheres are of an unofficial
character."

<HEADLINE> U.N.-Taliban Talks on Aid Resumption Make Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The on-going talks between
the United Nations and Afghan Taliban officials on the security
arrangements for U.N. operations in Afghanistan have made some
progress, a U.N. spokeswoman said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed 'security sub-agreement' today and the talks will
also continue tomorrow (Wednesday)," said Sarah Russell, spokesman
for the U.N. Office Humanitarian Assistance for Afghanistan
(UNOCHA).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taliban's representative Saeed-ur-Rehman Haqqani
said, "The talks are continuing and we hope that the matters would
be settled swiftly."
</P>
<P>
During Monday's talks, the U.N. offered the security
sub-agreement which calls for official protection for the world
body's premises and also promises of its implementing partners and
mobile mission.
</P>
<P>
The said agreement also asks guarantee that if any U.N. staff
member is detained they should be released in 72 hours in absence
of formal charges against them, and the U.N. staff would be
allowed if they want to visit any of its detained staff.
</P>
<P>
Taliban's paramount leader Mulla Muhammad Omar in his last
week's meeting with U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi in
Kandahar, southern Afghanistan, urged the world body and other aid
groups to resume their humanitarian operations in the war-ravaged
country.
</P>
<P>
International aid agencies suspended their operations in
Taliban-controlled areas over a row on the relocation of their
offices by the Islamic movement in an old building on the
outskirts of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. withdrew their expatriate staff from Afghanistan in
August following the killing of an Italian national working for
the U.N. in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, whose shuttle diplomacy helped avert a possible war
between Iran and Taliban, expressed the hope that the U.N. and
other aid groups would return to Afghanistan following security
guarantees from the militia authorities.
</P>
<P>
"I think the meeting between Taliban and U.N. officials will
clear the problems and the U.N. very much wants to return to
Afghanistan to resume its activities there," he told a press
conference here Monday.

<HEADLINE> Enhance Women's Economic Role, Addis Forum Told </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Speaker of House
of Federation Almaz Meko appealed Tuesday to "create an enabling
environment for the enhancement of women in the economic
development efforts."
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Almaz when she officially opened the
second Global Women Entrepreneurs Investment Forum at the United
Nations Conference Center here.
</P>
<P>
Almaz said that "in developing countries, women make up half
of the human resources potentially available for economic
activity, and they fulfill multiple productive roles."
</P>
<P>
However, she pointed out that women's current position and
prospects are generally at a disadvantage, saying that
"advancement prospects are limited as a result of social
prejudice and lack of access to resources, training and other
opportunities."
</P>
<P>
"The increased role of women's contribution to development in
areas such as trade, industry and generally in all
entrepreneurial activities, is vital in order to bring about a
meaningful socio-economic development in Africa," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
The four-day investment forum is jointly organized by the
African Federation of Women Entrepreneurs (AFWE) and the
Ethiopian Women Entrepreneurs Association (EWEA).
</P>
<P>
In her statement at the opening ceremony, AFWE President Aisha
Inok Bakari called on African women entrepreneurs to strengthen
their cooperation when they are actively participating in African
economic development.
</P>
<P>
"We shall work hard to mobilize resources to improve and
enhance the productive capacity of our women within their
environment and improve the marketability of their products both
within and outside borders," she said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, AFWE Secretary-General Lucia Quachey
said the focus of the theme of the investment forum is to
increase the contribution of women to accelerated industrial
growth and attract private direct investment to Africa, sensitize
national governments and the international community to the
empowerment of African women entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Participants will also discuss such topics as private direct
investment in Africa and the role of women entrepreneurs, Youth
entrepreneurship and unemployment, African industrialization and
the role of African women entrepreneurs, African economies and
globalization, technology and North-South cooperation.
</P>
<P>
AFWE was established in 1993 to enhance the economic
empowerment of African women, and to develop cooperation among
women entrepreneurs in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The first Global Women Trade fair and Investment forum was
held in Accra, Ghana in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Meets Chief Officials for Economic Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on Tuesday met with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Finance
Minister Mikhail Zadornov and Central Bank Chairman Viktor
Gerashchenko to discuss the country's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Following the Kremlin meeting, Primakov told the press the
president was advised of the government's plans and measures to
pay off wage and pensions debts.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was going to clear all wage debts by
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Repayment for pensions would likely be carried over to the next
year, but the government would do its best to avoid a lengthy
delay, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prime minister noted that a very small amount of
new money may have to be printed in order to repay the debts in
arrears.
</P>
<P>
Gerashchenko and Zadornov also reiterated there would be no
unbacked issuance of currency. "Not an issuance but a broadening
of the money base is in question," Gerashchenko said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said the government would soon work out a new tax
plan, which is aimed at reducing taxes on producers and creating a
broader tax base.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia "unconditionally" adheres
to the "One China" policy, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmanin said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a briefing on his visit to Taiwan, Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, the leader of Russian's Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP), said there is only one China, the People's Republic of
China, and its government is the only legitimate government in all
of China, which includes Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Zhirinovsky's trip was prompted, first of
all, by his own desire to promote mutually beneficial contacts
between Russian and Taiwanese business communities.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's official stand with respect to Taiwan is determined
by the Russian president's decree of September 15, 1992, and the
relevant provisions of the Russian-Chinese documents resulting
from the bilateral summits," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin emphasized that "Russian-Taiwanese ties and contacts
in the trade, economic and cultural spheres are of an unofficial
character."
</P>
<P>
A group of representatives from the LDP headed by Zhirinovsky
started the five-day trip to Taiwan on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Grant Entry Visas on Arrival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
approved a proposal to grant airport entry visas for travelers on
arrival at the airports of Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, a newspaper
report said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Vietnam News, the new rules allow airport
entry visas to be granted to travelers visiting Vietnam on package
tours and arriving for celebrations marking the 300th anniversary
of Saigon-Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
The measure is aimed at boosting the country's slump tourism
sector.
</P>
<P>
But officials stressed that airport entry visa status is being
run as a pilot-scheme while awaiting a new governmental decision
on overall exit-entry visas regulations.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released by the Vietnam National
Administration for Tourism (VNAT), many tour contracts to bring
foreign travelers to Vietnam were canceled, while room rates and
package tour prices dropped sharply.
</P>
<P>
The declining number of tourist arrivals has forced a number of
tour operators and hoteliers to launch unhealthy competition
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam received only 800,000 foreign visitors in the first
half of this year. VNAT is still pursuing a target of 1.8 million
foreign visitors this year.

<HEADLINE> HK's Incursion Into Markets Wins Overseas Understanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang said Tuesday that the government's
incursion into the local stock and futures markets in August has
won understanding and support from financial and banking leaders
of foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from a three-week overseas mission, which took
him to nine cities in Germany, Holland, the United States and
Britain, Tsang told reporters at the airport that he had explained
the rationale behind the counter-activities in the stock and
futures markets taken by the SAR government in August.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said that most of the financial ministers, central
bankers and other financial and banking officials as well as
businessmen he met had expressed their understanding and support
over the HKSAR government's measures against the manipulation by
speculators in the stock and futures markets in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tsang left Hong Kong for the U.S. and Europe on September 27.
During his three-week mission, he discussed questions about the
hedge funds and the monitoring over the international fund flows
with financial ministers and central bankers he met, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said that he had also collected the latest first-hand
knowledge on the development of the European single currency --
the Euro. Hong Kong has to do some preparation for the birth of
the Euro, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the government will sell out the stocks it bought
 in August as the share prices have surged sharply, Tsang said
that the purpose of the government to buy these stocks was not to
make profits but to stabilize the stock and futures markets.
</P>
<P>
So the government will not sell out these stocks now in order
to avoid unnecessary turbulence on the stock market and the
government is considering holding these stocks for longer-term
reserves, Tsang said.

<HEADLINE> China's Monetary Policy to Pursue Continuity, Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Sources from the Monetary
Policy Committee of the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said today
that in 1999 China's monetary policy will pursue continuity and
stability on the basis of this year's operation.
</P>
<P>
The committee held its 1998 autumn meeting earlier this week to
discuss issues concerning current monetary policy, and studied
monetary policies for the last quarter of this year and for next
year.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the meeting said that in 1999 efforts will be made
to raise the operating efficiency of credit capital, further
prevent financial risks, continue to improve financial services,
and appropriately increase money supply, all for the purpose of
promoting economic development.
</P>
<P>
It has been predicted that by the end of this year, the money
supply will near the growth target of a 16 to 18 percent increase
set at the beginning of the year, while the amount of loans from
state-owned banks will fulfill the readjusted directive growth
plan.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the meeting held that the series of measures to
 appropriately increase money supply, which began in the first
quarter, have now become effective. By the end of September, the
amount of broad money (M2) rose 16 percent over the same period
last year, while the amount of loans extended by all financial
institutions increased 17 percent. The proportion of loans to
infrastructure construction has increased, and the money supply
and credit growth basically match the development of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
They also believe that international and domestic financial
conditions since the start of the Asian financial crisis have
provided evidence that China's principle of opening the capital
account in a progressive way is correct, in that it is both
beneficial for enhancing China's macroeconomic control ability,
and can protect the interests of foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that China's policy of maintaining a stable yuan
is in line with the country's balance of international payments,
and that there is a solid basis for the continued stability of the
yuan.

<HEADLINE> SKorean Firm Invests 80M Dollars in Chittagong EPZ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Youngone Corporation, a major
private sector enterprise of South Korea, has invested 80 million
U.S. dollars in the Chittagong Export processing Zone (CEPZ) since
1987.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Chairman of the Youngone Corporation Kihak
Sung while exchanging views with newsmen in the seaport city of
Chittagong Tuesday, the official BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Around 20,000 workers are employed in 13 industrial units of
the Youngone Corporation at the CEPZ and three more units named
the Youngone Multiple Assembly Complex with an investment of 25
million dollars, which already went into operation, Sung said.
</P>
<P>
Though the government has offered a package of incentives to
foreign investors creating a bright investment climate in
Bangladesh, the port customs facilities and agitational programs
like hartal and road blockade immensely affected production in the
CEPZ, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the Korean Export Processing Zone (KEPZ) on
the left bank of the river Karnaphuli at an estimated cost of 200
million dollars is also progressing, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The Youngone Corporation chief urged all concerned to come
forward unitedly to help implement construction of this giant EPZ,
which will create employment opportunities for 150,000 people
directly or indirectly.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises from all over the world have expressed keen
interest to invest in the KEPZ with an expected investment of one
billion dollars initially, he told the newsmen.
</P>
<P>
The KEPZ, which is to be built on over 2,526 acres, will have
around 100 small and medium-scale and 30 large-sized key
industries, backward linkage industries, textile, ready-made
garments, shoes manufacturing units and hi-tech agro-based,
chemical and machine manufacturing industries.
</P>
<P>
The development cost of the KEPZ will be funded by the
sponsoring company and a number of international financing
companies, Sung added.

<HEADLINE> Kabila's Top Military Commander Defects: RNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 20 (Xinhua) -- One of the top senior
commanders of embattled President of the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) Laurent Kabila allegedly defected to the rebels early
this month, the Rwandan News Agency (RNA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
RNA quoted the state-run Radio Rwanda as saying that Col.
Songolo Nura arrived in Goma, an eastern town bordering Rwanda
where the rebels headquarters is based on October 5, after
abandoning his post as "the military commander of Kabila's troops
in Katanga (Shaba) in southern Congo (K)".
</P>
<P>
Col. Songolo declared in Goma Monday that he had defected
because he wanted to join the rebels of the Congolese Democratic
Coalition in the struggle to topple Kabila, who was "heading a
tribal group" as a "corrupt dictator."
</P>
<P>
Tutsi-led rebels launched a revolt in early August in the east
and Rwanda and Uganda have been accused of invading to back the
rebels who occupy one fourth of the Congolese territory mainly in
the east.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the troops from Zimbabwe, Angola, and Namibia
which threw their support to Kabila officially, Songolo claimed,
there were a rag-tag of militia forces including the former
Rwandan government soldiers (ex-FAR), the "Interahamwe" Hutu
militiamen, the Sudanese soldiers, the Burundi Hutu rebels, and
rebels fighting the Ugandan government.
</P>
<P>
These armed groups were called in by Kabila to help liberate
territories in the hands of the Congolese rebels with the promise
that he will in return assist them in seizing power in Rwanda and
Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Firmly Upholds Rule of Law: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Hong Kong official
said here Tuesday that the policy objective of the Department of
Justice is to uphold the rule of law, provide efficient and
effective legal services to the government and improve the present
legal system.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Legislative Council Administration of Justice
and Legal Services Panel meeting, Secretary for Justice Elsie
Leung said that the rule of law has been firmly upheld and the
integrity of the legal system has been fully preserved after Hong
Kong's smooth return to China.
</P>
<P>
She noted that almost all the ordinances previously in force
have been adopted as laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) and justice continues to be administered by an
independent judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Criminal prosecutions continue to be conducted by the
Department of Justice, free from any outside interference, she
added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the first Legislative Council, as envisaged in the
Basic Law, has been established by free and open elections
successfully held in May and the SAR continues to participate in
more than 20 international organizations, and continues to be
party to around 200 multilateral treaties, she said.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the work that the Department of Justice has
done over the past year or so, Leung put forward following tasks
in the coming year:
</P>
<P>
-- Formulating and promoting legal policy and advising
government on legal policy issues;
</P>
<P>
-- Providing advice on international law issues and handling
requests for international legal cooperation;
</P>
<P>
-- Drafting sound and enforceable legislation;
</P>
<P>
-- providing legal advice to government and other public bodies
on civil law matters, undertaking civil litigation and drafting
contracts on construction-related and other commercial matters;
</P>
<P>
-- Advising and deciding whether or not criminal proceedings
should be undertaken and prosecuting cases in the courts; and
</P>
<P>
-- Developing efficient and effective bilingual legal services,
promoting better use of information technology, and promoting
public understanding of the rule of law and the legal system both
locally and overseas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said the Department of Justice will implement
16 new initiatives including publishing a new index to the Basic
Law and promoting the SAR's participation in international law
forums as well as the work of the law drafting, civil and
prosecutions divisions.
</P>
<P>
Leung said that the Department of Justice is determined to play
 its part in realizing the vision of "one country, two systems"
and the principle of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
"We are fully committed to upholding the rule of law under the
Basic Law, and are ready and eager to take on the challenges that
lie ahead," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
weaker Tuesday, softening on the back of increased speculation of
a possible cut in official interest rates by the Reserve Bank of
Australia (RBA).
</P>
<P>
According to Colonial State Bank treasury manager Nick
Volanakis, the local currency fell when European trading began.
</P>
<P>
"It's not different to any other day," he said. "Europe just
comes in and sells it - it's in a bit of a pattern."
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 63.20 U.S. cents, down from
63.47 Monday.
</P>
<P>
It traded between 63.15 and 63.38 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The market was still concentrating on any developments that
might arise in the United States, and another rate cut there would
further increase the chances of an easing here, Volanakis said.
</P>
<P>
"Every day around 9:30 a.m. (local time) there's the fear that
the RBA might cut rates," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished at 72.84 Japanese yen from 72.64
and 1.0329 German marks from 1.0267.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar gained against the Japanese yen, buying 115.38
from 114.56, it was also trading at 1.6345 German marks from
1.6178 previously.
</P>
<P>
Volanakis said market sentiment on where the Australian dollar
was going was currently neutral. "I think the market is undecided,
but overall the sentiment is that the Aussie could see higher
levels again."

<HEADLINE> China to Encourage More Overseas Investment in Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China will take measures to
divert overseas investment into agricultural sector in the coming
years, according to sources with the Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Fair for Central and West China, which ended here
today.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural experts said that China needs to increase its
grain output by 50 million tons before the end of this century,
and also needs to expand agricultural investment by 130 to 180
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Policies guiding overseas investment in China's agricultural
industries are also being drafted, they said, adding that more
state investment will also be put into these sectors.
</P>
<P>
In the south, Guangdong Province has worked out preferential
policies to encourage overseas investors to agricultural sectors.
</P>
<P>
About 14 provinces, cities and autonomous regions in central
and western China also listed several hundred agricultural
projects at the fair, winning favor from overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said that China's agriculture can expect to
pull in more funds from overseas since agricultural
investment has few risks, but pays off handsomely.
</P>
<P>
One American company has decided to invest 46 million
U.S. dollars in a pig farm in Hunan Province, which is capable of
breeding 200,000 fine breed pigs a year.

<HEADLINE> Produce More Iodized Salt, Angolan Govt. Told </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan National Commission
of Technology for Iodized Salt has called upon the government to
work out an emergent plan to increase the production of iodized
salt.
</P>
<P>
Coordinator of the commission Filomena Da Mata made the call
Monday at a function marking the World Day for Wiping Out Iodine
Deficiency, Journal of Angola reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Da Mata said that Angola now produces only 48,000 tons of salt
while 60,000 tons are demanded, and noted that of the 48,000 tons
produced, only 8,000 tons are iodized.
</P>
<P>
"Although the government is aiming at selling iodized salt,
half of the salt on sale across the country is not iodized," said
the coordinator.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the priority of the government is to increase
the production of salt and therefore, the salt fields in the
province of Zaire, Luanda, Benguela, Kwanza-Sul and Namibe should
be rehabilitated as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
According to Da Mata, by 1990, there had been 30,000 cases of
goitrous tumor, which means 50 cases in 10,000 inhabitants.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Military Ready to Accept Any Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Israel Defense Force
(IDF) will implement any agreement reached in the U.S. between
Israeli and the Palestinians, said IDF Chief of General Staff
Lt.-Gen. Shaul Mofaz Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters in northern Israel, Mofaz said that he
has no idea whether any progress was made in peace talks between
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat in the, but the IDF is ready to implement whatever
agreement to be reached at the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks sponsored by the U.S. at
the Wye Plantation outside Washington entered its sixth day
Tuesday. Israel Radio quoted Israeli and Palestinian sources at
the talks as saying that some progress was made so far, especially
on the issue of Israel's second stage troop redeployment in the
West bank, the opening of the Gaza airport and the Karni
industrial park.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's talks were centered on the issue of security
cooperation between the two sides due to the impact of Monday's
grenade throwing incident occurred at Israel's souther desert
city of Beersheba, other reports said.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian from the West Bank city of Hebron threw two
hand grenades into the central bus station in Beersheba Monday
morning, and 64 people were injured by the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this issue, Mofaz said that Palestinian assailant
was in the hands of Israeli police and initial interrogations
showed that more arrests must follow.
</P>
<P>
The assailant said he acted alone, but investigation indicated
that some other Palestinians were also involved in this incident,
Mofaz said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian police has identified the assailant as a
29-year-old construction worker from Hebron and a father of five
children.
</P>
<P>
The incident caused outcry and anger among the Israeli people
and politicians. Israel's right-wing politicians opposing the
Oslo Accords have requested Netanyahu to stop the Wye plantation
talks and return home.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Monday the attack was grave and could not be
taken lightly. He and Arafat issued Monday a joint statement at
Wye Plantation to condemn the attack.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also phoned President Ezer Weizman Monday night and
expressed his sorrow over the incident, asking him to relay
his get-well wishes to those wounded in the attack.

<HEADLINE> Pay Boost for Hoddle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association (FA)
of England are set to offer Glenn Hoddle a pay rise of around
100,000 pounds a year -- but with most of the increase dependent
upon qualification for the Euro 2000 finals.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle resumed pay negotiations with FA chief executive Graham
Kelly after they were postponed for two weeks while the England
coach prepared his squad for the qualifying double-header against
Bulgaria and Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Kelly has already admitted he understands the "sensitivities"
of offering a large salary increase to a coach who is currently
under fire in the wake of England's poor qualifying campaign
performances and results.
</P>
<P>
But it seems he has now reached an outline agreement with
Hoddle to boost the England coach's current salary, estimated to
be around 250,000 a year, by up to 40%.
</P>
<P>
But the increase is mostly performance-related, dependent upon
results and qualification for the Euro 2000 finals.
</P>
<P>
The deal still has to be agreed when the FA's international
sub-committee, which has the power to finalise contract and pay
negotiations, meets again, probably next week.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle has defended his right to a pay rise despite England's
demise since the World Cup saying: "Football can turn around so
quickly.
</P>
<P>
"It has done this way around and it can turn right back round
again -- and people would then say yes, he deserved it a pay
rise."

questioning it, " he said.

<HEADLINE> Lucent Sees Bigger Potential in China's Data Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The biggest problem facing
China's telecommunications industry is how to raise the efficiency
of the existing network in order to generate higher returns on
investment, an expert from Lucent Technologies of the United
States said here today.
</P>
<P>
Rau C. Chang, vice president of Lucent Technologies (China)
Co. Ltd., told a press conference that as a major partner of
the Chinese telecommunications industry, Lucent has noticed that
the evolution of information technology is proceeding faster than
construction of telecommunications networks in China.
</P>
<P>
China invests several hundred billion yuan in construction of
telecommunications infrastructures every year. China Telecom, one
of the country's major service providers, has spent 11 billion
U.S. dollars introducing foreign technologies and equipment over
the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Lucent accounts for 40 percent of the optic transmission
equipment market in China, which has developed the largest fiber
optic cable network in the world. Lucent won six of the nine
construction projects for trunk optic cables put forward by China
Telecom for international bidding this year.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that the time interval between generations of new
telecommunications technology is becoming increasingly shorter,
and that the integration of voice, data and frame communications
is the trend of the future for telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has to improve the planning, construction,
operation and maintenance of existing networks in order to realize
the highest possible return for its huge investment in
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Chang said he believes that China should take into
consideration the trend of technological development in the world
today as it builds its telecommunications networks. For example,
localities should give priority to data communications while
building local networks.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, the China telecommunications market may see
the fastest growth in such sectors as intelligent exchanges,
providing Internet service, transmission, fiber optic cable
networks and network management. This shows that China's
telecommunications network still has a large potential waiting to
be tapped.
</P>
<P>
Lucent China set up a data networking systems team here today
to meet the fast-growing need of China's data communications
market.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that Lucent will use its world-class network service
expertise to help China smoothly go through the
telecommunications technologies revolution.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets Vietnamese Prime Minister (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that China and Viet Nam should do a good job with
their modernization drive, and contribute to the regional peace,
stability and development.
</P>
<P>
This is where the overall interests of bilateral relations
lie, Jiang said during his meeting with Vietnamese Prime Minister
Phan Van Khai.
</P>
<P>
As long as China and Viet Nam proceed from this overall
situation and redouble their efforts, Jiang said, the cause of
their socialism will prosper and thrive, and their
good-neighborliness and relations of mutual-beneficial cooperation
will enter into a new period of growth.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China and Viet Nam share common ideals and goals
of development, follow the leadership of the Communist Party and
the socialist line, adhere to reform and opening up, and are both
dedicated to their economic development.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between the two communist parties and the two
countries ushered into a new phase of development in September
1990, and the meetings between leaders of both countries have laid
a foundation for further growth, the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the leaders of the two parties and the two nations
have maintained close contact, and bilateral cooperation has
witnessed an overall restoration and growth in various fields.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang noted that he had reached consensus in July last year
with then general secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party
Central Committee Do Muoi to sign the land border treaty before
the year 2000, and conclude the demarcation of the Beibu Gulf by
the end of this century, which has set the goal for border
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his delight over the important progress made at
the government-level negotiations through efforts over the past
year and more.
</P>
<P>
To settle the border issue, which has been left over by history
conforms with the fundamental interest of both countries, and they
should "scale the height and view farther" and solve the problem
at an earlier date so as to bring a peaceful, friendly and stable
border line into the next century, he said.
</P>
<P>
The second major consensus he reached with Muoi, Jiang noted,
is that both sides should take effective measures to bolster
economic and trade co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Jiang noted, Phan has made new efforts to resolve the
above issues through his current visit, and this will undoubtedly
push forward the relationship between the two parties and two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Phan said that since the normalization of relations between the
two countries, the relations between the two parties have been
getting closer. Both countries implemented reform and opening up
policy, and their friendly co-operation is of vital importance to
the regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Viet Nam is both willing and resolved to work together with
China to put into practice the consensus reached between Jiang and
Muoi, Prime Minister Phan said, adding that it is of major
historic importance for the leaders of the present generation to
settle the border issue and further reinforce bilateral mutual
co-operation, as this will benefit the coming generations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang asked Phan to convey his regards to Le Kha Phieu, general
secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party Central Committee, and
hoped Le will make his next year's China trip as early as
possible.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Urges Religious Groups Not to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Tuesday urged religious groups to refrain from hating and
holding grudges against one another.
</P>
<P>
Open and fair dialogues are needed for the purpose, the
president said when opening the 4th conference of the Indonesian
Pentecostal Council at the state palace here.
</P>
<P>
Harmony among religious communities would not be achieved if
they close themselves to dialogues, more so if they are suspicious
of one another, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the head of state, religious figures play a
decisive role in giving guidance to the people in the face of
problems.
</P>
<P>
Religious institutions and organizations likewise play a
significant role in creating religious harmony through the
promotion of dialogues to settle problems.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that although Indonesia's is a
heterogeneous society, its plurality should not hamper efforts to
build a strong national life.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, approximately 87 percent of the population are
Muslims. However, Christianity, Hinduism and Buddhism are equally
recognized in the country.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on Noted Chinese Film Director </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- This year is the 50th
anniversary of film directing by Xie Jin, a renowned Chinese film
artist. A series of activities to mark the occasion began in
Beijing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The activities, including film exhibitions, photo shows and
seminars, are sponsored by four central and local art
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing wrote a letter to the occasion quoting
President Jiang Zemin as saying that Chinese film artists should
"produce more fine works, boost the prosperity of the film
industry, make greater achievements, and look forward to the new
century".
</P>
<P>
Li, who is a member of the Standing Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Political Bureau, urged
artists to display fine traditions of the Chinese film sector,
learn about the cream of films produced by foreign film studios,
and turn out good products for the forthcoming 50th anniversary of
the founding of the People's Republic.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams U.S. "Illegal Conducts" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has urged the United
Nations Security Council to seriously discuss America's hostile
policy and illegal conducts against Iraq and to help put an end to
them.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency reported Tuesday that in an official
letter sent by Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf on
Monday to the Security Council, Iraq warns that U.S. anti-Iraq
policy threatens security and peace in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
"The use of force which the U.S. government has been
practicising against Iraq's sovereignty, security, territorial
integrity and political independence...constitute a flagrant
violation of the U.N. Charter and all rules of international law,"
reads the letter.
</P>
<P>
The letter says that the imposition of no-fly zones by the
U.S. in northern and southern Iraq is a "unilateral, illegal and
illegitimate," because the U.S. government did not possess any
authorization by the Security Council to carry out these conducts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., Britain and France imposed a no-fly zone in northern
Iraq in June 1991 in the name of protecting Iraqi Kurdish minority
from government troop attack, and in August 1992 established
another no-fly zone in southern Iraq with a declared aim of
protecting Iraqi Shiite Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution 687 adopted in 1991 provides for putting an
end to hostile military acts totally, and any resumption of such
acts should get the authorization from the Security Council, says
the letter.
</P>
<P>
It also accuses the U.S. of creating flimsy pretext to justify
its aggressive missile attacks against Iraq in January 1993, June
1993 and August 1996, which "killed a number of civilians and
caused huge damage to the national installations."
</P>
<P>
The letter slams the involvement of the U.S. government in the
secret operations which the American Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) had carried out to overthrow President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
It points out that CIA officer Warren Mareik admitted in an
article carried by U.S. Washington Post newspaper in June 1997
that the secret operation against the legitimate authority in Iraq
had cost huge sums of money no less than 100 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the U.N. economic sanctions on Iraq following its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, the letter says "they were basically designed
and maintained till now to achieve illegal political U.S. purpose
rather than as it has been alleged to ensure the implementation of
relevant Security Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
The letter refers to U.S. President Bill Clinton's remarks in
November 1997 that "the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq will
remain in place as long as President Saddam Hussein is still in
power," stressing that Clinton's remarks reflect the U.S.
persistence in maintaining the unjust embargo in spite of Iraq's
implementation of all the requirements of relevant U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
It also accuses the U.S. government of assisting and
organizing Iraq's opposition groups abroad "to change Saddam's
regime."

<HEADLINE> Longevity Research May Find Genetic Clues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists hope to find
some genetic clues to questions of human longevity after the
conclusion of a nationwide research program early next year.
</P>
<P>
Blood samples taken from the fingertips or earlobes of people
aged 80 or older will undergo genetic analysis, according to a
research team composed of experts from Beijing University and the
China Research Center on Aging (CRCA).
</P>
<P>
The blood samples will be taken only after providers and their
families are fully informed and their safety guaranteed, stressed
Xiao Zhenyu, CRCA's deputy director.
</P>
<P>
The program also includes the investigation of non-genetic
factors related to the life span of senior Chinese, such as
individual conditions, family background, characteristics, life styles
and eating habits.
</P>
<P>
"So far, we've received more than 8,000 questionnaires and some
2,700 blood samples. Initial results will be published early next
year," Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to finding out which kinds of
individual, family, social, environmental and genetic factors are
favorable or unfavorable to human longevity," said Prof. Zeng Yi,
head of the research team.
</P>
<P>
Experts have estimated that factors determining a person's
life span are 25 percent genetic and 75 percent non-genetic,
according to Zeng, director of the Institute of Population
Research and a World Health Organization collaborating center at
Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
Research results will also be used for reference as China's
governments and legislators formulate policies and laws related to
senior citizens, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has a fast-growing aging population with over eight
million people over 80 years old. Experts estimate that this
figure will surpass 25.4 million by 2010 and reach 160 million in
the middle of the next century.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time China has conducted national-level
longevity research.

<HEADLINE> Police Intensify Crackdown on Crimes in Flood-hit Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Alerted by signs of increasing
criminal activity in the areas devastated by floods this summer,
Chinese public securities authorities are considering measures to
effectively safeguard social stability and reconstruction in these
regions.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference on security in flood-affected areas,
vice minister of Public Security Mo Xinsheng said that there has
been a recent rise in the number of disputes and gang crimes in
the provinces of Jilin, Heilongjiang, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi
and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, where police cracked
over 5,800 criminal cases in September alone.
</P>
<P>
In some areas, a growing number of people are leaving their
hometowns to seek jobs in other places, bringing about
risky conditions in the recipient regions, Mo said.
</P>
<P>
The damaged roads in these regions and poor infrastructure in
temporary residential areas are posing grave challenges to the
efforts of local police, fire-fighters and traffic administrators.
</P>
<P>
Mo said the police force in flood-stricken areas will be
reinforced to maintain high vigilance and insure tough punishment
for criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
Theft, robbery, and swindling will be the focus of the
crackdown, along with activities seriously affecting people's
lives including price gouging and market monopolizing, which will
be dealt with severely, the vice minister said.

<HEADLINE> HK GDP Shrinks 5.2 Percent in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's gross domestic
product (GDP) fell 5.2 percent in real terms in the second quarter
of 1998 from a year earlier, mainly due to the further slackening
in both domestic demand and export performance.
</P>
<P>
The Census and Statistics Department revealed Tuesday the
preliminary estimates of the expenditure-based GDP for the second
quarter of 1998. The 5.2 percent GDP fall was very close to the
initial assessment of a 5 percent decline produced in late
August.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account more information available, the department
slightly revised the year-on-year growth rate of GDP for the first
quarter of 1998, from -2.8 percent to -2.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> No Compensation for Petrol Fire Victims: Abubakar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian leader General Abubakar
said Monday that the government will not offer any compensation
to families of Saturday's petrol fire victims, because it was an
act of sabotage.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar, who paid a personal visit to the scene at Jesse
town, near Warri City in Delta State in the south bordering the
Gulf of Guinea, said, "I want to state very clearly that there is
no relief to the families of the victims by the government. What
we would do on humanitarian grounds is to pick the hospital bills
of the injured."
</P>
<P>
"I see a human tragedy and we will do the best we can to
alleviate it... We are trying to see what can be done," said
Abubakar, who flew to the scene in a helicopter at about 3:00
p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, he continued that "there is no way government can
prevent this type of incident, unless the people stop the
vandalization of petroleum pipelines and other government
properties."
</P>
<P>
According to the official News Agency of Nigeria which cited a
police source at Jesse town, 700 people have died in the
incident, while unconfirmed reports said the figure may have
risen to 1,000.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened at the weekend when hundreds of people
from nearby villages rushed to Jesse with various tools to scoop
oil from a leaking pipeline believed to be cut by vandalizers.
</P>
<P>
During the process, there was suddenly a fire that gulped the
whole area, killing about 300 people instantly, with charred
bodies littering all over the place.
</P>
<P>
According to the state-owned Pipelines and Products Marketing
Company, the blazed pipeline is used to transport fuel from the
Warri refinery to the Benin City in neighboring Edo State.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson of the company said it is not responsible in
any way for the accident, because the company has been struggling
with pipeline vandalization for years.
</P>
<P>
As the flow in the pipeline has been switched off, it is
expected that the fire will die down in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 120 unidentifiable bodies have been buried in
a mass grave as ordered by Delta State Administrator Walter
Feghabo.

</P>
<P>
Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian, who is also vice chairman
of the Central Military Commission and state councillor, made this

the further development of relations between the two armed forces.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Shrinks in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's external trade in
September 1998 fell by 9.2 per cent year-on year in total volume,
with imports and exports sliding by 16.9 per cent and 0.9 per cent
respectively, according to statistics released Tuesday by
Singapore Trade Development Board.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports (NODX) expanded marginally by 1.4 per
cent in September 1998, half the growth rate in August. September
saw a 6 per cent growth in non-electronic exports and 0.6 per cent
decline in electronics exports. The growth offsets the declines,
resulting in the overall positive growth in non-oil domestic
exports.
</P>
<P>
Of the top five markets for non-oil domestic exports, EU
remained buoyant with a strong growth of 19.9 per cent, the U.S.
began to soften with a marginal increase of 0.7 per cent while the
other remaining top markets, namely Malaysia, Hong Kong and
Japan, shrank by 3.2, 14.2 and 12.5 per cent respectively. Non-oil
domestic exports to the emerging markets expanded 10.1 per cent in
September 1998.
</P>
<P>
Domestic exports of oil continued to decline in September,
sliding 15.3 per cent over September, 1997. The decline was
attributed to the depressed oil price and weak demand from major
Asian markets such as Hong Kong and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil re-exports dipped by 0.8 per cent compared to that in
September, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil imports, excluding lumpy items such as aircraft and
ships, shrank by 17.1 per cent in September, 1998, over a year
ago.

<HEADLINE> China Celebrates World Human Rights Declaration Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China has launched a series of
events to mark the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Tang Guoqiang told a
regular news conference here today.
</P>
<P>
China has published the declaration and other human rights
documents of the United Nations lately and, in line with its
specific national conditions, the country has conducted law
promotion activities in an effort to improve the Chinese citizens'
awareness in the protection of their legal rights, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Internationally, China has sponsored along with the European
Union and Canada and other nations seminars on human rights and
justice. Meanwhile, China is preparing to hold several more
international symposiums on human rights.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always spoke highly of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, Tang said. President Jiang Zemin said
in a letter in reply to Kofi Annan, secretary general of the
United Nations, in January this year that the declaration has
played a vital role in promoting the cause of world human rights,
and that the Chinese Government fully supports the U.N. in
reviewing and summarizing the work it had done on human rights at
the moment of the 50th anniversary of the declaration, and mapping
out future plans.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government signed the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights earlier this month. And it signed last
year the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights, which has been submitted to the National People's Congress
for deliberation.
</P>
<P>
All those efforts have shown China's readiness to make
continuous efforts to further promote the development of world
human rights cause together with other nations of the world, said
the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nigeria's Crude Oil Export Threatened (by Wang Jinyu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's crude oil exports have
come under serious threat as warring Ijaw youths in the Niger
Delta are extending their attacks on the country's oil terminals
and export vessels.
</P>
<P>
On August 19, the Egbesu Boys of Africa, a group of Ijaw
freedom fighters, declared a "war" on all oil companies and their
contractors in the Niger Delta.
</P>
<P>
During the past two months, the Egbesu Boys have at least
seized four boats and two helicopters belonging to oil companies
operating in the area.
</P>
<P>
Last week, four Chevron workers including the supervisor of
the Abiteye flowstation are still being detained inside the
flowstation as hostage by irate Ijaw youths.
</P>
<P>
Sources of oil industry disclosed that the Escravos waterways
are being ruled by pirates and an oil tanker was attacked last
week along the Escravos River.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, three boats carrying oil workers to production
sites were attacked and about four workers are still held hostage
from a total 40 held since last week.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the local communities had pledged to
halt oil production and export until their demands including more
social facilities, employment opportunities and contract from the
oil companies were met.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting of the Federal Executive Council held last
week in Nigerian capital Abuja, Information and Culture Minister
John Nwodo said that serious disruption to oil exploration and
production in the Niger Delta had been going on in the past two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
In some cases, he noted, there had been disruption of
pipelines, kidnaping of oil workers while some multi-national oil
companies in the affected areas had experienced substantial
disruption to their activities.
</P>
<P>
Oil industrial sources said that Shell and Agip oil companies
were losing a total of 508,000 barrels of crude oil per day to
the protest by the Ijaw youths.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Chevron Nigeria Limited shut down six flowstations
and was losing 125,000 barrels of crude oil per day due to the
closure.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Nigeria's oil export was estimated to have been cut
by one third of more than two million barrels of crude oil per
day, leading to the failure of export commitment.
</P>
<P>
The recent disruption of oil production and export by Ijaw
youths was attributed to the dissatisfaction of their demands by
the Federal Government and oil companies.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has agreed to set aside three percent
of the revenue generated from oil sources specifically for the
development of the oil producing communities.
</P>
<P>
However, the local communities see the percentage as grossly
inadequate to make for the pain of deprivation, devastation and
potential danger that oil operations pose to the communities'
environment, demanding that the percentage be increased to 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
On October 11, The Egbesu Boys of Africa wrote a letter to
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar, setting
conditions for the "ceasefire" on the disruption of oil
exploration and production.
</P>
<P>
According to the letter, the conditions include the
construction of a dualized road linking all oil producing
communities, the creation of more local councils in Bayelsa
State, and provision of pipe-borne water, electricity, cottage
hospitals and telecommunications network.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that although the Niger Delta is endowed with
enormous wealth, there are no enough schools and hospitals in the
area and the poverty rate is too high.
</P>
<P>
The dissatisfaction of the local communities was believed to
be the source of the incessant sabotage of oil production
facilities including the huge fire on October 18 resulting in a
death toll of some 1,000.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Promulgates New School Admission Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The South African
Education Department has promulgated a new school admission
policy, under which pupils in public schools will not be promoted
to a higher grade when they fail in decisive exams more than
once.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Sibusiso Bengu said Monday that from
January 2000, pupils in the country would be allowed to enter
grade one only when they turned seven.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to save the Education Department about
1.4 billion Rand (about 250 million U.S. Dollars) from its 40
billion Rand (about 727 million Dollars), Bengu was quoted by the
Citizen daily as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the policy, parents must present the school with
an official birth certificate of the pupil. Making a false
declaration about the age of a child will become a criminal
offense.
</P>
<P>
When applying for admission, parents must prove that the child
has been immunized against communicable diseases such as polio,
measles, tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus and hepatitis B.
</P>
<P>
Public schools will not be allowed to suspend pupils from
classes, deny them access to cultural, sporting or social
activities and refuse to issue school reports or transfer
certificates, if parents have not paid school fees.
</P>
<P>
The document created, for the first time in South African
history, a common administrative framework to regulate access to
all ordinary public schools, Bengu said.
</P>
<P>
The admission policy and age-grade norms will put a
stop to laissez faire practices in the admission of learners to
public schools. It will also reinforce the statutory obligation
placed on parents to ensure the compulsory school attendance of
all young learners in school, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the policy, a pupil will be able to repeat only
one year per school phase, with the phases outlined as grade one
to three, grades four to six and grades seven to nine.
</P>
<P>
"This will curb another serious problem, namely the phenomenon
of serial repeaters," Bengu said, noting that the reason for
making the rule was that few repeaters succeed and they result in
huge and wasteful costs which the government cannot afford.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Tuesday clarified
its stand on the defense cooperation with the Philippines, saying
the defense cooperation meeting between the two countries at the
end of this month has been postponed and not canceled.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and the Philippines have a good military relationship
and "Malaysia has no intention of breaking any bilateral
arrangement. I have instructed my officers to find a suitable
date," Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar told reporters here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said a new date convenient to both sides for the meeting,
which was originally scheduled for October 28 to 30 in Manila,
would be fixed.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said the postponement "has nothing to do
with strained relations".
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two Southeast Asian countries were
strained because of Philippines President Joseph Estrada's
reported criticism of Malaysia in his support for former deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
Defense cooperation between Malaysia and the Philippines has
been established since 1994.

<HEADLINE> Estrada: Philippine-Malaysian Ties Remain Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- President Joseph Estrada said
here Tuesday that the Philippine-Malaysian relations remain strong
despite the deferment of a meeting on defense cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine president stressed that the deferment has noting
to do with his advocacy on "human rights" and "due process" in the
trial of former Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the meeting was merely postponed because of
scheduling problems and that he looks forward to a "fruitful
meeting" with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad during the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Kuala Lumpur
next month.
</P>
<P>
"There is no connection," Estrada said when asked by reporters
if the suspension of the meeting was linked to his personal
support for Anwar.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was arrested two weeks ago for violating the Internal
Security Act of Malaysia and will be tried sooner.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that he does not think his statements on Anwar
would jeopardize the interest of some 300,000 Filipino workers in
Malaysia, saying "my personal opinion and my personal feeling has
no connection with the status of the workers there."
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government has begun driving some 50,000 illegal
Filipino workers out of Malaysia since the beginning of this year
due to economic difficulties caused by the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
It was learned here that some 200 supporters of Prime Minister
Mahathir went to the Philippine embassy in Kuala Lumpur Tuesday to
protest President Estrada's support for Anwar.
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said
that Malaysia remains a strong ally of the Philippines in
Southeast Asia despite the temporary differences between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Our ties with Malaysia are strong. Malaysia is our friend and
not our enemy," Mercado said, adding that the relations between
the two countries are likely to go back to normal soon once both
governments thresh out their difference.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nigeria's Crude Oil Export Threatened (by Wang Jinyu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's crude oil exports have
come under serious threat as warring Ijaw youths in the Niger
Delta are extending their attacks on the country's oil terminals
and export vessels.
</P>
<P>
On August 19, the Egbesu Boys of Africa, a group of Ijaw
freedom fighters, declared a "war" on all oil companies and their
contractors in the Niger Delta.
</P>
<P>
During the past two months, the Egbesu Boys have at least
seized four boats and two helicopters belonging to oil companies
operating in the area.
</P>
<P>
Last week, four Chevron workers including the supervisor of
the Abiteye flowstation are still being detained inside the
flowstation as hostage by irate Ijaw youths.
</P>
<P>
Sources of oil industry disclosed that the Escravos waterways
are being ruled by pirates and an oil tanker was attacked last
week along the Escravos River.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, three boats carrying oil workers to production
sites were attacked and about four workers are still held hostage
from a total 40 held since last week.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the local communities had pledged to
halt oil production and export until their demands including more
social facilities, employment opportunities and contract from the
oil companies were met.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting of the Federal Executive Council held last
week in Nigerian capital Abuja, Information and Culture Minister
John Nwodo said that serious disruption to oil exploration and
production in the Niger Delta had been going on in the past two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
In some cases, he noted, there had been disruption of
pipelines, kidnaping of oil workers while some multi-national oil
companies in the affected areas had experienced substantial
disruption to their activities.
</P>
<P>
Oil industrial sources said that Shell and Agip oil companies
were losing a total of 508,000 barrels of crude oil per day to
the protest by the Ijaw youths.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Chevron Nigeria Limited shut down six flowstations
and was losing 125,000 barrels of crude oil per day due to the
closure.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Nigeria's oil export was estimated to have been cut
by one third of more than two million barrels of crude oil per
day, leading to the failure of export commitment.
</P>
<P>
The recent disruption of oil production and export by Ijaw
youths was attributed to the dissatisfaction of their demands by
the Federal Government and oil companies.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has agreed to set aside three percent
of the revenue generated from oil sources specifically for the
development of the oil producing communities.
</P>
<P>
However, the local communities see the percentage as grossly
inadequate to make for the pain of deprivation, devastation and
potential danger that oil operations pose to the communities'
environment, demanding that the percentage be increased to 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
On October 11, The Egbesu Boys of Africa wrote a letter to
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar, setting
conditions for the "ceasefire" on the disruption of oil
exploration and production.
</P>
<P>
According to the letter, the conditions include the
construction of a dualized road linking all oil producing
communities, the creation of more local councils in Bayelsa
State, and provision of pipe-borne water, electricity, cottage
hospitals and telecommunications network.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that although the Niger Delta is endowed with
enormous wealth, there are no enough schools and hospitals in the
area and the poverty rate is too high.
</P>
<P>
The dissatisfaction of the local communities was believed to
be the source of the incessant sabotage of oil production
facilities including the huge fire on October 18 resulting in a
death toll of some 1,000.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Promulgates New School Admission Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The South African
Education Department has promulgated a new school admission
policy, under which pupils in public schools will not be promoted
to a higher grade when they fail in decisive exams more than
once.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Sibusiso Bengu said Monday that from
January 2000, pupils in the country would be allowed to enter
grade one only when they turned seven.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to save the Education Department about
1.4 billion Rand (about 250 million U.S. Dollars) from its 40
billion Rand (about 727 million Dollars), Bengu was quoted by the
Citizen daily as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the policy, parents must present the school with
an official birth certificate of the pupil. Making a false
declaration about the age of a child will become a criminal
offense.
</P>
<P>
When applying for admission, parents must prove that the child
has been immunized against communicable diseases such as polio,
measles, tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus and hepatitis B.
</P>
<P>
Public schools will not be allowed to suspend pupils from
classes, deny them access to cultural, sporting or social
activities and refuse to issue school reports or transfer
certificates, if parents have not paid school fees.
</P>
<P>
The document created, for the first time in South African
history, a common administrative framework to regulate access to
all ordinary public schools, Bengu said.
</P>
<P>
The admission policy and age-grade norms will put a
stop to laissez faire practices in the admission of learners to
public schools. It will also reinforce the statutory obligation
placed on parents to ensure the compulsory school attendance of
all young learners in school, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the policy, a pupil will be able to repeat only
one year per school phase, with the phases outlined as grade one
to three, grades four to six and grades seven to nine.
</P>
<P>
"This will curb another serious problem, namely the phenomenon
of serial repeaters," Bengu said, noting that the reason for
making the rule was that few repeaters succeed and they result in
huge and wasteful costs which the government cannot afford.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Correcting the foreign population figure 9th para hke -- Schroeder, Greens Ink Coalition Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- After two weeks of negotiations,
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democratic Party (SPD)
Tuesday signed an agreement with the Greens party to form
Germany's new government.
</P>
<P>
The 50-page accord, if approved by the two parties at their
conventions later this week, would create the first-ever
SPD-Greens coalition government in Germany's post-war history.
</P>
<P>
Under the coalition accord, the SPD and Greens set fighting
unemployment, stuck above 10 percent, as their top priority.
</P>
<P>
As a key measure, they will introduce a so-called "Alliance for
Jobs", a forum for government, employers and trade unions to work
together to create jobs and training places.
</P>
<P>
The two parties also pledge to introduce a 10-billion-mark (6
billion U.S. dollar) cut in income and corporate taxes while
raising energy prices to finance reductions in social-benefit
payments made by employers and employees.
</P>
<P>
Vowing to defend social justice, the new government will also
roll back state pension cuts made by the outgoing government of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and will seek other measures to save the
pension system threatened in Germany by the aging population.
</P>
<P>
As a reflection of the Greens' demand for better environment
protection, the new government will start negotiations with the
energy industry with the ultimate goal to shut down all nuclear
power plants which currently provide about one third of the
country's energy supply.
</P>
<P>
Eager to enter federal government for the first time since its
founding in 1979, the ecologist and pacifist Greens has refrained
from asserting many of its controversial demands such as a call
for Germany to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) or to bar Germany from participating in
international peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
Under the coalition accord, the SPD and Greens pledge
continuity in German foreign policy and say that the new
government will hold on to the German commitment to European
integration and the transatlantic partnership.
</P>
<P>
The new government is also planning to liberalize Germany's
strict citizenship law to allow dual citizenship and ease the
integration into the German society of the country's 7 million
foreign population.
</P>
<P>
As the dominant one in the coalition government, the SPD will
have 11 ministerial posts with party chairman, Oskar Lafontaine,
to head the Finance Ministry, and SPD parliamentary leader, Rudolf
Scharping, to become defence minister.
</P>
<P>
The Greens, which will serve as the junior partner in the new
ruling coalition, has won three cabinet post with party leader
Joschka Fischer to become foreign minister and vice-chancellor.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder is due to be formally elected as the chancellor by
the new parliament on October 27. His cabinet will be sworn in
soon afterward.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft's Business Undisturbed by Antitrust Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Business seemed as usual at
Microsoft headquarters on the first day of the U.S. government's
antitrust trial against this software giant.
</P>
<P>
On Monday in Washington D.C., the federal government and 20
states kicked off the trial that accused Microsoft of illegal
activities, including bullying competitors.
</P>
<P>
Back in Seattle, Washington state, where Microsoft is based,
the company fired off five upbeat, product-oriented press releases
and other announcements.
</P>
<P>
Its Web site on Monday carried two articles in favor of
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
One of them is entitled "Economist experts challenge underlying
assumptions in government's case," quoting them as saying that the
government antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft is depending on
theories that are not supported by the realities of the
marketplace or current economic research.
</P>
<P>
The other which was carried by Los Angeles Times said that
Microsoft is wrongly targeted and consumers would be losers if the
government wins.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Microsoft is scheduled to release its quarterly
financial results, as analysts predicted another solid,
high-profit quarter.
</P>
<P>
Computer Reseller News on Monday quoted a Microsoft employee as
saying that "we are all concentrating on our individual jobs and
only a small number of attorneys and executives are focused on the
trial."

<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Special Envoy Lakhdar
Brahimi Tuesday expressed the hope that his talks with leaders of
Afghanistan and Iran will reduce tension between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, who is on a shuttling peace mission in the region, was
talking to journalists at Chakalala airbase here before his
departure for Tehran after holding talks with the Taliban
leadership and Pakistani officials.
</P>
<P>
He said he will inform the Iranian government about results
that his mission has so far achieved.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to talk about the necessity of achieving real
peace in Afghanistan," said Brahimi, who will also tour the
Central Asian countries in the coming few days.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi said he was very grateful to the Pakistan government as
it has reaffirmed its support and willingness to cooperate with
the U.N. and the Organization of the Islamic Conference in their
efforts for peace in the region and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi had secured the release of all the Iranians held by
Taliban during his talks with the militia's supreme leader Mulla
Omar in Kandahar, southern Afghanistan, last week.
</P>
<P>
His visit to the region follows an understanding reached by
Afghanistan's six immediate neighbors plus the United States and
Russia in September in New York.
</P>
<P>
The six-plus-two conference had called for an immediate
ceasefire by the Afghan warring factions and defusion of tensions
between the Taliban and Iran caused by the murder of Iranian
diplomats in northern Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Garment Fair Brings New Orders to Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The figure was much higher than the 38.35 million dollars'
worth of business transacted at last year's exposition, BGMEA
President Mostafa Golam Quddus told a press conference at the
Sonargoan Hotel.
</P>
<P>
The volume would rise to 47 million dollars if transactions on
the stock lot was included, he said.
</P>
<P>
The country's garment industry was expected to receive more
orders amounting to 350 million dollars within the next three
months, according to Quddus.
</P>
<P>
The BATEXPO, the largest exposition of the country's apparel
and textile industry, was originally slated for October 16 to 18,
but was extended for one more day due the hartal last Sunday
called by the country's seven-party opposition alliance in protest
of the government's "failures" in conducting post-flood
rehabilitation programs and "fabricated" cases against opposition
leaders and workers.
</P>
<P>
A total of 79 firms from at home and abroad participated in the
fair, which has been held annually to promote export of the
country's apparel and textiles products since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Some 478 businessmen, including 103 foreign businessmen from
such countries as the United States, Canada, Britain, France,
Germany, Japan, Thailand and Singapore, attended the four-day
exposition, Quddus told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The ready-made garments, growing at an annual rate of over 20
percent over the past few years, has become the country's largest
foreign exchange earner, which along with the textiles industry
contributed over 70 percent to the country's foreign exchange
earnings last year.
</P>
<P>
The country exported 3.43 billion U.S. dollars' worth of
apparel in 1997, and the export is expected to cross 4 billion
dollars this year, according to the BGMEA president.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 2,700 garment manufacturers and exporters

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Media Unhappy About Peace Talks with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Most of Pakistan's major
newspapers Tuesday expressed their dissatisfaction over the
just-concluded peace talks between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing new that the two sides said on the
conclusion of the dialogue. It was almost a replica of any such
past exercise: the two sides sitting together, reiterating their
positions, and then dispersing to meet again, but without making
any headway," said The Muslim.
</P>
<P>
The News echoed The Muslim's remarks by saying the joint
statement "made the usual noises" about the need for durable peace
and security, and the commitment by both sides to reduce the risk
of conflict by building mutual confidence in the nuclear and
conventional realms.
</P>
<P>
"The key question that is raised by the lack of substantive
advance in the Islamabad talks is that if no framework could be
agreed upon to continue discussions on either peace and security
and on Kashmir, how will any future dialogue on this be sustained
? " asked The News.
</P>
<P>
However, The Frontier Post saw a "promising note" from the
foreign secretary-level talks which were regarded essential for
the improvement of the relations between the hostile neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"Though there has been no tangible progress in terms of an
agreement, both sides have shown understanding for maintaining
restraint. At least they have agreed to take steps that would
reduce the risk of a nuclear war or a conventional war on the
sub-continent," the newspaper noted.
</P>
<P>
But the Frontier Post also emphasized that "the real dawn of
peace on the sub-continent will materialize once the Kashmir issue
is resolved."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India held a foreign secretary-level meeting on
the Kashmir issue between October 16-18 in the Pakistani capital
of Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
After three days of talks, Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad
Ahmad and his Indian counterpart K. Ragunath admitted on Sunday in
a joint statement that they had made no concrete progress.
</P>
<P>
However, with the next round of talks scheduled to be held in
the first half of February, the two senior officials said their
two countries would keep up efforts on the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
The dispute of Kashmir, two thirds of which is controlled by
India and rest by Pakistan, has been the key issue in the
relationship between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder, Greens Ink Coalition Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- After two weeks of negotiations,
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democratic Party (SPD)
Tuesday signed an agreement with the Greens party to form
Germany's new government.
</P>
<P>
The 50-page accord, if approved by the two parties at their
conventions later this week, would create the first-ever
SPD-Greens coalition government in Germany's post-war history.
</P>
<P>
Under the coalition accord, the SPD and Greens set fighting
unemployment, stuck above 10 percent, as their top priority.
</P>
<P>
As a key measure, they will introduce a so-called "Alliance for
Jobs", a forum for government, employers and trade unions to work
together to create jobs and training places.
</P>
<P>
The two parties also pledge to introduce a 10-billion-mark (6
billion U.S. dollar) cut in income and corporate taxes while
raising energy prices to finance reductions in social-benefit
payments made by employers and employees.
</P>
<P>
Vowing to defend social justice, the new government will also
roll back state pension cuts made by the outgoing government of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and will seek other measures to save the
pension system threatened in Germany by the aging population.
</P>
<P>
As a reflection of the Greens' demand for better environment
protection, the new government will start negotiations with the
energy industry with the ultimate goal to shut down all nuclear
power plants which currently provide about one third of the
country's energy supply.
</P>
<P>
Eager to enter federal government for the first time since its
founding in 1979, the ecologist and pacifist Greens has refrained
from asserting many of its controversial demands such as a call
for Germany to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) or to bar Germany from participating in
international peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
Under the coalition accord, the SPD and Greens pledge
continuity in German foreign policy and say that the new
government will hold on to the German commitment to European
integration and the transatlantic partnership.
</P>
<P>
The new government is also planning to liberalize Germany's
strict citizenship law to allow dual citizenship and ease the
integration into the German society of the country's 700 million
foreign population.
</P>
<P>
As the dominant one in the coalition government, the SPD will
have 11 ministerial posts with party chairman, Oskar Lafontaine,
to head the Finance Ministry, and SPD parliamentary leader, Rudolf
Scharping, to become defence minister.
</P>
<P>
The Greens, which will serve as the junior partner in the new
ruling coalition, has won three cabinet post with party leader
Joschka Fischer to become foreign minister and vice-chancellor.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder is due to be formally elected as the chancellor by
the new parliament on October 27. His cabinet will be sworn in
soon afterward.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) will
finally soar back into foreign skies on October 29, PAL said here
Tuesday in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The airlines said it would first resume a triangular routing
from Manila to Los Angeles and San Francisco in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Then it will commence a daily service to Tokyo on November 11
and gradually increase destinations and frequencies on its
international operations as the holiday peak season approaches.
</P>
<P>
PAL closed its operations at the end of September due to heavy
financial losses and the differences between the management and
the labor union.
</P>
<P>
PAL resumed its domestic flights on October 7 after the
management and the labor union reached an agreement.
</P>
<P>
PAL is one of Asia's oldest airlines and the Philippines'
national flag carrier.
</P>
<P>
Due to mismanagement over the past few years and the ill
effects of the Asian financial crisis which started in July last
year, PAL has incurred a heavy loss of 2.1 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Per Capita GDP to Drop in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel's per capita gross
domestic product (GDP) in 1998 is expected to fall to the lowest
level since 1995, the Jerusalem Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics put
the per capital GDP in 1998 at 16,000-16,500 U.S. dollars,
compared with 16,900 dollars in 1997 and 17,000 dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The figure of Israeli per capita GDP this year is below that of
most developed countries, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It also predicted that the economic growth this year will drop
to 1.5 percent, as against 2 percent last year and 4.5 percent in
1996, due to the decline in investment and the slow increase in
exports of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
Since the Likud coalition came to power in 1996, it has carried
out a restrictive economic policy in a bid to reduce both the
budget deficit and the inflation rate of the country.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Israel's economic growth has slowed down in the
past two years.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia should ratify START-II
treaty, otherwise, it cannot speak of weapon control, First Deputy
Prime Minister Yury Maslyukov noted on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the military daily "Krasnaya Zvezda,"
Maslyukov said, "if we now reject the START-II strategic arms
reduction treaty, Russia would have lost its voice in control of
weapons of mass destruction."
</P>
<P>
Maslyukov said Russia should move in the direction of a new
treaty, START-III.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, Russia should insist on the United
States observing the anti-ballistic missile defense treaty of
1972.
</P>
<P>
The START-II treaty was signed by U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Russian President Boris Yeltsin on January 3, 1993, and it was
ratified by the U.S. side in January,1996.
</P>
<P>
The Russian State Duma so far has not given green light to the
treaty, fearing it could damage the Russian interests.

MOSCOW, October 20 (Xinhua) -- About 85 percent of the

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Remains Philippines' Strong Ally: Mercado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia remains a strong ally
of the Philippines in Southeast Asia despite the temporary
differences between the two countries, Philippine Defense
Secretary Orlando Mercado said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mercado emphasized that a bilateral meeting on
border defense cooperation between Malaysia and the Philippines is
likely to resume soon.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia canceled Monday a scheduled bilateral meeting on
defense cooperation with the Philippines for the Philippines'
concerns over former Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was arrested about two weeks ago and would be tried
sooner. Philippine President Joseph Estrada called for "due
process" and "the respect of human rights" for Anwar's trial.
</P>
<P>
"Our ties with Malaysia are strong. Malaysia is our friend and
not our enemy," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
He added that both countries are long-time members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) which has
mechanisms for the settling of differences among members.
</P>
<P>
Mercado acknowledged that the cancellation of bilateral meeting
on defense cooperation was apparently Kuala Lumpur's way of
expressing its displeasure over President Estrada's personal
support for Anwar.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the ties between the two countries are likely
to go back to normal soon once both governments thresh out their
difference as ASEAN members.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Estrada said that his words over Anwar was
"personal opinions" and not the Philippine government's policy.
</P>
<P>
He denied interfering in Malaysian internal affairs and
expressed his willingness to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) meeting to be held next month in Kuala Lumpur.

<HEADLINE> African Trade Prospects Affected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The devaluation of Asian
currencies has affected trade prospects of Africa's share in
world trade, according to the United Nations Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO).
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the Asian economic crisis Asian countries
have become more competitive in export markets with countries
like the Republic of Korea, Thailand and Indonesia increasing
their volume of the exports between 20 and 30 percent to earn
hard currencies, Times of Zambia quoted UNIDO as saying.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Tuesday quoted a message from UNIDO in
Vienna headquarters as saying that the expansion could seriously
erode Africa's fragile competitiveness in the world market.
</P>
<P>
The message said that the improved competitiveness of Asia
poses a big threat to Africa's resource-based industry and
manufactured exports like textiles, garments, cocoa, rubber and
other products.
</P>
<P>
Africa's share in the world trade has declined to below one
percent.
</P>
<P>
Investment flows to Africa show that it will have a modest
impact because financial markets are not as they are in Asia,
said UNIDO.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment from Asia to Africa will slow down
as a direct result of the crisis although these flows are limited
except from Malaysia, said UNIDO.

BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China will host for the first

and set eyes on at least one of the four gold medals featured in
the October 22-24 contest.
</P>
<P>
A gathering of 72 boys and girls from fifteen countries and
regions will participate in four events including men's, ladies,
pairs and ice dancing, with competitors from Russia, Canada, the
United States and China leading the field.
</P>
<P>
China organized a 16-member team to compete in all the four
events at the Capital Stadium in Beijing. Guo Zhengxin, 18, is
China's best medal hope in the men's event.
</P>
<P>
"He could win the men's gold if he skates to his normal
level," the event's organizing committee chief Xiao Tian said on
Tuesday of Guo, eighth-placer at the Winter Olympic Games in
Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese skaters have an edge in the difficulty level of their
routines, but are lacking understanding of rhythm and dancing,"
Xiao added. "Russia, the United States and Canada have more
all-round skaters. They are the biggest rivals to China."
</P>
<P>
The top eight finishers in the eight-leg Tour qualify for the
Finals in Detroit, the United States, in December.

<P>
LUSAKA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Health Minister Nkandu
Luo said that HIV/AIDS are hindering the development of Africa
and to fight the pandemic is a hard task for African countries.
</P>
<P>
In a speech read here Monday at a training workshop of the
Ambassadors of Hope organized by African Network of People Living
with HIV/AIDS, a non-governmental organization, Luo said Africa
has been one of the regions that suffer most in the world and its
development is hindered by the disease, according to Zambia News
Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
Currently about 30 million people worldwide are infected with
HIV/AIDS, 90 percent of whom are in developing countries,
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa which with only 10 percent of
world population accounts for two thirds of all HIV infections,
said a 1998 report on the pandemic compiled by the U.N.
Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
At the workshop that attracted attendants from 19 African
countries, Luo also called for a general revision of the
approaches adopted so far by the network in the last four years
since it has been in existence.
</P>
<P>
She described the attendants as "brave" people since they have
the courage to come openly in the society and reveal their status
for the benefit of others, saying the society could learn to live
positively from them.
</P>
<P>
Luo, however, said the battle does not end at revealing the
status only but there is need to bring about the desired change
in people's behavior and attitude at a global level.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's ruling Barisan
Nasional (BN) (National Front) Tuesday protested against
Philippine President Joseph Estrada for interfering in Malaysia's
internal affairs with regards to former deputy prime minister
Anwar Ibrahim issue.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 people representing the coalition gathered peacefully
for about 45 minutes in front of the Philippine Embassy here to
register their protest and handed a protest memorandum to the
Philippines' Ambassador to Malaysia Jose Brillantes, expressing
profound regret and disappointment against Estrada for
interference.
</P>
<P>
The three-page memorandum signed by representatives of major
component parties -- United Malays National Organization,
Malaysian Chinese Association, Malaysian Indian Congress and the
People's Movement Party, among others, urges Estrada to apologize.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum states that although Estrada's comments on the
treatment of Anwar since his arrest on September 20 were made in
his personal capacity, they could be regarded as the official
stand of the Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has reportedly appealed to the Malaysian government for
better treatment to Anwar whom he considered as his personal
friend.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was sacked from the government on September 2 and
from UMNO a day later, was released from detention under the
Internal Security Act after 23 days' detention and is now held at
the Sungai Buloh Prison pending his court case on November 2.

<HEADLINE> 61,000 Zambians Lose Jobs Since Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The total loss of formal sector
employment in Zambia since 1994 when the country began its
privatization process is estimated at 61,000.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed over the weekend by Elizabeth Jere, social
impact manager of Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA), according to
a weekly newspaper published here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Mail quoted Jere as saying that job losses from
privatization had been minimal compared with job losses in the
economy as a whole resulting from the pressures of the other
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
She noted that only 61,000 jobs had been lost as a result of
privatization in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Before active privatization started in 1994, a retrenchment
strategy study commissioned in 1993 showed that formal sector
employed about 490,000 employees and the public sector alone had
about 320,000 employees, said the ZPA official.
</P>
<P>
She said out of the number of public employees, 140,000 were
in the parastatal sector while 180,000 were employed by the civil
service.
</P>
<P>
Another study conducted between November 1996 and May 1997
indicated that privatization by ZPA resulted in several thousand
retrenchments between 1994 and 1997, said Jere.
</P>
<P>
She attributed the job losses to internal and outside
competition brought about by market liberalization and free trade
policies followed by the Zambian government.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's construction
industry has grown rapidly since the late 1970s, when China
started opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The city's statistics bureau reports 370,000 construction
workers and 75.3 billion yuan in business for the industry in
1997, which were 2.7 times and 170 times the figures for 1978
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The bureau says that the city's construction industry spent
197.7 billion yuan on fixed assets and built 45 million sq m of
housing in 1997, representing increases of 70 times 19 times in
1978.
</P>
<P>
The industry has also seen dramatic improvement in technology,
with nearly 120,000 pieces of machinery and equipment being used,
11 times the 1978 amount.
</P>
<P>
As a hedge against risks inherent in engaging solely in
construction, the city's contruction companies have branched out
into the real estate, building materials, food service, and
transport sectors.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the construction companies earned 780 million yuan
from non-construction businesses, accounting for 60 percent of
their profits.

<HEADLINE> Over 20,000 People Starving in W. Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 20,000 people in the
Western Province of Zambia are starving and feeding on wild
fruits, a Zambian provincial minister said.
</P>
<P>
"There is acute hunger here. People are eating wild fruits
like muzauli which they mix with shombo (cassava leaves)," said
Western Province Minister Michael Mabenga Monday when he toured
several areas in his province, government-owned Times of Zambia
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The province minister blamed the starvation on the high price
at which the mealie meal, a staple food in Zambia, is being
traded, saying that even the people in town can not afford to buy
food which is "very expensive".
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the office of vice-president in charge of
monitoring and dealing with starvation in the country to send
relief food to his province.
</P>
<P>
Zambia produced less than 400,000 tons of food in the last
farming season to feed the nation. However, it has imported
100,000 tons of maize through the Food Reserve Agency (FRA) as at
September 30, 1998 to compensate for the shortage of maize the
whole country is facing in the next 12 months, chief government
spokesman Newstead Zimba said in a press statement released last
Saturday in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to dispel the widespread fears that there is a
shortage of food at present, Zimba said the FRA has started
releasing up to 70,000 tons of maize per month as from October 1,
1998, adding that the figure represents an excess of the monthly
national maize requirement of 60,000 tons.

455,000 bundles.
</P>
<P>
It is believed the drop due to the regional economic crisis and
the country's political instability, but however, the factory
operation is equilibrium and sustainable.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts maintained that despite the good trend in garment
industry, many foreign investors were still being frightened off
by the country's uncertain political outlook.
</P>
<P>
At the moment investors are awaiting for the formation of the
new government. As a senior official pointed out: "the sooner a
new government is formed and we have political stability then the
sooner more investors will come."

<HEADLINE> Symposium on World Human Rights Opens in Beijing (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhu said that the Chinese people, who had suffered from
imperialist aggression and humiliation for over a century, waged a
protracted and arduous struggle for national independence and
people's democracy in defiance of sacrifices and losses of lives
and property, before finally winning the War of Resistance Against
Japan.
</P>
<P>
He noted that that was an important contribution to the world
in fighting facism and safeguarding human rights. The Universal
Declaration of Human Rights is also a victory of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the past 50 years, great changes have taken
place in the world, and the cause of world human rights is facing
many new issues.
</P>
<P>
He said that he hoped the human rights scholars and
experts will take the opportunity to discuss new concepts,
principles and goals for hunman rights development.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Chinese government has attached great
importance to the exchanges and cooperation in the fields of
international human rights. Besides, the Chinese government has so
far signed a total of 17 international human rights instruments,
including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights.
</P>
<P>
China has also made significant progress in the human rights
studies, Zhu said, adding that Chinese human rights experts hold
that rights to subsistence and development are the most important
ones.
</P>
<P>
China is quite different from Western countries in terms of
historical tradition, so is the human rights view of the Chinese
people from that of the westerners, Zhu pointed out. European and
American countries pay attention to individual rights and values,
while Asian countries uphold the human rights of the collective
and responsibility to the family, he added.
</P>
<P>
As the human rights progress is a process of gradual
improvement, it helps enrich and develop the connotation of human
rights if people respect, introduce and carry forward the fine
fruits of civilizations of various countries.
</P>
<P>
The symposium will focus on the position and role of the
Declaration, the present situation and development of human rights
throughout the world, and the challenges to human rights
cause in the 21st century.

<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen said here today that although the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights embodies the importance the international community
attaches to the promotion of human rights and fundamental
freedoms, the task of achieving the objectives identified in the
Declaration is still an uphill journey.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Government and people have furthermore scored
impressive achievements in the promotion and protection of human
rights by turning their solemn commitments to the Declaration into
practice," Qian said at the opening ceremony of the International
Symposium on World Human Rights Toward the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
"This year marks the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international
community is holding a series of activities in commemoration of
the event," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Last January, Chinese President Jiang Zemin wrote to the UN
Secretary General Kofi Annan, expressing the Chinese Government's
full support to the international community in its initiative to
commemorate this programmatic document, to review and summarize
the work in the field of human rights, and to look beyond the
present and plan the future.
</P>
<P>
Qian said, the year is the 20th anniversary of China's reform
and opening-up. Over the past two decades, tremendous changes have
taken place in China's political, economic and social conditions
and so in the mentality of the Chinese people.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Uneasy over Statements by Indonesian, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has expressed its
uneasiness over the statements by the Indonesian and Philippine
presidents in connection with the arrest of former Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi described the
statements attributed to the Indonesian and Philippine presidents
as interference in Malaysia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
According to Malaysia's national news agency Bernama Tuesday,
Abdullah said in the northeastern state of Kelantan Monday night
that he had contacted his Indonesian counterpart Ali Alattas and
his Philippine counterpart Domingo Siazon to express Malaysia's
uneasiness over the statements by the leaders of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said his Indonesian and Philippine counterparts had
assured him that their countries would continue with the ASEAN
policy of not interfering in the internal affairs of member
states.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian President B.J Habibie and Philippine President
Joseph Estrada criticized Malaysia's handling of the Anwar case.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was sacked as deputy prime minister on September 2
and released on October 14 after the detention for 23 days under
the Internal Security Act, is now at remand at the Sungai Buloh
Prison pending trial on November 2 on four corruption charges.

Besides having acceded to 15 international human rights
instruments, the Chinese Government signed the International
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights last year and the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights not long ago,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"At the 15th National Congress of the CPC held in September
last year, President Jiang Zemin clearly stated that we would
continue to press ahead with the political restructuring, further
expand the scope of socialist democracy, improve the socialist
legal system, rule the country according to law and make it a
socialist country ruled by law," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"We will lead and support the people in exercising the power of
running the state, holding democratic elections, making policy
decisions in a more democratic manner, instituting democratic
management and supervision, ensuring that the people enjoy
extensive rights and freedoms endowed by law, and respecting and
guaranteeing human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident that as long as we continue to go down the road
to development suited to our national conditions, China will
continue to make significant progress in its economic and social
development and the level of human rights enjoyed by the Chinese
people will be raised even further," he added.

"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the first
international instrument that has spelt out in a systematic way
the idea of respect for the protection of fundamental human
rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Adopted half a century ago, the Declaration gives expression
to the good will and determination of the world's people, who have
gone through the two world wars, to root out the scourges of war
and realize peace and democracy, and embodies the importance the
international community attaches to the promotion of human rights
and fundamental freedoms," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the five decades following the Declaration's adoption, the
international situation underwent enormous and profound changes.
After World War II, nearly 100 nations attained national
independence by breaking free of colonialist shackles, which can
be said without exaggeration to be the greatest achievement of the
world human rights cause," he said.
</P>
<P>
"After the Declaration, the United Nations drew up the
Declaration on the Right to Development, and the rights of women,
children and the disabled have also been accorded sweeping
recognition," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The concept of human rights therefore covers a much wider
range of areas. Human rights and fundamental freedoms have become
a universal ideal and the goal pursued by all the people around
the world," he said.
</P>

"However," Qian said, "the task of achieving the objectives

"The international cause of human rights is still faced with
many difficulties and obstacles, which include many unresolved
questions relating to the environment, basis, approaches and
modalities for the realization of human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The 21st century is drawing close and mankind is at the
threshold to a new millennium. How to overcome the existing
difficulties and obstacles and greatly advance the world human
rights cause in the new historical period has become a major
question of deep concern for the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, "War is the most gross form of violation
of human rights and fundamental freedoms while peace is the
prerequisite for the promotion and protection of human rights."
</P>
<P>
"History and practice have proved that respect for the purposes
and principles of the UN Charter and the Five Principles of
Peaceful Co-existence is an important basis for the settlement of
any international dispute, and that to resolve differences and
disputes between nations through peaceful means without recourse
to force or threat of force is the right path to realizing and
maintaining peace and stability," he said.

<P>
"Poverty is the main impediment to the realization of human
rights while development constitutes the basis for the promotion
and protection of human rights. To survive and develop is the most
basic need of human beings and is also the essential human right,"
Qian said.

"One of the major significance of the Declaration lies in its
recognition of economic, social and cultural rights. As all human
rights are mutually dependent and related, and the international
community should attach equal importance to each and every one of
them," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Given their differences in social system, economic development
level, and historical and cultural tradition," he said, "it is
only natural that countries in the world do not have complete
agreement on how to define, approach and realize human rights."
</P>
<P>
"But we do have common ground in many other aspects. We all
recognize the universality of human rights and observe the same
international norms on human rights; we all recognize that no
country's human rights situation is perfect, and that all
countries are confronted with a weighty task of further promoting
and protecting human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian also said, "To jointly advance and strengthen the human
rights cause, countries should enhance mutual understanding, seek
and broaden common ground, and reduce differences through
dialogues on the basis of equality and mutual respect."

He said he believes the worldwide human rights experts and
scholars who are attending the two-day symposium will understand each
other better and come up with many constructive proposals through
the exchange of experience and discussions, as well as make
contribution to the healthy development of the world human rights
cause in the next century.

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS Hinder Africa's Development: Minister  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Health Minister Nkandu
Luo said that HIV/AIDS are hindering the development of Africa
</P>
<P>
In a speech read here Monday at a training workshop of the
Ambassadors of Hope organized by African Network of People Living
with HIV/AIDS, a non-governmental organization, Luo said Africa
has been one of the regions that suffer most in the world and its
development is hindered by the disease, according to Zambia News
Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
Currently about 30 million people worldwide are infected with
HIV/AIDS, 90 percent of whom are in developing countries--
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, which with only 10 percent of
world population, accounts for two thirds of all HIV infections,
said a 1998 report on the pandemic compiled by the U.N.
Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
At the workshop that attracted attendants from 19 African
countries, Luo also called for a general revision of the
approaches adopted so far by the network in the last four years
since it has been in existence.
</P>
<P>
She described the attendants as "brave" people since they have
the courage to come openly in the society and reveal their status
for the benefit of others, saying the society could learn to live
positively from them.
</P>
<P>
Luo, however, said the battle does not end at revealing the
status only but there is need to bring about the desired change
in people's behavior and attitude at a global level.

<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- An International Symposium on
World Human Rights Towards the 21st Century opened today in
Beijing to mark the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
As the first multi-lateral world human rights symposium hosted
by China, the symposium is held under the circumstance that human
rights disputes between China and some western countries have come
to dialogue now from confrontation in the past.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 scholars and experts on human rights from 26
countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, Europe and America

Society for Human Rights Studies and the United Nations
Association of China.

international community is holding a series of activities to mark
the event. He added that the symposium is part of the activities
undertaken by China to commemorate the event.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that over the past two decades, tremendous changes
have taken place in China's political, economic and social
conditions and so too the mentality of the Chinese people. The
Chinese Government and people have, furthermore, scored impressive
achievements in the promotion and protection of human rights by
turning their solemn commitments to the Declaration into practice.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that China is now advancing its reforms in an
all-round way and with full confidence, reforms that are on both

<HEADLINE> Symposium on World Human Rights Opens in Beijing (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the 15th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party
held in September last year, Chinese President Jiang Zemin stated
that China would continue to press ahead with the political
restructuring, further expand the scope of socialist democracy,
improve the socialist legal system, rule the country according to
law and make it a socialist country ruled by law; China will lead
and support the people in exercising the power of running the
state, holding democratic elections, making policy decisions in a
more democratic manner, instituting more democratic management and
supervision, ensuring that the people enjoy extensive rights and
freedom endowed by law, and respecting and guaranteeing human
rights, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He said that just as there are no obligations without the
corresponding rights, there are no rights without the accompanying
obligations in the world. The present reality is that people live
in different countries. All individuals, while exercising their
rights and enjoying freedom, should abide by laws and fulfill
their obligations.
</P>
<P>
Given their differences in social system, economic development
level, and historical and cultural traditions, it is only natural
that countries in the world do not have complete agreement on how
to define, approach and realize human rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we do have common ground in many other aspects. We all
recognize the universality of human rights and observe the same
international norms on human rights; we all recognize that no
country's human rights situation is perfect, and that all
countries are confronted with a weighty task of further promoting
and protecting human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To jointly advance and strengthen the human rights cause,
countries should enhance mutual understanding, seek and broaden
common ground, and reduce differences through dialogues on the
basis of equality and mutual respect," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Muzhi, president of the China Society for Human Rights
Studies, presided over the symposium. In his speech, Zhu said
that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights represents the
common demand of the people throughout the world to eradicate
fascism and the catastrophe of war and safeguard the basic rights
of man following victory in World War II.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Chinese Island Dwellers Get Drinking Water From Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Some people living on islands
off Zhejiang Province on the east coast of China are now able to
get drinking water from the sea, thanks to a Hangzhou water
treatment center that has some advanced desalination technology,
according to sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The center can extract a ton of good-quality drinking water
from the sea with only 5.5 kwh of electricity, or a third of what
was needed for earlier methods.
</P>
<P>
China is following the United States and Japan in using this
technology, the paper says and quotes Yao Fubao, an engineer at
the center, as saying that the new technology is expected to
spread to other islands or coastal areas that are short of
drinking water.

Act so foreign secret service agents could carry weapons at the
Leaders' Meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC),

It quoted United States Ambassador to New Zealand Josiah Beeman

<HEADLINE> Indian Businessmen Lose Much in Festival Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Bad weather, a financially
weak market and overestimation of the gift requirements for Diwali
(festival of lights) have resulted in a huge loss of rupees to the
dry fruit dealers and sweets manufacturers in the Indian capital
New Delhi, The Statesman said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the passive mood of Diwali, the largest festival
for Hindus in the country, was obvious in the handicraft and
ethnic items industry. The emporia at Baba Kharak Singh Road and
Handicraft Bazar in Dilli Haat Road in the city showed a steep
decline of about 40 percent in sales compared with Diwali last
year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The cash-starved economy had affected business badly. "During
Diwali, the entire emporium area used to be full of customers but
this year one has to look out for a buyer," Himachal Emporium
divisional manager O. P. Shah said.
</P>
<P>
The worst affected are shopkeepers who bought dry fruits worth
tens of thousands of rupees anticipating brisk Diwali business
like last year. But it turned out to be a damp squib. Some stores
in GK Part-1 had bought dry fruits worth 5 million rupees (0.12
million U.S. dollars) but had been able to sell barely 20 percent.
A department store owner said that he had not witnessed such a
"black" Diwali in the past 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Further Promotion of Human Rights in 21st Century Urged (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The world should further
promote human rights in the forthcoming 21st century, discuss new
theories and views, and look into more representative principles
of this subject of worldwide concern.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Muzhi, president of the China Society for Human Rights
Studies, made the remark here today at the opening ceremony of the
International Symposium on World Human Rights Towards the 21st
Century.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the
issuing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, jointly held
by the China Society for Human Rights Studies and the China UN
Association. Over 80 experts and scholars from China and 26 other
countries from Asia, Africa, Latin America, Europe and North America
participated in the symposium.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights remains
a milestone in the history of the development of human rights
worldwide. It represents the common desire of the people
throughout the world to eradicate fascism and catastrophe of war
and safeguard the basic rights of man following the victory of the
Second World War.
</P>
<P>
"In this way it has greatly promoted progress in human rights
the world over," he said.
</P>
<P>
Great changes have taken place in the world over the past 50
years, and the cause of world human rights is facing many
new challenges and situations.
</P>
<P>
"The most important question of common concern to people of all
countries while commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights is how to further promote human rights
in the upcoming 21st century," Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
For that end, Zhu said, symposium participants are expected to
review the developments and achievements of the world's human
rights cause over the past five decades.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that there was no world war broke out during the past
50 years. Many countries have shaken off colonial rule and
regained their independence.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people also founded a democratic people's republic,
he said. The basic needs of China's 1.2 billion people have been
met, and the Chinese people are now working hard toward the goal
of increased prosperity. China also made remarkable achievements
in the field of human rights including the right to subsistence
and the right to development.

<P>
"Over the past five decades, people in all countries of the
world have been paying more and more attention to human rights
issues; enjoying human rights to their full extent has become the
common goal," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, actual situations vary from country to country, and
the roads taken by each country are different," Zhu said, adding
that China has chosen to march along its own road in accordance
with its historical background, social system, cultural traditions
and stage of economic development.
</P>
<P>
"All the knowledge and experience accumulated by various
countries over the years have enriched the contents of the world
human rights cause," he said, expressing the belief that progress
in human rights worldwide is made through the endeavors of each
individul country, taking its own road.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that history has shown that knowledge and practice in
human rights develop along with the changing times. Following
issuing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the various
conventions, programs and declarations on human rights adopted by
the United Nations over the past 50 years have broadened and
deepened the content, conception and principle of human rights.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that many major problems remain to be solved
despite of remarkable achievements made in this cause. In
addition, many new problems seriously endangering human rights
have cropped up along with the major changes in the world.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that experts and scholars of human rights studies can
take the advantage of this symposium and jointly explore and
discuss new theories, new views and new principles which are more
representative, as well as seek new starting points and new
goals for the continued development of human rights.
</P>
<P>
"Today, differences in human rights issues still exist in the
international community, but the voices calling for dialogue and
opposing confrontation become increasingly strong," he said,
adding "this conference is also a form of dialogue."
</P>
<P>
Zhu hoped that participants at this on-going conference can
express and discuss their views fully, as they seek common ground
while reserving differences in the spirit of equality and mutual
respect.

<HEADLINE> European Bank Plans to Increase Investment in Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is planning to increase its
investment in Bulgaria, a visiting senior official with the EBRD
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The EBRD attaches great importance to the development of
privatized small and medium-sized businesses in Bulgaria and is
planning to invest 20 million European Currency Units (ECUs), or
80 million German marks (45 million U.S. dollars), in a
post-privatization fund, said EBRD Director of Country Team for
Bulgaria Olivier Descamps.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to local reporters after a meeting with Bulgarian
President Peter Stoyanov, Descamps said that the EBRD has invested
250 million German marks (138 million U.S. dollars) in the country
since the United Democratic Forces took power last year.
</P>
<P>
The bank will play a leading role in the progress of Bulgaria's
investment process, said Descamps, who is leading a group of EBRD
Board of Directors officials on a visit to Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
In meeting with the president, the EBRD Board of Directors
officials highly praised the progress of economic, financial and
structural reform in the country and expressed readiness to
further support economic development in Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the EBRD officials met with Bulgarian
Finance Minister Muravei Radev.
</P>
<P>
Radev said after the meeting that the EBRD is ready to
participate in funding a promotion bank to provide credit lines to
small businesses. It may also participate as a supporting
investor in the privatization of Bulgarian banks.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Attracts 2b Dollars of Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh attracted foreign
direct investment (FDI) worth over 2 billion U.S. dollars between
July 1996 and June 1998, according to a survey conducted by the
Board of Investment (BOI).
</P>
<P>
During the period, the BOI registered investment proposals of
about 4.2 billion dollars from 278 foreign or joint venture
projects, The Financial Express daily Tuesday quoted the survey as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Many of these registered projects are either at the stage of
signing agreement of implementation, yet many others did not
follow up, stated the survey which was handed over to the prime
minister last week.
</P>
<P>
A number of the prospective investors have not come back even
12 months after registering their projects with the BOI, it added.
</P>
<P>
The BOI was now trying to identify the reasons why many of the
prospective foreign investors did not follow up after registration
with the BOI, it said.
</P>
<P>
Getting land for a project is a complicated process which,
among other things, might have discouraged some investors, BOI
executive chairman Farooq Sobhan pointed out while meeting a group
of European envoys in Dhaka Monday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the real and proposed investments have gone to three
major sectors -- oil and gas, telecommunications, and power --
followed by textiles and cement, he stated, adding that the power
section alone accounted for about 525 million dollars of the
invested foreign capital in two years till June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Sobhan further said that 12 cement projects worth about 469
million dollars have been registered, and of them, a joint venture
cement factory in (northeast district of) Sylhet with French
multinational Lafarge is likely to be launched on November 10.
</P>
<P>
He listed composite textile mills as the "first and foremost"
area where the government looks for foreign investment to feed the
country's ready-made garment industry.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government is keen to see foreign investment in
the proposed Dhaka Bypass, Dhaka Ring Road and Dhaka-Chittagong
Express Way, he said.

<HEADLINE> Sweden to Provide More Economic Aid to Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish government is to
increase its overseas economic aid for developing countries by 19
percent in the coming three years.
</P>
<P>
According to the new draft national budget, Sweden's
allocation on international development and cooperation will rise
422 million krona (about 52.8 million U.S. dollars) next year over
that of this year.
</P>
<P>
The increase will bring the total allocation for such purpose
to reach 12.84 billion krona (about 1.605 billion dollars) next
year, accounting for 0.705 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Pierre Schori, Swedish junior minister for foreign aid, said
that the new aid policy, which will reverse the downslide trend of
the past few years, could help the poor not only to have enough to
eat and dress warmly, but also to uproot the cause of poverty.
</P>
<P>
For many years, the rich countries, except Sweden, Norway, the
Netherlands and Denmark, provided only 0.2 percent of their GDP to
help developing countries, far short of the 0.7 percent target set
by the United Nations, showed a recent U.N. report.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Builds One More Reservoir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- One more reservoir, the Mann
Creek Reservoir, has been commissioned into service in Myanmar's
Magway division, adding the total number of dams and reservoirs
built since 1988 to 91.
</P>
<P>
The Mann Creek Reservoir, inaugurated on Monday in Ngaphe
township, Minbu district of the division, would irrigate over
19,035 hectares of farmland, The New Light of Myanmar official
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Lieutenant-General Tin Oo, second secretary
of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, as saying that
the reservoir had been built to enable farmers to engage in
agriculture with a certainty of success as the Magway division,
where the reservoir lies, is an area in the dry zone and farmers
have to depend solely on the rainfall.
</P>
<P>
Ten dams had been built in the eastern and western sectors of
the division, he said, adding that the government is planning to
build more dams and diversion weirs there in the future.
</P>
<P>
Of the 91 dams built since 1988, nine were constructed during
1997 and 1998 with 203,107 hectares irrigated. There are 22 dams
in central Mandalay division.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar registered a 4.6 percent growth of its gross domestic
product (GDP) in the 1997-98 fiscal year which ended in March, in
which agriculture, the mainstay of the country's economy, grew by
2.9 percent in output value, accounting for 35.6 percent of the
total GDP and about 35 percent of the export.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Says D'Alema Not Helping Two-Bloc System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Italy's outgoing Prime Minister
Romano Prodi said that his successor's attempts to form a new
government with a shifted political focus hindered Italy's
progress towards a stable two-bloc system.
</P>
<P>
Prodi also denied that the centre-left Olive Tree coalition he
led through 28 months in government had reached the end of the
road now that the new prime minister, Massimo D'Alema, looked set
to accept support from outside the alliance.
</P>
<P>
"The way in which the new majority has been formed and the
shape it has taken represent a pause in the construction of a
bipolar system based on the confrontation of programs and ideals,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
As the head of the Left Democrats, the largest party in the
Olive Tree, D'Alema was a linchpin in Prodi's government. After
Prodi failed to reconstruct his old parliamentary majority last
week, he was given the task of trying to seek support for a new
government.
</P>
<P>
He immediately began cobbling together a majority which saw the
axis of power shifting towards the center, leaving behind the
hard-left Communist Refoundation party and turning to the
ex-Christian Democrat UDR.
</P>
<P>
Prodi had refused to do this, arguing that it would not be the
government the country had voted for in 1996. This view has also
been espoused by the opposition, which has called for early
elections rather than a new centre-left government with a new
majority.
</P>
<P>
In a message to a local Olive Tree office Monday, Prodi
recalled that one of the reasons the coalition had been created
was to help launch "a phase of political and institutional life
based on the alternation and stability of governments."

<HEADLINE> Mexico Urges U.S. to Relocate Nuke Dump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Mexican Environment
Minister Julia Carabias Monday urged the United States to relocate
its nuclear waste dump at Sierra Blanca.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the 7th Latin American Botanical
Congress, Carabias said the decision to build the dump in Texas,
only 30 kilometers away from Mexico's border "is not the policy of
a good neighbor."
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government will request the state of Texas to make
what she called "indispensable" changes and relocate the dump.
</P>
<P>
Mexico will do everything in its power to stop construction of
the dump, she emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The dump project has prompted adverse reactions from
environmentalists and local residents on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, legislators from Mexico's border states of Coahuila
and Chihuahua started a hunger strike to protest the project. They
said they will stay in front of the residence of Texas governor
George W. Bush until at least Thursday, when a state commission
will have the final say on the site.
</P>
<P>
A 1983 Mexico-US agreement banned all projects potentially
harmful to the environment or to human health within 100
kilometers from the border.

COLOMBO, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Over 700 members of Sri Lanka's
main opposition United National Party (UNP) including two former
Members of Parliament (MP) have crossed over to the Sri Lanka
Muslim Congress (SLMC), a partner in the ruling Peoples Alliance
government, according to a report of the official Daily News
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Former UNP MP for Batticaloa district Rizvi Sinne Lebbe told

leadership which was discriminating against the minorities,
particularly in the Eastern Province.

District, said the MP, adding that they have no right to talk
about the rights of minorities in the UNP.
</P>
<P>
The party leader Ranil Wickremasinghe and another former
Minister had deprived the Muslim community of representation in
parliament, they charged.
</P>
<P>
At a special ceremony held here Monday, the two former
Ministers and the other members of the UNP who crossed over were
welcomed to the SLMC by its leader Ports Minister M.H.M. Ashraff
and party secretary Rauf Hakkim.

LIMA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Trade volume between Peru and

<HEADLINE> Chilean President Calls for Respect of Chilean Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Chilean President Eduardo Frei
Monday asked other countries to respect Chile's sovereignty when
they addressed the case of former Chilean President Augusto
Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Frei's statement came after British police arrested Pinochet in
Britain at the request of two Spanish judges.
</P>
<P>
As a country ruled by law, Frei said, Chile will not accept the
trial by the courts of other countries of the domestic affairs
within Chile's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
This is an international principle that requires the respect of
international law, said Frei in Spain where he was attending the
Ibero-American summit.
</P>
<P>
On October 17, the British police detained the 82-year-old
Pinochet at a London clinic where he had received a minor surgery.
</P>
<P>
The British authorities said they were acting on a request from
Spanish courts probing Pinochet's role in alleged organized
killing of Spaniards in Chile during his rule of the country
between 1973 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish courts asked Britain to extradite Pinochet and
bring him to justice in Spain.
</P>
<P>
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar described the Pinochet
case as a "judicial problem" in an earlier statement, saying the
Spanish government will take a detached stand on this incident.
</P>
<P>
In response, Frei said the Chile-Spanish relations remain
"normal and fairly tranquil" despite the Pinochet incident.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Summit Extended to Sixth Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Palestine-Israel summit
talks will continue for a sixth day on Tuesday as leaders from
both sides and the U.S. continue working to conclude a
comprehensive peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton had canceled a two-day trip to
California and would return for the fifth time in six days on
Tuesday to continue his unusual, intense and direct involvement in
the peace talks, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said at the
Wye Plantation, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
"Given the importance of the issues at hand, the president,
Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu and Chairman (Yasser) Arafat
believe it is appropriate to stay," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright would also remain closely involved in the
negotiations between Netanyahu and Arafat on an interim peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Clinton met Arafat and Netanyahu for the fourth time Monday
night to break the deadlock in the negotiations which started last
week.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, a grenade attack in Beersheba, Israel,
threw a shadow over the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israel said it would discuss only security and drop all other
issues on the agenda at its U.S. summit with the Palestinians
following the grenade attack, which wounded more than 60.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at Wye Plantation after the Israeli
"kitchen cabinet" discussed the attack, Netanyahu's office also
said that the Israeli delegation would not stay at the summit
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
In response, a Palestinian delegate told reporters that the
Israeli statement was an attempt to blackmail the Palestinians
into making concessions.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this is the traditional way of the Israelis to try
and blackmail the Palestinians to make concessions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to stay at Wye and continue negotiations.
Otherwise we can go home and then come back to the States and
negotiate a whole package," said the Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side said in the statement that a meeting had been
planned for Monday to discuss opening an airport in the Gaza Strip
but Israel had now decided to postpone that meeting.
</P>
<P>
"After the consultations conducted in the kitchen cabinet it
was decided that Israel will demand that the Palestinians fulfil
all of their commitments so that there can be progress on other
issues and there is a need to focus on issues of security and
terror," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for the plantation, Clinton told reporters at
the White House that he deplored the attack and the talks are
becoming complicated and tough.
</P>
<P>
"The issues are difficult. The distrust is deep. The going has
been tough. But the parties must consider the consequences of
failure and also the benefits of progress," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged the Israelis and Palestinians to continue their
talks for a lasting peace, which is the best way to remove
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Now I am convinced that reaching a secure, just, and lasting
peace between Israelis and Palestinians is the best way to ensure
that terrorism has no future in the Middle East," he added.
</P>
<P>
"As I said when we launched the talks last week, the United
States will do everything we can to help. But ultimately, only
the parties themselves can bridge their differences and put their
people on a more hopeful course," he added.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment In Central And Western Parts Of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China will further encourage
overseas investment in its resources-rich but less-developed
central and western regions, and new preferential policies have
been worked out to this end.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded projects that use resources in those areas will
qualify for tax breaks, an official of the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation said at a trade fair which started
here last week.
</P>
<P>
The central government will give priority to overseas-funded
projects in agriculture, water conservation, transportation,
energy, raw materials, and environmental protection in these
regions, and overseas investment will be used for the technical
transformation of medium-sized and small state enterprises and for
turning military enterprises into civilian operations.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors can open retail, foreign trade and travel
agency businesses on a trial basis with the approval of the
central government.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of this year, these regions approved
2,182 projects using overseas funding worth 3.7 billion
U.S. dollars. By August, 56,785 enterprises involving overseas
investment had been set up in these regions, accounting for only
17.8 percent of the total in the country.

<P>
WUHAN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- When an American teacher opened
an English school in Wuhan, capital of Central China's Hubei
Province, last year, he had no doubt about the market.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment in October 1996, the school has drawn
3,000 students for its various English classes.
</P>
<P>
David Perrie, the 60-year old Ph.D of English Literature from
Princeton University says that more Chinese in the city are
interested in studying English because it gets them better job
opportunities. Perrie, now a permanent resident in China, has
taught English in China for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Apart from its major courses, the school also runs an "English
corner" for practising spoken English and an English drama socity,
whose programs have been aired on a local television station.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Hongbo, a 26-year old woman, attends classes three nights
a week and says she is studying foreign languages, computer
science and driving, which are important skills for young people.
</P>
<P>
More of such schools have appeared in recent years, according
to Cao Aiping, an education official in Wuhan, and the city's
television station has opened an English channel to offer
programs for local English learners.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan has become more open to the outside world, according to
one governmental official, and has got 4.3 billion yuan in foreign
investment and many international companies have joint-ventures
there.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia More Appealing to Chinese Businessmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese businessmen are now more
likely to try their luck in Mongolia through direct investment, a
sharp contrast to a few years ago, when they were easily satisfied
by earning a moderate sum from labor exports.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are more than 200 solely Chinese-funded and
Sino-Mongolian joint ventures in Mongolia, a country with a
population of two million, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Chinese investment has been mostly in Mongolia's growing,
breeding, construction and entertainment sectors, with a high
economic return due to favorable Mongolian government policies
such as a three-year tax exemption for foreign vegetable farms
since April 1996.
</P>
<P>
In that neighboring country, vegetables and building materials
are sold at prices five to 20 times higher than in China, and
places of entertainment can take in 1,000 to 3,000 U.S. dollars a
day, according to a Chinese investor who is running a brick
factory and a vegetable farm there.
</P>
<P>
Chinese investors are mostly involved in sectors with low cost
and quick, high returns, he said.
</P>
<P>
This September, the Mongolian government imposed a 15 percent
import duty on grains, food and other farm products, which may
encourage Chinese businessmen to increase their direct investment
in the country's agricultural sector.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A federal judge in Little
Rock, Arkansas, released 724 pages of previously secret materials
in the Paula Jones lawsuit Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jones' lawsuit accused U.S. President Bill Clinton of making a
crude, unwanted sexual advance in 1991 when he was Arkansas
governor.
</P>
<P>
The materials made public on the Internet Monday by U.S.
District Judge Susan Webber Wright included written testimony by
the president and court documents Monica Lewinsky filed trying to
avoid becoming a witness in the case, which ultimately prompted an
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
The release came as a settlement in the lawsuit remained
elusive and lawyers on both sides prepared to make arguments
Tuesday before a federal appeals court in St. Paul, Minnesota. The
8th Circuit Court is considering whether to reinstate Jones'
lawsuit accusing the president of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's legal team Sunday rejected an offer from Jones to
settle the case for two million dollars -- one million each from
Clinton and New York real estate developer Abe Hirschfeld, who
volunteered his own money -- sources close to the case said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The documents, which detail the lawyers' closed-door maneuvers
in the case, included several written answers submitted by the
president.

<HEADLINE> Logging Being Stopped in Forests of Southwestern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, October 20 (Xinhua) -- One lesson people got from the
floods this summer was that, if there are no forests, human beings
will have no shelter.
</P>
<P>
And Sichuan Province in southwest China had to take action on
September 1 to stop the logging in its western parts at the
headwaters of the Yangtze, China's longest river, to prevent soil
erosion and reduce the amount of silt.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, forests on the upper reaches of the Yangtze were
not able to escape the logger's axe, and the provincial government
ordered logging of natural forests be stopped entirely throughout
the province beginning October 1.
</P>
<P>
Floods on the Yangtze and on the Songhua and Nen rivers in the
northeast caused at least 160 billion yuan (19.3 billion
U.S. dollars) worth of damages. Much of the flooding has been
attributed not only to climate changes but also to excessive
logging and and the silting up of the rivers.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government also decided to turn hillsides into
forests by planting trees and grasses. Sichuan is one of China's
key forest regions and ranks second with its 11 million hectares
of woodland and 1.4 billion cubic meters of timber reserves.
</P>
<P>
According to a national plan to protect major state-owned
natural forests, in three years, 65 logging companies will have to
stop and 70 more owned by the central government will cut
production by 10 million cubic meters.

major international cities by the end of the year. Its service
offers rooms in name-brand properties ranging from two-star to
luxury hotels.
</P>
<P>
Since its operation in February, the new company based in Stamford,
Connecticut has been offering the same kind of service on the World
Wide Web for leisure airline tickets and for cars. "Name your own
price" is its business logo.
</P>
<P>
In its first 120 days of operation, Priceline sold more than 50,000
leisure airline tickets online. And, in its first 45 days of operation
in the New York metro area, the company sold more than 2 million
dollars worth of new cars. In total, it registered over 20 million
dollars in sales in its first two quarters of operation. The company
now has 100 employees.
</P>
<P>
Priceline's unique online service and its success have drawn keen
attention of market analysts as well as mass media in the United
State. The company has been hailed as an exciting example of the Web's
potential to turn traditional marketing on its head in that it is not
a supply-and-demand market but the consumer telling the supplier what
he wants to pay.
</P>
<P>
Experts in e-commerce say that Priceline's model is a reverse
auction technology, a standard business practice between companies
for a long time. But the fascinating thing is that this economic
power is now being transferred to the individual because of the
Internet.

URUMQI, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region has built a number of key highway, railway, and
airport projects and, after years of infrastructure work, now has
32,000 km of highways, 2,000 km of railways, and 14 airports,
providing more convenient links with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
However, transportation is insufficient for mineral resources
exploration in the region, so the central government has spent
over 7 billion yuan (843 million U.S. dollars) this year in the
sector.
</P>
<P>
A local official says that a 1,000-km highway is
being built across the Tianshan Mountains and 40 percent of
the 286-km expressway between Urumqi and Kuitun has been
completed.
</P>
<P>
The Southern Xinjiang Railway westward extension project had
laid 564 km of tracks by the end of September. The project of
975-km railway is expected to be completed in June next year.
</P>
<P>
Urumqi International Airport was also expanded this year and an
expansion project at Kashi International Airport will add 170,000
sq.m. of runways and 1.8 million sq.m. of parking space.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Becomes China's Leading Acetic Acid Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China's largest acetic acid
production facilities with a designed annual production capacity
of 150,000 tons was put into trial operation last week in the
municipality of Chongqing in the southwest.
</P>
<P>
It is so far the largest joint venture in China's chemical
industry involving a total investment of 2.1 billion yuan (253.6
million U.S. dollars) with the BP of Britain holding 51 percent of
the equity.
</P>
<P>
Acetic acid production needs natural gas and methyl alcohol,
and Chongqing has proved 270 billion cubic meters of natural gas
reserves. Last year, it produced 4.5 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The project, which will officially go into operation in
November, is expected to meet the need for acetic acid in the

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Leicester City defeated
Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 in an English Premier League soccer match
Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
During the match, Leicester supporters urged manager Martin
O'Neill to stay. The fans at Filbert Street held up placards
before the kick-off and at halftime with the words "Don't go
Martin" -- an appeal for the Irishman to ignore the persistent
calls of managerless Leeds United.
</P>
<P>
Leeds, still seeking a manager after George Graham moved to
Tottenham last month, have targeted O'Neill but have been refused
permission by Leicester to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
With some suggesting the game could be Leicester's last under
O'Neill, the team served up a fine win after going a goal down in
the 13th minute to striker Les Ferdinand.
</P>
<P>
Tottenham had started brightly in what was technically
Graham's first game in sole charge of the team and Ferdinand
slotted in clinically off a Darren Anderton cross.
</P>
<P>
But Leicester equalized in the 37th minute when Emile Heskey
turned quickly, shrugged off Swiss defender Ramon Vega and lashed
home an unstoppable left-footed shot.
</P>
<P>
Muzzy Izzet then grabbed the 86th-minute winner on the volley
after a volleyed clearance by Spurs.
</P>
<P>
The result lifted Leicester to 11th in the league with 12
points, level with Leeds on points.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- World figure skating
champion Michelle Kwan and WNBA Most Valubal Player Cynthia
Cooper were named as Sportswomen of the Year by the U.S. Women's
Sports Foundation Monday in New York.
</P>
<P>
Kwan, also the silver medalist at the Nagano Olympics, was
chosen in the individual catergory, while Cooper, the two-time
league MVP in the Houston Comets, was chosen in the team
category.
</P>
<P>
Kwan won the world championship and the Goodwill Games titles,
and is looking toward 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"One of my dreams is to go to the Olympics in 2002, it's in
the States and my whole family will probably come, " Kwan said.
"I'm just hoping that everything will go right and I'll be ready
for that competition."
</P>
<P>
Kwan won her second world championship in March, one of five
titles she took this year. She added another U.S. title and
received 15 perfect marks in her short and long programs, the
most by any skater.
</P>
<P>
Cooper scored 23 points to lead Houston to its second
consecutive WNBA title over Phoenix last month. She also earned
her second scoring title, averaging 22.7 points a game.
</P>
<P>
After a 13-year professional basketball career in Spain and
Italy, and dominating the WNBA, Cooper is looking ahead, on the
court and beyond.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to be a general manager, maybe the next president of
the WNBA, maybe a broadcaster," the 35-year-old guard said.
"Maybe a three-peat. Michael Jordan won six championships, I want
to be like Mike."

<HEADLINE> Tyson Gets His Boxing License Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson got his boxing
license back today with a 4-1 voting from the Nevada Athletic
Commissioners today in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
Tyson told the commission that he had suffered 15 months and
needs to box to make a living.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Elias Ghanem said the fighter had made many mistakes
but deserved another chance. All the commissioners voted
favorablly for Tyson, but James Nave.
</P>
<P>
Tyson was near tears as his supporters hugged him and patted
on his back after the decision was announced.
</P>
<P>
"I'm just happy I won," he said. "I'm undecided when I'll
fight again. I don't know whether I'm prepared to fight. I've
been going through a lot of things."
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson and Muhammad Ali were among his supporters. Ali
told the commission that despite all of Tyson's problems he
should be allowed to box again.
</P>
<P>
"There are only a few punishments worse than being denied a
right to make a living," Ali said in a statement read by his
wife, Lonnie, who sat next to him. Ali had once been banned from
the sport for 3 and a half years for refusing military induction.
</P>
<P>
Tyson said he had no one to blame but himself for biting
Evander Holyfield's ears. He denied accusations that he punched
and kicked two men following a fender-bender in an accident in
August.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to kill anybody. I'm not a mass murderer,"
Tyson told the commissioners when asked about his ability to
control his temper.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ronald Schouten, one of five doctors who examined Tyson at
Massachusetts General Hospital, told the commissioners today that
the boxer's low self-esteem was a "chronic situation" but that he
could be helped through weekly treatment.
</P>
<P>
"The impact of losing his license has been
devastating,"Schouten said. "He wants his job back."
</P>
<P>
Tyson lawyer James Jimmerson opened the hearing and said Tyson
approached the hearing with a sense of "honesty, fairness and
doing the right thing."
</P>
<P>
Tyson owes the Internal Revenue Service 13 million U.S.
dollars despite having made more than 100 million dollars in pu
rses since his release from prison in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He is technically still on probation for his rape conviction,
and could be sent back to prision if convicted on the assault
charges from the car accident.

<HEADLINE> Arbitrator Supports NBA Owners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Arbitrator John Feerick
made a decision today in favor of the NBA owners and rejected the
union's grievance that 226 players with guaranteed contracts
should be paid during the lockout in New York.
</P>
<P>
The decision came on the 111th day of the lockout, which has
led the league to cancel the first two weeks of the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
The ruling strengthens the owners' bargaining position and is
a heavy blow to the players who have been waiting for a favorable
decision.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased with the arbitrator's ruling," NBA chief legal
officer Jeffrey Mishkin said. "Unfortunately, it does not get us
any closer to deal with the union's leadership."
</P>
<P>
The decision made the owners no longer to face a payment more
than 700 million U.S. dollars in salaries to the players that are
barring from work.
</P>
<P>
The union claimed that the absence of lockout language in the
standard player contract meant the owners were liable for
guaranteed salaries.
</P>
<P>
However, the owners argued that the right to withhold pay by
imposing a lockout was a tenet of labor law.
</P>
<P>
The ruling means that players now can not be paid unless the
dispute is settled. Union officials did not immediately comment.
</P>
<P>
The sides are fighting over the amount of revenues owners will
devote to salaries. The players proposed a "tax" on the highest
salaries to help slow the salary growth.
</P>
<P>
The league brought out a counterproposal incorporating the
tax, but at a much lower threshold and with much higher rates.
The union got angry by the "step backward" proposal and the
dispute looked difficult to be settled in near future.
</P>
<P>
The union filed the grievance just hours before the lockout
was imposed on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Feerick, a Fordham law professor, ruled in the controversial
Latrell Sprewell case in which he reduced the player's one-year
suspension for attacking his coach and reinstated his contract.

CHANGSHA, October 20 (Xinhua) China will provide a better
environment for overseas investment by improving legislation and
policies, according to Chen Bangzhu, vice-minister in charge of
the State Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
Chen told a trade fair on central and western regions here in

<P>
At present, China has at least 15,000 large and medium-sized
state enterprises, which account for over 85 percent of state
sector assets.
</P>
<P>
Chen says that in the future, the Chinese government will allow
overseas investors to acquire, lease, or get contracts on
medium-sized and small state enterprises, which now number in more
than 480,000.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Calls for More Effort to Promote Drug Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's present acreage of
opium poppy and marijuana was down by 70.2 percent compared to the
1997 figure, said Minister of Public Security Le Minh Huong at a
two-day conference opened here Monday to review the situation of
drug control in the past year.
</P>
<P>
He said in the ten northern mountainous provinces, the acreage
of opium poppy dropped from 1,483 hectares in the 1996-97 winter
crop to 442.6 hectares in the 1997-1998 crop.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of this year, 5,347 cases of
drug-related crimes involving 11,075 people were detected, and
34.94 kg of heroin and 588.2 kg of opium seized.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, Vietnam's courts at all levels tried
2,807 drug-related cases and handed down 34 death sentences and 19
life imprisonment verdicts.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 63,000 drug addicts received treatment to drop the habit
in that period.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has also intensified cooperation with the United
Nations Drug Control Program and the International Police, as well
as signed cooperation agreements with Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and
other regional countries to prevent and fight drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister's report sounded the alarm that
drug-related crimes are increasing rapidly, especially in major
cities and urban areas, with the appearance of trans-national drug
trafficking rings. The country currently has 80,000 registered
drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
Outlining tasks for the coming years, the minister stressed the
need to intensify the anti-drug education, further tighten the
control of legal addictive substances, to continue eradicating
poppy planting, to improve treatment for drug addicts, to complete
the laws on drug control, and to step up international cooperation
in the field.
</P>
<P>
The conference will also discuss measures and a plan of action
for the 1998-2000 period.

<HEADLINE> Palestine Blames Israel for Suspending Some Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestine blamed Israel for
its decision to postpone a set of talks in response to a grenade
explosion in Israel as the Middle East summit enters a fifth day
in the Wye Plantation in Maryland without any sign of a deal.
</P>
<P>
Israel said it would discuss only security and drop all other
issues on the agenda at its U.S. summit with the Palestinians
following the grenade attack in Beersheba, Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the Wye Plantation after the Israeli
"kitchen cabinet" discussed the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's office also said that the Israeli delegation would not
stay at the summit indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
In response, a Palestinian delegate told reporters that the
Israeli statement was an attempt to blackmail the Palestinians
into making concessions.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this is the traditional way of the Israelis to try
and blackmail the Palestinians to make concessions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to stay at Wye and continue negotiations.
Otherwise, we can go home and then come back to the States and
negotiate a whole package," said the Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side said in the statement that a meeting had been
planned for Monday to discuss opening an airport in the Gaza Strip
but Israel had now decided to postpone that meeting.
</P>
<P>
"After the consultations conducted in the kitchen cabinet, it
was decided that Israel will demand that the Palestinians fulfill
all of their commitments so that there can be progress on other
issues and there is a need to focus on issues of security and
terror," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
As the grenade attack, which wounded more than 60 people
earlier Monday, cast a shadow over the summit talks, U.S.
President Bill Clinton rejoined the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for the plantation, Clinton told reporters at
the White House that he deplored the attack and the talks were
becoming complicated and tough.
</P>
<P>
"The issues are difficult. The distrust is deep. The going has
been tough. But the parties must consider the consequences of
failure and also the benefits of progress," he told reporters
before flying to the Wye Plantation.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and other senior
U.S. officials spent a whole day on the negotiations, which
started last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, which originally planned to finish
the talks on Sunday, decided to extend the summit to Monday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged the Israelis and Palestinians to continue their
talks for a lasting peace, which is the best way to remove
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Now I am convinced that reaching a secure, just, and lasting
peace between Israelis and Palestinians is the best way to ensure
that terrorism has no future in the Middle East," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to meet Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and Netanyahu, who have been staying for five days in the Wye
Plantation, which is 110 km away from Washington.
</P>
<P>
"I'm now returning to the Middle East peace talks to encourage
the Israelis and the Palestinians to make the hard decisions
necessary to move this peace process forward," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"As I said when we launched the talks last week, the United
States will do everything we can to help. But ultimately, only the
parties themselves can bridge their differences and put their
people on a more hopeful course," he added.

<HEADLINE> English Pair Banned </HEADLINE>

<P>
LONDON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- English Badminton Association
has banned two leading players from representing their country
after being involved in high-spirited frolics with brooms in a
Dutch hotel earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Games team bronze medallist Peter Knowles and
team mate Colin Haughton caused a rare stir in the sedate world
of shuttlecocks and subtle shots by raiding the cleaners'
cupboard near the hotel bar and starting a game of cricket.
</P>
<P>
Both players had been drinking alcohol but were not
excessively drunk, the English Badminton Association said.
</P>
<P>
But the Association reacted by suspending Knowles, 28, from
representing his country until the end of the year and stripping
him of British lottery funding during the suspension -- around
2,000 pounds (3,409 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"He will receive no funding for any tournament he chooses to
enter himself," the Association said. "Following his suspension
he will be re-admitted to the squad if his improved attitude
merits it."
</P>
<P>
Haughton, 25, was also withdrawn from representing England
until the end of November and will lose funding for international
tournaments during the ban.
</P>
<P>
"Haughton's discipline is not so severe as Knowles' because
although both were involved in the incident, Haughton was quick
to try and put the situation right," the Association said.
</P>
<P>
Alcohol and its effect on English sport has been in the
spotlight in Britain recently after former soccer international
Paul Gascoigne entered a rehabilitation clinic to treat a drinki
ng problem.

reforms in the wake of the Asian financial crisis, enhancing its
leadership role in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Domestic violence protection orders granted by courts have
surged by more than 53 percent in a year in parts of the New South

</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Australian Prime Minister John Howard's election-night
pledge for reconciliation with the nation's aborigines was in

</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- David Richards has resigned as
head of the Benetton team less than two weeks before the Formula
One racing Japanese Grand Prix, the final race in this season's
Grand Prix calendar.
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old, who replaced Flavio Briatore as chief
executive just 13 months ago, will be replaced by the team's
commercial director Rocco Benetton.
</P>
<P>
Richards was brought in to revitalise the team which won both
the drivers' and constructors' titles with Michael Schumacher in
1995.
</P>
<P>
He was formerly co-driver when Ari Vatanen won the 1981 World
Rally title and later went on to run the successful Subaru team.
</P>
<P>
But this year's championship has been a two-horse race between
McLaren and Ferrari with Benetton battling with Williams and Jorda
n for third place in the constructors' standings.
</P>
<P>
They have managed only two podium finishes, with Giancarlo
Fischella taking second place in Monaco and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Benetton will go into the race at Suzuka on November 1 in
fourth place, just two points behind Williams and two ahead of
Jordan.

<P>
NEW YORK, October 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks rose for the
fourth straight session with the Dow Jones industrial average up
49.69 to 8466.45 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip barometer has gained 528 points since last
Wednesday when it rose 30.65. It was boosted by the Federal
Reserve's announcement to cut short-term interest rates on
Thursday when the index shot up 330 points, the third largest
one-day gain in history.
</P>
<P>
The Dow crossed the 8500 line at one point today, the first
time since the late August selloff.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the upswing to the continuing effects of
the interest cuts and news on late corporate mergers.
</P>
<P>
Broader market indicators were also up with the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 up 6.52 to 1262.58, the Nasdaq composite index up 27.78
to 1648.73 and the the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies up
9.58 to 352.45, according to preliminary figures..

<P>
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.26 to 525.50
and the American Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.22 to
605.72.

Advancing issues led decliners 2-1 on NYSE with trading volume
down to 714 million shares from 1.02 billion previously.

arrested Monday when they were participating in a rally near the
Pentagon in protest against military policies and spending.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the War Resisters League, several hundred peace
activists held the rally at the Pentagon's parade field, normally
used for formal welcoming ceremonies for visiting dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
A series of speakers addressed the rally with one poster
reading "We say no to war, we say no to the war machine," and
another saying "Healthcare not warfare."
</P>
<P>
One speaker, comedian Dick Gregory, questioned the Pentagon for
its military policy and said the Pentagon was "drunk with power"
but that its missiles had no power.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Privatization Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Privatization
Minister Sorin Dimitriu Monday announced his resignation, and the
Prime Minister Radu Vasile is to act as interim privatization
minister until the appointment of a new minister.
</P>
<P>
Sorin Dimitriu also handed in his resignation as head of the
State Ownership Fund, the country's main privatization body.
</P>
<P>
Dimitriu is a controversial figure in the cabinet. He has been
repeatedly criticized for the inefficient way in which he carries
out the privatization process.
</P>
<P>
According to local media, the Prime Minister Saturday evening
discussed with President Emil Constantinescu Dimitriu's possible
resignation during a meeting held at the Cotroceni Presidential
Palace.
</P>
<P>
The reason why the Privatization Minister took the decision to
quit is that Constantinescu, his staunch supporter, obviously
changed his attitude towards him and last week the Romnanian head
of state criticized the slow pace of privatization.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said that Dimitriu's changing will coincide
with the beginning of Government restructuring. Other persons will
probably change, too, such as the ministers of Reform and the
Domestic Affairs, said the local media.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian Government, which promised to privatize 2,700
societies whose social capital was estimated at about 30,000
billion lei (3.6 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998, was obliged to
decrease the number of the enterprises to be transferred to the
private domain because of the investors' lack of interest. In 1997
the Government privatized 1,300 small and medium-sized enterprises

<HEADLINE> Blair Holds Talks With Czech President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair held talks here Monday with visiting Czech President Vaclav
Havel, vowing to assist the Czech Republic in its attempt to join
NATO and the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman was quoted by Reuters as saying
Blair made the pledge during a 50-minute meeting with Havel, who
is to travel to Northern Ireland to congratulate John Hume and
David Trimble on the award of the Nobel Peace Prize for their
efforts in building peace in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Havel also outlined to Blair some measures being taken in the
Czech Republic to improve the situation of Roma people (gypsies),
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Britain recently imposed a visa requirement on nationals of the
Czech Republic's neighbour Slovakia because of a rise in the
number of Roma arriving here and seeking asylum.

<HEADLINE> Georgian Government Paratroopers Rounding-up Mutineers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Government paratroopers of the
former Soviet republic of Georgia are now engaging in an operation
to envelope the armed group of mutineers.
</P>
<P>
In the operation, conducted close to the city of Khoni in
western Georgia, the paratroopers seized four tanks and armored
personnel carriers from the mutineers, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported early Tuesday, quoting the Georgian Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Some of the 200 soliders of the mutinous group, who took 13
tanks and armored vehicles near the western Georgian town of
Samtredia, gave up resistance and surrendered, Tass said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Concerned About New Fighting in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States Monday
expressed its concern about increased fighting between Kosovo
Albanian rebels and Yugoslav forcest.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing at the Wye Plantation, Maryland,
where the Middle East summit is being held, State Department
spokesman James Rubin said the skirmishing was unacceptable,
irrespective of which side opened fire first.
</P>
<P>
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke had made it clear to the Kosovo
Albanian rebels the importance of abiding by the cease fire to
which both sides have agreed, said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke and Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic reached
agreement last week that Milosevic will pull out all the forces
from Kosovo to avert air strikes by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The agreement, heading off for the time being NATO air strikes
against Serb forces, disappointed Kosovo Albanians who favor the
use of force.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Ambassador Christopher Hill, who has been shuttling
between the two rival Yugoslav factions for months, is back in the
region holding discussions with both sides.
</P>
<P>
Hill is certainly telling the KLA, the informal name used by
the rebel force, they should not try to provoke Serb forces into
taking actions that would heighten the possibility of NATO air
strikes against them.
</P>
<P>
It would be a mistake, Rubin said, for the KLA "to consider
NATO its air force. That will not be tolerated by the U.S."
</P>
<P>
With the help of outside monitors, Rubin said NATO will be able
to distinguish between people who are legitimately defending
themselves and those who are using provocations to conduct
offensives.

<HEADLINE> Incumbent Lawmakers Rake in Big Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Although this election year
sees relatively few competitive congressional races in the United
States, incumbent lawmakers have raked in political contributions.
</P>
<P>
In two-thirds of House races, the incumbent holds a 10-to-1
fund-raising advantage over his or her challenger, or faces no
challenger at all, Larry Mackinson, director of the Center for
Responsive Politics, said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Election Commission (FEC) has reported that large,
unregulated "soft money" contributions are at an all-time high for
a midterm election. Donations from political action committees
(PACs) are showing a modest increase from 1996, a presidential
election year, the center found in a study.
</P>
<P>
"This is money being given for lobbying purposes. It's being
given with the day after the election in mind, and with the 106th
Congress in mind," Mackinson said.
</P>
<P>
The nonpartisan research center reviewed raw FEC data to
determine who the largest donors are.
</P>
<P>
Business still outspends labor by about 12-to-one, and
Democrats are the chief beneficiaries of union money. Many of the
same names have dominated donor lists for the 10 years that the
center has been operating.
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris was the biggest contributor, giving 2.6 million
dollars to candidate and parties since January 1, 1997, according
to campaign records available as of October 1.
</P>
<P>
The tobacco company was also the Republican Party's top donor,
giving 77 percent of its money to Republicans. Amway was the
Republican Party's second-biggest giver, donating all of its 1.5
million dollars to Republicans. United Parcel Service gave 78
percent of its 1.6 million dollars in political contributions to
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers was the
second largest donor overall, and Democrats got almost all of it,
receiving 98 percent of the union's 2.3 million dollars in
political gifts. The American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees gave 2.1 million dollars, 97 percent to
Democrats. The Association of Trial Lawyers of America gave 88
percent of its 2.3 million dollars to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
The center reported that leadership PACs, the committees used
by congressional leaders and others to boost their political
allies, gave 3.4 million dollars, a million more than in 1994. It
also noted that transfers made from one candidates' committee to
another, which can shield the original source of contributions to
the final recipient, jumped to 2.3 million dollars, from 1.4
million dollars in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Annan: Reform of Judiciary, Haiti's Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The reform of the
judicial system is the priority Haiti is facing now, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report on Haiti, Annan said Haiti must quickly
form a government, so it can deal with the biggest challenge
facing it after years of political upheaval.
</P>
<P>
"The matter is urgent, and delay would pose a risk in view of
the number of detainees in Haitian prisons," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Until the judicial system is made a priority, there can be no
hope of satisfactory results for the economic and social
development of the Haitian people," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Haitian National Police had made
considerable progress during the past two years, but many human
rights violations committed by its agents remained cause for
concern.
</P>
<P>
The report called for increased international aid to focus on
reforming the judiciary "which is the cornerstone of a state under
the rule of law."
</P>
<P>
It also called on Haitian politicians to allow President Rene
Preval to appoint a prime minister so as to form a government.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Nonprofit Group Awards Researchers on Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A California-based
nonprofit group announced Monday its 1998-99 research grants which
are being awarded to four universities to help answer the growing
questions around education technology.
</P>
<P>
Learning in the Real World (LRW) said that last Spring it
invited research proposals investigating the correlation between
children's use of computers and effects of this use on their
academic achievement and their social-emotional development.
</P>
<P>
The research grants will go to researchers at Central Michigan
University, Stanford University, University of California at Santa
Barbara and University of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
"Education technology will cost taxpayers up to 100 billion
dollars in up-front costs and 33 billion dollars per year after
that," LRW said. "Right now only one tenth of one percent of the
education technology budget is going to research to see if it
really works." LRW hopes that its research grants, 56,000 dollars
this year, would serve to encourage bigger foundations for
objective research before billions of dollars are wasted.
</P>
<P>
As computers have become more important in professions and the
workplace, many Americans have assumed they should become equally
important in the classroom. But LRW said that educators and
parents are now finding disturbing data which cast doubt on the
assumption that computers play a valuable role in early primary
grades.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, 35 percent of schools in the United States and three
percent of classrooms had Internet access. But 1997, the
proportions grew to 78 percent and 27 percent, respectively,
according to an Education Week report earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Sharing the concerns expressed by LRW, an author, Thomas
Sherman, wrote in Education Week that every technology bringing
benefits also carries a monetary and social price. "It is
unfortunate that we have yet to examine seriously the price
associated with Internet access," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At this point, it appears that there may be some risk to the
intellectual and emotional development of young children if they
spend considerable time surfing the Web," Sherman wrote. "At a
minimum, it will be wise to study the impact of the Web much more
carefully before we completely immerse our children in this
pervasive medium."
