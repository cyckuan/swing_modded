<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Receive 600m Dollars from IMF: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Minister for
Finance Ishaq Dar said here Thursday that Pakistan will receive
600 million U.S. dollars from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) before the end of January, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen, Dar said the IMF Board will be meeting
around January 15, 1999 and the World Bank meeting is expected a
week later to finalize the package for Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Paris Club, he said, will be meeting in the last week of
next month to consider Pakistan's requirements for economic
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Dar said that by the close of 1998 calendar year Thursday,
Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves stand at 1.057 billion
dollars even after making 60 million dollar payments to the
preferred creditors.
</P>
<P>
As for the introduction of Euro currency from Friday, the
minister said the State Bank of Pakistan has been authorized to
include Euro currency in the country's authorized currency.
</P>
<P>
The government will be making certain changes during the next
few days in the light of the new development, he added.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, Dar said the introduction of Euro will
not have any negative effect on Pakistan. On the contrary, the
European countries are reducing interest rate from 3.5 percent to
three percent with the launching of Euro currency Friday.

<HEADLINE> Carrier Enterprise Battle Groups to Leave Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States is going
to reduce its forces in the Persian Gulf with the aircraft carrier
Enterprise battle group leaving the region at the week's end, the
Pentagon said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The forces left will be adequate to do what we need to do,"
Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Pat Sivigny said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that after the Enterprise leaves to patrol the
Mediterranean, another carrier, the Carl Vinson, will remain in
the Gulf region, along with more than two dozen other ships, 200
aircraft and 20,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
Another Pentagon spokesman Col. Rechard Bridges said
coalition air crews would continue to enforce the no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq despite recent exchanges of fire
between U.S. warplanes and Iraqi air defense batteries.
</P>
<P>
"None of this has affected our ability to enforce the no-fly
zones," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Operation Northern Watch also released a statement
declaring Western resolve to respond to any Iraqi challenges in
the no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
"Coalition air crews will continue to operate in a defensive
mode as they patrol the northern no-fly zone," the statement
said. "If threatened, they will act in self-defense to protect
U.S. and coalition forces."
</P>
<P>
Iraq remained defiant. "The battle against the aggression and
aggressors has not stopped. It will continue," Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said in remarks published on Thursday
in a front-page commentary in an Iraqi newspaper, called Al-Thawra.
</P>
<P>
Bridges said that, during Wednesday's exchange of fire, four
F-16 fighters and an EA-6B electronic warfare aircraft blasted an
Iraqi anti-aircraft site with two missiles and up to eight
laser-guided bombs after Iraq fired six to eight missiles at
British bombers in the southern no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
"It appears we hit the targets," Bridges said.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman David Leavy said the United States and
its allies would continue to carry out their mission and keep
Iraq contained and limit its ability to threaten its neighbors.

<HEADLINE> hke123154 -Pak to Re-invigorate Ties with Iran: Foreign Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Secretary Shamshad
Ahmed said Thursday the focus of his discussions in Tehran during
his upcoming visit would be "to re-invigorate an abiding
relationship" between Pakistan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad is leaving for Tehran Friday on a two-day visit. He is
to deliver a special message of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to
Iranian President Muhammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The Pak-Iran friendship and cooperation "remains a mutual
necessity," he was quoted by the Associated Press of Pakistan
(APP) as saying in an exclusive interview.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad said that during his stay in Tehran, he will hold two
rounds of talks with his Iranian counterpart on all the issues
concerning the Pak-Iran relations.
</P>
<P>
This sense of mutual need, strengthened by the "manifold
commonalties, rather than small irritants sowed by outside
forces," lay down the foundation of their close and mutually
beneficial relationship, he said.
</P>
<P>
Their relationship derives its strength from geo-strategic
compulsions and deep historical links between the two countries,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad said, he would seek "expansion of mutually beneficial
cooperation in all areas of common interest."
</P>
<P>
The visit to Tehran, he said, was in the context of follow-up
of the understanding reached between Prime Minister Sharif and
Iranian President Khatmi during their meeting in New York in
September this year.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders had agreed not only on the "need for
preservation of the abiding friendship between our two countries
but also for its expansion to make it commensurate with that
special relationship that we have shared between the two
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Pak-Iran relationship, based on trust and mutual
understanding, he said, "is serving the vital interests of the two
countries as well as the cause of regional stability."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that during his stay in Tehran, the two countries will
be able "to remove any misgivings or misunderstanding that may
have aroused because of factors which are extraneous to Pak-Iran
relations."
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Secretary said, Afghanistan is not the only canvas
of relations between Pakistan and Iran. If at all it is, "it is a
point of convergence rather than divergence."
</P>
<P>
"Afghanistan is our neighbor for whose legitimate interests
both Pakistan and Iran had struggled together for peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
A peaceful and stable Afghanistan, he said, is in the interests
of all countries in the region including Iran.
</P>
<P>
To a question, he said, "the allegations that Pakistan has been
supporting the Taliban is totally baseless. We only support the
Afghan people."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the unfortunate incident of the northern Afghan
town, Marzar-e- Sharif, in which eight Iranians were killed,
Shamshad said, Pakistan had taken up the matter with the Taliban
to ensure safety of Iranians there.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao Urges Cleaning Up Taihu Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wen
Jiabao recently urged a successfully battle against the
environmental pollution problems in the Taihu Lake Valley, setting
an example for the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
Wen stressed that the first stage in the fight against
pollution in the Taihu Lake Valley has been successful, but the
task ahead remains heavy and strict checks of compliance with
environmental law must be conducted to safeguard the achievements
already reached.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Council's requirements, all polluters in
the Taihu region must meet state standards for waste water
emissions by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA)
conducted a thorough check of some major polluters tonight,
together with officials from local governments.
</P>
<P>
It was just reported from Hangzhou, a major city in the region,
that more than 700 officials have randomly checked 17 enterprises
and all have met the state standards. Some entrepreneurs expressed
their surprise at being inspected as late as 11 p.m. on New Year's
Eve, and now sense the government's resolve to win this battle.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-seven percent of the major polluters have been found to
have met the state standards in 1998, according to Xie Zhenghua,
director of SEPA.
</P>
<P>
But there is still a long way ahead. Along with the Taihu Lake
Valley, China will launch anti-pollution projects in other rivers
and lakes in 1999, a key time for China to achieve its
environmental protection aims in this century, Xie added.

<HEADLINE> Another Town Falls to Rebels in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Another major town in Sierra
Leone, Lunsar, has fallen into the hands of the rebels fighting
against elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, reports reaching
here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A report by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) quoted
Francis Okello, the United Nations representative to Sierra
Leone, as saying that the west African peacekeeping force,
ECOMOG, has withdrawn from the town, which is about 100
kilometers to the east of the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Another report reaching here quoted post office workers in
contact with Lunsar as saying that the rebels moved into the town
Wednesday, after the withdrawal of ECOMOG troops.
</P>
<P>
Before the fall of Lunsar, the rebels have captured Makeni,
the northern regional capital that is about 100 kilometers to the
northeast of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Okello said the latest advance by the rebels means that the
whole of the northern half of the country is now under rebel
control in one form or another.
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for the ECOMOG force has reportedly denied the
fall of Lunsar.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, comprising the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
which took up arms in 1991 and loyalists of the May 1997 coup
that was kicked out of Freetown in March 1998, intensified their
attacks in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
In the face of renewed rebel threat, the United States and
Britain have evacuated their nationals while the United Nations
also withdrew part of its staff to neighboring Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, which provided the bulk of the ECOMOG troops, has
airlifted more than 7,000 reinforcement troops to Freetown in the
past few days.
</P>
<P>
Other west African countries, including Mali, Gambia and
Benin, have pledged troops but have been waiting for promised
international support to deploy them.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have threatened to attack Freetown on New Year's
Day, but ECOMOG said Freetown is now safe.

<HEADLINE> Simitis: Greece Will Realize its Goals in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Greece would realize the goals
it had set in 1999, which would see the start of planning for a
new four-year period, Greece's Prime Minister Costas Simitis said
in a new year message Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said that the sacrifices and efforts of the previous
year were taking boot and the first results of the economy were
tangible in thousands of large and small projects being undertaken
through Greece, in the increase in the real incomes of the Greek
people and in the role Greece was playing in the Balkans and the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
This would be a four-year period which would allow Greeks to
make an even greater step, to increase prosperity, to proceed to a
juster distribution of the wealth produced to more citizens,
particularly those in need, he added.
</P>
<P>
He described 1998 as a good year, saying that the international
financial crisis had not harmed the Greek economy.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Seeks U.N. Support for Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- As the fighting between
government and rebel troops intensified in Sierra Leone, Nigeria,
which plays a major role in sub-regional efforts to defend its
neighboring government, has appealed for urgent assistance from
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here Thursday said Nigeria's ambassador to
the U.N., Ibrahim Gambari, has met the five permanent members of
the Security Council to press for urgent actions by the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Gambari said the meeting Wednesday in New York was to get the
council to understand the urgent need to fulfill its
responsibility to support the peace efforts in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
He said he asked the permanent members, including China,
France, Russia, Britain and the United States, to tighten the
arms embargo on Liberia and the illegal flow of arms to the
rebels in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to the council to investigate countries
violating the embargo on arms supply to the rebels, namely
Liberia and the mercenary citizens of Ukraine who are fighting
alongside the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Gambari asked the council to prevail on the international
community to honor the pledges they made to support the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and its peacekeeping
force, ECOMOG, that has been supporting the government of
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian envoy asked the council to get U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to be more pro-active in getting
U.N. members to support the needs of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Gambari explained that Nigeria is currently going through a
financial difficulty which has made the continuation of the
present level of its involvement impossible.
</P>
<P>
As Nigeria is expecting its first civilian government in 15
years in May 1999, it is impossible to expect the new government
to continue to maintain the current level of involvement, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the envoy, the response of the five permanent
members to his request is positive.
</P>
<P>
"They said they will bring all these concern to the council
immediately and to convey all these urgent requests to their
respective countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a report by the British Broadcasting Corporation
(BBC) Thursday said the Gambia has begun an effort to mediate an
end to the fighting in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Gambian Foreign Minister Mohamed Lamin Sedat
Jobe as saying that the Gambia is trying to secure a ceasefire as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
The minister gave no details but said he is confident of
success.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Sierra Leonean capital Freetown Thursday said the
rebels have captured another major town Lunsar, which is about
100 kilometers to the east of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Following the fall of Lunsar and that of Makeni earlier, the
rebels now control the northern half of the country, U.N.
representative in Freetown, Francis Okello, was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> World Community Urged to Solve Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' President Glafcos
Clerides on Thursday called on the international community to act
more decisively and to fulfill its responsibilities in resolving
the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
In his New Year message, Clerides said that Cyprus' goal of
joining the European Union (EU) is beginning to be realised with
the opening of substantive talks in November.
</P>
<P>
"A more decisive and dynamic stand on the part of the
international community will give a new dimension to the
catalytic role our accession course to the EU may play on the
Cyprus problem," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
He assured that it was the Cypriot government's consistent
strategy to encourage and help the international community in
effective involvement in the Cyprus problem so that a settlement
would be reached.
</P>
<P>
He said that the support from Greece remains vital for Cyprus'
EU accession effort.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot president highlighted the significance of the Joint
Defense Doctrine between Greece and Cyprus in the maintenance of
peace and stability of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The joint defense pact concluded in 1993 stipulates that Greece
will come to Cyprus' aide in case of a new Turkish offensive.
</P>
<P>
The solution of the Cyprus problem and Cyprus' accession to the
EU are the two major objectives of the Cypriot government,
Clerides reiterated.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Nicosia's struggle for EU membership was
made difficult due to the "intransigent stand" of the Turkish
Cypriot sides.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Cyprus is ready to give everything to safeguard
its freedom, human and national dignity in the face of provocation
or attack, "however strong the enemy might be."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of the

CAIRO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Following are economic briefs
from the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
KHARTOUM -- Sudan produced 6 million tonnes of cereals in
1998, said Minister of Agriculture and Forests Ali Nafie.
</P>
<P>
The remaining cereal stock from last year stands at 700,000
tonnes, reported the Alam Al Yom daily Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Most Sudanese cereal products are wheat and maize. During the
years 1996 and 1997, the average annual production of cereals
amounted to 5.3 million tonnes, whereas, average annual
consumption stood at 4.2 million tonnes.
</P>
<P>
In October, the Sudanese government lifted the ban on exports
of maize to help raise local prices which had declined due to
excessive supply.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is the mainstay of the Sudanese economy. It
constitutes 95 percent of the country's exports, and between 40
to 50 percent of the gross domestic product, and provides
jobs to some 80 percent of the labor force.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Cotton products rank the second among Egypt's exports,
accounting for some 39 percent of the exports volume during the
period from 1994 to 1997, said a report by the Egyptian Ministry
of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The report, carried by the Alam Al Yom newspaper Thursday,
said that 79 percent of the cotton products go to western Europe
and the United States, and the rest goes to eastern Europe,
Africa, Asia and Arab states.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Saudi Arabian Consulting Services firm has
called upon Saudi businessmen and investors to engage in the
production of palm oil.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Saudi Arabia imported about 160,000 tonnes of palm oil.
This amount dropped to some 100,000 tonnes last year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Fails to Meet Beef Export Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has failed to meet
its export quota for the third year running due to the Cold
Storage Company (CSC) debt burden, high interest rates and the
depleted head, the Cattle Producers Association (CPA) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
CPA Chairman John Heynes said in the latest issue of the
Farmer magazine that it was expected that only 6,000 tons would
be achieved this year, far less than the required quota of 9,100
tons.
</P>
<P>
He noted that during 1996 and 1997, 6,600 tons and 6,560 tons
were exported respectively.
</P>
<P>
The marketing and debt problems faced by the CSC, he said,
were hindering the operations of the company, hence the failure
to perform up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
Due to low slaughter levels, Zimbabwe had failed to take
advantage of a duty free quota of 5,000 tons to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Only a few abattoirs passed export standards approved by the
European Union, thereby limiting the export ability," he said.

WASHINGTON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British
warplanes resumed their patrol on Thursday over no-fly zones in
Iraq and returned safely after the mission, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Pat Sivigny said Thursday's
flights were routine in both the northern and southern no-fly
zones, despite renewed Iraqi threats to challenge U.S. and
British planes monitoring the no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
"No violations have been reported in either no-fly zone,"
Sivigny said.
</P>
<P>
Two clashes between U.S. and British planes and Iraqi air
defense batteries have occurred this week. One took place on
Monday in the northern no-fly zone when U.S. warplanes from
Incirlik base, Turkey, attacked an Iraqi anti-aircraft site
after it launched missiles at the jets. The other happened on
Wednesday when U.S. warplanes attacked Iraqi targets after
Baghdad fired missiles at British and U.S. aircraft flying the
southern no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British planes suspended their patrolling
mission over the no-fly zones on Tuesday because of weather.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Waives Maize Imports Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa announced Thursday that the country has waived
maize import duty as a measure to solve the impending food
shortage.
</P>
<P>
In his New Year message to the nation, Mkapa said Tanzania's
Strategic Grain Reserve (SGR) has fallen to the lowest level
since it was set up in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The country is short of 400,000 to 450,000 tons of food, or 25
to 30 percent below requirement, due to lack of precipitation in
most parts of the country during short rains season starting
September, Mkapa said in a televised speech broadcast in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
Only Kigoma Region in the west and some parts of the Lake Zone
in the north have received some rainfalls in the season, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa also encouraged businessmen to transport food from
harvest regions to grain deficit areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a desperate move to alleviate food shortage, the president
ordered local brewers not to use food crops for production.
</P>
<P>
The president also asked people not to be choosy about food,
saying that cassava, plantain and yams should be consumed as
well.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa advised people to prepare their farms as soon as
possible and plant drought resistant crops such as cassava and
millets, adding that valleys and lower basins should be used for
crops cultivation.
</P>
<P>
People with cattle should be prepared to sell some to buy food
while those with few cash or domestic animals should be prepared
to work hard for food.

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Vows to Continue Fighting Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa said Thursday that the country will continue with
its anti-corruption campaign in the year 1999.
</P>
<P>
In his New Year message to the nation, Mkapa urged people to
report corrupt officers in their areas to him or to the Prime
Minister. He also called on people to refrain from bribing
officials as it encourages graft practice.
</P>
<P>
During 1998, he said, the government spared no efforts in
combating corruption. However, he admitted it was not an easy
task.
</P>
<P>
"No country in the world has ever eradicated corruption
completely," he said in a televised speech broadcast in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on security situation during the past year, the
president said tranquillity and peace prevailed in the country,
except for the bombing of U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam and
banditry incidents caused by refugees in border regions.
</P>
<P>
To maintain social order, Mkapa said some 3,000 policemen were
recruited during the passing year, and their equipment have
improved.
</P>
<P>
On the achievements of medical care, he said districts have
been given more responsibilities in running the sector. In
addition, District and Hospital boards were formed in Dar es
Salaam, northwestern Kagera Region and in Igunga District in the
northern Tabora Region.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, he said, district and hospital boards will be
launched in 35 districts.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Ministry of Health has completed drawing the
Health Sector Reform Action Plan (1999-2002).
</P>
<P>
On the leakage of national Form Four examination papers, he
said, the incident has revealed the decay of the nation's morale
and irresponsibility of some people.
</P>
<P>
"Which nation are we trying to build when the would-be
doctors, engineers and academicians would attain their
qualifications by dubious means?" he queried.

<HEADLINE> Chissano Calls for Boosting Economy by 10 PC </HEADLINE>

<P>
MAPUTO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano Thursday called on his countrymen to make concerted
efforts to boost the country's economic growth by 10 percent in
1999.
</P>
<P>
In his New Year message to the country, Chissano urged
Mozambicans to pay great attention to agriculture which is
crucial to poverty elimination and achieve the strategic goal for
economic development.
</P>
<P>
In the past years, he said, Mozambique has made big strides in
uplifting people's living standard as well as in shifting from
heavy dependence on foreign aid to a vigorous economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, both the prices of goods and the national
currency Metical have been relatively steady against the hard
currencies, adding that the steady macro-economy has in turn
enhanced the confidence of foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
"We may say that the country is ready for rapid economic
development and the gradual improvement in people's lives in the
coming years," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Chissano also appealed for continued attention to financial
allocation and investment in education, health, water supply,
environment and road construction.
</P>
<P>
Inflation should be curbed, while savings and productive
investment as well as foreign investment be encouraged, he added.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Mozambique's economy is to grow by 11.2
percent this year, making the country one of the few African
countries whose economy enjoys a double digit increase.

<HEADLINE> Schroder: Europe will Master Globalization with Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The single currency euro, set for
its historic launching at midnight, will help Europe to master the
challenges of globalization, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said
in an interview published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the business daily Handelsblatt, Schroeder said the period of
"nations going it alone in economic and financial policy" was now
over. With a common currency, cooperation in Europe must be
strengthened, he added.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder called the new single currency "Europe's key to the 21st
Century" and said that the euro actually had withstood its first tests
on international markets, while acceptance of the new currency among
Europeans was gaining.
</P>
<P>
"With the euro behind it, the European Union is well prepared for
the changes in the world economy," Schroder said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder also said that in addition to the fiscal policy stability
package to assure the euro's stability, there must also come an
employment package.
</P>
<P>
"The people can't be sold politically on a stability package
without an employment package," he told Handelsblatt.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also reported on a survey taken of bank economists
who predicted the 11 "Euroland" countries - Austria, Belgium, Finland,
France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal,
and Spain - would see favorable starting conditions of only 1.5 per
cent inflation in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Most of the experts surveyed foresaw the euro rising by 10 percent
on the dollar next year, which would give the European Central Bank
room to lower its key interest rate to 2.75 percent, from the current
3.0 percent. Some experts even foresaw a rate cut down to 2.5 per
cent, Handelsblatt said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Considers New Lending to Russia in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, January 1 (Xinhua) - The International Monetary Fund is
considering the possibility of lending to Russia under a new
Extended Facility Fund (EFF) program for 1999-2001, the Interfax
news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In June 1998, the IMF Board of Directors decided to prolong
by one year the previous 9.2 billion U.S. dollars program
expiring in March 1999 because the fund was lagging behind the
initial disbursement schedule.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government, on its part, requested the IMF to
consider the possibility of launching the new extended financing
program.
</P>
<P>
Under the new program, Russia hopes to borrow 7--8 billion
U.S. dollars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the IMF offered Russia 6.14 billion U.S. dollars,
1.34 billion of the sum in tranches of the EFF program and 4.8
billion in the framework of a stabilization loan approved by the
IMF Board of Directors on July 20.
</P>
<P>
This means total lending almost tripled from 1997 when the
IMF disbursed 2.1 billion U.S. dollars under the EFF program.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of 1998, the IMF planned to disburse 12.5
billion U.S. dollars, 1.3 billion of it agreed upon earlier in
the framework of EFF and 11.2 billion in additional stabilization
loans. However, given the crisis in August and the failure of the
Russian government to observe the terms of financial aid, the IMF
suspended disbursements.
</P>
<P>
Another IMF mission is expected in Moscow in mid-January. It
would decide about the possibility of disbursing the second 4.3
billion U.S. dollars tranche of the stabilization loan. The
Russian government attaches great hopes to the tranche which
Russia was to receive in September 1998 under the initial plan.
</P>
<P>
According to IMF reports, Russia owed a total of 19.5 billion
U.S. dollars to the Fund on September 1. In 1999 Russia is due to
pay the IMF 4.6 billion U.S. dollars on loans and interest.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Needs Adjustment to Euro Introduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The introduction of the Euro on
January 1 may result in less foreign investment in Thailand if the
country fails to improve its financial, industrial and legal
systems to meet the internationally accepted standards.
</P>
<P>
"If the Euro is sufficiently stable and does help lower
interest rates and diminish production costs in Europe as
designed, more European and other foreign firms may transfer their
investments to Europe and that could cause trouble to
cash-strapped Thailand which badly needs foreign currencies to
right its ailing economy," the Thai News Agency on Friday quoted
Nimit Nanthapanthawat, chief of the Research Center of the Bangkok
Bank, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thailand can also expect heated competition and there are
chances that the country will lose several European markets should
more European countries, which manufacture the same kind of
products as Thailand does, enter this single-currency zone, Nimit
said.
</P>
<P>
"With the advent of the Euro, Europe can become the economic
rival to the United States. It is expected that the single
currency will in the long run contribute to the annual economic
growth of at least 1 percent in Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the preparations in the financial and legal
systems, Thailand and other countries in Southeast Asia should be
more economically unified as to create a strong bargaining power
at international level, and a united effort is always more
effective than an isolated endeavor, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted other economists as saying the Euro may result in the
declining of Thai exports due to the stronger baht. The U.S.
dollar is expected to decline after the introduction of the
European single currency, which means the baht will surge and then
unavoidably affect Thai exports.

<HEADLINE> IMF Considers New Loan to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, January 1 (Xinhua) - The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) is considering the possibility of a new loan to Russia, the
Interfax news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
IMF and other lenders agreed to give Russia 22.6 billion U.S.
dollars in loans in 1998 to stabilize its finances. In June 1998,
the IMF Board of Directors decided to prolong by one year the
previous program expiring in March 1999, because the fund was
lagging behind the initial disbursement schedule.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government requested that the IMF consider the
possibility of launching the new extended financing program.
Russia's intention was supported by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
And an IMF delegation is due to visit Russia in mid-January
to discuss the next launch of money.
</P>
<P>
Under the new program, Russia hopes to borrow seven to eight
billion U.S. dollars, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Leaders Call for Greater Progress in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's unionist and
republican leaders on Friday called for more progress towards a
permanent peace settlement in their respective 1999 New Year
messages.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's First Minister David Trimble said peace in
the province must be secured in the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
In his message, Trimble said more had been achieved in the
past year than most people would have believed possible, but
there was still much to be done.
</P>
<P>
"1999 must be the year in which peace is finally and
completely secured. In the referendum, the people voted for a
real peace," said Trimble, who is also the Ulster Unionist Party
leader.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever happens, 1998 was the year we crossed the
watershed. The mountains are behind us. There are still hills in
front, but I believe we can make our way through them," he added.
</P>
<P>
In a separate message, Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said
if all parties honored their commitments to the agreement, they
could make major steps towards a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
The major issues facing all sides were the establishment of
the Assembly executive, an all-Ireland ministerial council and
cross-border policy and implementations bodies, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the political will exists, and if the parties to the
agreement honor their commitments, then progress will be made,"
said Adams. But he warned that progress could not be made until
Trimble "stopped looking over his shoulder at the past" and to
those in his party who were against change.
</P>
<P>
He urged the British and Irish governments to renew efforts
to move the process forward.
</P>
<P>
"For our part, Sinn Fein has repeatedly demonstrated our
commitment to the peace process," he said. "We are looking to a
new future, a new century, now only 12 months away."
</P>
<P>
The Assembly is due to meet later this month to ratify the
agreement on the structures of government for the province.

<HEADLINE> Azerbaijan to Observe Ceasefire With Armenia: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Azeri President Heydar Aliyev
pledged in a New Year message Friday that his country will
respect the ceasefire agreement signed with Armenia on the
Nagorno-Karabakh dispute.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev said that efforts were continuing to strive for a
peaceful settlement of the confrontation over the disputed
territory which hindered the normalization of Azeri-Armenian
relations, adding that Baku was ready to offer the region a high
degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The refugee problem still remains a major task on the agenda
of the Azerbaijani government, Aliyev said, expressing the hope
that this would be solved gradually with the progress to be made
on the Nagorno-Karabakh issue in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan and Armenia have long been at odds over the sove
reignty of Nagorno-Karabakh, a former autonomous region within
Azerbaijan whose population is mostly Armenian, leading to armed
clashes between 1988 and 1994 which caused around 7,000 deaths
and made hundreds of thousands of people refugees.
</P>
<P>
The two countries reached a ceasefire agreement in 1994 with
the mediation of the international community. However, the peace
talks have failed to achieve substantial progress so far due to
the two sides' differences over the issue.
</P>
<P>
On domestic issues, Aliyev said that the country's democratic
reform was proceeding smoothly and significant progress had been
achieved.
</P>
<P>
He said that two amnesties were announced last year with the
release of 24,000 people from jail and over 270 being pardoned.
The death penalty was also removed from the country's criminal
code.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev also expressed his satisfaction with the Azeri
government which he said had made the past year a successful one
for the country in all sectors.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Pay $1.5 Billion Foreign Debt in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will spend 1.5 billion U.S.
Dollars for external debt service in 1999, the Head of State, General
Abdulsalami Abubakar said Friday in a national broadcast on the 1999 budget.
</P>
<P>
The sum is 50 million Dollars less than in the case of previous years.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar explained that this is due to resource constraints in
1999, mainly as a result of the slump oil price in the international
market, as Nigeria depends on oil export for more than 90 percent of
its export income and 80 percent of the budgeted income.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that even the two billion Dollars set aside for external
debt services in previous budgets has been below the requirement of Nigeria'
s creditors, and has resulted in the accumulation of substantial arrears.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, he said, efforts will be intensified to open up
negotiations with the Paris Club, the Bretton Woods Institutions and
other creditors to seek debt reduction and debt relief.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Nigeria has already started discussion with the
above-said creditors toward evolving a program aimed at eventually
attaining debt relief for the country.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar also announced the lifting of the 1994 embargo placed on
external borrowing "in view of the projected deficit in the 1999 budget"
and the need for government to broaden the source of funding.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the borrowed money will be mainly spent on
export-based projects, including those in the oil and gas sectors.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's foreign debt now stands at between 28 billion to 34 billion
Dollars, according to the estimate of different sources.

<HEADLINE> China Implements Revised Land Use Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- China today began imposing the
world's strictest land-use regulations to protect arable land
through the implementation of the revised Land Use Law in an
effort to ensure sustainable economic growth and social progress.
</P>
<P>
The new law requires that each province, autonomous region and
municipality guarantee that the amount of arable land under their
jurisdiction does not decrease, and that land quality is improved
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Farmland under special protection should account for more than
80 percent of the total in each administrative region, according
to the law.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China will impose tighter reins on approving land use
for construction. The new law empowers only the central and
provincial governments with the right of approval, and raises
compensation for land acquisition.
</P>
<P>
To protect arable land, the new Land Use Law requires
governments at each level to take measures to improve the soil and
to prevent desertification, soil salinization and land erosion.

<HEADLINE> Official Exchange Rate of Nigeria's Currency Abolished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar announced this in
his 1999 budget broadcast to the nation Friday morning, saying that the
abolition of the official exchange rate would remove the long-standing
opportunity for personal gain at the expense of the public interest.
</P>
<P>
The application of the dual exchange rate did not allow for proper
evaluation of viable economic projects funded at official rate, he said,
adding that the practice had encouraged unprofitable projects in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Public expenditure is transacted at the autonomous rate, revenue is
monetized at official rate, giving rise to a mismatch between revenue and
expenditure," Abubakar stressed.
</P>
<P>
In the broadcast speech, he said that the focus of the monetary policy
in 1999 would remain the maintenance of price stability as well as the
promotion of stability of the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the dual exchange rate introduced four years ago has been a
subject of tense debate in the most populous African country among experts
who have argued for or against the merger of the dual exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Those who wanted the exchange rate merged argued that the retention of
the dual exchange rate was an incentive to corruption as well as creating
serious accounting problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar also announced that the Nigerian government had granted
the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) an autonomy in the formulation and
implementation of monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
According to him, this development was "in recognition of the critical
role which an independent central bank can play in the maintenance of price
stability and sound economic management."
</P>
<P>
An independent central bank will serve the best interest of the national
economy of Nigeria, said Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
The large scale fraud by the former Head of State Sani Abacha and his
aides was blamed on the lack of autonomy of the CBN by financial experts in
the country.

the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) to contribute
more to the country in the new year.
</P>
<P>
At a New Year reception hosted by the National Committee of the

of effective work performance by China's eight non-communist
parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Through studying Deng Xiaoping Theory and the guidelines of the
15th CPC National Congress, members of the non-communist parties
continued to carry forward the fine tradition of cooperating with
the Chinese Communist Party and play their role of participating
in political and governmental affairs and democratic supervision,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 will be the 50th anniversary of the founding of
the People's Republic of China as well as the system of

BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Air pollution indexes for some
major cities in north China remained high over the past week,
indicating that serious air pollution has not been eased,
according to the weekly report issued by the China Environment
Monitoring Center today.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the polluted air in the cities to unfavorable
weather conditions in the early part of the week, and low wind
speeds were unable to disperse the unclean air.
</P>
<P>
The pollution indexes for Lanzhou, Hohhot, Xining and Jinan
were reported at over 300, with air quality ranked V, the highest
and most serious category of pollution, during December 25-31,
1998.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Raps Iraqi Government for Deserting People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 1 (Xinhua) -- In a rare move, Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak lashed out at Iraqi government and President Saddam
Hussein for failing to "play the necessary role" in easing the
long-running plight of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing our best to remove the aftermath of the disaster
caused by Saddam Hussein when he invaded Kuwait. We are taking
into account the conditions of the Iraqi people who are suffering
most," Mubarak said in an interview with Egypt's Al Ahram daily.
</P>
<P>
Extracts of Mubarak's remarks were carried by the Middle East
News Agency Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We are not dealing with the Iraqi regime that has not yet
played the role that can help in removing its people's
sufferings," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader criticized the Iraqi government as there
was a war of words going on between the two countries, both
trading accusations and name-calling in their media.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi papers, known to be controlled by the government, have
reportedly blamed Arab leaders, including Mubarak, for failing to
help Iraq have the U.N. sanctions lifted while Egypt's official
media accused Saddam himself of bringing about the disasters in
Iraq and causing the rift in Arab ranks by sending troops into
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis have been reeling under eight years of crippling
sanctions imposed by the Untied Nations Security Council after its
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
In his interview with Al Ahram, Mubarak dismissed the call made
by Iraqi officials for not to draw a line between the ordinary
Iraqis and their ruling system.
</P>
<P>
"This is unacceptable talk at a time when the very same Iraqi
officials incite the Arab peoples to turn their backs against
their rulers," he told the paper.
</P>
<P>
"Has the Iraqi regime managed to patch up things with its Arab
brothers? Has this regime given up its ambitions and showed good
manners on having different views from others?" asked Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
"We are not supposed to replace this regime in undertaking its
responsibilities towards its people. The Iraqi regime has to take
the decisions beneficial to its people's interests, not the ones
that tamper with and squander these interests," he said.

<HEADLINE> New Year Brings New Hopes for Hong Kong: Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong entered the year
1999 with hopes and dreams for a better future, which requires
continued and pains-taking efforts of both the government and
people, local newspapers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents took to the streets
and counted down to the New Year Thursday night although the year
1998 had been struck by economic downturn, resulting in negative
economic growth and a higher jobless rate.
</P>
<P>
A commentary of Ta Kung Pao said the reason for the unhappiness
of Hong Kong people in 1998 was mainly from "external factors" and
the problems left over by history.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong returned to China on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
While the government of the Special Administrative Region (SAR)
made great efforts to overcome the difficulties, the Central
government has given "biggest possible support" to the SAR, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The festivities of the New Year's eve showed that Hong Kong
people cherish great hopes and confidence that the difficulties
will be overcome and economic recovery will soon start in the new
year, it said.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary, Wen Wei Po said Hong Kong has a relatively
favorable environment compared with other crisis-hit economies in
Asia since it is backed by China's mainland areas which enjoy a
sound economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The commentary called on the people of Hong Kong to "face the
reality" and work together to handle the existing problems so as
to further improve Hong Kong's strength in competition.
</P>
<P>
It appealed to employers and employees to adopt an attitude of
mutual understanding and coordination so as to narrow their
differences. It also hoped that politicians should "act with
caution" and not do anything to affect Hong Kong's stability or
dampen the enthusiasm of investors.
</P>
<P>
A commentary of Ming Pao Daily News described the year 1999 as
one of profit when people should strive for innovations and
reformation that will pave the way for future development.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said 1997 was a year of transition that
primarily requires stability and that 1998 was a year of
(economic) storm in which handling crisis is top priority.
</P>
<P>
It said Hong Kong people should take the advantage of "Hong
Kong people ruling Hong Kong" and meet the challenges of the
times.
</P>
<P>
A Sing Tao Daily commentary said Hong Kong can step into a new
century with a sound structure as long as it sticks to the current
path.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said Hong Kong has come to the dawn of economic
recovery. It said an overall growth of the world economy, although
such growth might be limited, will be helpful to the economic
recovery of Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Wenger Demands 'Cheat' Clampdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League club
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has ended 1998 by urging the
Football Association to crack down on cheating in the New Year.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman said referees were being conned by players
feigning injury in an attempt to have others sent off.
</P>
<P>
Wenger claimed Charlton midfielder Neil Redfearn was
responsible for Patrick Vieira being shown the red card during
last Monday's Premiership game at The Valley, which Arsenal won
1-0.
</P>
<P>
Vieira is facing a three-match ban but FA spokesman Steve
Double said: "Arsenal can appeal against the Vieira decision if
they so desire. They know the appeal procedure."
</P>
<P>
Foreign players have been accused of feigning injury in the
past, but Wenger believes their English counterparts are learning
fast.
</P>
<P>
"It's growing in England. It's not huge compared to other
countries but it's becoming bigger and bigger," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't like it, whether it's an English player or a foreign
player. I like people who put their foot in and are aggressive on
the field, but who don't behave like cheats."
</P>
<P>
Wenger wants the FA to adopt the French system when videos of
games are reviewed by disciplinary officials, who are empowered
to take action against guilty players.
</P>
<P>
"You need to punish people who cheat. Those who go down on
purpose in the penalty area should get the red card and those who
do so elsewhere on the pitch should also be punished.
</P>
<P>
"The difficulty for the referees is to sometimes see at normal
pace what has happened. Sometimes you can only see on slow motion
that the guy was cheating," Wenger added.
</P>
<P>
Vieira was sent off after Redfearn went down clutching his
face, but Wenger claims his aggressive reputation is unfair.
</P>
<P>
He claims Vieira's elbow came into contact with Redfearn's
chest after the Charlton player had tackled him from behind.
</P>
<P>
"My thought is that Patrick didn't deserve to be sent off and
the Neil Redfearn cheated the referee.
</P>
<P>
"Usually, I think, Redfearn is an honest type but on that
occasion, maybe Charlton wanted so much to win the game that he
was ready for everything to get him sent off," said Wenger.
</P>
<P>
But his allegations have been dismissed by Redfearn, who said:
"The first time he swung he just caught me on the cheek just
below my eye and then swung again and caught me on the shoulder.
When he did catch me on the eye it was quite painful."
</P>
<P>
He added: "I didn't want Patrick to be sent off. I would never
want to do that to a fellow professional. I think he's a
fantastic player and I'm disappointed how it's turned out.
</P>
<P>
"I went down but I actually got straight back up, I didn't
want the lad to get sent off, no way. I actually got booked and I
don't know what for. "

<HEADLINE> Pak Official Leaves for Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmed left here Friday for Tehran on a two-day visit for
talks on the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad will hold formal talks with Iranian Deputy Foreign
Minster Mohsin Aminzadeh on the entire range of bilateral matters,
particularly the Afghan issue, sources from the Foreign Ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Tehran, the Foreign Secretary will also call
on Iranian President Khatami to deliver a letter from Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad told the reporters before his departure that
developments in Afghanistan would not affect the friendly ties
between Pakistan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan issue is one of the important topics for the two
countries during his Tehran tour, said Shamshad, adding that some
ugly incidents in war-torn Afghanistan will not harm relations
between Pakistan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
He dispelled the impression that Pakistan has any competition
with Iran in Afghanistan, saying that Afghanistan is important for
the relationship between two countries. Any incident in
Afghanistan will have no impact on the friendly Pak-Iran ties, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad also said relations between Pakistan and Iran are
based on cooperation to resolve the long-running Afghan problem.
"The ties have never been based on rivalry in Afghanistan as we
are not competitors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if there is a possibility of the revival of the Pak-Iran
joint peace mission for the solution of the Afghan crisis, the
Foreign Secretary said Pakistan has been in close cooperation with
Iran in all aspects. He said his visit to Iran is in line with the
continued consultations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> 1998: Year of Mixed Economic Blessings: Nigerian Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to Abubakar, Nigeria witnessed in 1998 some measure
of macro-economic stability and consolidation of the economic gains
attained in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said that significant progress has also been made in
implementing economic reforms, including the removal of restrictions on
competition as well as private sector participation in various sectors of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the economy suffered some setbacks which
adversely affected the implementation of the 1998 budget and the
realization of the set targets.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's crude oil production, which accounts for more than 90 percent
of its foreign currency income and 80 percent of budgetary revenue, has
suffered blows.
</P>
<P>
In its 1998 budget, the Nigerian government predicted an oil price of 17
U.S. Dollars per barrel, but due to the decline of oil price in the
international market, the commodity was sold at an average price of 12
Dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to save the oil price, the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) slashed the quota of member countries, including
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The tension between oil companies and oil-producing communities in
southern Nigeria led to the closure of many oil wells and flow stations in
1998, which also reduced Nigeria's oil production and export.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Abubakar said, the budgeted 1998 revenue of 216.336 billion
Naira (one Dollar equals about 85 Naira) could not be realized.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October 1998, the country's actual receipts from
crude oil reached only 134.44 billion Naira, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar concluded that the story in 1998 proved again Nigeria's
economic weakness, namely, the over reliance on oil revenue.
</P>
<P>
"A major development goal for the country, therefore, is to
diversify the production, foreign exchange and revenue base of the economy,"
he said, adding that the 1999 budget will provide the basis for achieving
this goal.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Abubakar disclosed that by the end of November 1998,
Nigeria's foreign reserve stood at 7.6 billion Dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- England teammates Steve
McManaman and Rio Ferdinand are transfer targets for some of
Europe's biggest clubs, according to the BBC Thursday's reports.
</P>
<P>
Spanish giants Real Madrid are reportedly ready to offer
winger McManaman 110,000 a week to join them when his contract
with Liverpool runs out in the summer.
</P>
<P>
New rules mean the 26-year-old can begin talks with interested
clubs because his current deal has only six months left before
expiry.
</P>
<P>
McManaman has also been linked with Barcelona, Inter and AC
Milan, Juventus and Lazio.
</P>
<P>
But The Sun newspaper claims Real have prepared a four-year
contract, worth a total of 5.72m.
</P>
<P>
Defender Ferdinand has a seven-year deal with West Ham but the
list of admirers of the 20-year-old is growing.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool are thought to
monitoring his situation, but the Daily Mail claims they will
face competition from the continent if West Ham decide to sell
him.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Juventus, Inter Milan and Barcelona have
indicated they are willing to spend up to 15m on Ferdinand.
</P>
<P>
The club is currently sixth in the Premiership table and
challenging for a place in Europe next season.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Indian Minister's Utterance on Taiwan Dangerous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The utterance by Indian Urban
Development Minister Ram Jethmalani on Taiwan last Sunday was
evil-minded and dangerous as it was preaching recognition of the
island province of China.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Week magazine, the Indian minister
said that there is "a strong case" for recognition of Taiwan as
it is an "independent and democratic country now having 25
million people with a foreign exchange reserve of 96 billion U.S.
dollars."
</P>
<P>
Jethmalani, as a minister of India, should not be ignorant of
the simple fact that there is only one China in the world, Taiwan
is an inalienable part of China and the government of the
People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government of
the country.
</P>
<P>
This has been accepted by the United Nations and the
international community as a fact. All countries declared their
commitment to pursuing the one-China policy when they established
diplomatic relations with China. In this case, India is no
exception.
</P>
<P>
Jethmalani's yearnings reveal that there is a force in India
that is opposing the improvement of Sino-Indian relations and
attempting to split China.
</P>
<P>
The Indian minister's remarks on Taiwan were a flagrant
interference in China's internal affairs and it was a grave
development aimed at splitting China. So it has naturally caused
indignation among the Chinese people, who have heighten their
vigilance.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue is purely an internal affair of China and
China will never allow any foreign forces to meddle in its
internal affairs in whatever forms and under whatever
pretexts.
</P>
<P>
It is a common aspiration of all the Chinese people, including
the Taiwanese, to reunify the motherland as early as possible and
the reunification is an irresistible historical trend.
</P>
<P>
Jethmalani's utterance have seriously hurt the feelings of the
Chinese people and set obstacles to the improvement of relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, the Indian minister also called on New Delhi
to "make a serious departure from its present thinking to get
back its land occupied in the 1962 Chinese aggression."
</P>
<P>
History has already drawn its conclusion on the 1962
India-China border clashes, which were caused by India's
expansionism. The fact is that India grabbed about 90,000 square
kilometers of Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
When Indian armed forces launched large-scale attacks on
Chinese frontier troops in October 1962, China was forced to
mount a self-defensive counterattack.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the Chinese government has been making efforts
for a peaceful solution to the border dispute and trying hard to
create favorable conditions for the enhancement of mutual
confidence between the two countries so as to bring out a
reasonable and final settlement of the border dispute.
</P>
<P>
Jethmalani's remarks on the border issue represented nothing
but a futile attempt to distort historical facts.
</P>
<P>
China and India are close neighbors and the two most populous
countries in the world. Currently, both countries are faced with
the task of boosting their economic development.
</P>
<P>
A friendly Sino-Indian relationship not only conforms to the
fundamental interests of the two countries and the two peoples
but also is conducive to the peace, stability and development in
Asia and the whole world.
</P>
<P>
History shows that as long as the two countries follow the
principles of peaceful coexistence, China and India will witness
a smooth development of their relations. Otherwise, the
Sino-Indian ties will suffer setbacks.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government should take due steps to get the
China-India ties back to the track of normal development by
removing obstacles from the way.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Aims  to Attain 3 Percent Growth in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria isl aimed to achieve a minimum
growth rate of three percent in 1999, Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar said Friday in a national broadcast on the 1999 budget.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian leader announced that in view of the slump in the global
oil market, the 1999 budget is based on the oil price of nine U.S.
Dollars per barrel, compared with 17 dollars per barrel in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Based on an exchange rate of 86 Naira to one Dollar, the budget
predicts a revenue of 453.7 billion Naira from the oil and gas sector,
while revenue from non-oil sector is estimated at 214 billion Naira.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar announced a total spending of 88 billion Naira on capital
projects, including those in agriculture, health, education, road, water
supply and rural electrification.
</P>
<P>
He also announced a spending of 1.5 billion Naira on poverty
alleviation and rural development, including one billion Naira for
the Family Economic Advancement Project and 500 million Naira for soft
loans and support services for rural and small-scale industries.
</P>
<P>
Despite a 54 percent fall in the expected total revenue, the budgeted
spending on salary increased from 56 billion Naira in 1998 to 100 billion
i9n 1999, due to increased salaries and allowances for civil servants.
</P>
<P>
The budget expects a total of 50 billion Naira in revenues from the
Value Added Tax (VAT). And according to the new distribution formula,
about 15 percent will go to the federal government, while the state and
local governments will get 50 and 35 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the budget, the federal government will have a fiscal
deficit of 34.1 billion Naira in 1999, representing 1.05 percent of
projected gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The budget provides 39 billion Naira for settlement of domestic
debt.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Farmers Call for Eye-for-Eye Trade Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia National Farmers' Union (ZNFU)
has called on the government to impose non-tariff barriers on all
horticultural produce from neighboring South Africa and Zimbabwe to enable
Zambian farmers to compete fairly.
</P>
<P>
ZNFU President Ajay Vashee said the situation pertaining to the flooding
of horticultural products from the two countries in most shopping outlets
has not changed in spite of the presentations the union has made to the
authorities, according to Friday's Times of Zambia newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the union leader as saying that unless the
trend is reversed, the Zambian farmers, especially the small-scale
horticulturist will be wiped out.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the non-tariff barriers that South Africa and Zimbabwe have
put in place, including some very tough administrative measures, the
Zambian farmers cannot sell even a single cabbage in Johannesburg or Harare
vegetable shop," Vashee complained.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Zimbabwean authorities has introduced a rule where any
Zambian farmer wishing to export to that country has to apply for
authorization from Harare.
</P>
<P>
If successful, such an authority is valid for only 24 hours after
which it can not be used to export anything, said Vashee.
</P>
<P>
"Imagine, that means one has to drive or fly to Harare to get the
authority and rush back to Zambia and export the goods within the time
frame, something practically very difficult," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that while Zambian farmers are finding it difficult to export
to the south, the Zambian market is free for the produce from South Africa
and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Concern has been raised in various fora about the amount of the two
countries' vegetables on the Zambian market, a development which has
wrecked the market for the Zambian farmers, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Some supermarkets insist on getting their supplies from the south
because Zambian farmers allegedly cannot meet the demands of consistence in
the supply and quality of fresh farm produce.
</P>
<P>
Vashee dismissed the excuse as unacceptable and baseless, arguing that
none of the farmers have been given contracts and failed to deliver.

<HEADLINE> African Exports Hit by Asian Economic Crisis: UN Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 1 (Xinhua) - The ongoing Asian economic crisis
has slowed down the exports of many African countries and reduced the
overall growth rate in Africa by about one percent in 1998, according to a
United Nations report.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. report titled as Africa Recovery said that African countries
have been hit by the Asisn crisis directly and indirectly mainly through
lower
commodity prices in the international market, shrinking export markets as
well as reduced investment and other financial flows.
</P>
<P>
Local media Friday quoted the report as saying that the cotton exports
of Tanzania, the Sudan and Togo have dropped by 2.7 percent, 4.8 percent
and 2.3 percent respectively while Zambia's copper exports dropped by 25.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Oil exports of Algeria has dropped by 12.4 percent, Angola by 24.8
percent, Cameroon by 16.2 percent, Egypt by 5.9 percent and Nigeria by 24.3
pRercent.
</P>
<P>
Equatorial Guinea and Gabon wood exports declined by 9.9 and 4.6 percent
respectively while Ghana's aluminum exports declined by 4.1 percent, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, an economic giant in Africa, has also been hit by the
mounting global economic crisis and its exports to Asia have dropped to
some extent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the impact of the Asian crisis on Africa is
now being felt both directly and indirectly because there has been a
greater reluctance of foreign investors to invest in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The decline of commodity prices will also affect growth and
investment, even slowing progress in poverty reduction", the report said,
estimating that Angola and Nigeria have lost a quarter of their anticipated
total export earnings.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Optimistic About Uganda's Economy in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Museveni said this in his New Year message addressed to the nation on
radio and television Thursday night, a press release from the President's
Office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Uganda's economy has continued to perform well
despite some setbacks resulting from the effects of the adverse El Nino
weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the economy would reach a gross domestic
product (GDP) growth of seven percent in this financial year, up from 5.5
percent recorded in the previous one.
</P>
<P>
Some economic indicators were cited to show the healthy
development of the economy which include a 19 percent growth in private
investment, an annual headline inflation rate of minus 5.1 percent and an
underlying inflation of 3.1 percent (excluding food prices).
</P>
<P>
Museveni said that tax revenues are more or less on track in the sphere
of income tax and called on the revenue authorities to zero in on tax
erasion.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of increasing the country's revenue
performance relative to GDP which at 11.3 percent, though much better than
the four percent in 1986, is still much lower than many
countries in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The president also promised to take more effective measures to eradicate
poverty, improve infrastructures and enhance the standards of social
service.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Opposition  NDP to Sponsor Anti-Corruption Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Odinga said in capital Nairobi Thursday that the institutionalization of
corruption in national life can only be eradicated when such a bill is
brought before parliament and enacted into law.
</P>
<P>
"Such a bill will help stamp out corruption as sources of wealth
acquired by each individual and his or her relatives will be determined,"
the East African Standard newspaper Friday quoted the NDP boss as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have declared 1999 the year of fighting corruption in whatever
manner, form and quarters," Odinga said in his new year message. "We will
not relent in our crusade as the NDP to fight corruption this year."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that corruption had infiltrated the Immigration
Department, Motor Vehicle Registration, government ministries, parastatals
and other public sectors of the economy and have complicated development
issues.
</P>
<P>
Odinga, also a member of parliament, said that government tendering had
been abused through widespread corruption where kickbacks and commission to
a clique of influential persons have been the order of the day.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a number of parastatals were breeding grounds of corrupt
dealings where huge chunks of bribes were dished out to well-connected
individuals.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Punish Beirut for Guerrilla Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel's security cabinet has
decided to hold the Lebanese government responsible for any
rocket attacks on northern Israel launched by Hezbollah guerillas,
virtually rejecting a unilateral withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting late Thursday night, the inner cabinet adopted an
Israeli army proposal that it will respond to any Katyusha rocket
attack on Israel by hitting a target in Lebanon, Israel Radio
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after the meeting, the security cabinet
said Israel "holds Beirut directly responsible" for what happens
in south Lebanon, demanding the Lebanese government stem guerilla
activities there and prevent rocket attacks on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Observers said by adopting this proposal, the Israeli
government has virtually ruled out a unilateral withdrawal from
the self-styled security zone in south Lebanon it carved out more
than 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
As more soldiers lost their lives in the 15-kilometer-deep
buffer zone in the last few weeks, debates have heated up among
Israelis over the fate of their military presence there.
</P>
<P>
Many Israelis demanding a unilateral withdrawal argued that the
security zone, set up by Israel in 1985 to prevent cross-border
attacks by Hezbollah guerillas, has failed to provide security for
northern Israel but become a source of conflicts instead.
</P>
<P>
This view was driven home when Hezbollah guerrillas fired a
barrage of Katyusha rockets at northern Israel last week,
wounding 13 people, to retaliate the killing of a Lebanese woman
and six of her children in an Israeli bombing raid one day before.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli government has conditioned a withdrawal on a
security arrangement with Beirut, saying a unilateral pullout
would expose northern Israel to Hezbollah fires and endanger the
future of Israel's local militia allies, the South Lebanon Army
(SLA).
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its main ally, Syria, have rejected Israel's
proposal, insisting that Israel should withdraw from south
Lebanon unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's meeting, the cabinet said it would make efforts
to protect the SLA as well as Israeli civilians in the north.
</P>
<P>
It also adopted a position held by Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon, Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani and other
ministers that Israel will not link its negotiations on the
Lebanese track with the Syrian track.
</P>
<P>
Syria has insisted a linkage between Israel's withdrawal from
south Lebanon with a solution to its dispute with Israel over the
Golan Heights, which was seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East
war.

<HEADLINE> Jiang: Reunification Irreversible Historical Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- To realize the full
reunification of the motherland is an irreversible historical
trend, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also General Secretary of China's Communist Party
Central Committee, made the remarks here this morning at a new
year reception sponsored by the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
He said, "There still exist political differences between us
and the Taiwan authorities, but they can be reasonably and
properly resolved through dialogue and negotiations."
</P>
<P>
"Both sides across the Taiwan straits should further expand
exchanges and comprehensively develop the cross-straits
relationship in a bid to promote the process of the motherland's
reunification," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang hoped that the Taiwan authorities will cater to the
aspiration of the people, eye the circumstances in a practical
way, and have dialogue and negotiations with the mainland in an
effort to realize the early establishment of direct links of
postal, air and shipping services and trade between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Both sides across the straits should formally end the enmity
state under the "one China" principle, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged all patriotic Chinese to unite and firmly oppose any
splittist activities aimed at bringing about the "independence of
Taiwan" and creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" so as
to safeguard the motherland's territorial integrity and
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Through the joint efforts of all Chinese people, including the
Taiwan compatriots, the motherland's reunification should surely
be accomplished, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
On issues of Hong Kong and Macao, he continued, since the
return of Hong Kong, China has strictly observed the policy of
"one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong"
and a high degree of autonomy, and supported the government of
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to administer according to
law, thus helping Hong Kong maintain stability and prosperity
amids the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
By December 1999, he said, China will resume the exercise of
sovereignty over Macao and this is a great event for the Chinese
nation.
</P>
<P>
"We hope both China and Portugal continue their cooperation
and the Macao compatriots play a positive role to ensure a smooth
transition and transfer of power in Macao for local stability and
development," Jiang added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup:NZ Sharemarket to Get Brighter after Tough year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand sharemarket
is expected to become bullish after experiencing one of its most
difficult years in 1998.
</P>
<P>
It was punctuated by extreme volatility and record lows in
1998. The year saw the key NZSE40 Capital index falling to 1,668
points, about 1,000 points lower than a year ago, hitting a new
five-year low.
</P>
<P>
This means the combined value of the 40 leading stocks fell to
37 billion NZ dollars from 60 billion NZ dollars. Almost for the
whole year the NZSE40 Capital index fluctuated below the mark of
2,000 points.
</P>
<P>
On the bright side, the volume of the New Zealand stocks rose
about 60 percent and the number of trading increased 20 percent
compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
But, the general situation for the New Zealand sharemarket was
quite bad last year. Its bearish state was attributed mainly to
the slump of the economic activity in the country, which started
when the Asian crisis began to bite in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the three cuts in interest rates by the Federal
Reserve, New Zealand's central bank, in October resulted in the
sharemarket trading up quite strongly.
</P>
<P>
At present, retail deposit rates in New Zealand banks have
plunged to their lowest level in nearly three decades. New
Zealanders have 43 billion NZ dollars (23 billion U.S. dollars)
deposited in banks.
</P>
<P>
Historically, low interest rates should serve as a panacea for
the sharemarket, especially in the first half of this year.
Investors who have had their earnings from bank deposits reduced
are likely to turn to equities offering better returns.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country's GDP grew by 0.7 percent in the third
quarter of last year after a six-month contraction. The fourth
quarter is also expected to have a positive growth.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter of last year, New Zealand exports were up
3.6 percent. There are evident signs of improvements in the wood
and paper products, petroleum and chemicals, and metal products
industries. Exports of these products as well as of meat and dairy
products have been rising in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
There is a general feeling that the worst is over and New
Zealand is emerging from economic recession or even has shrugged
off the recessionary blues. The majority of New Zealanders expect
this year will be better than last year and their country will see
a fairly broad-based recovery in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
A latest survey shows business confidence in New Zealand is now
at a four-year peak and up across all sectors of the economy. The
growing confidence in the economy was apparent last month in the
strong rally in the stock exchange. On the last day of 1998, the
NZSE40 Capital index exceeded the mark of 2,000 points and reached
2,084 points.
</P>
<P>
The recovery of the New Zealand sharemarket is dependent on
there being no big correction in global sharemarkets, interest
rates remaining at current levels and the country's economic
activity growing and company earnings improving.
</P>
<P>
In view of the current situation in the country, most local
sharebrokers predict that it will be possible for the NZSE40
Capital index to reach more than 2,300 points this year. More
optimistic economists are now expecting the NZSE40 index to climb

<HEADLINE> Nairobi Stock Mart Ends 1998 on High Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NAIROBI, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Brokers in Kenya predicted that the
Nairobi
Stock Exchange (NSE) will continue to improve in the new year as it ended
1998
with a gain scoring its 19th win in 20 sessions in a day of desultory
trade Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The NSE 20-share index Thursday gained 8.42 points or 0.29 percent to
close at 2,953.64, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Brokers expressed the optimism that the index's recent rally would
continue
into the new year as investors continued to move away from the money
markets and into equities, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The 20-share index has gained over 15 percent since December 2 but 1998
is still likely to be remembered as one of the worst years for the Kenyan
bourse in 1990s, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
In July last year, the index slumped to a four-and-a-half year low with
prohibitive interest rates leaving equities unable to compete with high
yielding treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
Economic instability , characterized by a deep recession in manufacturing
industry and a crisis in the financial sector with leading banks reporting
large portfolios of non-performing loans, sent many foreign and
institutional investors scurrying for cover.
</P>
<P>
But with the average yield on Kenya's benchmark 91-day treasury bills
dropping to 11.068 percent at last week's auction from 27 percent in April,
the stock market has rebounded.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks have responded by lowering the base lending to around 17
percent for the leading banks.
</P>
<P>
The lower interest rates have been praised by manufacturers and the local
business community.
</P>
<P>
Barclays Bank of Kenya was the biggest mover jumping four Shillings to
close at 130 on 9,287 shares.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said Barclays, the biggest international bank in Kenya, has
weathered the storm hitting the financial sector better than most of its
competitors and is widely considered as a growth stock.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kenya posted an opening Shilling mean indicative rate
of 61.9056 against the U.S. Dollar from Wednesday's 62.15 Shillings.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, U.S. Presidents Vow to Boost Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton Friday expressed the hope
to boost relations between the two countries on the occasion of
the 20th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
In his congratulatory message, President Jiang extended, on
behalf of the Chinese government and people and in his own name,
cordial greetings and warm congratulations to President Clinton
as well as the government and people of the United States.
</P>
<P>
 "the normalization of China-U.S. relations was a milestone
in the history of our bilateral relations and also a major event
in the history of contemporary international relations. The
course of development of China-U.S. friendly and
mutually-beneficial cooperation over the past two decades gives
expression to the common aspirations of the two peoples. It
contributes to peace, stability and prosperity in the
Asia-Pacific region and the world at large, and accords with the
trends and requirement of the times," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has "seen with pleasure the significant
progress scored in China-U.S. relations in recent years.
</P>
<P>
" The two presidents "have had a successful exchange of
visits, together decided that our two sides would be committed to
the establishment of China-U.S. constructive strategic
partnership and reached identity of views on enhanced bilateral
cooperation in wide-ranging fields," the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the two countries have had good cooperation
on some major international issues. At present, the bilateral
relations are faced with new opportunities of development, said
Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the principles enshrined in the three Sino-U.S.
Joint Communiques are the basis for these relations" and facts
have proved that strict observance of these principles "will
ensure sound and stable progress of China-U.S. relations."
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed the hope that the two countries would "work
together to move China-U.S. relations forward in the spirit of
mutual respect, seeking common ground while shelving differences,
broadening identity of views and promoting cooperation, and along
with other countries in the world, help bring a peaceful, stable
and prosperous world into the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
In his message to Jiang, Clinton said he was pleased to convey
the warmest wishes of the American people to the people of China,
the congratulations on the achievements of the Chinese people
over the past two decades, and the sincere commitment of the U.S.
government to increasingly cooperative and mutually beneficial
relations in the decades to come.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "As we mark the 20th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China,
we can take pride in the fruitful efforts you and I -- and our
predecessors -- have made to deepen and strengthen U.S.-China
relations."
</P>
<P>
He said, "the expansion of cooperation between the two nations
has increased mutual understanding and established the basis for
stronger future relations."
</P>
<P>
He said he is "personally committed to building a constructive
strategic partnership with China that will benefit the two
peoples and promote a stable and prosperous Asia-Pacific region."
</P>
<P>
He believed the exchange of visits by President Jiang and
himself in 1997 and 1998 furthered their ability to work together
to meet global and regional challenges critical to both countries.
</P>
<P>
Today, as the two sides celebrate their achievements over the
past 20 years, they should reflect on ways to strengthen their
ties for future generations, and they must work together to meet
the common challenges of the 21st century while frankly
addressing differences, Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the two sides will be able to
build the kind of partnership that will serve the interests and
hopes of the American and Chinese peoples.

<HEADLINE> 1 Killed, 310 injured in Firecracker explosions in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed and 310
were injured in firecracker explosions and gunfires in the past
two days in the Philippines, where many people greeted the new
year with firecrackers and firing of guns, the Philippine News
Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Partial reports received by the Philippine National Police
(PNP) as of noon Friday showed 14 people were hit by stray
bullets, causing one death, and 310 cases of firecracker
explosions, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
However, the Department of Health said the number of victims
could rise as soon as all reports from all regions come in.
</P>
<P>
Of the 14 victims of stray bullets, the agency said, 10 came
from Mindanao and four from Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested a Manila policeman and a soldier for firing
their guns to celebrate the new year, it said.
</P>
<P>
Based on the partial reports, firecracker explosions and firing
of guns decreased by 58 percent compared to 1997, the health
department said.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that the country experienced a less
explosive New Year's Eve celebration. In the past, Filipinos
usually greeted the new year with unabated explosion of
firecrackers all over the country, particularly in Metro Manila.
Aggravating the situation was the indiscriminate firing of guns by
soldiers, policemen and civilian gun owners.
</P>
<P>
Weeks before the Christmas holiday, the government and
non-government organizations (NGO) launched a massive campaign
nationwide asking gunholders to refrain from firing their firearms
to celebrate the new year.

JAKARTA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Floods triggered by incessant
rains since Wednesday killed eight people and injured 13 others in
Bengkulu province, Indonesia's Sumatera island.
</P>
<P>
Most of the flood victims were gold miners. The inundation
destroyed 35 miners' houses and some gold mining equipment, Antara
News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The flood waters came from the Kerinci Seblat National Park and
caused landslides in an area measuring two hectares, a location
where local inhabitants have conducted traditional gold mining
since 1982.

Bengkulu Vice Governor Iskandar Ramis visited Ketenong Satu,
one of the flood-hit villages, on Thursday to hand over rice and
some cash to the flood victims.

<HEADLINE> 134 State-Owned Cinemas Privatized in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- A total of 134 state-owned
cinemas have been privatized in Myanmar in different forms since
the country opened its door for private entrepreneurs to run the
cinemas.
</P>
<P>
Of the 134 cinemas owned by the Myanmar Motion Picture
Enterprise (MMPE), 22 were sold to local private entrepreneurs, 21
leased on a long-term basis under the BOT (Built, Operate,
Transfer) system and 91 leased on a yearly basis, the New Light of
Myanmar newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Plans are underway to lease 30 others now being run by the
MMPE, it said.
</P>
<P>
Cinema business in Myanmar is reportedly going down due to a
lower number of Myanmar films produced and high cost of foreign
films.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has, since January 1995, been implementing a
privatization plan for its state economic enterprises (SEE), aimed
at transforming them into effective business organizations.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the scheme covers 51 SEEs including
processing and manufacturing factories, livestock breeding farms
and cinemas, and is being implemented in various forms --
auctioning and leasing out the enterprises or establishing joint
ventures with local and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises include those nationalized during the time of
the Revolutionary Council government in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
In the privatization process, the government is striving to
ensure that in transferring to the private business people, local
Myanmar citizens take precedence over foreigners.

to and properly handle contradictions among the people and various
kinds of social problems and crack down sternly on all kinds of
sabotage activities by hostile forces both at home and abroad, so

</P>
<P>
He called on people of all walks of life to overcome the
difficulties and strive for new progress under the leadership of

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: 1999: Critical Stage for Asia's Adjustments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- With the beginning of the year
1999, Asia's economic adjustments have entered a most critical
stage, as the outcome of such adjustments in the next 12 months
would decide the fate of the region's economy in the years ahead,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Since a regional financial crisis began 18 months ago, Asian
countries, and those in Southeast Asia in particular, have
undertaken a series of adjustments in various economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
The initial outcome of the adjustments has contributed to a
rebound in regional currencies, stocks and foreign investments in
the past three months.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the adjustment measures taken by Asian
countries so far were aimed at containing the crisis, rather than
achieving a recovery, the analysts said. A full economic recovery
needs further and more effective adjustments.
</P>
<P>
In a recent report, the Asian Development Bank said the
region's outlook for 1999 depends on the fate of current reform
initiatives. Many economists also place their hopes for an
economic turnaround in Asia on further reforms.
</P>
<P>
In all economic sectors, repairing the region's banking system
is the most urgent and difficult task, as abnormal banking
operations are directly affecting a recovery process, economists
said.
</P>
<P>
During the last 18 months, banking bailouts were progressing at
a very slow pace despite closures and take-overs of some
debt-ridden financial institutions by governments in the region.
Non-performing loans are increasing instead of falling in many
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, non-performing loans of the nation's 17 biggest banks
totaled at 426 billion U.S. dollars as of the end of last March,
according to a report by the Financial Supervisory Agency, a
Japanese financial watch dog, in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials estimated that non-performing loans for the
whole Japanese banking sector have reached 700 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
As a major creditor of other Asian nations, Japan could hardly
provide new loans for Asia's recovery before it finishes cleaning
of its own house.
</P>
<P>
In the countries worst affected by the crisis -- Thailand,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and South Korea, no funds
have been allocated to eliminate bad debts owed by banks. The
non-performing loan ratio of these countries is almost certain to
increase this year from the current 10 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the non-performing loans, the five countries
owed about 175 billion dollars in short-term debt to international
banks as of mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
Although the Japanese government has pledged a 30 billion
dollar aid package to Asian countries for banking reforms, the
amount is far from enough.
</P>
<P>
The cost of recapitalizing Asia's beleaguered banks, excluding
those in Japan, could be as high as 64 billion dollars, said
global securities firm Merrill Lynch in a recent report.
</P>
<P>
To speed up the banks' resuscitation, experts suggested the
greater use of nationalization. By taking over banks, governments
would remove share-holders who are reluctant to write down the
value of their stakes, they said.
</P>
<P>
Being sole or majority owners, they said, governments would be
better placed to negotiate the debt-forgiveness and restructuring
deals with foreign creditors and local borrowers. And after
cleaning up the banks, governments can sell them back to the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
As an "engine" of the Asian economy, the region's export sector
also needs further adjustments. In the past year, Asian countries
have done virtually little in adjusting the export sector, which
is dominated by
production of electronics, textile and garments.
</P>
<P>
Partly because of weak demands in the regional and world
markets and partly because of a shortage of working capital and
falling prices,
exports in Asia fell remarkably for the third consecutive year in
1998. And accordingly, Asia's economic growth slowed down from 7.5
percent in
1996 to 6.1 percent in 1997, and to 1.8 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Governments also must look for a solution to over-capacity,
which has crushed prices, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
This problem is worst in electronics, which accounts for up to
50
percent of exports in the crisis-hit countries. Western markets
are
unlikely to keep soaking up Asian products even at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Asian countries should make adjustments in the
export
sector by diversifying their products to solve the problem of
over-
supply.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for an export recovery would remain bleak until the

adjustment in the export structure is completed, experts said.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, some Asian countries must find new remedies for the
economy
as old prescriptions by the International Monetary Fund have
failed to save their economies in the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
After the crisis broke out, the crisis-hit countries
implemented the
IMF's austerity programs by raising interest rates, lowering
growth targets and cutting budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
But under the austerity programs, all these countries fell into
a serious economic recession in 1998. During the latter part of
last year, even the IMF had to persuade these countries to
increase budget deficits to stimulate their economic development.
</P>
<P>
With the change of prescriptions, these countries must make
re-adjustments in their development strategy to achieve a quick
recovery, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang: China's Ties with Western Countries Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- China's relationship with the
Western developed nations has been improved and developed in the
past year, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also General Secretary of China's Communist Party
Central Committee, made the remarks here this morning at a new
year reception sponsored by the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, he said, Chinese and U.S. presidents exchanged visits
and both sides made efforts to help build a constructive,
strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Russian strategic partnership is developing in a
smooth way, Jiang said, adding China and Europe have decided to
develop a comprehensive partnership.
</P>
<P>
He stated that China and Japan have decided to set up a
friendly cooperative partnership for peace and development, and
stressed that China has always placed importance on using the
history as a mirror to open up the future.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that in the past year, China has taken an active
part in activities of international organizations, including the
UN and the APEC, and played an important role on handling major
international issues.
</P>
<P>
China has also contributed to easing the Asian financial crisis
by offering necessary assistance to nations seriously affected by
the crisis and by not devaluing its currency RMB, thus improving
its international prestige and status, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of the diplomatic work which has scored
significant results, Jiang said China's good-neighborly ties with
neighboring nations have been furthered, while its unity and
cooperation with developing nations have also been continuously
consolidated.
</P>
<P>
All these have served to create a favorable international
environment for China's reform and opening-up, he said.
</P>
<P>
China will always stick to its independent foreign policy of
peace and promote the friendly cooperation with various countries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people are ready to join other people in the world
to safeguard the world peace, promote common development, oppose
the hegemonism and power politics and make due efforts to help
stabilize the regional and world economic and financial situation,
and set up a fair and reasonable international new order.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Government Holds Year-End Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The living conditions of the
people remained stable throughout 1998 and a number of annual
socio-economic targets, scaled down in the second half of the
year, have been achieved, the Vietnamese government says.
</P>
<P>
At a two-day Year-End cabinet meeting held on Wednesday and
Thursday and chaired by Prime Minister Phan Van Khai and his
deputies, the government said the drastic measures to tackle
production and business difficulties were carried out effectively.
</P>
<P>
The government "has made improvement in its operation and
management over major and complicated issues" and "has been active
and flexible in managing socio-economic issues, national defense
and security, and foreign relations," according to state media
here.
</P>
<P>
As a result, positive results have been yielded in boosting the
practice of thrift, fighting wastefulness, corruption, smuggling
and frauds in trading, an official report said.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet members also pointed to shortcomings of the government
over the past year, especially in administrative reform,
restructuring state-run enterprises, and updating information.
</P>
<P>
The government stressed the need to seek solutions to the
problems so as to create vigorous changes right at the beginning
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The government also discussed the working program for 1999,
stressing the need to strictly implement the government's
operation regulations, step up its administrative reform process,
renovate its management style, closely coordinate with branches at
all levels and strengthen its relationship with the people, social
organizations and businesses.

<HEADLINE> Exchange Rate Set Between Bulgarian Currency, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The exchange rate will go into effect as of January 4, 1999,
announced the People's Bank of Bulgaria, adding that exchange
rates with currencies of relevant European Union (EU) member
states have also been established.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate between the lev and the euro was worked out
on the basis of the new linking exchange rate system between the
lev and the German mark, the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, one German mark is equivalent to 1,000
Bulgarian lev. The Bulgarian government has announced that the
lev's face value will be changed as of July 1, 1999, so that one
lev is equal to one German mark.
</P>
<P>
These moves are believed to be the steps needed to speed up
Bulgaria's financial integration into the European economy.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the start of the new European currency, Bulga
rian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov said he hoped that it would help
Bulgaria be adopted by the European Monetary Union and the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Bulgarians hoped the huge volume of the
single European financial market, surpassing six trillion euro,
will provide a broader and more convenient source of investment.
</P>
<P>
Of the total amount of foreign investment Bulgaria attracted
in 1998, the investment from EU member countries accounted for 76
percent, including 20 percent from Germany.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Has Lowest Road Toll in 34 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The road toll in New Zealand
in 1998 was the lowest in 34 years with 503 people killed.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) Friday quoted Land
Transport Safety Authority spokesman Dave Jones as saying while
the overall drop was pleasing, many deaths were avoidable.
</P>
<P>
Half of the people killed in 1998 were due to speeding,
drinking and driving, and people not wearing seat-belts, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the number of drivers killed last
year fell 11 percent to 225, the lowest since 1984, and the
number of passengers killed dropped from 166 in 1997 to 138, the
lowest since 1964.
</P>
<P>
The lower national toll in 1998 was attributed to a combination
of public response to publicity campaigns for drink driving and
better speed management on highways.
</P>
<P>
The national road toll for the Christmas and New Year holidays
from December 24 to Friday morning was 14, four less than at the
same time of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand saw the highest road toll in 1973 with 843 people
killed and the lowest road toll in 1964 when 428 people died.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Firecracker-Related Injuries Reported in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Only 247 injuries had been
reported so far in firecracker-related incidents in the
Philippines during the new year celebrations, according to a
monitoring report by the Department of Health Friday.
</P>
<P>
The figure was about 28 percent of the 1,147 injuries for 1997,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring report covered the period from 06:00 (22:00 GMT
Wednesday) Thursday up to 06:00 (22:00 GMT Thursday) Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that 14 people were either shot or hit by
stray bullets, also down significantly from the 31 stray-bullet
injuries for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The big drop in firecrackers-related injuries was attributed by
the Philippine National Police to the effective coordination among
the government, hospitals, the media and the public.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 1998 Witnesses High Growth, Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Privatization, as a process of developing new technologies
and modern management systems instead of financial sell-off, is
a basic component of reactivating Mozambique's national economy.
</P>
<P>
By early June last year, 900 small- and medium-sized firms and
85 large ones of the 1,254 state-owned enterprises, had been
privatized. The rest will also have been done so by the end of
June this year.
</P>
<P>
The private sector has been playing a leading role in the
national economy. and more privatizations and leasing out port
and rail infrastructure to private management will come soon.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Transportation and Communications Paulo Muxanga
told Parliament last November that Mozambique will privatize all
the ports and railways company of the country at all costs but
would be very careful regarding the treatment of the workers.

Political Stability
</P>
<P>
Local government elections were successfully held in 33 cities
and towns across the country in June last year.
</P>
<P>
Although 15 opposition parties led by the largest -- the
Mozambican National Resistance Movement (RENAMO) -- boycotted the
elections, they all expressed their willingness, after the
results were made known, to cooperate with the newly-elected
local governments.
</P>
<P>
What's more, police across the country have taken effective
measures to fight various crimes. In capital Maputo alone,
police mopped up more than 110 gangs in the first nine months
last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of major and vile crimes has been declining in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Analysts hold that political stability and better security
have contributed to the good performance of the Mozambican
economy.

Debt Relief
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank
meeting in Washington last April took the final decision that
1.4 billion U.S. Dollars of Mozambique's debt would be written
off.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is deemed eligible for the Highly Indebted Poor
Countries debt relief, with a waiting period of 15 months instead
of the usual 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1.4-billion-Dollar relief, 916 million Dollars have
been granted by bilateral creditors (mostly members of the Paris
Club which is the liaison body of the main creditor nations), and
526 million Dollars by multilateral agencies, mainly the World
Bank and the IMF.

More Investment
</P>
<P>
The Paris Club has so far provided 570 million Dollars in aid
to the Mozambicans while this southern African country had
attracted 360 million Dollars of foreign investment in the upper
half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
There are six foreign-funded projects under negotiations each
worth at least 50 million Dollars. Two big projects were started
in mid-1998. One is the 900-million-Dollar superhighway linking
Maputo with South Africa. Another is the 1.2-billion-Dollar
Mozal Project of the Mozambique Aluminum plant.
</P>
<P>
The plant is the most immediate development arising from the
Maputo Corridor project, the biggest industrial development now
taking place in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
It involves the British company Billiton, Mitsubishi of Japan,
and the Commonwealth Development Corporation of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mozal will produce 250,000 tons of aluminum a year for export
using bauxite from Australia. After construction it will provide
400 permanent jobs and a number of local spin-offs.
</P>
<P>
However, the remarkable economic growth is still part of the
recovery in Mozambique, one of the world's poorest countries, and
long years of warfare and neglect have left about 80 percent of
its population in absolute poverty. This poses great challenges
to the Mozambican government in the future.

<P>
BANGKOK, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Gunmen, believed to be
separatists, shot dead a border patrol officer in broad daylight
in Southern Thailand, a police source said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The source said a group of heavily-armed men driving a pick-up
truck and two motorcycles chased the officer from his house in
Narathiwat Province on Wednesday and fired several shots at close
range at a deserted route.
</P>
<P>
The officer, Pol Sgt Masawree Binwae-arong, 31, was found lying
in a pool of blood beside his motorcycle. He sustained serious
gunshot wounds and died on Thursday.
</P>

group in Southern Thailand, populated by Muslims. A series of
attacks against policemen and civilians had been reported before.
</P>
<P>
A manhunt for the gunmen was still going on, said the source,
requesting anonymity.

</P>
<P>
He praised all Thais and athletes for their united efforts in

"The great success of the Games is the work of all Thais. It

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Determined to Call Early Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai has reaffirmed that he would call early general elections
after the passage of key organic laws required by the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Chuan stressed in a new year speech made public on Friday that
he would keep his promise to quit before his four-year term ends.
</P>
<P>
He said his government's priorities were to tackle economic
problems and prepare the nation for a new general election.
</P>
<P>
"I believe all (the laws) will be completed in the next
parliamentary session," he said, referring to the next ordinary
sitting between June and October.
</P>
<P>
The constitution requires that key organic laws be passed in
two years after its promulgation, or by October 1999. Eighty
percent of these laws have reached parliament or are being
deliberated.
</P>
<P>
Coalition partners have called upon Chuan to complete his term
which ends in 2000 despite the rejection from the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The call came as the opposition was stepping up efforts to
launch a no-confidence motion against the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Chuan has said the mission of his term was temporary and if the
economy picked up before 2000, he would dissolve the House of
Representatives and call a general election.
</P>
<P>
But key coalition figures have urged Chuan to change his mind,
saying his stay in office would serve the nation's interests.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said in the new year speech that he intended to lay a
firm economic foundation for the country but would not use this as
an excuse to buy time or to take advantage of other parties.
</P>
<P>
He said all parties were at the moment equally prepared for a
general election, and the question as to who was better would be
answered by looking at their lists of candidates.
</P>
<P>
But he did not say exactly when a new election would be called.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Sends Condolences to Widow of Prominent Chinese Writer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
sent a message expressing his condolences on the death of
prominent Chinese Writer Qian Zhongshu, praising his outstanding
contributions to the cultural exchanges between France and China.
</P>
<P>
In the message addressed to Qian's widow, Yang Jiang, Chirac
described Qian as "the embodiment of the finest features of the
Chinese nation: intelligence, elegance, Kindness, openness and
modesty.
</P>
<P>
"I pay my respects to this great man, who, in the history of
cultures, will remain a source of inspiration for future
generations, thanks to his boundless creativity, his vigilant
thinking and his sense of universality," the French president
said in the message, a copy of which was faxed to Xinhua by the
French embassy in China on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Qian died in Beijing on December 19 at the age of 88.
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Qinghua University of China and Britain's Oxford
University, Yang was known for his efforts to interweave Western
and Eastern cultures. He also studied at Sorbonne University in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
His most famous novel, "The Besieged City," depicts the ideas,
hopes and aspirations of Chinese intellectuals. He was also
respected for his collections of literary critiques.
</P>
<P>
In his condolence message, Chirac also said that "France
realizes how much she owns to this paramount scholar of the 20th
century. Since the days he was studying at the Sorbonne
University in Paris in the 1930s, Mr. Qian Zhongshu has
consistently honored French culture and shared his passion for
our writers and philosophers.
</P>
<P>
"His brilliance was such that he appealed to all his readers.
As you know, French translations of his works -- short stories,
his famous novel "The Besieged City" and his critical essays --
have been acclaimed as masterpieces by a very large audience in
my country," Chirac said in the message, which he signed on
December 24.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Presents Motion Picture Awards for 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's Ministry of Information
has presented 12 motion picture gold star awards of 11 categories
for 1997 to artists in the country.
</P>
<P>
The 12 awards from 4 films out of 11, which were presented
Thursday, include the best film award, the best director award,
the best actor and actress awards and the best editor award.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Minister of Information Maj. Gen. Kyi Aung told the
presentation ceremony that the points which were taken into
consideration for the awards are the goal set by the state, the
national policy, national culture and national interest, adding
that the points that should be avoided in producing the motion
pictures were also taken into account.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the strength of producing Myanmar movies is
decreasing year after year. In 1996, 25 movies came out to vie for
best film awards in the respective categories, while there were 43
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He warned that a decline in production of high-standard Myanmar
movies would not only give space to foreign films but would also
help promote the market for foreign films.
</P>
<P>
He urged the producers to strive to help Myanmar films gain
markets abroad.
</P>
<P>
He also said that in 1998 only 15 new Myanmar films would be
produced.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar formed the Appraisal Board for Raising the Standard of
Myanmar Motion Picture in 1952 and has presented 209 best awards
of 11 categories of films screened.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 1998 Witnesses High Growth, Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Different from a large number of
other African countries which are haunted by either political
chaos or economic recession, Mozambique has been enjoying high
economic growth and low inflation in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Mozambique experienced the highest growth in southern
Africa, with its gross domestic product (GDP) reaching 2.2
billion U.S. Dollars for 1998, up by 11.2 percent over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
From January to November last year, its inflation rate had
been 2.5 percent on average and the annual inflation is estimated
at two percent, the lowest in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
From January to September, Mozambique's exports topped 184
million Dollars, up by 1.5 percent over the similar period of
1997 while its import was 781 million Dollars, 66 million Dollars
down as against the 1997's.
</P>
<P>
Since the war ended in 1992, Mozambique's economy has
recovered quite rapidly.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, agriculture and animal husbandry grew by 4.9 percent,
industry and fishery by 11.3 percent respectively, mining by 28.7
percent, building materials by 43. 9 percent, construction by
eight percent and transport by 6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Generally, the exchange rate of the Mozambican currency
Metical to the U.S. Dollar is stable.  Currently, one Dollar
equals to 12,323 Metical and the exchange rate at the black
market is only two percent higher than the official one.
</P>
<P>
Favorable weather, structural adjustment, political stability
and improved security, debt relief and incoming investment are
attributed to the good performance of the Mozambican economy,
analysts here said.

Favorable Weather
</P>
<P>
Mozambique had a bumper harvest last year and farming remains
the basis of the Mozambican economy. The grain output amounted to
1.69 million tons, up by 10 percent as against the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Production of the staple maize is expected at 1.124 million
tons, up by eight percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the favorable weather in most parts of the country,
only less than 700,000 hectares of farmland were affected by
drought or floods in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Planting acreage has been expanded to 3.72 million hectares,
increasing by 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
pricing of various farm products except cotton has been
liberalized by the government as an incentive to the farmers.
</P>
<P>
Good performance in agriculture has played an important role
in stablizing prices, keeping inflation low, reducing imports and
promoting the development of processing.

Tax Reform
</P>
<P>
The contribution of financial revenues to Mozambique's GDP
increased to 19.9 percent in 1998 from 19 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The government has reorganized the tax authorities, trained
tax collectors and computerized the process of tax collection as
well as lowered tax rates.
</P>
<P>
As a result, revenues collection increased remarkably
since the government expanded the areas for tax collection and
curbed tax evasion, and also improved the government's capacity
to fund essential services.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, although the running spending increased by 0.6
percent, its share in the GDP had dropped from 1994's 22.5
percent down to 18.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the growth of monetary supply has been contained
within 2.6 percent and the bank loaning rate to the government
also kept low since the government does not use bank loans to
fund its budget spending.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Exchange Reserves Rise in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's foreign currency
reserves rose significantly to 1.92 billion U.S. dollars as of
December 31, 1998, up 6.67 percent from 10 days earlier, said
Bangladesh Bank, the country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign exchange reserves soared up to the
highest level of 3.07 billion dollars on June 30, 1995, but
dropped to 2.03 billion dollars on June 30, 1996 and 1.71 billion
dollars on June 30, 1997, according to a bank press release
reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The reserves fell to the lowest point of 1.6 billion dollars in
August 1998, but rebounded and rose to 1.8 billion dollars on
December 21, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The release did not say what had contributed to the rising
reserves, but earlier press reports said the increase in the
foreign exchange reserves was attributed to the inflow of aid in
cash and kind from the country's donors for emergency relief and
post-flood rehabilitation.

<HEADLINE> China, IAEA Sign Additional Nuclear Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to keep the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) informed of its
cooperation with non-nuclear-weapon countries as well as its
imports and exports of nuclear materials.
</P>
<P>
Under an additional protocol to a strengthened safeguards and
supervision treaty signed by the two sides on Thursday, China
also promised the IAEA to verify any information about China's
nuclear issues presented by non-nuclear-weapon nations to the
IAEA.
</P>
<P>
China's permanent representative to the IAEA, Ambassador Zhang
Yishan and IAEA Director-General Mohammed el-Baradei signed the
additional protocol.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador pointed out that China signed the protocol for
the purpose of improving the efficiency and proficiency of the
IAEA with an aim to contributing to the efforts of achieving
nuclear non-proliferation in the world.
</P>
<P>
As one of the developing nations that own a small number of
nuclear weapons and a signatory nation to the Non-Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons Treaty, China has shown its seriousness and
responsibility in fulfilling its due obligations, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
China has all along stood for the complete prohibition and
thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. It pursues a policy of
not advocating, encouraging or engaging in the proliferation of
nuclear weapons, nor helping other countries to develop nuclear
weapons, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Japan, Canada, the 13 non-nuclear-weapon countries in the
European Union, and the three nuclear powers of the United
States, Britain and France have signed the additional protocol
with the IAEA.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Closes 1998 with 44-Percent Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador ended 1998 with an
annual inflation rate of 44 percent, the highest in Latin
America, said an official source here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Ecuador achieved 1.4 percent economic growth,
registered a 1.4-billion-U.S.-dollar budget deficit and a
negative trade balance of about one billion dollars with sucre,
the national currency, devalued by 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
Government officials attributed the economic slump to a number
of factors including the "El Nino" phenomenon and the drop in oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
"El Nino" caused a loss of more than 1.6 billion dollars to
Ecuador and produced a negative impact on the economic
development.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Ecuador's gross domestic product grew 1.4 percent
compared with 3.4 percent in 1997, with the export of crude oil
and bananas plummeting to 300 million and 600 million dollars
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The small demand for bananas in the international market,
caused by the world financial turmoil, and the fall of crude oil
price led to a drop in the two products' exports, which are the
main pillars of Ecuador's economy.
</P>
<P>
President Jamil Mahuad announced that the sucre was devalued
and subsidies for electricity and fuel were eliminated on
September 14 last year, following a ratification of a tax on capit
al circulation two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
The government's goals for 1999 are to reduce the budget
deficit of 1.4 billion dollars and resume economic development.
It also expects to reduce inflation rate to between 24 percent
and 29 percent and to increase the gross domestic product to 2.5
percent.

VIENNA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- After European Union (EU)
finance ministers approved the rates for the conversion of 11
currencies into the euro, Austrian government officials Thursday
hailed the birth of the euro as a "quantum leap" forward for
European integration.
</P>
<P>
The euro will become legal tender in 11 countries of the

the single currency will further Europe's economic growth,
employment and stability.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel said the birth of the euro will be "a quantum leap
forward for European integration".
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger said the single currency is
"a successful result of 40 years of unremitting efforts toward
European integration."
</P>
<P>
The time of euro initiation is "very ideal," Edlinger said,
adding that the EU countries, the euro-zone countries in
particular, are now witnessing good economic growth, low
inflation and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Liescher, president of the State Bank of Austria, said,
"Today is a great day for Europe."
</P>

Guenter Stumnvoll, secretary general of the Federal Chamber of
Commerce, said the birth of the euro is a most important step

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman Resents over U.S. Satellite Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- China expressed its strong
resent over the U.S. House of Representatives' charges on U.S.
satellite technology deals with China, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman has said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Bangzao noted that these charges do not tally with the
truth and are a "sheer fabrication".
</P>
<P>
A report by a special House committee investigating
technological transfer deals with China claimed technological
deals with China, including use of Chinese rockets to launch
U.S. satellites, have harmed the U.S. national security.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the report is an ill distortion of China's peaceful
use of space technology, thus deliberately undermining the
China-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China hopes the U.S. government, viewing from
the point of the shared interests of bilateral long-term
cooperation, strictly observe the agreements signed between the
two governments on the commercial launching service and properly
handle the Chinese rockets' launching of U.S. satellites, in an
effort to safeguard the normal international commercial activities.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a spokesman for the China Aerospace Corporation
has refuted the charges and insisted the service, a normal
commercial activity, has always been in line with common
international practice, upheld the principle of fairness and
transparency and conformed to the three agreements between the
two governments.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the Chinese launching of U.S. satellites is in the
interests of the two nations.
</P>
<P>
"It is unnecessary, also impossible, for China to obtain
satellite, rocket and missile technology through commercial
launching service," Zhu added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Non-Oil/Gas Exports Expected to Grow 4-5 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's non-oil/gas exports
are expected to grow by 4 to 5 percent next year with a total
value of 44 to 45 billion U.S. dollars, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"By taking into account various problems and economic
conditions which are still full of uncertainties, the growth of
the non-oil/gas exports is projected at 4 to 5 percent by 1999,"
Industry and Trade Minister Rahardi Ramelan said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The projection of non-oil/gas exports was also based on the
world economy which was expected to improve by 1999 due to several
factors, such as the improved economy of European Union countries
following the introduction of Euro single currency, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the improvement in the United States' economy as a
result of a seven-year economic expansion program and the
strengthening of the crisis-hit Asian countries' currencies would
also contribute to the attainment of the non-oil/gas export
growth, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The cut in banking interests in some crisis-hit countries and
the improved economies in Latin American countries would boost
Indonesia's non-oil/gas exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister believed that if the Japanese economy improved and
China did not devaluate its currency, then the economies of Asian
nations, including Indonesia, would become increasingly sound.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's non-oil/gas exports from 1993 to 1997 grew by an
average of 11.59 percent annually, while from 1994 to 1998 the
annual growth averaged 9.02 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the country's total exports in the first 10
months of 1998 dropped by 6.88 percent from a corresponding period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's exports in the first 10 months of 1998 reached
41.03 billion U.S. dollars, including oil/gas exports worth 5.65
billion dollars and non-oil/gas exports valued at 34.46 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The oil/gas exports dropped by 32.13 percent while the
non-oil/gas exports increased by 0.22 percent compared to the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Indonesia's total imports in
January-October also dropped by 36 percent to 22.56 billion U.S.
dollars. The oil/gas imports and non-oil/gas imports dropped by
30.74 percent and 36.54 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Rahardi said that in 1999 the government would be proactive in
struggling for national interests amid the increasingly fierce
competition on the global market.
</P>
<P>
"In 1999 Indonesia will always play a constructive role in
creating free, open and fair multilateral trade system," he said.
</P>
<P>
One of the global issues which should receive attention was
that all members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) should
fully and faithfully implement agreements reached at the Uruguay
Round trade dialogue, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Communist Party Diplomacy Makes Headway (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dai, a former vice-foreign minister, stressed that the CPC is
carrying on its diplomatic work with all parties in line with the
four principles guiding such relations, namely "independence and
self-reliance, equality, mutual-respect and non-interference into
each other's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the CPC's diplomatic work over the past 20 years, Dai
pointed out that it was the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th CPC
Central Committee convened in 1978 that broke the ideological
barrier that had dominated China for decades, and that it was Deng
Xiaoping's Theory that encouraged a revival in CPC foreign
relations.
</P>
<P>
People came to realize that it is unreasonable to rule a
diversified world with one philosophy and one political viewpoint,
Dai added.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the 1970s, the CPC began resuming ties with
several foreign communist parties. Starting in the early 80s, it
made efforts to contact socialist parties in western countries,
and later capitalist political parties in developed
countries. With the end of the Cold War, the CPC took the chance
to get in touch with old as well as new parties in the former
Soviet Union and East European countries.
</P>
<P>
As far as Dai is concerned, the CPC has now absolutely
abandoned its former activities of "exporting revolution", and
has encouraged positive inter-state relations.
</P>
<P>
With unique characteristics and flexible steps, the CPC's
foreign relations efforts have served to explore and consolidate
China's inter-state ties with foreign countries, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
Also being China's top state leaders, those in charge of the
CPC exchange views on a frequent basis with politicians from
various countries on major bilateral and international issues of
common concern, thus providing important political guarantees to
the development of inter-state ties.

the New Year, the official radio said Friday.
</P>
<P>

She expressed the hope that peace would dawn in the new year,
ushering in a new era of prosperity and progress.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a protracted civil war between
the government and Tamil rebels since 1983. The government's
efforts to resolve the ethnic conflicts was obstructed by the

<HEADLINE> Mexican Lower House Passes 1999 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's Chamber of
Deputies (lower house) Thursday approved a
103-billion-U.S.-dollar federation budget for 1999.
</P>
<P>
The budget was passed with 340 votes from the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and the National Action
Party (PAN).
</P>
<P>
The main opposition political forces, which include the
Democratic Revolution Party (PRD), the Labor Party (PT) and the
Mexican Ecologist Green Party (PVEM), rejected the budget bill.
</P>
<P>
The approved budget is based on an estimated income from oil,
which is expected to be around 9.25 dollars per barrel in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The new budget estimates that the inflation rate for next year
will be 13 percent, the economic growth rate will be 3 percent
and the average interest rate will be 21.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The public deficit proposed by the approved budget foresees a
level of 25 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), less
than that of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Public Education Ministry was given first priority in the
budget with 7.06 billion dollars, which seems to demonstrate that
the Ernesto Zedillo government attaches importance to education.
</P>
<P>
The defense spending on the Mexican armed forces will be 2.32
billion dollars, including 1.65 billion dollars for the National
Defense Ministry and 660 million for the Navy Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The budget for other ministries, such as agriculture,
livestock and rural development is 2.11 billion dollars, and the
Finance and Public Credit Ministry is 1.77 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry is the fifth largest with budget
expenditures of 1.72 billion dollars.

BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- China will need to strive even
harder in 1999 because of all the arduous tasks and difficulties
lying ahead in the reform and construction, said Chinese
President Jiang Zemin at a new year reception here this morning.
</P>

Held by the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the reception saw the

</P>
<P>
Expressing his deep concern for the reunification of the
motherland in the speech, Jiang said all the political differences
between China's mainland and the Taiwan authorities could be
solved in a fair and reasonable manner through talks and
negotiations and he firmly believes the reunification of the
motherland could be achieved with the concerted efforts of all the
Chinese people including the compatriots from Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> China Refutes U.S. Congressional Charges on Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The charges by a United States
congressional committee on U.S. satellite technology deals with
China do not tally with the truth and are a sheer fabrication, a
spokesman for the China Aerospace Corporation (CASC) said.
</P>
<P>
The charges included in a report by a special House committee
investigating military and commercial deals with China have
"greatly damaged the good image and international reputation of
the Long March rocket as well as the producer and launcher of the
rocket", the spokesman said in an interview with Xinhua last night.
</P>
<P>
China's commercial launching service is an important outcome of
the reform and opening-up policy, which aims at making peaceful
use of space technology, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of both China and the United States have made
positive efforts to promote trade in commercial launching service
between the two countries for more than a decade, the spokesman
said, noting that the two governments have signed three agreements
on the issue, which shows a strong sense of responsibility on
launching U.S.-made satellites by Long March rockets.
</P>
<P>
"China's commercial launching service has always been in line
with common international practice, upheld the principle of
fairness and transparency and conformed to the three agreements
between the governments of China and the United States," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that while the technological security of U.S.-made
satellites is fully guaranteed, even if a breakdown occurs, the
investigation, analysis and decision on further measures are all
done independently by Chinese experts.
</P>
<P>
"The past experiences indicate that those measures are fully
effective and it is unnecessary, also impossible, for us to obtain
rocket and missile technology from U.S. satellite companies," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S. media and some House representatives have
misled the public by mixing up the conceptions of carrier rockets
and missiles, and blurred up the differences between normal
technological coordination and leakage of technology.
</P>
<P>
"Some people even take a biased stand on normal international
trade to serve certain political interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Those descriptions and behavior, while hurting the Chinese
aerospace industry, will do more harm to U.S. satellite producers
and users," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that U.S. congressmen of insight will take a prudent
approach in handling the issue and make sensible judgement in line
with the truth," the spokesman said.

SOFIA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian President Peter
Stoyanov, in his new year address to the nation Friday, urged
Bulgarians to "unite along the road to reform."
</P>
<P>
In the address aired at the start of the new year on national
radio and television, Stoyanov voiced his belief that Bulgaria
has already chosen its way, which will distance the country from
the hardship of transition in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"People should realize that reform is not a prerogative of a
single party or an end in itself and that they could miss success
if they are divided, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is time we started walking together along the road we have
chosen. The national choice was made by all Bulgarians using
common sense. It is the people who carry the burden of reforms."
</P>
<P>
"Soon we will make one more stride, not only towards the end
of the 20th century, but also towards the end of the second
millennium. I am sure this stride will distance us, the citizens
of Bulgaria, from the drama of the recent years.
</P>
<P>
"I think after wandering around for such a long time, the
fallacy and illusion, we deserve to look cheerfully and
peacefully into the future," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Communist Party Diplomacy Makes Headway (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Twenty years ago, the Chinese
Communist Party (CPC), which had the largest number of party
members anywhere in the world, maintained a few links with foreign
communist parties. Then by telling friends from enemies just
according to ideologies, the CPC's foreign relations were in an
impasse.
</P>
<P>
Today, matters are much changed and the CPC, which leads one
fifth of the world's population, has set up contacts and exchanges
with over 340 political parties of all types, in nearly 140
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Dai Bingguo, head of the International Department of the CPC
Central Committee in charge of the party's diplomatic work, told
Xinhua in an exclusive interview that along with China's rising
international status, the Party's diplomatic skills have become a
part of inter-state relations in order to better serve the
country's overall foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
In the last year, the 20th anniversary of the launch of China's
reform and opening-up policy, two notable achievements in the
CPC's external relations were recorded: the relationship between
the two communist parties of China and Japan was resumed after a
32-year suspension, and the president of the International
Socialist Party visited China for the first time in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that a new pattern in the CPC's
diplomatic work has emerged, in which it keeps in touch with
various party forces, including ruling parties, power-sharing
parties, opposition parties, and even political parties in
countries which have no diplomatic ties with China.
</P>
<P>
The CPC's brand-new foreign relations policy, which ignores
ideological differences, has shown unprecedented vigor and
vitality, they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's President Jamil
Mahuad is to meet his Peruvian counterpart Alberto Fujimori again
next Monday in Brasilia, capital of Brazil, Ecuadorian Vice
Foreign Minister Diego Ribadeneira said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents last met on October 26, when they signed in
Brasilia a definitive border peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state have pending themes at their meeting
about future development between the two countries, Ribadeneira
said.
</P>
<P>
Mahuad and Fujimori will also renew their appreciation to
Brazilian President Fernando Enrique Cardoso for his positive
role in brokering peace between Peru and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso, as coordinator of the peace process between Ecuador
and Peru, met the two presidents at least on three occasions
before the peace agreement was signed, and facilitated dialogues
between Mahuad and Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
Brazil also brokered a military peace mission in the
Ecuador-Peru Amazonian border following an armed conflict in 1995
between the two nations.

<P>
In another development, the CPC has maintained frequent and
in-depth exchanges with major parties in almost all neighboring
countries, contributing to a good-neighborly, peaceful and stable
environment for China's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
While strengthening and developing exchanges and cooperation
with over 160 parties in developing countries, the CPC also
carried on candid dialogues with parties in developed countries in
an effort to bring up the positive elements in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats say that, with friends in both ruling parties and
non-ruling parties, the CPC has helped China maintain sustainable
and stable ties with multi-party countries when power reshuffles
occur. Around 10 presidents in Latin America, for example, had
visited China at the invitation of the CPC before they assumed
their presidency.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, the CPC has forged ties with over 40
major parties in a total of 17 countries yet to establish ties
with China, which helps expedite both countries on their way to
forging diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
When it comes to such major issues as Taiwan, Tibet and human
rights, the CPC always tries to promote common understandings and
reduce divergencies through party-channel dialogues, and in
return, has won understandings and support from many parties and
international figures in favor of China's stance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the CPC has included economic exchanges in its
foreign relations framework in addition to political-themed talks,
and has made active efforts to promote economic and trade ties
between China and foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Casting his eyes upon the future of CPC foreign relations at
the turn of the century, Dai noted that the CPC will continue to
make every effort to explore more favorable and peaceful
international conditions for the ongoing reform and opening-up and
modernization drive right now in full swing in China.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's 1998 Per Capita GDP Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The prolonged economic crisis
has made both Indonesia's per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
and per capita Gross National Product (GNP) in 1998 lower than
those in 1997, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.
</P>
<P>
Based on the 1993 constant prices (one dollar equaled 2,123
rupiah), Indonesia's per capita GDP in 1998 dropped from 2.2
million rupiah in 1997 to 1.8 million, while the country's per
capita GNP fell from 2.1 million rupiah to 1.8 million rupiah,
Antara News Agency Friday quoted chief of the bureau Sugito Suwito
as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, if measured on the basis of the prevailing prices, the
country's per capita GDP increased to 4.9 million rupiah (one U.S.
dollar equals 8,000 rupiah now), compared with the previous year's
3.1 million rupiah, Sugito said.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the per capita GNP in 1998 was recorded at 4.6
million rupiah, up from the 3 million rupiah in 1997, he added.
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis caused changes in the 1998 GDP structure.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector enhanced its role in the GDP for the
first time in 30 years, increasing from 16.01 percent in 1997 to
18.82 percent. The mining sector in 1998 also increased its role
from 8.71 percent to 12.86 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
The industry sector also increased its share from 25.54 percent
to 26.23 percent, as the oil/gas industry could continue
production, Sugito said.
</P>
<P>
However, the role of the property and trade sectors in the GDP
declined from 7.38 percent and 16.59 percent to 5.44 percent and
14.9 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The role of the transportation and service sectors in the GDP
also dropped from 6.75 percent and 8.36 percent to 5.42 percent
and 6.91 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Ends 1998 With 29.9 Percent Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela ends 1998 with a
29.9 percent inflation, among the highest in Latin America, the
Central Bank of Venezuela announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, this year's inflation index variation has been the
least for the country since 1986, and has showed a deceleration
compared to 1997 when it registered a 37.6 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
The deceleration is linked to an important drop in the
domestic demand, produced by the contraction of public spending
and increases in the interest rates, Antonio Casas Gonzalez,
Central Bank president, said in his year-end message.
</P>
<P>
The government of Rafael Caldera had to cut its spending by
3.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, because of a 7 billion dollar
shortfall in oil income caused by the international crude prices
drop.

MADRID, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The implementation of a single

market as it will increase liquidity and the volume of trade, the
president of the Madrid Stock Market Antonio Zoido said here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zoido said that the year 1998 "was important for investors"
because of the yield obtained by the Madrid stock market with a

market for the financing of the Spanish economy."

The Madrid Stock Exchange president said that 1998 also ends
with "a growing degree of internationalization of the market."
</P>

He said that the year 1999 starts with a good economic
condition, but refused to make forecasts about possible

NEW YORK, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Blue-chip stocks closed lower
on Wall Street Thursday, but technology shares surged to a record
high in the last session of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 93.21 to 9,181.43,
sitting 16.1 percent above the year's starting point, but 192
points below the record high of 9,374.27 reached on December 23.
</P>
<P>
The technology-rich Nasdaq composite index ended the year at a
new high of 2,192.69, up 25.74 points from Wednesday, representing
a 39.6 percent growth for the year.

<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 2.70 to 1,229.23, up 26.7

Advancers led decliners 3-1 with more active trading than two

</P>
<P>
Analysts see Wall Street's 1998 performance as strong as it has
retained the double digit growth in major market indicators since
1995, thanks to a stable economy expected to grow around 3.5
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Some say that the stock market may face a correction some time
next year, as the economy is expected to see an expansion of
slower pace amid a not so strong consumer spending and bleak U.S.
exports to crisis-hit countries.

<HEADLINE> Romanian President Firmly Believes in Success of Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The year 1998 has been
tormented and difficult and it will remain enshrined in the books
of the future as a threshold in the history of this long and
winding road of the reform, Romanian President Emil Constantinescu
said Thursday night in his New Year message.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the year "began with a governmental
crisis and ended with a relaunching of radical, firm reform
measures we need so desperately in order to privatize large
enterprises and banks, curtail economic losses, tame the inflation
and regain the lost ground on foreign capital markets."
</P>
<P>
Should these processes go on as fast as they have in the past
two months, Romanians may start picking up the fruits of all the
sacrifices they have committed in the last 10 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
On a regional plan Romania has won unanimous appreciation as a
pillar of stability and balance thanks to its ties with its
friends in the neighborhood, he said. He added that Romania has
also earned a place along the trans-continental routes likely to
dominate the global society of the third millennium. "All these
have definitely fetched us security and high esteem from around
the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
In reference to the efforts and sacrifices the Romanian people
should enact in the near future, the president said
metaphorically, "There is a bridge that spans a troubled water
ahead of us and we must step across it. The countries that have
done it already can now enjoy more wealth and more security. The
indecisive are suffering from lack of capital, overdue wages and
pensions, violent actions carried out by mafia-like structures."
</P>
<P>
"As for ourselves," he stressed, "we are ready to cross the
bridge."
</P>
<P>
To do it right and in due time, he said, "we need three things:
to bear the conviction that we will be better off once across the
other bank, to act fearlessly, and to help one another as we all
shall have to cross this river."

<HEADLINE> Security Council Urges Angola's Cooperation Over Air Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Thursday voted 15-0 to adopt a resolution, demanding that
the conflicting parties in Angola immediate allow rescue
operations of a downed U.N. plane with 14 aboard over territory
where fierce fighting is raging on.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted at an urgent meeting on Angola, the
15-nation council deplored "the incomprehensible lack of
cooperation clarifying the circumstances of this tragedy" in the
central highland province of Huambo, Angola.
</P>
<P>
The council convened the urgent session during the holiday
break at the request of the Russian Mission to the United Nations,
about five days after the U.N.-chartered C-130 cargo plane crashed
Saturday with 10 passengers and four crew members aboard,
including U.N. peacekeepers in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The plane flew over embattled territory after taking off from
Huambo, Angola's second largest city.
</P>
<P>
The resolution demanded Jonas Savimbi, head of the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),
respond immediately to appeals from the United Nations that would
"guarantee the security and access necessary for" a resue mission.
</P>
<P>
It also called on the Angolan Government to cooperate "as
appropriate in fulfillment of its expressed commitment to do so."
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Government, which U.N. officials said also ignored
numerous U.N. appeals, reportedly said it would cooperate with the
United Nations over the plane crash just minutes before the
council's urgent meeting, but it gave no details on how this would
be done.
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan issued a
statement, saying that he has requested Benon Sevan,
under-secretary-general and United Nations security coordinator,
"depart for Angola as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
The statement said, "As part of his urgent efforts to assure
the swiftest possible implementation of a search and rescue
mission to the crash site of the United Nations plane in Angola,
the secretary-general has requested that Mr. Benon Sevan,
under-secretary-general and United Nations security coordinator,
depart for Angola as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to helping facilitate a mission to the crash site,
as well as an investigation into the cause of crash, the United
Nations security coordinator will assess the growing threat to
United Nations personnel throughout Angola," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general expects the responsible leaders in
Angola to provide all possible assistance to the United Nations
security coordinator in his mission," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has a 1,000 peacekeepers in Angola to
supervise crumbling 1994 peace accords that were to have ended
more than two decades of civil war in the former Portuguese colony
in southwest Africa.
</P>
<P>
The 185-member world body has asked UNITA and the Angolan
Government for a cease-fire so that rescue teams could operate
safely. However, artillery barrages continued with at least six
civilians killed and 20 others injured in Huambo Thursday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Collects 14.4 Billion Dollars in Overdue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Figures released Thursday
by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) of the United
States show a significant increase in collection of overdue child
support money from deadbeat parents.
</P>
<P>
The delinquent child support payments that the government
collected rose seven percent this year to a record 14.4 billion,
an increase of 80 percent over the past six years. The figure is a
compilation of both federal and state efforts nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Federal seizures of income tax refunds contributed greatly to
the increase.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of deadbeat parents across the nation opened their
tax refund envelopes only to find that the money they were
expecting was used to pay their delinquent child support,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
HHS seized 1.1 billion dollars in tax refunds from parents who
were delinquent in their child support payments. More than a
million American families in all 50 states received money owed to
them by delinquent parents through the program.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, state governments report the names of
parents who owe child support payments to HHS, which then notifies
the delinquent parents of the impending tax refund seizure. If the
parents do not pay their debt, the amount is deducted from their
refund. HHS can also report the failure to pay to credit agencies.
</P>
<P>
The White House also announced that next year's budget proposal
will include funding to find and prosecute violators under new,
strict laws that make moving across state lines to avoid paying
child support a federal offense.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating collection and prosecution efforts between state
and federal agencies has increased the number of federal
convictions 18-fold since the program's inception in May.
</P>
<P>
The program, currently in five states, would be expanded to 17
more states.
