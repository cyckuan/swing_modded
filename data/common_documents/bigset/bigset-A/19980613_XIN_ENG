<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Actions to Prevent School Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday called for less violence in popular entertainment and
urged Congress to support his gun safety and juvenile crime
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address, Clinton tried to determine "the
root causes" of youth violence that have led to dozens of deaths
and injuries in school shootings in Arkansas, Kentucky,
Mississippi, Pennsylvania and Oregon over the past several months.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said popular culture, from television and movies to
music and the computer screen, "too often glories violence" and
makes youngsters numb to it.
</P>
<P>
"When mindless killing becomes a staple of family
entertainment, when over and over children see cinematic conflicts
resolved not with words, but with weapons, we shouldn't be
surprised when children, from impulse or design, follow suit,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The president called for public action and responsibility to
the problem. Entertainment industry must act responsibly while
adults must better monitor what youngsters see and hear, and
counsel them against violent behavior, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Clinton said, parents must guard against easy
access to guns for children and Congress should act on the
administration's juvenile crime bill, which, among other things,
would ban violent juveniles from buying guns for life.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also asked the Department of Education and the
Department of Justice to work with school officials on developing
on "early warning guide" that might help prevent school violence.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Congress to pass a proposal in his balanced
budget for 95 million U.S. dollars to prevent juvenile crime and
promote after-school programs for youngsters.
</P>
<P>
Clinton planned to console later Saturday families of the
victims and community members following the May 21 shooting
rampage at Thurston High School in Springfield in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
Two students were killed and more than 20 were wounded when
15-year-old Kip Kinkel opened fire in the school cafeteria.

<HEADLINE> NATO to Conduct Mock Air Raids in Albania, Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- NATO announced Saturday that it
is conducting mock air raids next Monday in Albania and Macedonia
to demonstrate its capability to project power into the region
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The Western military alliance first announced air exercises in
the two Balkan countries at its defense ministers council meeting
Thursday, but did not say when.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
said that the air exercises, codenamed "Determined Falcon," would
be held on June 15 with the consent of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Fifth Allied Air Force Combined Air Operations Center in
Italy will be responsible for conducting the exercises, which are
designed by NATO to stop Yugoslavia from indiscriminate use of
force against civilian population in its province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that fighters, reconnaissance, airborne
early warning, tankers and helicopters will take part in the
exercises. The aircraft are provided by a number of NATO
countries. They will take off from NATO countries and fly to the
exercise areas for specific events before return to originating
bases.
</P>
<P>
Solana said that NATO continues to support a political solution
which brings an end to the violence in Kosovo, provides an
enhanced status of Kosovo, preserves the territorial integrity of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and safeguards the human and
civil rights of all inhabitants of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"NATO also remains determined," added the alliance chief, "to
contribute to efforts promoting stability and security in
neighboring countries, with particular emphasis on Albania and
Macedonia."
</P>
<P>
Both Albania and Macedonia are NATO's Partnership for Peace
member nations.
</P>
<P>
NATO warned that other military options, including air strikes
against Yugoslav military facilities on the ground in Kosovo, may
have to be resorted to if Belgrade chose to slight the warning
from the international community.

<HEADLINE> Pak Government Vows to Pursue Loan Defaulters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Finance Minister
Sartaj Aziz Saturday asked all banks and financial institutions to
pursue loan defaulters and warned of dire consequences after the
expiry of a July 10 deadline.
</P>
<P>
Sartaj told a press conference here that all defaulters, as
announced by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Thursday, must pay off
their loans or face strict action after four weeks.
</P>
<P>
To a question about specific steps taken by the government to
recover 140 billion rupees (about 3.2 billion U.S. dollars) stuck
up with the defaulters, he said, "We have not yet decided the
action plan against the defaulters."
</P>
<P>
He said the State Bank of Pakistan has been asked to collect
the new list of defaulters from banks in the light of which an
action plan against defaulters will be formulated.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Cabinet Meets to Heal Rift with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber
Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah Saturday chaired a special Cabinet meeting in an
attempt to end a rift between the government and the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State for Cabinet
Affairs Nasser Al-Roudhan said after the meeting that the
ministers discussed the current relations between the government
and the National Assembly (parliament) and ways to overcome
obstacles blocking achievement of positive and constructive
cooperation between the two authorities.
</P>
<P>
Roudhan said the emir was briefed on the outcome of contacts
and meetings held between parliament and Cabinet leaders,
which were aimed at finding appropriate means to develop
a relationship of cooperation and coordination.
</P>
<P>
The emir called for strengthening democracy in light of the
values, principles and ties governing Kuwait, which are dominated
by the spirit of fraternity, indulgence and responsibility,
Roudhan said.
</P>
<P>
The emir also expressed hope that everyone would realize the
magnitude of responsibilities and challenges that have to be dealt
with and all efforts required for the good of the country.
</P>
<P>
It was speculated that the emir might, at Saturday's meeting,
dissolve the parliament due to its lack of cooperation with the
government on a wide range of matters, especially on the
government reform blueprint. The main difference is focused on the
government plan to privatize the economy in order to curb budget
deficits.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah has said that
his government can no longer work with the 50-member National
Assembly, which was blamed for hindering the government reforms.
</P>
<P>
The parliament's criticism of the "spread of crimes and
corruption in various bodies" in the Interior Ministry also
attributed to the growing crisis between the two highest power
organs.
</P>
<P>
The current crisis began earlier the month when a legislator
decided to grill Interior Minister Sheikh Mohammad Al-Khaled
Al-Sabah over his incapability of fighting drugs and crimes.
</P>
<P>
However, the emir's remarks Saturday indicated that he would
not dissolve the parliament elected two years ago. Under the
constitution, the emir can dissolve parliament when the prime
minister says he can no longer deal with the legislature.
</P>
<P>
In 1976 and 1986, two previous Kuwaiti parliaments were
dissolved for severely criticizing the government.

<HEADLINE> Police at Grassroots Substations Key to Public Security: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Public Security Jia
Chunwang said here today that the prevention of crimes by police
at the grassroots levels is the key factor to safeguarding social
stability.
</P>
<P>
Police at the substations have the closest ties with the local
residents and are acquainted with the areas under their
jurisdiction, so they should act as a major force maintaining law
and order in localities, Jia said.
</P>
<P>
The minister of public security made the remarks at a national
conference on the work of police substations, which is being held
in this capital of northeast China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
He commended the work of establishing safety neighborhood
communities in Fuzhou, the capital city of east China's fujian
Province, where the occurrence rate of criminal cases had dropped
by 46 percent in 1997 over the previous year, and cases regarding
burglaring, looting and stealing of bicycles and motor vehicles
reduced by some 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he called on grassroots police to further reinforce
ties with the masses of people and serve them wholeheartedly, so
as to win their trust and support the fight against crime.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Injured McCarthy Misses Denmark Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- An embattled South Africa
suffered another big blow to their World Cup aspirations as their
star striker Benedict McCarthy is out for the crucial Group C
match against Denmark in Toulouse on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
McCarthy, who was stretchered off late in the match against
France on Friday night, suffered serious damage to his left ankle
ligaments and would be out for the match against the Danes, South
African Press Association quoted team doctor Victor Ramathesele as
saying on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
McCarthy, 20, was involved in a rather innocuous tackle with a
French player in the 87th minute of the match against France,
which ended in a 0:3 defeat for the South Africans.
</P>
<P>
The young Ajax Amsterdam player did not make much impact on the
heart of the French defense, who bottled him up with single-minded
determination.
</P>
<P>
There was also concern over fellow striker Phil Masinga, who
took a knock on the shin during the game but bravely continued for
the full 90 minutes, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Masinga's injury looks more serious than we thought, and I am
sending him for X-rays for a second opinion to be absolutely sure
of the severity of his injury," Ramathesele said on the team's
arrival at Vichy.
</P>
<P>
South Africa must win both their remaining matches, against
Denmark and Saudi Arabia, to advance to the next round.
</P>
<P>
Coach Philippe Troussier, pleased with his team's performance
in the Friday match but not happy with the margin of defeat, said
the side would start their preparations for the Denmark encounter
with a practice on Saturday evening.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The six-nation Contact Group for former Yugoslavia met on
Friday in London to envisage a reprisal against the bloody
suppression by Serbs against Albanians in Kosovo. They threatened
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic with a U.N. resolution opening
the way for a military intervention. This option was supported by
France but rejected by Russia.
</P>
<P>
-- Pope John Paul II called on all parties concerned in the
Middle East to respect the engagement they have made for the peace
 process, when he met Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at the
Vatican on Friday. Arafat has called for a popular mobilization by
the Palestinian people against Jewish colonization and urged the
United States to intervene more actively to save the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The recession in Asia, particularly in Japan, is exerting a
strong impact on world stock markets. The new bending of the yen to
144.75 low in exchange rate with the U.S. dollar made the stock
index in Seoul drop by 8.1 percent on Friday, while in Europe, Paris
stock exchange index dropped by 2.56 percent Amsterdam by 2.56
percent, and Frankfurt by 1.45 percent.
</P>
<P>

Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to give promise before Monday
to stop violences in Kosovo. Milosevic will meet with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin on Monday in Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Government Disappointed Over French </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government expressed
Saturday disappointment with statements by French officials that
a divided Cyprus could not enter the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
In a short statement, government spokesman Christos Stylianides
said that "after the visit of (Cypriot) Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides to Paris and other meetings with French officials, we
were disappointed to see this statement because we believe it is
not helpful."
</P>
<P>
Stylianides noted that statements, such as those expressed
Friday by French officials, are "contrary to EU decisions on
Cyprus and of course to the position of the British presidency."
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac's spokeswoman Catherine Colonna
told reporters in Paris Friday that France wants the EU to
consider suspending membership negotiations with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
She said that "the (European) Union cannot import into its
midst the problems of the division of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that "a country which is split in two
is hard to envisage," adding that "negotiations make no sense
if reunification is not on the cards."
</P>
<P>
The French statements were made just three days before the
opening of the EU summit, which will be held in the Welsh city of
Cardiff on June 15-16.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders agreed last December to open membership talks
with the Cypriot government, which started in March this year.
</P>
<P>
The EU's decision has angered the Turkish Cypriots, who vowed
not to attend the intercommunal talks unless the Turkish
Cypriot-controlled breakaway entity in northern Cyprus is
recognized and the Cypriot government suspends accession talks
with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus peace process came to a standstill last summer when
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash walked out of a
U.N.-sponsored intercommunal talks to protest the EU's intention
to open accession talks with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
aftermath of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island as
a bizonal, bicommunal federation through peace talks, but so far
no tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Army Chief Stresses Need for Upgrading Readiness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Army chief said
Saturday that "very responsible, mature and foolproof policies at
the national level will continue to be enforced to control, direct
and manage further developments in the nuclear field."
</P>
<P>
Chief of Army Staff General Jehangir Karamat made the remarks
while addressing officers during his day-long visit to two
garrisons in northeast Punjab Province, according to a press
release by Inter Services Public Relations Directorate.
</P>
<P>
General Karamat stressed the need to enhance combat efficiency
and upgrade operational readiness for all possible contingencies,
especially low-intensity conflicts and internal security
situations.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent nuclear tests, General Karamat said
that Pakistan had reacted in the interest of national security and
that the strategic imbalance in the region had to be redressed.
</P>
<P>
He said the testing was Pakistan's own effort and success had
been achieved at great costs. "Therefore, very responsible,
foolproof policies at the national level would continue to be
enforced to control, direct and manage further developments in
this field," he added.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, he said national security depends on
many other factors besides military and nuclear capabilities and
among them economic resilience and internal stability are the most
important, Karamat said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Refugee Crisis Eases in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The situation of refugees and
internally displaced people living in Africa is easing since 2.2
million refugees have returned home recently, said a report by
the U.N. refugees agency UNHCR available here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
As of January 1998, there were 5.7 million refugees and 1.5
million internally displaced in Africa, out of an estimated 22.3
million worldwide. Now the figure of refugees fell to 3.5 million
in Africa, said the report of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
In January 1997, there were 22.7 million refugees and the
displaced around the world, of whom eight million were in Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, among the major refugee-producing countries in the
world, seven are from Africa. They are Angola, Burundi, Eritrea,
Liberia, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Sudan, said the UNHCR Africa
Fact Sheet issued ahead of Africa Refugee Day on June 20.
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 saw major repatriation movements especially in
Ethiopia, Mali, Mauritania, Rwanda, Somalia and Togo, according
to the report based on a survey conducted in April.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, before the seven-year civil war broke out in Liberia,
western Africa recorded only 20,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
However, conflicts in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegal,
Mauritania and Mali have multiplied the figure in western Africa
to a peak of nearly one million exiles, said the report.
</P>
<P>
With an end to hostilities in Mali, the UNHCR was able to
begin important repatriation operations in 1995, and last year
completed returns from neighboring Mauritania and Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
The year 1998 now is expecting repatriation beginning in 1997
to Liberia to pick up with tens of thousands of refugees having
signed up to go home from Cote d'Ivoire and Guinea, said the
UNHCR report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, despite continuing debate over a possible peace
accord and crop-ruining floods in the south, tens of thousands of
Somali refugees are registering for return, especially to the
northwest of the Horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March 1998, more than 18,000 Somali refugees
have returned home.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are still about 400,000 Somalis, 346,000
Sudanese, 321,000 Eritreans, 268,000 Burundis, 100,000 Congolese
and 75,000 Rwandans living as refugees in east Africa and the
Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, more than 40,000 Congolese had returned
home across Lake Tanganyika while the UNHCR now is facilitating
the return of the Burundi refugees from Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, Congo (Brazzaville), the Democratic Republic of Congo
and Namibia currently still host 260,000 Angolans who fled during
the 20 years of civil war, the UNHCR noted.
</P>
<P>
However, around 10,000 refugees have returned so far this year
to Angola, bringing the number of returnees to 140,000 since the
UNHCR began the repatriation in 1996. The UNHCR now hopes more
Angolans will repatriate when the country's rainy season ends in
May.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the improvements, Africa is still facing a
critical challenge particularly in the Great Lakes region over
how to reconcile refugee protection with the security of hosting
states and their people, the UNHCR said.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are three lasting solutions to the plight of
refugees -- voluntary repatriation, integration in the country of
first asylum and re-settlement in a third country.
</P>
<P>
The Convention on Refugees ratified by the member states of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) entered into force on
June 20, 1974. Since then, the date has been celebrated as
Africa Refugee Day.

<HEADLINE> Debutants Croatia, Jamaica to Clash in Group H </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Croatia and Jamaica make their World Cup
debuts on Sunday when the two sides clash with each other in a Group H
game.
</P>
<P>
Jamaica, the first English-speaking Caribbean nation to qualify for
the finals, would surprise the world if they could reach the second
stage while Croatia, boasting many talents playing in European
leagues, is aiming at a berth in the last four.
</P>
<P>
Croatia's coach Miroslav Blazevic said his team would have a result
no worse than the European Championship in 1996, meaning entering the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
There were also pre-competition spying between the two squads,
which have never met before.
</P>
<P>
The Croatia camp has reportedly sent unsuccessfully spies to their
rivals while Jamaican coach Rene Simoes did some reconnaisance himself
by attending a Croatian warm-up game on June 9.
</P>
<P>
There is reasons that he shoudl know his opponents better, who are
led by 30-year-old Real Madrid striker Davor Suker, playmaker Robert
Prosinecki and midfielder Zvonimir Boban from AC Milan.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian attacking force could be stronger had Alen Boksic not
dropped out through injury and coach Miroslav Blazevic has planned to
form a striking combinatoin of Mario Stanic, originally a midfielder,
with Suker.
</P>
<P>
However, the key of this formation reshuffling lies in right back
Slaven Bilic, who became the major injury worry for Blazevic after
suffering a groin strain in a friendly last month.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Brazilian Simoes prepared his team for the
finals through a series of friendlies and forced goalless draws with
Brazil, Nigeria and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
In a World Cup group that also includes South American favorite
Argentina and Japan, the "Reggae Boyz" may just be able to dance
within the first stage.
</P>
<P>
However, Simoes warned that "If the Croatians aren't careful, on
Sunday they'll be learning to dance reggae."
</P>
<P>
Walter Boyd could be the main hope to net in Sunday's game as the
"Black Pearl" has claimed with 17 international goals.
</P>
<P>
Following a rift between Boyd and Simoes, some English-based
players could be fielded instead, including Derby County's Deon
Burton, who made his fame by netting four goals in four successive
games in the qualifying competition.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Increase Bus Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Government-owned Zimbabwe United
Passenger Company (ZUPCO) is to increase its fares by between
seven and 16 percent with effect from Monday or June 15.
</P>
<P>
ZUPCO Public Relations Manager Ben Mauchaza Saturday told the
Zimbabwe News Agency that the increases had been necessitated by
a number of factors which included the rise in prices of major
inputs such as tyres and lubricants.
</P>
<P>
The prices of all imported vehicle spare parts had gone up by
81 percent mainly because of the devaluation of the Zimbabwean
Dollar last year while tyre costs had gone up by a minimum of
28.3 percent and lubricants by up to 80 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The increase in fares had become unavoidable but the company
would ensure that fares were kept at a minimum level, he said.

HARBIN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- More and more enterprises from the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) are showing great
interest in expanding trade relations with northeast China, an
official from the Hong Kong Trade Development Council said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The council has organized many businesses in the Hong Kong SAR
to attend the upcoming Ninth Harbin Economic and Trade
Negotiations Fair, said Song Ying, chief representative in charge
of the council's business in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
China's northernmost province of Heilongjiang, which does a
flourishing border trade with members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS), is particularly attractive to Hong Kong
business people.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong business people regard the fair in Harbin, capital
of Heilongjiang, as the best channel for entering the regional
market," Song said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong enterprises signed about 4.1 million US dollars-worth
of orders with local partners at last year's Harbin fair.
</P>
<P>
The 15-odd enterprises from Hong Kong which attend the fair will
display various commodities, including garments, jewelry, cosmetics,
electronic goods and traditional Chinese medicines, Song said.
</P>
<P>
Business people from Australia, Hungary, Japan, the Republic of
Korea (ROK), Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, Yugoslavia and other

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The people of Mogadishu have
started reacting for the first time to the current wave of
widespread banditry and looting in the streets of the Somali
capital.
</P>
<P>
Groups of annoyed businessmen, intellectuals and religious
elites began creating local security servicemen to combat this
burglary.
</P>
<P>
As the former Islamic courts of North Mogadishu had been
crippled by the misunderstanding between faction leader Ali Mahdi
Mohamed and the chairman of the courts, Sheikh Ali Sheikh Mohamud
(Sheikh Ali Dhere), daylight looting and robbery on public places
including mosques as well as the civilian properties became
popular.
</P>
<P>
The latest was the peeling off of Mogadishu's second largest
soccer stadium which currently accommodated a soccer tournament
by Mogadishu's main 10 teams. It had been rehabilitated by U.N.
Operations in Somalia (UNOSOM) during their operations in the
country.
</P>
<P>
A new initiative led by Sheikh Ali Dhere himself has again
reorganized about a hundred former armed militiamen in the Karan
district of north Mogadishu. Two days ago, the new force has in
one of their largest operations rounded up quite a number of
bandits including the seizure of two sacks of marijuana and 16
bandits including two women who either sold the narcotic or used
them.
</P>
<P>
The bandits have been tried in a small Islamic court, where 10
of them were found guilty and each served 39 lashes in public
while three others were released after establishing their
innocence. Sheikh Ali Dhere himself and his forces have blazed
the two sacks of marijuana inside the Karan police station where
hundreds of people have watched in happiness.
</P>
<P>
In south Mugadishu, another new Islamic court has been
inaugurated in the Shirkoleh area by a group of businessmen and
religious scholars.
</P>
<P>
People in the capital have been talking about the renewed
peace efforts by the renewed Islamic courts and two of their
subsequent successful operations. Many of them sighed with
relief following their disappointment resulted from the failure
of Mogadishu's faction leaders to formulate a common
administration for the capital.

HARARE, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Federation of
Red Crescent Societies (IFRCS) is holding a regional workshop
here to train its members to handle refugees in situations of
limited facilities, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The workshop comes in the wake of the rise in the number of
refugees now streaming into Zambia from its conflict-torn
neighbors Angola, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo
(former Zaire).
</P>
<P>
The workshop which started Monday has drawn participants from
most southern African countries.
</P>
<P>
"Zambia has been receiving a lot of refugees from Rwanda,
Angola and Zaire and the skeleton facilities and skills available
were not able to adequately provide help to them," said the
spokesman of the organizers.
</P>
<P>
IFRCS is the mother body of Red Cross societies whose mission
is to fight against human sufferings.
</P>
<P>
Issues to be tackled at the workshop include the prevention of
cholera outbreak which is usually the chief problem in situation
of water scarcity, crowding and poor sanitation.

<P>
PARIS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Saturday urged Yugoslav authorities to bring an end to military
operations against ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
It is perfectly clear to everyone that the Serbs are acting
with excessive brutality toward the Kosovans. The violence is
forcing the people to flee their country in an attempt to escape
the conflict, the constant threat of death, and the harsh
realities of an ethnic cleansing, said Chirac during a meeting
with Kosovo's Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
He said the international community should use all means
necessary, including military intervention, to re-establish peace
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"If they continue like this, there will be a great risk that
the conflict will spill over into the Balkans," he said.
</P>
<P>
France has expressed its support of military intervention by
NATO in Kosovo, which has been plunged into war between Yugoslav
security forces and Albanian separatists over the past several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians have fled their homes
because of the conflict.

Rouge (KR) officials to the Royal Cambodian government.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's state television Saturday evening released a letter
sent by Hun Sen to Chan Youran and four other KR officials who
defected from the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, on behalf of the Cambodian government and joint
commander-in-chief of the Cambodian Royal Army, said he would like
to give them a warm welcome on their return to the big family --
the kingdom of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Chan Youran, Mak Ben, En Sopheap, Kor Bum and Thiounn Thioeun,
the five senior officials of the so-called KR government, signed a
statement on Friday announcing they had split from the Khmer
Rouge's hardliners Ta Mok and Nuon Chea.
</P>
<P>
A large number of KR guerrillas also defected to the government
following the death of Pol Pot on April 15, and in response to the
government's continuing efforts to eliminate the remaining KR
rebels.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Refugee Crisis Eases in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The situation of refugees and
internally displaced people living in Africa is easing since 2.2
million refugees have returned home recently, said a report by
the U.N. refugees agency UNHCR available here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
As of January 1998, there were 5.7 million refugees and 1.5
million internally displaced in Africa, out of an estimated 22.3
million worldwide. Now the figure of refugees fell to 3.5 million
in Africa, said the report of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
In January 1997, there were 22.7 million refugees and the
displaced around the world, of whom eight million were in Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, among the major refugee-producing countries in the
world, seven are from Africa. They are Angola, Burundi, Eritrea,
Liberia, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Sudan, said the UNHCR Africa
Fact Sheet issued ahead of Africa Refugee Day on June 20.
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 saw major repatriation movements especially in
Ethiopia, Mali, Mauritania, Rwanda, Somalia and Togo, according
to the report based on a survey conducted in April.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, before the seven-year civil war broke out in Liberia,
western Africa recorded only 20,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
However, conflicts in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegal,
Mauritania and Mali have multiplied the figure in western Africa
to a peak of nearly one million exiles, said the report.
</P>
<P>
With an end to hostilities in Mali, the UNHCR was able to
begin important repatriation operations in 1995, and last year
completed returns from neighboring Mauritania and Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
The year 1998 now is expecting repatriation beginning in 1997
to Liberia to pick up with tens of thousands of refugees having
signed up to go home from Cote d'Ivoire and Guinea, said the
UNHCR report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, despite continuing debate over a possible peace
accord and crop-ruining floods in the south, tens of thousands of
Somali refugees are registering for return, especially to the
northwest of the Horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March 1998, more than 18,000 Somali refugees
have returned home.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are still about 400,000 Somalis, 346,000
Sudanese, 321,000 Eritreans, 268,000 Burundis, 100,000 Congolese
and 75,000 Rwandans living as refugees in east Africa and the
Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, more than 40,000 Congolese had returned
home across Lake Tanganyika while the UNHCR now is facilitating
the return of the Burundi refugees from Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, Congo (Brazzaville), the Democratic Republic of Congo
and Namibia currently still host 260,000 Angolans who fled during
the 20 years of civil war, the UNHCR noted.
</P>
<P>
However, around 10,000 refugees have returned so far this year
to Angola, bringing the number of returnees to 140,000 since the
UNHCR began the repatriation in 1996. The UNHCR now hopes more
Angolans will repatriate when the country's rainy season ends in
May.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the improvements, Africa is still facing a
critical challenge particularly in the Great Lakes region over
how to reconcile refugee protection with the security of hosting
states and their people, the UNHCR said.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are three lasting solutions to the plight of
refugees -- voluntary repatriation, integration in the country of
first asylum and re-settlement in a third country.
</P>
<P>
The Convention on Refugees ratified by the member states of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) entered into force on
June 20, 1974. Since then, the date has been celebrated as
Africa Refugee Day.

WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Two bombs were found at the
airport in Eugene, Oregon, on Friday night hours before U.S.
President Clinton's Air Force One landed, an Associated Press
report said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tipped by an anonymous caller, Eugene police found and
detonated the bombs in a culvert near the airport, where the
president was to arrive for his visit to nearby Springfield to
comfort victims of last month's school shooting.
</P>
<P>
The caller also told police there were bombs at Eugene's
Greyhound bus terminal, but after it was cleared and searched for
seven hours no bombs were found. In Springfield, a bomb threat
emptied City Hall but a search there also turned up nothing.
</P>
<P>
Eugene police was quoted as saying that the bombs were nothing
to do with the president.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was to make a commencement address at Portland State
University on Saturday and to visit Springfield's Thurston High
School, where 15-year-old Kip Kinkel is accused of open fire on
students in a cafeteria, killing two and injuring more than 20.

<P>
CAIRO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- Tunisia ranks second among African countries in
service export.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar in the capital on Thursday, Tunisian
Minister of Trade Mondher Znaidi said services account for 30
percent of the country's total exports, 10 percent more than the
figure set by the European Union for its member states.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics have showed that Tunisia's exports of
textiles and clothes stood 2.7 billion Tunisian dinars (2.5
billion U.S. dollars) last year, increasing by 8 percent compared
to the volume in 1996.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Latest statistics released by United Arab Emirates
(UAE) Ministry of Planning have showed that hotel revenues in the
country last year amounted to 3 billion dirhams (about 820 million
dollars), 9.5 percent more than those in 1996.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's trade deficit dropped by a dramatic 36
percent on an annualized basis from November 1997 to May 1998,
thanks to expanded exports and shrunk imports.
</P>
<P>
The deficit was 425 million U.S. dollars in May, the Jerusalem
Post newspaper reported Friday, quoting figures released by the
Central Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The exports totaled 1.78 billion dollars, up 14 percent in
annual terms from November 1997 to May 1998 and imports 2.23
billion dollars, a decrease of 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The declining trade deficit along with the increase of imports
of investment goods have seemed to reinforce Finance Minister
Ya'acov Neeman's claim that Israel is nearing the end of its
economic stagnation.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Transit Point for Asia Drug Trafficking: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is a transit point for
narcotic drugs from mainly the Asian sub-continent, Kenyan
Cabinet Minister in the Office of the President Marsden Madoka
has said.
</P>
<P>
Drug problems in the east African country are no different
from that of some main narcotic consuming countries, he was
quoted Saturday by the East African Standard newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Madoka termed Kenya's geographical position as strategic for
drug source countries, adding that the state's effective
communications network only serve to make it the ideal conduit
for international drug runners.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenya, a supporter of the African Common Position on
Drug Control, has taken measures to cope with escalating drug
related problems at the national level, he said at the 20th
special session of the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
</P>
<P>
The country has already established an Anti-Narcotics Unit as
well as a permanent inter-ministerial drug coordinating committee
to harmonize, monitor and evaluate all drug control measures
nationwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
Establishing a national crime research center last year and
enacting the narcotic drugs and psychotrophic substances control
act in 1994 were also among the measures.
</P>
<P>
The act incorporates various provisions of the U.N.
conventions on narcotic drugs and psychotrophic substances.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Kenya is working on the ratification of the
convention on Psychotrophic substances of 1971, which would
compliment the already ratified single Convention on Narcotic
Drugs of 1961, and the Convention against Illicit Traffic in
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotrophic substances of 1988.
</P>
<P>
Madoka added that Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania have drawn up a
protocol in common efforts to combat drug trafficking in the east
African region.

<HEADLINE> Tough Rules Facing Kenyan Bankers: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Finance Minister Simeon
Nyachae has said bank directors and senior managers will in
future be expected to borrow money from the banks they manage at
commercial rates and other tougher rules.
</P>
<P>
The move, which include amendments to the Banking Act, is
aimed at further protecting depositor's funds and fostering a
sound banking system, he was quoted by Saturday's East African
Standard newspaper as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The changes also require owners and managers of financial
institutions to ensure sound corporate governance in all their
institutions. However, no details were given as to how this was
to be achieved.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that the Central Bank of Kenya now has
the managerial capacity necessary to monitor the local banking
sector.
</P>
<P>
The asset quality of banks will be scrutinized so that the
problem of large non-performing assets, which results from poor
credit procedures, is effectively addressed.
</P>
<P>
He announced that no bank or company will be allowed to issue
commercial paper or corporate bond unless they are rated by an
independent rating agency.
</P>
<P>
However, immediate implementation of this measure will be
difficult given that there is still no independent rating agency
in the country.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the minister presented to parliament the 1998/99
budget aimed at reviving the country's battled economy, and this
also sent a signal of an era of belt-tightening.
</P>
<P>
"The 1998/99 budget... reflects two principles that can be
summarized in a few words -- fiscal restraint and a balanced
budget," he said in the draft budget.
</P>
<P>
The budget also announced plans to introduce longer term bonds
with an attractive lower interest rate in the market.
</P>
<P>
The first, a two-year maturity bond will be an amnesty bond of
those who with undeclared tax income may buy the bond from now
until December 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Although the minister did not indicate the interest rate the
bond will attract, it is likely that this will be similar to the
current floating rate bond whose interest is pegged to the 91-day
Treasury Bill rate.
</P>
<P>
This interest will be paid half-yearly and will be subject to
15 percent withholding tax.
</P>
<P>
The other bond will be a low denominated bond with a fixed
rate of interest aimed at small savers. This is expected to
increase competition for government debt and lower interest
rates.

<HEADLINE> New Gold Mine Commissioned in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Anglo American Zimbabwe Company
has commissioned a new gold mine in Nkayi of west Zimbabwe, The
Herald daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Production at the gold mine, the company's second largest one
in the country, whose present capacity is 30,000 ounces of gold
per month, is expected to rise to 40,000 ounces a month.
</P>
<P>
Anglo American was planning to become the pre-eminent producer
of gold in Zimbabwe, with a target of some 300,000 ounces to 10
tons per annum in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony Friday, Nicky Oppenheimer,
deputy chairman of Anglo American Corporation of South Africa,
said, "We need to recognize that the world is shrinking in size
as communication becomes easier, finance becomes more mobile and
trade barriers around the world begin to fall."
</P>
<P>
"To meet these challenges, we as a country and a corporation
need to make the most of our advantages and minii our
disadvantages as we compete in the global playing field," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Oppenheimer, the new mine was a show of the
confidence they had in Zimbabwe's economy. He urged governments
in the southern African region to continue improving the
investment climates in their countries.
</P>
<P>
Anglo American Corporation operates a number of mines in
Zimbabwe while it has announced plans to open a 77-million-U.S.
Dollars platinum mine, which is the country's second largest.

JOHANNESBURG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's currency Rand
sank to a new record low against the U.S. Dollar Friday despite a
Reserve Bank move to shore up local markets by cutting the repo
rate to 17 percent from 17.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In late trade the Rand was at 5.3 to the Dollar, a loss of 44

"The point was raised and accepted that the changes here in
South Africa have not reached crisis point," Manuel told a news
conference in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
He said all role players were committed to ensuring price
stability, and the government did not want to see unnecessary
changes to the macro-economic environment.
</P>
<P>
Referring to banks' decisions to increase lending rates,
Manuel said the government was concerned about any move that
would dampen economic growth prospects.
</P>
<P>
First National Bank announced a rate hike of two percentage
points Friday following similar move by another leading
commercial bank, ABSA. Other banks are expected to follow suit

<HEADLINE> WB Helps Zambia's Copper Mines to Pay off Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has injected 80
million U.S. Dollars in Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM)
in the past month to help the mines pay off its international and
local debt prior to the privatization of its assets.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Saturday quoted Mines Minister Syamukayumbu
Syamujaye as saying Friday that 50 million Dollars was released
last month while another 30 million Dollars has recently been
released to help ZCCM decongest its debt stock as negotiations
for its privatization continue.
</P>
<P>
The new debt that is being accrued by ZCCM which used to cover
more than 90 percent of the country's foreign exchange earnings
will have to be included in the value for which the mines will
eventually be sold, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the continued accrual of debt by the state-owned
conglomerate is of concern to the government and it is therefore
important that its assets are sold off as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Syamujaye announced that the Nkana and Nchanga mines, two
largest ones registering about 65 percent of ZCCM's copper
production, are now scheduled to be sold off by the end of July
after the failure of the initial privatization talks with the
Kafue Consortium, while the remaining assets of ZCCM will be sold
off by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Kafue Consortium, the sole bidders for ZCCM's Nkana and
Nchanga mines, has finally collapsed following the decision by
its members to abandon the project after 16-month long unfruitful
negotiations with the Zambian government.
</P>
<P>
Mining analysts here, however, feel that mines should be
quickly disposed of because the mines' current one million
Dollars per day operational costs has become a strain on the
national revenue.

The deal, signed in Harare later this week, formed part of the
CBZ's privatization and signified Absa's entry into sub-Saharan
Africa, Absa group managing director Nallie Bosman was quoted by
the Saturday's Citizen daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The CBZ is a commercial bank with 12 well-spread branches in
Zimbabwe and is the first bank to be privatized in that country.
</P>
<P>
Absa expressed the hope that it would not merely be an
investor but would also promote a closer relationship with the
CBZ by becoming its technical partner.
</P>
<P>
The CBZ chief executive Gideon Gono said Absa was a strong
international partner whose expertise in treasury and technology
areas can assist the bank in entering international markets.
</P>
<P>
Absa and the CBZ have had a health relationship through
correspondent banking and trade financing transactions for
sometime.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994 trade between South Africa and sub-Saharan African

causing big economic losses to the giant parastatal.
</P>
<P>
The UEB board of directors also decided to send six top
managers in the company on forced leave.
</P>
<P>
Frank Katusiime, a board member, was quoted by Saturday's New

million U.S. Dollars) in dubious financial transactions.
</P>

of Natural Resources. We have been restructuring and clear
financial and procurement regulations must be observed. Any

<P>
Over 100 million Uganda Shillings (80,000 Dollars) was paid

WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Japan's authorities said the economy is shrinking,
officially affirming a recession in the world's second-largest
economy.
</P>
<P>
-- The world's leading industrialized nations stepped up
diplomatic pressure against India and Pakistan, halting loans to
the South Asia rivals because of their recent nuclear tests while
offering encouragement to forswear further development of atomic
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton, navigating a middle course between
environmental groups and oil companies, announced a 10-year
extension of the moratorium on oil drilling off virtually all
American ocean coastlines.
</P>
<P>
-- An Indian proposal for talks to lessen tensions on the
subcontinent was quickly rejected by Pakistan, but the offer
nonetheless appeared to move both governments closer to direct
negotiations over the crisis set off by recent nuclear tests.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Hopes for U.N. Chief's Role in South Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Saturday expressed the
hope that U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan will play a positive
role in promoting peace and security in South Asia through a just
settlement of the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the U.N. secretary general will contribute toward the
resolution of the Kashmir dispute in accordance with Security
Council resolutions," a Foreign Office spokesman told a news
conference here Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who has written a letter to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
and also had a telephone conversation with him, is to send an
envoy to Islamabad and New Delhi to promote peace and security in
South Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman reiterated that bilateral talks
between Pakistan and India could be resumed unless they are held
on the basis of the agenda agreed by the two countries' foreign
secretaries at their meeting in Islamabad in June last year.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has invited India for talks on the basis of the
agreed agenda adopted at the Islamabad round on June 23 last year
while India wants talks on the basis of proposals they sent in
January," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, cannot agree to engage itself in such talks
with India because the Indian proposals are "unrealistic and
unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
However, he did not elaborate on these proposals, saying only
that they are dealing with just the "mechanism" of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman emphasized that the agreed agenda between the two
countries includes "matters pertaining to peace and security with
a specific reference to the Kashmir dispute."

Li recalled his recent visit to France, saying that he has
become deeply aware through the visit that China and France have
many reasons to enhance their co-operation and exchanges.

He noted that both countries, which have a longstanding history
and splendid cultures, are currently engaged in developing economy
and upgrading people's living standards, and they have identical
or similar views on many international issues.

added.

Li expressed appreciations over the forging of sisterly-city
ties between Bordeaux and Wuhan, a transportation hub and an

Co-operation between the cities of the two countries constitute
an important part of the overall friendship, he said, expressing

their own development and to contribute to the progress of
bilateral relations as well.
</P>
<P>
Juppe said France has always considered China its major
co-operative partner, and that just as China, France opposes
hegemonism. He expressed satisfaction with bilateral co-operation
in some current world issues, and appreciated the positive role
China has been playing in helping stablize the Asian economic
situation.

<HEADLINE> Neuharth: "Most Americans have better understanding of China than Politicians"  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- "My feeling is that there are no
more walls. If there are walls, they are walls of friendship,"
Allen Neuharth has said when he posed for a picture with a group of
veteran American newspapermen.
</P>
<P>
"The Great Wall was built to keep away foreigners, unfriendly
foreigners from China. And now, look! Everybody on the Wall is a
foreigner, because there are no longer walls between countries,"
said Neuharth, an American newspaper mogul and founder of USA
Today.
</P>
<P>
The 73-year-old Neuharth has made 10 trips to China since China
normalized relations with the United States in 1979, and he met
the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping during his first visit to
Beijing, in 1980.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interviews with Xinhua, Neuharth noted that the
on-going debate in Congress and the media targeting President
Bill Clinton's coming visit to China "is made by a small minority
of noise-makers, and I think the vast majority of the people in
the U.S. are very glad that President Clinton is coming here.
</P>
<P>
"In some ways, most of the people in the U.S. have a better
understanding of China than our politicians do," he said, "That's
because the American people are not so selfish.
</P>
<P>
"I think the American people are relieved, and admire China and
Beijing more in the last year than ever before because of the way
China has handled the Hong Kong handover," he noted. "China
said, 'We will have "one country, two systems".' They made the
promise and they kept the promise.
</P>
<P>
"I think many many people in America -- those who have an
understanding of foreign affairs -- believe that there must be
one world with several systems," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
"So I think it is very important from China's perspective that
you do not let the political noise-makers in our country put the
wrong thing on this, I can understand what might happen but, you
see, even President Clinton has never hesitated, never for a
minute, considered not coming, though the media made it look like it
might change his mind," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no anti-China sentiment on the part of the American
people," Neuharth said. "You have to understand when you have a
two-party political system, they love to argue with each
other. But the general public are not carried away with such little
things. And that's why President Clinton never hesitated about
coming here."
</P>
<P>
Recalling his dinner with American Ambassador James Sasser
Thursday, Neuharth said the ambassador told him that the Clinton
administration had never considered not attending the welcoming
ceremony at the plaza to the east of the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
"If an American leader refused to attend a welcoming ceremony
at the plaza, it would be like the leader of China coming to the
United States and saying "I don't want to be received at the south
lawn of the White House," Said Neuharth.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about media reports on the transfer of missile
technology and political donations, Neuharth said, "I think most
of our people and our administration and our President believe
that China has acted as a responsible, emerging world leader.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the financial contributions are concerned, everybody
in America knows that many many countries tunnel campaign funds to
the Republicans and the Democrats," he said. "It's just that,
again, under the two-party system, the Republicans try to make
democrats to be ashamed. In our political system, illegal campaign
contributions are used by both political parties over and over
again. Most people just laugh about it, and say,'That's the way
our system works,'" he said. "Also, there has been no proof that
campaign financing was directly tied to any favors for China."

Talking about the Western media's current coverage of China, he
said, "In our country, the public thinks that our press is not
very fair, that too many journalists, too many reporters report
biased, or unfair things in newspapers or on television. That's
why our press is not very popular in other countries. Instead of
just reporting the truth, there are too many opinions that are
biased and prejudiced."
</P>
<P>
"Even American embassy people here think the Western press does
not do a good, fair job in covering China. They generally agree
that the Western press is too negative about China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Neuharth is also the founder of Freedom Forum, an international
foundation. Speaking about freedom, he said, "I think the free
press, free speech and free spirit is different throughout the
world.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe that Americans should impose their system on
other countries," he said. "We think we should let other countries
decide whether their systems are better or our system is better, or
whether there should be a mixture of the two."
</P>
<P>
"I think the more you travel in this world, the more you
understand that it is one world, but there are many systems, not
just in the press, but in religion, in economy and in everything
-- in all factors of life, all sectors of life," he added.
</P>
<P>
"And if we understand that, we can get along with each other,
cooperate with each other in economic and business matters, be at
peace with each other, and still be different in the way we do
things," Neuharth said.

<HEADLINE> ``Improved Legal System Guarantee for Sustained Development" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Cheng Siyuan, vice-chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), said
in this capital city of Shandong Province today that the
improvement of China's legal system will serve as a guarantee for
environmental protection and sustained development.
</P>
<P>
A national legal system for the protection of the environment and
resources will be set up in coming five years, Cheng said during
an eight-day inspection tour on ocean environmental protection
organized by the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
He urged people's congresses at the provincial level to work
out their own regulations in light of local conditions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, people's congresses at all levels should enhance
their supervision of the implementation of the laws on
environmental protection and correct the tendency for laws not to
be enforced strictly and violations of laws not to be
investigated, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-chairman called on all provinces to launch mass
campaigns on disseminating elementary knowledge of the law.
</P>
<P>
Shandong has a coastline of 3,121 km, accounting for one sixth
of the national total. Its marine economic sector yielded an
output value of 60 billion yuan in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the quality of Shandong's offshore water has
deteriorated in recent years owing to the discharge of untreated
industrial waste water, the vice-chairman noted.

JOHANNESBURG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Absa, the biggest commercial
bank in South Africa, has bought 26 percent share holding in the
Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe (CBZ) for 50 million Rand (9.4
million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The deal, signed in Harare later this week, formed part of the
CBZ's privatization and signified Absa's entry into sub-Saharan
Africa, Absa group managing director Nallie Bosman was quoted by
the Saturday's Citizen daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The CBZ is a commercial bank with 12 well-spread branches in
Zimbabwe and is the first bank to be privatized in that country.
</P>
<P>
Absa expressed the hope that it would not merely be an
investor but would also promote a closer relationship with the
CBZ by becoming its technical partner.
</P>
<P>
The CBZ chief executive Gideon Gono said Absa was a strong
international partner whose expertise in treasury and technology
areas can assist the bank in entering international markets.
</P>
<P>
Absa and the CBZ have had a health relationship through
correspondent banking and trade financing transactions for
sometime.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994 trade between South Africa and sub-Saharan African
countries has improved dramatically.

MANILA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from 14 countries
and the United Nations said here Saturday that their governments
will continue to support Philippines' modernization and
development under the administration of President-Elect Joseph
Estrada.
</P>
<P>
They made the assurance during their separate meetings with
Philippine President Fidel Ramos Wednesday Morning, according to a
press statement issued by the presidential office.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the statement said, the dignitaries urged
Ramos to be actively involved in international affairs even after
he steps down from office on June 30 by sharing his thoughts on
the many developments taking place in various parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with President Ramos, Xie Fei, vice chairman of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China,
said China will develop 21st century-oriented relations of good
neighborliness and mutual trust with the Philippines and other
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
"Japan is still committed to support the Philippines. We are
confident that the Philippines' incoming president will continue

<P>
HONG KONG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A show was staged here Saturday
to mark the UN International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit
Trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The 90-minute show, featuring anti-drug messages, songs and
music, was organized by the Narcotics Division of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
During the show held at a local shopping center, performers
entertained the audience with songs, and teamed up with the
audience in a quiz and games to popularize anti-drug messages.
</P>
<P>
The show was accompanied by an anti-drug photo exhibition and
display of fake drugs.
</P>
<P>
According to a local official, the number of reported drug
abusers dropped to 17,555 in Hong Kong in 1997, a 10.9 percent
decrease compared with that of 1996 as a result of strenuous
efforts made by the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
Apart from education and publicity, the SAR government
increased in 1997 the penalties for exploiting young people in
drug trafficking and tightened up control on certain chemicals to
prevent them from being used in manufacturing of drugs.
</P>
<P>
The government also continued maintaining close liaison with
various countries and international organizations in combating
drug trafficking and money laundering.

<P>
BAGHDAD, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and the U.N. Special Commission
on disarmament in Iraq, known as UNSCOM, started talks on Saturday in
order to work out a program for the future arms inspections in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held at the Iraqi foreign ministry building, with
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz as head of the Iraqi team and UNSCOM
Chairman Richard Butler as head of UNSCOM team.
</P>
<P>
Butler arrived here on Thursday, leading a 20-member UNSCOM
delegation including Deputy Chairman Charles Duelfer and four
commissioners from Venezuela, Russia, Belgium and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The talks are under way, but diplomats here believe that the talks
will be very difficult. Butler said at Thursday's press conference
that he has brought a list of prior tasks that Iraq has to fulfill in
order to get sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
Butler called the list "road map," saying access to information of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, biological weapons in particular,
is the main prior task.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq has declared time and again that it has destroyed all
its banned weapons and provided all necessary materials, documents and
information.
</P>
<P>
On a working visit to New York earlier this month, Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf slammed the "road map" as "political
motivated" with the aim to "complicate the situation."
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq has implemented all requirements under the U.N.
resolutions, urging that sanctions be lifted immediately.
</P>
<P>
Butler will continue his talks with Aziz on Sunday, and will leave
here next Monday.

<HEADLINE> ICCPR Firmly Rooted in HK Legal System: Justice Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is firmly rooted in the legal
system of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),
Secretary of Justice Elsie Leung said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Members of the community in Hong Kong are able to challenge
laws and procedures that they consider to be inconsistent with the
ICCPR, and in some cases those challenges have been successful,
Leung told the International Bar Association Conference on the
Worldwide Application of the ICCPR.
</P>
<P>
Leung said since the reunification the ICCPR has been given a
special status in Hong Kong by virtue of Article 39 of the Basic
Law.
</P>
<P>
"The Basic Law provides that provisions of the ICCPR as applied
to Hong Kong shall remain in force and shall be implemented
through the laws of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
"It also provides that the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong
Kong residents shall not be restricted unless as prescribed by
law, and that such restrictions shall not contravene the above
provisions," she said.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing some of the significant legal developments in the
past 12 months, Leung said some of these developments have been
the subject of criticism, but when properly understood in the
context of the resumption of Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong,
they were fully justified and were consistent with the SAR's
obligations under ICCPR.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the amendments to the Societies Ordinance and
Public Order ordinance enacted on July 1, 1997, Leung told
participants of the conference that care was taken to ensure that
restrictions imposed on freedom of association and freedom of
assembly were consistent with the ICCPR.
</P>
<P>
"The amendments were subject to some criticism at the time they
were made. Some feared that they indicated an approach that was
hostile to human rights. That fear was misplaced," Leung said.
</P>
<P>
"The amendments struck the right balance between civil
liberties and social order. They reflected both the ICCPR and the
basic Law and, as I am sure you can see for yourselves, political
activities and demonstrations in Hong Kong remain as lively as
ever," Leung said.
</P>
<P>
To illustrate her point, Leung pointed out that from July 1,
1997 to March 31, 1998, there were over 1,260 public
demonstrations in Hong Kong and 626 societies formed.
</P>
<P>
Turning to court challenges that have been made to some of the
Ordinances enacted by the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC)
such as the immigration legislation which introduced the
Certificate of Entitlement Scheme, Leung said those challenges
have been made possible after Hong Kong's return to China because,
for the first time, Hong Kong now has a detailed written
constitution.
</P>
<P>
These court challenges demonstrated that human rights were
fully protected in the SAR by an independent judiciary, and that
the rule of law was as strong as ever, she said.

HONG KONG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- An extensive public transport
network will go into operation progressively starting from late
this month to get ready for the opening of the new Hong Kong
International Airport at Chek Lap Kok on July 6, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Chan, Deputy Commissioner for Transport, told a press
conference here Saturday: "Different models of public transport
services at different price ranges will be available for airport
bound passengers."
</P>
<P>
Commuters can choose among diversified means of transport,
including railway, bus, taxi and ferry, to get to the new airport,
which is situated on the north of Lantau, an outlying island in
the west of the Hong Kong Island.
</P>
<P>
The public transport network serving the new airport will be
introduced in two main phases, said Chan.
</P>
<P>
The first stage will start on June 22 with the commissioning of
the Tung Chung Line, a 30.5-km railway running from the downtown
district in Hong Kong to the Tung Chung Town in the north of
Lantau. On the same day, bus and taxi services on some routes will
start.
</P>
<P>
On June 30, regular high-speed ferries will begin to sail
between Chek Lap Kok and Tuen Men, in the southwest of the New
Territories.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the second phase will be in tandem with the full
opening of the new airport on July 6, when a purposely-built
railway linking Hong Kong, Kowloon and Chek Lap Kok is scheduled
for operation. The 34-km Airport Express Line can take passengers
to the airport in just 23 minutes, with trains rushing at a speed
of 135 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 franchise buses will be deployed on the routes on the
opening day of the new airport and taxis will be in full service,
according to the official.

<HEADLINE> Negative GNP Growth Reported in Macao in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The growth rate of Macao's gross
national product (GNP) showed a negative growth for a second year
running in 1997, the Macao Daily News said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted official statistics as saying that the GNP growth
was estimated at -0.1 percent last year, comparing a -0.3 percent
growth rate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Macao has suffered from an economic slowdown since 1993. During
the past two years, nearly all its leading economic sectors --
tourism, foreign trade, real estate and finance -- reported
recession.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals to Macao reached 7 million in 1997, down more
than 10 percent from 1996. Although foreign trade recorded growth,
real estate business and finance scored little progress.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign trade in the first quarter of this year
resulted in a 1.8 billion patacas (about 225 million U.S. dollars)
of deficit, compared to a trade surplus last year. Retail sales in
the first three months also dropped 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that Macao's mini-economy is subject to
external factors more than internal ones. The recession in the
past two years was attributed to financial storms in Asia as well
as security problems in Macao.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Reiterates Desire for Talks with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
reiterated Saturday Pakistan's desire for meaningful talks with
India to settle all disputed issues between the two countries,
including Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the reporters here before his departure to
Manchester, the United Kingdom, the prime minister said Pakistan
is always prepared for talks with India to reduce tension in the
south Asian region.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan does not want to remain in a situation of hang up,"
said Sharif. He hoped that India would respond positively to
Pakistan's offer for talks and come forward to resolve the core
issue of Kashmir, which, he said, is a flash point for peace in
the region.
</P>
<P>
"We want to solve the Kashmir issue because we believe that it
would result dangerous arms race," said Sharif, adding that the
nuclear tests have brought the Kashmir issue out of the cold
storage.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said that "first, the world should force
India to stop human rights violations in the held Kashmir, and
second hold plebiscite according to the United Nations
resolutions."
</P>
<P>
During his four-day stay in the United Kingdom, Sharif,
accompanied by Information Minister Mushahid Hussain and Minister
of State for Water and Power Haleem Siddique, will meet overseas
Pakistanis and address meetings at London and Manchester.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Blamed Over Tehran Mayor's Corrupt Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- As factional struggles intensified in
the country, Iranian Former President Hashemi Rafsanjani was once
again targeted by the conservatives over the corrupt case of the
suspended Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi.
</P>
<P>
"From the legal point of view, the superiors of the Tehran mayor
are also guilty of breaking the law," local daily Iran News on
Saturday quoted Majlis (parliament) deputy Ali Zadsar Jirofti as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that Karbaschi's superiors, particularly Rafsanjani, should
have stood up to Karbaschi and stopped the mayor's violations of the
law. But regretfully Rafsanjani encouraged Karbaschi in stead of
stopping him, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Jirofti did not specify how Rafsanjani encouraged
Karbaschi, who is under an open trial on corrupt charges.
</P>
<P>
In April, another conservative Majlis deputy Ahmad Rasoulinejad
strongly lashed out at Rafsanjani for defending Karbaschi, warning
that he would release documents to show the involvement of
Rafsanjani's relatives in Karbaschi's case.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, chairman of the powerful arbitrating body the State
Expediency Council, openly defended Karbaschi, blaming the factional
political row over the case as a "bitter" experience for the country
and the Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was detained on April 4 by the conservative judiciary on
embezzlement charges but was released after an 11-day imprisonment
upon an order from the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei following
an appeal by President Mohammad Khatami and intervention by
Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The mayor's case provoked a white-hot political struggle between
the conservatives and the moderates. The moderates accused their
rivals of undermining the government of Khatami while the
conservatives lashed out at the moderates for abusing freedom and
democracy.
</P>
<P>
The judiciary started an open trial on the suspended mayor on
June 7. Karbaschi rejected all accusations as "baseless," saying
that "I never stole a single rial."
</P>
<P>
However, Jirofti stressed that Karbaschi should be considered a
lawbreaker who tried to bypass the basic institutions of democracy,
saying Karbaschi "ignored the law and considered his own opinions
and judgments to be the law."
</P>
<P>
Iranian legal experts said that Karbaschi could face five years
in prison, a ban on holding government office, the return of funds
allegedly embezzled and a fine equivalent to twice the sum embezzled
if he was found guilty.

<HEADLINE> Pak Expresses Disappointment over G-8 Ministerial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Saturday expressed
its disappointment over a G-8 Ministerial Communique issued Friday
in London, saying it is "retrogressive and certainly counter
productive."
</P>
<P>
"The G-8 decision to work for a postponement in consideration
of loans in the Worlk Bank and other financial institutions is
retrogressive and certainly counter productive," said an official
statement issued Saturday afternoon, although it said the G-8
Ministerial Communique contains some positive elements.
</P>
<P>
"The policy to punish in order to push the non-proliferation
agenda will not succeed, " said the statement, "It is unrealistic
and based on a fictional notion of the realities in South Asia."
</P>
<P>
It said that "the G-8 should have, instead, laid greater
emphasis on strengthening of peace and stability in South Asia
with a pledge of continuous and active engagement in a wide
ranging political process for resolution of the core dispute of
Jammu and Kashmir which is the sole root-cause of tension and
conflict in South Asia as well as promotion of nuclear and
conventional restraint and stabilization measures between Pakistan
and India."
</P>
<P>
The G-8 should have recognized that for 50 years "the bilateral
dialogue between Pakistan and India has produced no results," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Effective international engagement is a sine qua non for
initiating and sustaining a meaningful process of peace and
rapprochement in South Asia," it said.
</P>
<P>
While making demands for adoption of non-proliferation
measures, the G-8 has not taken note of the positive steps
Pakistan has taken in this regard including the declaration of a
unilateral moratorium, the offer of a regional test ban treaty
with India as well as reaffirmation that Pakistan will not export
nuclear technology to any country or entity, the statement further
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement also said that Pakistan welcomes all
international efforts, whether by P-5 or G-8, to arrest the
deteriorating security situation in South Asia.

<HEADLINE> Namibian Court to Try Apartheid-Era Killers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Namibia
have agreed in principle to try apartheid-era killers who
operated in Namibia on the eve of that country's independence in
1989, the Saturday Star newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
South African Minister of Justice Dullah Omar and his Namibian
counterpart Ngarikuthuke Tjiriange met Friday to establish a
contact group to coordinate efforts to get to the bottom of
apartheid-era crimes committed in Namibia.
</P>
<P>
The group comprises Namibia's Solicitor-General Hans Heyman
and on the South African side, Transvaal Attorney-General Jan
D'Oliveira and Omar's chief consultant Mebard Rwelamira.
</P>
<P>
Omar said the group would focus on speeding up the conclusion
of about 12 cases which still remained unresolved.
</P>
<P>
One of these involves the murder of Anton Lubowski, a
prominent member of the South West African People's Organization
(SWAPO), who was shot dead in September 1989.
</P>
<P>
The SWAPO has been the ruling party of Namibia since the
country won its independence from the South African rule in March
1990.

<HEADLINE> Leopard Killed in W. Kenya to Save Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Five young ethnic Maasai warriors
living in western Kenya killed a marauding leopard after a
five-hour fight Friday to save a 50-year-old man who was attacked
by the wild animal, local press reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Silili ole Olofikany of Nairasirara village in Narok said he
was going to his shamba (a small farm ) when he saw a leopard
kill two of his goats.
</P>
<P>
Trying to save the rest of his herd, Olofikany fought the
animal only with a rungu (knobkerrie) and a sword for more than
one hour, and suffered from serious injuries all over his body.
</P>
<P>
The five young men came to his rescue after hearing his
screams.
</P>
<P>
Using spears and metal-studded rungus, the young men killed
the leopard, skinned it and took the mutilated skin to the Kenya
Wildlife Service (KWS) warden at Ewaso Nyiro.
</P>
<P>
A brother of the injured man, Sarun ole Olofikany, said they
would kill all the wildlife in the area since KWS has failed to
drive them off.
</P>
<P>
They complained they had lost more than 100 goats to leopards
that have been roaming the area, forcing parents to escort their
children to and from school.
</P>
<P>
The villagers claimed they have not had a good harvest for a
number of years following destruction of food crops by elephants,
buffalos, zebras and antelopes.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he said, their livestock continued being
killed by lions, leopards and cheetahs.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of the wild animals in Kenya live out of
sanctuaries and game parks, leading to quite frequent conflicts
between human beings and animals who have to fight for their own
survival.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Lowers Cash Ratio Rule for Local Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
has announced a lower cash ratio requirement for commercial banks
to be effective from July 1.
</P>
<P>
Reuben Marambii, the chief banking manager, reduced the cash
ratio requirement from 15 percent to 14 percent Friday, the Daily
Nation newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The cash ratio is the percentage of total deposits that banks
and financial institutions must deposit with the central bank.
The cash attracts no interest, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Banks are required to observe the cash ratio rule and
forwarding the money to CBK. This is one of the tools used by
CBK to check money supply and inflation.
</P>
<P>
In a circular to commercial banks and financial institutions,
Marambii also reduced the daily cash ratio rule from 12 percent
to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
A lower cash ratio requirement was announced by Finance
Minister Simeon Nyachae when presenting the budget for 1998/99
(July 1/June 30) to parliament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The reduction in cash ratio should assist commercial banks in
their effort to bring down interest rates," said Marambii.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates on 91-day Treasury bills stand at over 25
percent, with commercial banks' base rates averaging around 28
percent.
</P>
<P>
In the money market, the Shilling hardly moved despite strong
inflows from coffee and tea exports as dealers waited for details
of the budget proposals.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said while Nyachae put focus on achieving a balanced
budget in the 1998/99 fiscal year, his comments on reducing
domestic debt and improving infrastructure and efficiency of the
public sector will be welcomed by the business community.
</P>
<P>
The minister said CBK is to introduce a two-year maturity
Treasury Bond with interest payable semi-annually, which will
carry a tax waiver and amnesty for investors.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange market was expected to remain calm as
analysts and corporations digest the long-term implications of
the budget.
</P>
<P>
CBK posted a Shilling mean rate of 61.19 against one U.S.
Dollar Friday, slightly weaker compared to 61.11 Thursday. It
posted a buying rate of 61 Shillings to the Dollar and a selling
rate of 61.33 Shillings.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Govt Accepts Blame for Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Vice President Specioza
Kazibwe said the government takes the blame for the June 8
massacre in which some 80 students were burnt to death by rebels
of Allied Democratic Forces (ADF).
</P>
<P>
Kazibwe made the statement when addressing a rally Friday at
the Kichwamba National Technical College in Kabarole district,
west Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, the government takes the blame for this massacre. There
was a problem with the institution that is constitutionally
supposed to protect all Ugandans. But this problem will be
rectified and the people should not lose hope," the vice
president was quoted by Saturday's New Vision daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Our children have been massacred, but not in vain. Their
blood should give us the strength to continue and accomplish the
struggle for the total liberation of the country from the
ruthless ADF and LRA (Lord Resistance Army)," she added.
</P>
<P>
As a counter measure against the rebels now active in the west
and north Uganda, she said, the government will train and arm
more home guards to protect people in the war-disturbed areas.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has increased its defense budget by 26 percent in the
coming fiscal year to boost the capacity of the army and end the
insurgency.
</P>
<P>
She called upon all Ugandans to join hands in fighting their
common enemy. She also promised to mobilize resources and assist
the bereaved families through the social welfare ministry.

<HEADLINE> World Cup hke -- Old vs New: Theme of Argentina-Japan Clash    by Cao Li </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOULOUSE, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Argentina will on Sunday face the
challenge from Japan in the Group H opener between the traditional
South American powerhouse and the Asian debutants at the World Cup
finals.
</P>
<P>
Three-time winners Argentina are this time without the magic
elements from striker Diego Maradona, who brought disgrace rather than
glory to his motherland with a humiliating doping ban halfway down the
last World Cup in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the missing of their star striker Gabriel Batistuta
from Friday's training session reflected coach Daniel Passarella's
discretion in preserving their striking power.
</P>
<P>
The Fiorentina player hurt his left ankle in a practice game on
Thursday but Passarella explained his omission "was just a
precaution."
</P>
<P>
"Batistuta will play against Japan," said Passarella, a member of
champion team which won the trophy in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Batistuta, or "Batigol" for nickname, is the top Argentine scorer
with 38 goals and his fitness would be the key to success here.
</P>
<P>
Another striker to pound the Japanese defence on Sunday will be
nimble dribbler Ariel Ortega, known in his hometown as "Little
Donkey."
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Japan which qualified for the finals for the
first time after 44 years of attempt, would have an up-hill battle
relying on the talents of Masashi Nakayama.
</P>
<P>
Nakayama, scorer of an incredible four successive hat-tricks for
Jubilo Iwata in the J-League this spring, will be fed ammunitions from
a Japanese midfield organized by 21-year-old Hidetoshi Nakata.
</P>
<P>
But coach Takeshi Okada's main injury concern is experienced
defender and skipper Masami Ihara, who also suffered from an ankle
trouble and is expected to recover in time.
</P>
<P>
Okada knows that a lengthy horror story will be shown before the
Japanese goal if the team's defence crumbles amid blasts from a much
stronger Argentine offence but he would have no choice but fielding a
mixture of veterans and new faces.
</P>
<P>
The lack of crowd support in the Stade Municipal will be another
problem as thousands of Japanese fans arrived in France only to find
their travel agencies could not provide tickets.
</P>
<P>
The ticketless Japanese supporters will only be able to watch the
game live on a giant screen at the 5,000-seat Palais des Sports here,
arranged as an emergency measure by the local government.

<HEADLINE> Gas Pipeline Salvage Work Begins in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The full-fledged salvage operation
for a 4.8-kilometer gas pipeline that collapsed Tuesday started
Saturday, press reports said.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline was anchored underneath the cantilever slab of the
Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge in Tangail district, 80 kilometers
northwest of Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
The bridge, the longest in Bangladesh and 11th longest in the
world, is being built at a cost of 900 million U.S. dollars. It
has been scheduled to be inaugurated on June 23.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place early Thursday when water ran through
the pipeline for leakage testing. Armymen have been sent to the
bridge site to re-install the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The amount of loss in the crash was initially estimated at 90
million taka (about 1.96 million U.S. dollars), according to site
engineers and experts.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Hyundai Company, contractor for the bridge, and
Gas Transmission Company of Petrobangla (Bangladesh) were
responsible for the laying of the gas pipeline along the bridge.

<HEADLINE> . mee061302hke -- Egypt, Libya Deny Report of Attack on Gaddafi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian and Libyan officials have
denied a report that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had been injured
in a failed attempt on his life.
</P>
<P>
The official Libyan news agency JANA Friday described the report of
an assassination attempt as "lies and vile allegation."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency's Arabic service
quoted an unnamed senior Egyptian security source as denying
Thursday's media report.
</P>
<P>
"The report is baseless and could be aimed at harming the firm
fraternal ties between the two brotherly countries and their
developing integration," the source said.
</P>
<P>
A foreign news agency report quoted travellers arriving in the
northwestern Egyptian town of Marsa Matrouh as saying Gaddafi had
scrapped a visit to Egypt earlier this month because of an attack in
the Mediterranean city of Benghazi in which he was slightly wounded
and many of his bodyguards were hurt.
</P>
<P>
Tripoli-based diplomats said on Thursday they had heard nothing
about any such attack, according to the Egyptian Mail daily Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan leader has suspended his week-long visit to Egypt slated
early this month, without giving reasons. But Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak told reporters this week that Gaddafi has a mild tonsil and is
expected to make the trip in 10 to 15 days.

<HEADLINE> TAZARA Managing Director Reinstated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Kingstone Mkandawire, suspended
managing director of the Tanzanian-Zambian railway (TAZARA) has
been reinstated after intervention of the Zambian government.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Saturday quoted Transport and Communications
Minister Anosh Chipawa as saying in Ndola, northern Zambia Friday
that he has instructed his permanent secretary to write to the
Tanzanian minister concerned declaring the suspension null and
void.
</P>
<P>
Mkandawire was suspended last week by the Tanzanian government
for alleged mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Chipawa said the Tanzanian authorities did not consult the
Zambian government when taking the action.
</P>
<P>
He said it is legally the responsibility of the Zambian
government to employ the managing director and by the same token
to suspend or fire the director if any allegations against the
director are proven true.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania employs the deputy managing director of the
1,860-kilometer railway built by Chinese 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Chipawa said a board meeting will be held in Tanzania next
week to discuss a lot of issues including Mkandawire's case.
</P>
<P>
He said that ever since Mkandawire, who was a former Zambia
railway general manager for the northern region, was employed,
TAZARA's operations have improved a lot.
</P>
<P>
"He is very efficient and we don't know his weaknesses and if
the allegations are proved true then Zambia will take action," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania accused Mkandawire of spending money lavishly on
unworthwhile projects, making irrelevant trips, administer the
company with an iron fist and practising nepotism.
</P>
<P>
Mkandawire took over from another Zambian in a major shake-up
last year.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Teenager Confesses to Killing 11 Family  Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A 19-year-old student has confessed to
the murder of 12 people, including his parents, nine of his family
members and one friend, in the most horrifying crime in the history of
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian police declared here late Friday night that Sa'eed Amin
Qashash confessed to the killings at his house in Bnyat neighborhood,
south of Amman, on Wednesday, saying his father had pressed him too
had over passing his high school examinations.
</P>
<P>
Amman police chief Brigadier Hisham Ensour told Jordan's official
media that the 12 bodies of those killed were recovered from the
basement of Qashash's family's two-storey building Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Qashash failed to pass his final examinations at high school in
1997, expected to fail again this year and thus decided to kill his
family members "because they threatened to kick him out of the house"
if he failed again, Ensour quoted Qashash as telling the
investigators.
</P>
<P>
Qashash told the police that he had stolen his father's pistol
one week before the crime date and hid it in his room.
</P>
<P>
The boy killed the victims one after another, put all the bodies
in the basement and sealed its door and windows with bricks and
cement, according to the police statement.
</P>
<P>
Later, the teenager submitted himself to the police, confessed to
the murders and handed over the weapon he used.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's serial killing has been the worst one of its kind in
Jordan, according to the police.
</P>
<P>
At high schools in Jordan, one has to pass the final examinations
before he can get a graduation diploma and then take the test for
college entranced. About 10 per cent of the high school students fail
in their final examinations each year, according to official figures.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has set up its first
company to handle problems concerning the recruitment of foreign
workers, who take a chunk share of the country's labor force.
</P>
<P>
Al-Suleiman &AMP; Al-Suwaid Manpower Service Company, based in Riyadh,
will pay visa fees and return tickets of expatriate workers while
adopting an insurance scheme, according to Saudi newspaper Arab News
available here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad AL-Suleiman, co-founder of the company, said they intend
to help resolve problems facing private recruitment offices while
recruiting manpower from certain countries.
</P>
<P>
He said about 30 percent of housemaids and servants in Saudi Arabia
come from Sri Lanka. About 35 percent of them do not complete their
contract period, incurring losses on the recruiting offices.
</P>
<P>
Al-Suleiman estimated the losses being suffered by local offices at
about 4,300 U.S. dollars for each visa as no guarantees are given to
secure their rights from the expatriates' side.
</P>
<P>
About Al-Hamoud, director general of Al-Hamoud Recruit Office,
described the new company as a "first step" in the way of promoting
recruitment services. "The market needs such a company to guarantee
the rights of private recruitment offices," he said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has a population of 18 million, including 6 million
foreign. Only 7 percent of workers in private sector are nationals.

MARSEILLE, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of French fans took to the
streets here Friday night to celebrate the hosts' victory in the
opening game as the country returned to the World Cup finals after 12
years of absence.
</P>
<P>
"It was the Marseille players who won the game," cried a fan waving

He was amid the cheering crowds that celebrated with cars' horn
blaring and flag waving from a train of cars in this soccer-mad city.

Fans here were apparently pleased by the fact that two of three
goals in the 3-0 win over South Africa were scored by players from the

Marseille striker Christophe Duggarry put the French on the
scoreboard with a header on a first-half corner kick delivered by

GUANGZHOU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China's Guangdong Province is
doing more to develop forestry resources overseas, and recently
signed a letter of intent with Malaysia to help it reproduce rare
species of trees, Forestry Department sources say.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong began this cooperation overseas early in 1984 when it
reached an agreement with Macao on nearly 170 hectares of forest
area for ring roads. The project was completed in 1988, and gave
Guangdong about 4.39 million Hong Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
Another effort was by the Guangdong Yuzhu Forestry Products
Group and a Hong Kong company in 1995 to cultivate 150,000
hectares of tropical forest and 57 million cubic meters of timber
reserves in Surinam.
</P>
<P>
The two companies have now developed 5,000 cubic meters of
timber, and shipped them back to China for use.
</P>
<P>
The province is known for its forestry technology and has begun
to export equipment and technology for forestry applications. The
provincial Academy of Forestry Science reached an agreement in
1994 with Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City on exporting saplings of fine
and helping plant eucalyptus and other trees.
</P>
<P>
The province has more than a dozen forestry cooperation
projects overseas, sources say.

<HEADLINE> WB Helps Zambia's Copper Mines to Pay off Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has injected 80
million U.S. Dollars in Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM)
in the past month to help the mines pay off its international and
local debt prior to the privatization of its assets.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Saturday quoted Mines Minister Syamukayumbu
Syamujaye as saying Friday that 50 million Dollars was released
last month while another 30 million Dollars has recently been
released to help ZCCM decongest its debt stock as negotiations
for its privatization continue.
</P>
<P>
The new debt that is being accrued by ZCCM which used to cover
more than 90 percent of the country's foreign exchange earnings
will have to be included in the value for which the mines will
eventually be sold, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the continued accrual of debt by the state-owned
conglomerate is of concern to the government and it is therefore
important that its assets are sold off as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Syamujaye announced that the Nkana and Nchanga mines, two
largest ones registering about 65 percent of ZCCM's copper
production, are now scheduled to be sold off by the end of July
after the failure of the initial privatization talks with the
Kafue Consortium, while the remaining assets of ZCCM will be sold
off by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Kafue Consortium, the sole bidders for ZCCM's Nkana and
Nchanga mines, has finally collapsed following the decision by
its members to abandon the project after 16-month long unfruitful
negotiations with the Zambian government.
</P>
<P>
Mining analysts here, however, feel that mines should be
quickly disposed of because the mines' current one million
Dollars per day operational costs has become a strain on the
national revenue.

Siemens is now the largest German investor which employs 3,200
people here. The Matsushita Electric Industrial of Japan has 10
operations and employs more than 12,000 workers in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Describing manufacturing and services as the country's "two
engines of growth," the minister said the Economic and Development
Board has launched a program called Industry 21, which targets a
25 percent of manufacturing's share in GDP by 2010 and a 6 percent
share of manufacturing services in GDP in the period which will
double the figure of 3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the growing importance of manufacturing services
in developing a knowledge-based economy, he said: "We will no
longer be able to compete in simple assembly line production. We
must instead compete on research and development, product design,
product development, process engineering, testing services, market
research and so on."
</P>
<P>
Since Singapore launched in 1993 a manufacturing-promoting
program called Manufacturing 2000. The city-country has pursued a
policy to build up manufacturing as a key pillar of its economy
and as a result manufacturing now contributes about 23 percent of
its GDP and has an employment share of about 23 percent, according
to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the country is facing new emerging challenges as
the new century is nearing, the minister said: "Our strategy must
therefore be to continue moving up the value chain and finding new
ways to add value in Manufacturing."
</P>
<P>
Of the 15,000 job to be created each year, he said, at least
two-thirds should be for knowledge and skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
The minister affirmed that Singapore will strive to diversify
its economy to a greater extent, to build up world-class
capabilities, to promote a culture of innovation, to enhance
continuing education and training and to strengthen links with all
parts of the world so as to make the Industry 21 program a
success.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Transit Point for Asia Drug Trafficking: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is a transit point for
narcotic drugs from mainly the Asian sub-continent, Kenyan
Cabinet Minister in the Office of the President Marsden Madoka
has said.
</P>
<P>
Drug problems in the east African country are no different
from that of some main narcotic consuming countries, he was
quoted Saturday by the East African Standard newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Madoka termed Kenya's geographical position as strategic for
drug source countries, adding that the state's effective
communications network only serve to make it the ideal conduit
for international drug runners.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenya, a supporter of the African Common Position on
Drug Control, has taken measures to cope with escalating drug
related problems at the national level, he said at the 20th
special session of the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
</P>
<P>
The country has already established an Anti-Narcotics Unit as
well as a permanent inter-ministerial drug coordinating committee
to harmonize, monitor and evaluate all drug control measures
nationwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
Establishing a national crime research center last year and
enacting the narcotic drugs and psychotrophic substances control
act in 1994 were also among the measures.
</P>
<P>
The act incorporates various provisions of the U.N.
conventions on narcotic drugs and psychotrophic substances.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Kenya is working on the ratification of the
convention on Psychotrophic substances of 1971, which would
compliment the already ratified single Convention on Narcotic
Drugs of 1961, and the Convention against Illicit Traffic in
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotrophic substances of 1988.
</P>
<P>
Madoka added that Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania have drawn up a
protocol in common efforts to combat drug trafficking in the east
African region.

<HEADLINE> Tough Rules Facing Kenyan Bankers: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Finance Minister Simeon
Nyachae has said bank directors and senior managers will in
future be expected to borrow money from the banks they manage at
commercial rates and other tougher rules.
</P>
<P>
The move, which include amendments to the Banking Act, is
aimed at further protecting depositor's funds and fostering a
sound banking system, he was quoted by Saturday's East African
Standard newspaper as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The changes also require owners and managers of financial
institutions to ensure sound corporate governance in all their
institutions. However, no details were given as to how this was
to be achieved.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that the Central Bank of Kenya now has
the managerial capacity necessary to monitor the local banking
sector.
</P>
<P>
The asset quality of banks will be scrutinized so that the
problem of large non-performing assets, which results from poor
credit procedures, is effectively addressed.
</P>
<P>
He announced that no bank or company will be allowed to issue
commercial paper or corporate bond unless they are rated by an
independent rating agency.
</P>
<P>
However, immediate implementation of this measure will be
difficult given that there is still no independent rating agency
in the country.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the minister presented to parliament the 1998/99
budget aimed at reviving the country's battled economy, and this
also sent a signal of an era of belt-tightening.
</P>
<P>
"The 1998/99 budget... reflects two principles that can be
summarized in a few words -- fiscal restraint and a balanced
budget," he said in the draft budget.
</P>
<P>
The budget also announced plans to introduce longer term bonds
with an attractive lower interest rate in the market.
</P>
<P>
The first, a two-year maturity bond will be an amnesty bond of
those who with undeclared tax income may buy the bond from now
until December 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Although the minister did not indicate the interest rate the
bond will attract, it is likely that this will be similar to the
current floating rate bond whose interest is pegged to the 91-day
Treasury Bill rate.
</P>
<P>
This interest will be paid half-yearly and will be subject to
15 percent withholding tax.
</P>
<P>
The other bond will be a low denominated bond with a fixed
rate of interest aimed at small savers. This is expected to
increase competition for government debt and lower interest
rates.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Initiatives to Improve Oceans' Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 12 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton of the
United States on Friday extended the current bans on offshore oil
drilling in California and most of America's other coastal states
for 10 more years to help improve the ocean's health.
</P>
<P>
Oil spills from offshore drilling can spoil the coasts, causing
not just the death of marine life, but the destruction of the
fragile ecosystem, said the president on the closing day of the
country's first national ocean conference.
</P>
<P>
The president had been seeking a balance between industry needs
and the environment, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
The ban, which continues a previous 10-year moratorium signed
by President George Bush in 1990, prohibits any new oil and gas
drilling in federal waters off California, Oregon, Washington,
southwest Florida, New England, southern Alaska and the
mid-Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
There are 28 oil platforms in the waters along California's
coastline, all built between late 1950s and early 1080s. They
account for about four percent of America's yearly oil production.
</P>
<P>
Other initiatives include a ban on the sale and import of
Atlantic swordfish weighing less than 33 pounds, and an
800-million-dollar plan to deepen the country's harbors.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 scientists, policymakers, environmentalists and
business leaders attended the conference in Monterey, California.

<HEADLINE> New Gold Mine Commissioned in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Anglo American Zimbabwe Company
has commissioned a new gold mine in Nkayi of west Zimbabwe, The
Herald daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Production at the gold mine, the company's second largest one
in the country, whose present capacity is 30,000 ounces of gold
per month, is expected to rise to 40,000 ounces a month.
</P>
<P>
Anglo American was planning to become the pre-eminent producer
of gold in Zimbabwe, with a target of some 300,000 ounces to 10
tons per annum in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony Friday, Nicky Oppenheimer,
deputy chairman of Anglo American Corporation of South Africa,
said, "We need to recognize that the world is shrinking in size
as communication becomes easier, finance becomes more mobile and
trade barriers around the world begin to fall."
</P>
<P>
"To meet these challenges, we as a country and a corporation
need to make the most of our advantages and minii our
disadvantages as we compete in the global playing field," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Oppenheimer, the new mine was a show of the
confidence they had in Zimbabwe's economy. He urged governments
in the southern African region to continue improving the
investment climates in their countries.
</P>
<P>
Anglo American Corporation operates a number of mines in
Zimbabwe while it has announced plans to open a 77-million-U.S.
Dollars platinum mine, which is the country's second largest.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's currency Rand
sank to a new record low against the U.S. Dollar Friday despite a
Reserve Bank move to shore up local markets by cutting the repo
rate to 17 percent from 17.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In late trade the Rand was at 5.3 to the Dollar, a loss of 44
cents in the year, after briefly touching a low of 5.34. At its
strongest level Friday, it was 5.225, local media reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Trevor Manuel told officials from the Reserve
Bank and commercial banks that there was no crisis in domestic
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
"The point was raised and accepted that the changes here in
South Africa have not reached crisis point," Manuel told a news
conference in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
He said all role players were committed to ensuring price
stability, and the government did not want to see unnecessary
changes to the macro-economic environment.
</P>
<P>
Referring to banks' decisions to increase lending rates,
Manuel said the government was concerned about any move that
would dampen economic growth prospects.
</P>
<P>
First National Bank announced a rate hike of two percentage
points Friday following similar move by another leading
commercial bank, ABSA. Other banks are expected to follow suit
soon.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Troops Clash With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June (Xinhua) -- Philippine government troops and Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels clashed Friday in Buldon,
Maguindanao, the Southern Philippines, but so far no casualties
have been reported.
</P>
<P>
The official Philippine News Agency reported Saturday that the
incident was the latest in the series of sporadic encounters in
the area though the government and the MILF signed a cessation of
hostilities agreement last July.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that Friday's fighting occurred at the time the
Quick Reaction Team (QRT), a peace body formed by the government
and MILF to look into violations of the ceasefire agreement, was
investigating related incidents in the provinces of Sultan Kudarat
and Zamboanga del Sur.
</P>
<P>
Speaking over a radio station, Al Haj. Murad, deputy MILF
military chief, claimed that government troops belonging to the
39th Infantry Battalion (IB) fired 10 rounds of 105 mm howitzers
at their perimeter defense in Camp Abubakar while pursuing a group
of armed men in the area.
</P>
<P>
Murad said they were forced to fire back at the soldiers with a
number of 81 and 60 mm mortar shells "as Abubakar was threatened."
</P>
<P>
The exchange of fires lasted one hour, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the group being pursued by the 39th IB were bandits
responsible for the series of cattle rustlings in the area and not
members of the MILF.
</P>
<P>
"It so happened that they (bandits) ran towards our direction
leading soldiers to suspect they were MILFs," the rebel leader
explained.
</P>
<P>
Murad vowed to include and bring up the recent incident to the
government - MILF peace panel during their next meeting later this
year.

<HEADLINE> 32-Year-Old Panda Critically Ill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- One of the three eldest giant
pandas in China, 32-year-old Zhuzhu, became critically ill in
southwest China's Guiyang Province and doctors from hospitals are
drafting measures for rescuing the panda.
</P>
<P>
The male giant panda caught a cold on June 7. He had a running
nose and was even reluctant to take his most favorite food --
bamboo and other food.
</P>
<P>
The Guiyang Qianling Park Zoo, where the panda is housed, has
established an emergency group to rescue the aged and weak
panda. The zoo has contacted Chengdu Panda Base where Zhuzhu came
from to seek help.
</P>
<P>
The panda has received injections and infusion of fluid. But,
it did not respond to the treatment well and only had a small
amount of urine after massage in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Five experts on respiratory tract diseases, cardiovascular
diseases and kidney diseases from Guiyang Medical College have
made an overall health check-up for the sick panda.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said Zhuzhu's cold was caused by a sudden drop of
temperature in Guiyang, the provincial capital city.
</P>
<P>
They said the panda is too old and the functions of its organs
fail to operate normally, adding Zhuzhu's life is in danger if its
conditions do not make a turn for the better.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, a wild giant panda can only live for 16
years, while the average age of giant pandas in zoos is 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The eldest giant panda in China is 36-year-old Dudu at Wuhan
Zoo in central China's Hubei Province.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir: Malaysia Welcomes FDIs, Not Hot money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia welcomes more
foreign direct investments (FDIs), but not "hot money" or
speculative funds, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has regarded genuine foreign direct investors as
permanent contributors to Malaysia's industrial development, he
said at the opening of a cement factory in Bukit Sagu near
Kuantan, about 260 kilometers east from here.
</P>
<P>
"We always treat them as special guests of the country. They
are different from the other kind of investors, especially on the
stock market, who come and go," he was quoted by the Malaysian
national news agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
"As for hot money, keep it hot elsewhere," Mahathir said,
adding "I know that will affect the recovery of the economy but I
want a healthy economic recovery. We do not want a recovery that
is impermanent."
</P>
<P>
He said those who invested in the stock market were not
permanent investors.
</P>
<P>
However, he said: "They are still welcome provided they invest
for the dividends."
</P>
<P>
He said "Hot money" investors had dumped their shares when
prices were riding high to gain hefty profits and this had had a
damaging effect on local companies, local investors and the
country.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir assured that all necessary incentives would be
provided for foreign direct investors, but hot money is not what
Malaysia welcome.
</P>
<P>
He said that "for the foreign direct investors, we are prepared
to go out of the way to welcome them. Their contribution towards
Malaysia's industrial development is very valuable."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the country was now facing problems because of
the depreciation of the ringgit and the fall in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
He said that when "hot money" wove in and out of the stock
market, it would leave a trail of destruction.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir was of the view that foreigners must realize that
investments in the country must benefit not only them but the host
country as well.
</P>
<P>
He said although the country had stipulated that foreign
interests could take up to 30 percent equity in local companies,
some of them had even exceeded 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way we can track them because that is something
that comes very fast. And when they dump the shares to take up
capital gains, local shareholders are left to bear the costs," he
added.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Karl Malone hit 17 of 27 shots
from the field and scored 39 points to help the Utah Jazz edge the
Chicago Bulls 83-81 in NBA Game 5, narrowing the series gap to 2-3
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Antoine Carr hit three vital baskets of his 12 points in the
final stage to smash the Bulls's hope of landing the sixth
championship tonight.
</P>
<P>
The next two games will go to Jazz's home court with Game 6
starting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Toni Kukoc scored 30 points, including a big three with 5.5
seconds to go, his effort put the Bulls 81-82 behind the Jazz, but
with another point from Utah in the final second, the Bulls failed
to create a miracle to turn the table.
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan added 28 points for the Bulls, but Scottie
Pippen failed to rise on the crucial occasion, only making six
points from his 2-of-16 shots.
</P>
<P>
Malone finished with a series-high points, 17 in the third
quarter. "We just want to win one game at a time. It's not a
victory of myself, the teamwork is always very important. We have
got a good chance now. I am happy to bring the series back to our
home floor," Malone said after the triumph.
</P>
<P>
The Jazz were dragging 36-30 at halftime after Malone elbowed
Dennis Rodman to draw a techinical foul.
</P>
<P>
But Malone nailed the first three shots of the third quarter to
help the Jazz turn the tide for the first time before winding up
the period 59-55.
</P>
<P>
When the Jazz surged ahead, they never looked back and kept a
small margin deep into the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
If Utah win Game 6, a decisive seventh game would be played
there next Wednesday.

<P>
COLOMBO, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's state media including
print media will be banned from carrying advertisements of alcohol
and tobacco from January 1, next year, according to media ministry
sources here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said President Chandrika Kumaratunga has directed
the ministry to instruct all state media including print media
not to accept advertisements of alcohol and tobacco from January
1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The president said in a letter to Media Minister Mangala
Samaraweera that "my attention has been drawn to the promotion of
alcohol and tobacco use via the media, through advertising, and
through portrayals in teledramas. I have been informed that such
promotion is becoming more common in recent months especially in
the electronic media, both in government owned and privately owned
radio and television channels."
</P>
<P>
There is an unacceptable situation in the country, where the
democratic and open-minded approach of the government towards the
media is being used to achieve commercial gains by promoting
products that are known to cause tremendous social, economic and
health harm in the country, the president said.

<P>
DHAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's first off-shore
gasfield, Sangu Gasfield, on Friday went into commercial
production and started delivering gas to the national gas grid,
according to reports reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Located in the Bay of Bengal, the gasfield has been developed
with a total cost of about 300 million U.S. dollars by the
Scotland-based Cairn Energy PLC along with the U.S. Halliburton
and the British-based Shell companies, having 56.25, 25 and 18.75
percent shares respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Cairn Energy and Shell struck the gas reserve at Sangu,
some 5 kilometers off the port city of Chittagong, in February
1996 under a production-sharing contract for the hydrocarbon block
16 of the country.
</P>
<P>
The gasfield is anticipated to produce up to 160 million
standard cubic feet of gas per day during the first 6 to 9 months
and will then stabilize at around 200 million standard cubic feet
of gas per day in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
The gasfield is expected to deliver 20 percent of Bangladesh's
gas production, the reports added.

BANGKOK, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports for May showed
a continued fall for the third consecutive month or a 2.98 percent
drop from the month before, the Customs Department said.
</P>
<P>
The department's Director General Somchainuk Engtrakul said in
a statement received on Saturday that Thailand's exports in May
were worth only 164 billion baht (4.268 billion U.S. dollars), 5
billion baht (125 million dollars) less than April.
</P>
<P>
The 10 exported items which show high potential include
computers, electrical appliances, garments, integrated circuits,
rubber and canned seafood. Rice, jewelry and shrimps showed a
sharp drop.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thailand has benefited from a drop in imports. In
May, imports were valued at 129 billion baht (3.22 billion
dollars), compared with 144 billion baht (3.6 billion dollars) a
month earlier. In dollar terms, the fall was 8.54 percent, while
in baht it was 10.12 percent.
</P>

Consequently, the Customs Department's revenue had dropped due

<HEADLINE> Thai Academics Urged to Help Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda said Friday night that he has asked academics in
the country to propose measures to immunize the Thai economy
against global fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said after meeting with 30 top academics that he had
given them the job as "homework".
</P>
<P>
A special session was held Friday night to allow an exchange of
view-points between the government and academics on how to tackle
the economic crisis hitting Thailand and how to save the country
from a further slump.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said he had taken seven to eight pages of notes on ideas
proposed by the academics and would urgently study them.
</P>
<P>
One of the proposals raised during the meeting was that the
government adopt a more selective policy on saving particular
industries from the crisis instead of desperately trying to keep
all of them afloat.
</P>
<P>
"Under the current situation, the government has to choose
which particular industries it will help sustain. It cannot save
all of them," Somkiat Osotspa, a lecturer from Chulalongkorn
University, said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The academics called on the government to prepare to take
action to cope with a further downturn of the Thai economy in the
next few months.
</P>
<P>
Among the measures the government was advised to take is debt
restructuring, with the help of both the public and private
sectors, according to a TV report Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was also proposed that the government formulate social
measures to inject monetary support into the rural sector to help
strengthen the economy domestically.
</P>
<P>
The academics also cautioned that the government must try all
means to sustain the baht's stability and curb inflation to a
level not too far above 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Thai FM Calls for Review of ASEAN's Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan urged ASEAN to review its "non-interference" policy so as
to play a more constructive role in preventing controversies with
regional implications.
</P>
<P>
He said the "non-interference" principle of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) should not mean that ASEAN
countries should turn a blind eye to the plight of their
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"Lending assistance in time of need even on domestic affairs
should not be interpreted as interference in internal affairs,"
said Surin, quoted by Saturday's Nation newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The minister was speaking on Friday at a seminar held to
commemorate the 49th anniversary of the Political Science
Department at Thammasat University in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps it is time for ASEAN's cherished non-intervention
principle to be modified," Surin said.
</P>
<P>
"Non-interference does not mean that we cannot espouse the
values of our own society, although, of course, we should not try
to impose them on others," he said.
</P>
<P>
When a matter of domestic concern poses a threat to regional
stability, a dose of peer pressure or friendly advice can be
helpful," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said if there was a consensus among the group's members on
the type of situation warranting constructive intervention, the
process should become easier.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that Thailand has expressed interest in
the review of ASEAN's non-intervention principle, which had been
criticized as a pretext for ASEAN not to help end conflicts in
member countries.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Send More Workers Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government called
on recruitment agencies around the country to make a serious
effort to reduce the unemployment problem by sending more workers
abroad, reported The Indonesian Observer Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The government's efforts to curb unemployment could succeed if
recruitment agencies could find more jobs for Indonesians abroad,
director of the country's Recruitment Companies Association Munir
Ahmad said.
</P>
<P>
If more Indonesians are sent to work in other countries, he
said, the amount of foreign revenue coming into the country will
increase substantially.
</P>
<P>
But most recruitment agencies told the newspaper that they
won't be able to help until the government puts an end to the
monopolies controlled by certain agencies.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government failed to meet its target of sending
2.5 million Indonesian workers abroad during the sixth Five-Year
Development Plan (1993-97).
</P>
<P>
As the economic crisis deepens, many Indonesians are now unable
to come up with the funds needed to travel abroad for work.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Manpower Ministry has provided 77.5 billion
rupiah (about 6 million U.S. dollars) for an intensive labor
program that aims to provide employment for those rendered jobless
by the financial crisis and recent riots in Jakarta and other
cities.
</P>
<P>
According to the People's Welfare/Poverty Eradication Ministry,
if the economic crisis persists, the number of people living below
the poverty line in the country is expected to reach 30 million.
</P>
<P>
Before the economic crisis began in mid-1997, only 22 million
of Indonesia's 202 million people were living below the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
The number of poor people in Central Jakarta alone has
increased drastically from 150,000 in 1997 to 300,000 in 1998.
That means about 25 percent of Central Jakarta's 1.2 million
people are now poor.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Tightens Sanctions on Angola's UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
adopted a resolution Friday to impose further sanctions on
Angola's National Union for the Total Independent of Angola
(UNITA) for its failure to fully implement peace obligations.
</P>
<P>
The sanction measures include freezing of funds and financial
resources of UNITA as an organization or of its senior officials
or immediate families and prevention of all official contacts with
the UNITA leadership.
</P>
<P>
They also include prohibiting anyone from importing diamonds
without a certificate of origin from the Angolan government, and
prohibiting the sale of mining equipment and motorized vehicles or
water transportation services to areas the government does not
control.
</P>
<P>
The measures will come into force on June 25 unless the
Security Council decides on the basis of a report by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan that UNITA has fully complied by June
23 with all its relevant obligations.
</P>
<P>
The new sanctions follow those imposed last year to curb
travels by senior UNITA officials and the closing of UNITA offices
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Council members criticized UNITA for delaying in handing over
four regions it controls to the national unity government and
failing to demobilizing its fighters as requested by the 1994
Lusaka Protocol and for attacking government officials and U.N.
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Taking the floor at the Council consultations, Chinese
Ambassador Shen Guofang urged UNITA to heed the demands of the
Angolan people and the international community to completely
comply with its obligations and to achieve national reconciliation
together with the Angolan government.

<HEADLINE> IMF Funds Not Enough If Crisis Spreads: IMF Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) may not be able to provide enough funds if the monetary
crisis which has gripped Southeast Asia and East Asia continued to
spread, local press Saturday quoted an IMF official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe some time in the future, the funds from IMF would not be
sufficient," IMF advisor for the Indonesian government Prabhakar
Narvekar said.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for
Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita here Friday,
Narvekar said the fund for the restoration of the Indonesian
economy will have to be sought by the IMF from its member
countries within the shortest possible time.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the IMF must also treat other equally
important "patients" besides Indonesia, he added.
</P>
<P>
The IMF promised last October to provide 10 billion U.S.
dollars of the 43 billion U.S. dollar bailout fund which the
agency brokered to bail out Indonesia's ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
It initially agreed to disburse the bailout money in 3 billion
U.S. dollar tranches, to make sure that Indonesia remains
committed to the agreed reforms.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia received the first installment of 3 billion U.S.
dollars in November, but the second disbursement of 3 billion U.S.
dollars was delayed and divided into three monthly installments,
each amounting to one billion U.S. dollars, following a failed
attempt by the government to implement the promised reforms.
</P>
<P>
The second one billion U.S. dollar payment, due this month,
will likely be made only next month.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has sent a review team, led by IMF Asia Pacific
director Hubert Neiss, to review Indonesia's economic reform
programs before the IMF board of directors makes a decision
whether to disburse the second one billion U.S. dollar payment.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar expected that the IMF team will finish making its
evaluation later this month so that the IMF can release the funds
desperately needed by Indonesia early next month.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan Friday made an urgent appeal to both sides in
the Georgia-Abkhaz conflict to settle their disputes at the
negotiating table and not through armed confrontation.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, he said tensions in the
Gali sector remain high. He warned that if the situation
escalated further, it would only result in unnecessary human
suffering and more loss of life.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said the Council may wish to consider
redeploying the U.N. Observer Mission in Georgia with a temporary
staff of about 100 military observers.
</P>
<P>
He said he is concerned about the lack of progress in setting
up a meeting in Moscow between Georgia and Abkhaz leaders.
</P>
<P>
The proposed meeting would address the crisis and try to put
the peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
Tension in this area appears to have persisted in spite of the
signing on May 25, 1998 of the protocol on a Cease-fire and
Withdrawal of Armed Formations.

KIEV, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) held their first defense ministerial meeting
Friday at NATO's headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Bizhan, the Ukrainian first deputy defense minister, and
Javier Solana, secretary general of NATO, attended the meeting,
the Press Bureau of the Foreign Ministry of Ukraine said.

<P>
Solana praised the work done by the joint team for Ukrainian
military reform, which was set up recently under a NATO framework.

<HEADLINE> Old Friend Becomes Part of China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people view Clark Johnson,
who most often puffs on a big cigar and sports a fashionable tie,
as a typical American businessman.
</P>
<P>
However, he is much more than simply a successful businessman
in China and on Thursday received the Marco Polo Award, one of the
highest honors the Chinese Government grants to
foreigners. Johnson received the award for his outstanding
contributions to trade and personnel exchanges between the United
States and China.
</P>
<P>
Pier 1 Imports, Johnson's U.S.-based company, has imported
Chinese products valued at over two billion US dollars and has
sponsored experts recruited by Volunteers of America to assist
China's economic development over the years.
</P>
<P>
"We've been here for so long that we are now a part of
it," said Johnson, chairman and CEO of the Texas-based speciality
retail company.
</P>
<P>
Pier 1 Imports initiated business with China in 1975. The
company weathered the ups and downs of the Sino-US relations over
past decades and has never stopped dealing with China.
</P>
<P>
"I think that economic exchanges between the two countries are
far removed from political issues," said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
"The business community in the United States recognizes that
trade and economic relations are of equal importance to the
interests of both countries,
</P>
<P>
"We've worked hard to overcome some of the noise in political
relations (with China)," according to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that President Clinton's upcoming visit to
China will have the same important impact on the Chinese people as
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to the U.S. last fall had on
American citizens.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that strengthening the Sino-U.S. strategic
partnership will create a more positive situation for the Chinese
market and will in turn provide more business opportunities for
U.S. companies in China.
</P>
<P>
Pier 1 Imports currently has 155 suppliers in China, including
a large number of state-owned enterprises. The company regularly
invites personnel from Chinese factories to visit its chain stores
around the world in order to help them gain a greater
understanding of the needs of customers and learn more about the
international market. Related efforts are designed to help Chinese
factories improve competitiveness of their products.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who has traveled to almost every part of China, said
the company often purchases woven products from one particular
village. He said that seeing how grandmothers, mothers and
children in the village work together for a prosperous future
makes him feel he has made a truly beneficial contribution.

<TEXT>
<P>
He expressed his belief that China has witnessed more changes
over the past more than 10 years than recorded over past 1,000 years
combined.
</P>
<P>
The company had to search for suppliers when first arriving in
China. Now, however, many Chinese enterprises approach the company
which has gained fame throughout China.
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the Chinese Government has done an excellent job
in effort to encourage enterprises to increase exports.
</P>
<P>
His company has benefited greatly from trade with China. Its
imports of furniture, utensils for both dining and entertainment,
bedroom and bathroom accessories, and handmade arts and crafts
from China have increased at an annual rate and now account for 15
percent growth rate for the companies global sales. Imports of
metal furniture have grown by over 100 percent annually in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
China is the company's largest supplier, with Chinese products
accounting for 32 percent of total sales. Chinese merchandise have
entered homes in many other countries through the company's 770
chain stores worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Johnson said Chinese merchandise have a excellent reputation
for good quality and Chinese workers are known for their
entrepreneurship and ability to learn quickly. Chinese factories
adapt quickly in terms of producing merchandise in demand on the
international market.
</P>
<P>
He cited the aforementioned factors as the reason he constantly
seeks new sources of supply in China. Pier 1 Imports also plans to
open chain stores in China.
</P>
<P>
He said that the financial crisis in Southeast Asia will not
affect the company's long-term strategy to expand operations in
China.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the U.S. business community strongly
supports President Clinton's move to extend the Most Favored
Nation trade status to China and expressed hope that the issue of
China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) will be
resolved soon.
</P>
<P>
He said President Clinton was "smart" to ensure his
administration took concrete steps to improve US-Sino relations
and comprehensively strengthen bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people will never forget friends who help them. I
believe this partnership will continue to move forward," said
Johnson.

<HEADLINE> Government Welcomes Defection of Khmer Rouge Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian Royal government
Saturday welcomed the defection of five high-ranking figures of
the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
Sok An, a cabinet member, told Xinhua that the government is
sending a team on Saturday morning to Pailin to talk with the five
Khmer Rouge important members, the news of whose defection was
broadcast by Television of Kampuchea (TVK) on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
On the government stand on Ta Mok, Noun Chea and Khieu Samphan,
the three other Khmer Rouge important members, Sok An said that
they are hardliners and must be put on trial.
</P>
<P>
Television of Kampuchea interrupted the World Cup football
match broadcasting shortly before midnight Friday to announce the
defection by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Khmer
Rouge Interim Government Chan Youran, Finance Minister Mak Ben,
Minister for Immigration En Sopheap, Labor Minister Kor Bum Heng
and Special Advisor to the Prime Minister Thiounn Thioeun.
</P>
<P>
It said that the five signed a statement in Pailin near
Cambodia-Thailand border Thursday, declaring they broke with the
Khmer Rouge on May 3.
</P>
<P>
The statement said in order to end the decades of civil war and
lingering unrest in Cambodia, they determined to break with the
Khmer Rouge hardliners Ta Mok and Nuon Chea and return to
Cambodian national community.
</P>
<P>
It also stated that they would accept the Constitutions of the
country and the Royal government and respect the important role of
King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
The Khmer Rouge Interim Government was outlawed by the
Cambodian National Assembly (parliament) passed a bill in July
1994.
</P>
<P>
Under mounting pressures from both the inside and outside of
the organization, Khmer Rouge officials and soldiers kept
defecting to the government in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Ieng Sary, among many other Khmer Rouge important
members, led a big group of soldiers to surrender to the
government.
</P>
<P>
Almost all strongholds of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla group,
including Anlong Veng near the Cambodia-Thailand border, have
fallen into the hands of the government forces.
</P>
<P>
Former Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, died of heart attack on
April 15 this year on a hill near Anlong Veng.

SAN JOSE, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Central American countries
are trying to defend their export privileges in the European Union
(EU).
</P>
<P>
It is "an important factor in the creation of jobs in the
region," Costa Rican Chamber of Exporters President Antonio
Burgues said Friday, referring to the Generalized System of
Preferences that permits Central American countries to export
products worth more than 1.1 billion U.S. dollars to the EU market.
</P>
<P>
He said that these products generate 1.3 million direct and
indirect jobs in the non-traditional agricultural sector, and
enable 1.7 million people to work in the coffee sector.
</P>
<P>
A long list of Central American agricultural products are
allowed to enter the European Common Market duty-free, but the
regime expires on June 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the European Commission is preparing its
proposal of a new Generalized System of Preferences applicable to
Central American countries.

<P>
OTTAWA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Canada has welcomed the World Trade
Organization's (WTO) ruling on the Canada-Australia salmon dispute
which judges that Australia's ban on importing Canadian salmon is
inconsistent with its WTO obligations.
</P>
<P>
The ruling, made by the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body Friday,
requests Australia to bring its regulations on imports of fresh,
chilled and frozen salmon from Canada in conformity with WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
"This final ruling of the WTO has very clearly upheld Canada's
case," said Canadian International Trade Minister Minister Sergio
Marchi, "This also demonstrates that Canada's trade interests are
best defended through a system of fair and equitable rules."
</P>
<P>
Australia's ban was first introduced in 1975. After years of
unsuccessful bilateral efforts to resolve the dispute, the WTO
Dispute Settlement Body established a panel on April 10, 1997, at
Canada's request.
</P>
<P>
Australia still has the right to appeal the WTO ruling.

<HEADLINE> Chile Worries About Mir's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Chilean environmentalists have
expressed concern over an eventual fall of the Russian space
station Mir in Chilean territory.
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists have asked the government to demand the
postponement of the maneuver which will pull the space station out
of its orbit, the Chilean press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The members of the Political Ecology Institute of Chile said
that the maneuver to drop the space station to Earth could be
started before complete information about the Mir components was
obtained.
</P>
<P>
It had to be known whether the structure contained substances
dangerous to the population and the environment in general, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian authorities have decided to abandon the Mir station
because of a lack of resources to keep it in orbit.
</P>
<P>
Although it is not possible to forecast specifically where the
Mir would fall, there was a possibility of it hitting Chilean
territory.
</P>
<P>
However, Chilean consul in Moscow Alejandro Gibbons rejected
the possibility of serious damage in Chilean territory caused by
an eventual fall of the 130 ton station, because, in his opinion,
it would disintegrate before hitting the ground.

The law aims to keep low-income families above the poverty line
by providing them with a minimum income of 500,000 lire (about 285
U.S. dollars) a month.
</P>
<P>
The new income support scheme will be introduced on a trial
basis in a dozen pilot areas, mainly in the south, and is expected
to benefit about 15,000 to 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The cities and towns involved in the experiment will be decided
in the next 30 days. The decision will be made by the central and
regional governments on the basis of poverty statistics, Social
Solidarity Minister Livia Turco said.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want the measure to be confined to big cities, but
rather to focus on small and middle cities, especially in the
Mezzogiorno where 70 percent of the poor live," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Anyone benefiting from the plan will have to take part in job
training programs and other initiatives aimed at rehabilitating
the poor and marginalized, Turco said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Freezes Tourism Promotion Offices Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Government will
temporarily freeze tourism promotion offices in seven countries
because of financial constraints, Antara News Agency Saturday
quoted a senior tourism official as saying.
</P>
<P>
After consultations with his aides, Minister of Tourism, Arts
and Culture Marzuki Usman had agreed to freeze the activities of
these offices for at least one year.
</P>
<P>
These tourism promotion offices are located in Frankfurt,
Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, Los Angeles, London and Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to call our tourism representatives home was
taken after considering the rupiah's continuing slide against the
U.S. dollar," said Andi Mappisameng, Director General of Tourism.
</P>
<P>
Funds earmarked to finance the operations of the offices were
based on an exchange rate of 5,000 rupiah per U.S. dollar, but in
the latest money market developments the dollar unexpectedly rose
three times the pegged rate of 5,000 rupiah, Andi said.
</P>
<P>
Andi said earlier this month that it is practically impossible
for the country's tourism sector to record any growth this year
because of the ongoing monetary crisis. The sector managed to
bring in foreign exchange of no less than 6.6 billion U.S. dollars
last year.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the government is planning to establish a
Trade Tourism and Investment agency to handle tourism promotion
abroad. The agency would be staffed with personnel from the Trade
and Industry Ministry, the Investment Ministry and the Tourism,
Arts and Culture Ministry.

<P>
Currently, it has an annual production capacity of 730 million
semiconductor ICs, which is expected to be expanded to one billion
pieces this year and two billion in 2000, according to Wang
Dianfu, chairman of SEG and STS.
</P>
<P>
"The financial troubles (in Asia) do not affect long-term
prospects in the region or our investment here," said Pasquale
Pistorio, ST's president and chief executive officer, adding that
STS, ST's first joint venture in China, would help his company
further integrate into this region.

</P>
<P>
The State Council has decided to appropriate a record 18.3

The money must be used well, and those misuse or embezzle such
funds will have their criminal responsibility investigated,
according to the circular.

Following a policy set by the national poverty alleviation and
development conference held in 1996, the economically booming
provinces and cities in the eastern part of the country should

<HEADLINE> Arafat Warns of Danger of Peace Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Friday warned the world of the dire consequences of a collapse of
the peace negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"I have warned before, and I warn now, before it is too late,
that a collapse of the peace process will plunge the whole region
into a cycle of violence, conflict and total, unlimited
instability," Arafat told a dinner hosted in his honor by Arab
ambassadors and the Italy-Arab Chamber of Commerce, in Rome.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader is in Italy for a two-day visit. He
urged Italy and its EU partners to pursue moves complementary to
those of the United States to get the peace process moving.
</P>
<P>
According to Arafat, the Israelis have not only frozen all
previous agreements, but have also promoted a "vast movement of
settlement" in the occupied eastern part of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He insisted, however, that peace in the Middle East is in
conformity with the interests of the whole international
community, despite existing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Romano Prodi met Arafat earlier in the
day. Prodi expressed hope that Israel and Palestine can overcome
the present severe difficulties through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
A communique from Prodi's office said Italy believes the
willingness to support the peace process should be used "as widely
as possible."
</P>
<P>
It also affirmed Italy's willingness to propose joint European
Union-United States moves to EU nations when "opportune and
necessary."

PHNOM PENH, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Five high-ranking figures of

Television of Kampuchea (TVK) reported on Friday night.
</P>

Cambodian national community.
</P>
<P>
It also stated that they would accept the Constitutions of the
country and the Royal government and respect the important role of

</P>
<P>
The Khmer Rouge Interim Government was outlawed by the

<HEADLINE> Maradona Receives Suspended Sentence for Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Former Argentine soccer Star
Diego Maradona was convicted on Friday of shooting journalists
with an air rifle in 1994 and received a suspended sentence of two
years and 10 months .
</P>
<P>
His lawyer, Hugo Wortman Jofre, said he would appeal. The
journalists injured by Maradona said they would also appeal
because they considered the suspended sentence too light.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors and the journalists' lawyers had sought four years
in jail for Maradona. In the Argentine legal system, any sentence
over three years must be served in prison.
</P>
<P>
Maradona's career has been marred in recent years by drug
scandals and short-lived comebacks. He was banned for 15 months
for taking cocaine while playing for the Napoli team in Italy in
1991.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, his agent said Maradona wanted to return to
Napoli as a player or player-manager, but the plan fell through
and Maradona's playing career is considered to be over.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Maradona received permission to leave Argentina for
two weeks to go to France where he is working as a World Cup
commentator for Argentine television.

<HEADLINE> Pension Increase by Britain Insufficient: Gurkha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Former Gurkha soldiers who
served in the British army on Friday evening criticized the
planned increase of pensions for them by the British government as
"completely insufficient."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC Nepali Service, Padam Bahadur Gurung,
president of the Gurkha Army Ex-Servicemen's Organization (GAESO),
said that they are demanding an increase of 500 percent, and the
demand has not been met.
</P>
<P>
The British government has decided to increase the pensions for
its former Gurkha soldiers which vary from 23 to 51 percent
depending on rank, years of service and date of retirement, the
British Embassy here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There are 26,375 ex-Gurkhas and their families who are
receiving pensions worth 6.9 million British pounds (about 11
million U.S. dollars) every year from the British government, the
British Embassy said.
</P>
<P>
Many retired Gurkha soldiers are receiving as little as 24
pounds (38 dollars) per month while their British counterparts are
getting 475 pounds (760 dollars).
</P>
<P>
For the past four years, they have been demanding pension
parity with their British counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"We're not slaves, but employees of the British government, so
the pensions should be increased according to our demand on the
basis of the tri-partite agreement," Gurung argued.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached in 1947 between Nepal, India and
Britain, the British and Indian armies can recruit Nepalese, who
have been popularly known as Gurkha soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Gurung said that his organization has issued an ultimatum
threatening that if its demand is not met by June 15, it will
launch a three-phase movement. He did not elaborate on the
movement.
</P>
<P>
The GAESO had issued ultimata several times and had even
threatened to file its case at London courts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Min Bahadur Gurung, vice-president of Nepal
Ex-Servicemen's Association, said on BBC that the proposed pension
increase is "completely insufficient."
</P>
<P>
He said that a movement will be launched after his association
meets.
</P>
<P>
The British army drafted Nepalese already in 1816 under the
Sugauli Treaty signed between Nepal and the East India Company of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 Nepalese soldiers fought during the First and
Second World Wars and 15,000 of them were killed.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 2,500 to 3,000 Nepalese are serving in the British
army.
</P>
<P>
For the past four years, the ex-Gurkhas have also been
demanding the right to live and work in Britain and pensions for
those dismissed without pensions.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Three days before his team's
World Cup opener, U.S. coach Steve Sampson criticized german head
coach Bertu Vigts for not respecting the Americans.
</P>
<P>
"Bertu Vigts walked out 20 minutes before the end of the
Belgium match, that shows a lack of respect for the United States
team," Sampson said in Paris, a press report said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"In Europe, they have no respect for the U.S. team. Frankly, we
haven't earned it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sampson, who was referring to the Americans' 2-0 loss at
Brussels on February 25, is openly using the respect issue to
motivate his players going into Monday's game againt Germany in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
The United States has a 10-29-5 record in Europe against
European opponents and has been outscored by 123-42. In their last
10 matches, the Americans did pretty good, beating Iceland 1-0 and
Austria 3-0.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Envoy Rebukes U.S. Critics of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Li Zhaoxing, the Chinese
ambassador to the United States, Friday strongly criticized some
congressional critics of China just two weeks before U.S.
President Bill Clinton's trip to China.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference at the National Press Center that
Clinton's upcoming visit to China will further promote the
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers in Congress, using the Clinton administration's
China policy as a domestic political tool against Clinton, urged
the president to cancel or postpone his visit scheduled to start on
June 25.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the two sides are working very actively and
conscientiously to prepare for the upcoming visit.
</P>
<P>
"We are sure that... this visit will be yet another very
important one in our bilateral ties and will again make great
contribution to the further promotion of the relationship between
our countries," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of some congressional critics of China, Li dismissed
them as Cold War thinkers.
</P>
<P>
"After the Cold War, I believe, some of the people... seemed to
be nostalgic of the Cold War period. In other words, they found
that they still needed an enemy, they still needed a target, so as
to justify their Cold War mentality," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"So because these people were so keen to find an enemy, to find
find a substitute for the Soviet empire in the past, they had
started to look at China, which they should not look at,"Li said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China is pursuing a peaceful foreign policy.
"China presents no threat to any country, at all."
</P>
<P>
The ambassador denied U.S. intelligence information that
China's nuclear missiles are targeting American cities, saying
there's "nothing of the sort that I know of."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's five-city journey, from June 25 to July 3, will be
the first visit to China by an American president in a decade.
Clinton defended his trip on Thursday, citing a series of reasons
to justify his policies towards China.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that his trip is "the right thing to do for our
country."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador said recent events highlight the need
for closer U.S.-China consultations, including the tit-for-tat
nuclear testing in May by neighboring rivals India and Pakistan,
and the Asia financial crisis that has deeply devalued currencies
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the fact that the Cold War is over, the issue of the
international stability has yet to be finally resolved," Li said.
"So two countries as important as China and America still have a
common responsibility and have a lot to do together," he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
China recently chaired a Geneva meeting of the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council, which condemned the nuclear
tests. Beijing also has agreed not to devalue its currency in
order to prevent another wave of financial destabilization.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of human rights, Li said, "China attaches the greatest
possible importance to human rights." He explained that for the
Chinese this means providing "the basic rights for people's
survival" or feeding the nation's 1.2 billion people.

<HEADLINE> Private Distribution of Fertilizer Urged in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia National Farmers Union
(ZNFU) said Friday that the distribution of fertilizer should be
left to the private sector while the government should only
facilitate its importation into the country.
</P>
<P>
ZNFU's Acting Executive Director Songowayo Zyambo said here
the distribution of fertilizer should be put in private hands and
that a commercial court should be established to handle disputes
between private dealers and farmers.
</P>
<P>
Zyambo said a steering committee should be appointed to
monitor the whole distribution process to ensure that fertilizer
reaches every part of the country.
</P>
<P>
In the case of fertilizer, the government can assist to bring
it into the country but must not manage the distribution and
related procedures, he said.
</P>
<P>
The steering committee will ensure transparency, and monitor
the formation of cartels and put a check on bogus dealers and
mediate on complaints between farmers and companies involved in
the distribution of fertilizer, Zyambo said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government should only facilitate the acquisition
of inputs for small-scale farmers who desperately need
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The mechanisms for the distribution of fertilizer, he said,
should be planned collectively by dealers, farmers and the
government.
</P>
<P>
ZNFU will work closely with the government to make maize an
export crop as well as improve food security in the country, he
promised.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Agriculture, Food and Fisheries Minister
Amusaa Mwanamwambwa announced that the government will start
distributing fertilizer to all parts of the country because the
private sector was unable to handle the exercise in a
satisfactory manner.

<HEADLINE> Albright Rebukes Treasury Secretary for Secrecy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has rebuked Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin in
a letter for failing to inform her about a money-laundering sting
operation in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
"I would appreciate being kept personally informed of
developing investigations in Mexico and other foreign countries
that could have a significant foreign policy fallout," Albright
said in the letter dated May 22.
</P>
<P>
"I do not wish to interfere with your law enforcement work, but
I do believe we need to do a better job of coordination," she
complained in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Albright expressed concern "about the negative tone this
development introduces into the relationship and that Mexican
cooperation on several fronts, particularly counternarcotics, may
be affected."
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report said Friday the letter was inserted
in the Congressional Record by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, but
it did not disclose how Grassley obtained the letter.
</P>
<P>
Albright wrote the letter following an uproar in Mexico touched
off by the disclosure that U.S. Customs agents working under
Rubin's jurisdiction had carried out part of the sting operation
without Mexican authorization.
</P>
<P>
Mexican bankers were arrested after being lured into the United
States under false pretenses. U.S. authorities seized 110 million
U.S. dollars and three Mexican banks were indicted in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Mexico has indicated that laws were broken by the agents and
that it plans to prosecute them.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton also has expressed regret to
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo about the secrecy of the
operation, which was carried out over three years and was made
public last month.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Extension of U.N. Mission in Bosnia Recommended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan recommended on Friday that the U.N. Mission in Bosnia-
Herzegovina (UNMIBH) stay there for one more year to help set up a
multi-ethnic police and a judicial system for all its citizens.
</P>
<P>
The UNMIBH, with its current mandate expiring at the end of
this month, comprises a 2,011 member police unit contributed by 42
countries with an aim to train and advise the newly established
local police forces.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, which was made public
Friday, Annan said the last three months have seen an increase in
violent incidents in Bosnia which are aimed at returning refugees
and displaced persons, especially those of minority groups.
</P>
<P>
UNMIBH "will do everything in its power to further advance the
restructuring of the local police forces in order to help create
confidence for returning minorities," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"However, it would be overly optimistic to expect a decisive
change before the nationwide elections scheduled for 13 September
1998," it said.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, some 20,000 refugees and
displaced people have returned to Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Dealing with U.N. activities in the country since the 1995
Dayton Peace Accord which ended a war, Annan said the 5.1 billion
U.S. dollar reconstruction program endorsed by the World Bank
after the Dayton Accord "remains on track".
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is expected to adopt Annan's
recommendation on Monday, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told
reporters on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Private Distribution of Fertilizer Urged in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia National Farmers Union
(ZNFU) said Friday that the distribution of fertilizer should be
left to the private sector while the government should only
facilitate its importation into the country.
</P>
<P>
ZNFU's Acting Executive Director Songowayo Zyambo said here
the distribution of fertilizer should be put in private hands and
that a commercial court should be established to handle disputes
between private dealers and farmers.
</P>
<P>
Zyambo said a steering committee should be appointed to
monitor the whole distribution process to ensure that fertilizer
reaches every part of the country.
</P>
<P>
In the case of fertilizer, the government can assist to bring
it into the country but must not manage the distribution and
related procedures, he said.
</P>
<P>
The steering committee will ensure transparency, and monitor
the formation of cartels and put a check on bogus dealers and
mediate on complaints between farmers and companies involved in
the distribution of fertilizer, Zyambo said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government should only facilitate the acquisition
of inputs for small-scale farmers who desperately need
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The mechanisms for the distribution of fertilizer, he said,
should be planned collectively by dealers, farmers and the
government.
</P>
<P>
ZNFU will work closely with the government to make maize an
export crop as well as improve food security in the country, he
promised.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Agriculture, Food and Fisheries Minister
Amusaa Mwanamwambwa announced that the government will start
distributing fertilizer to all parts of the country because the
private sector was unable to handle the exercise in a
satisfactory manner.

<HEADLINE> World Cup hke -- France Open Campaign with 3-0 Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MARSEILLE, June 12 (Xinhua) -- France returned to the World Cup
finals after 12 years' absence with an overwhelming 3-0 win over South
Africa in their Group C opener here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
France had all guns firing from the beginning in this game at this
soccer-mad city and Christophe Duggary found the net with a header in
the 35th minute on a corner kick delivered by Zinedine Zidane.
</P>
<P>
There was no let-up in the second half for the French attackers,
with Inter Milan star Youri Djorkaeff chipping a ball toward South
African keeper Hans Vonk in the 78th minute.
</P>
<P>
Vonk made the correct judgement and did a slide-dive toward the
ball's path. But South African defender Pierre Issa, in an attempt to
stop the ball before the keeper, bounced the ball up over Vonk into
the net with his leg.
</P>
<P>
Thierry Henry, with European Cup semifinalist club Monaco, sealed
the victory for the hosts by netting in close range at the dying
minutes of the game after beating three South African players.
</P>
<P>
Zidane said after the game that the victory proved that the
pre-game critism against the team was all wrong.
</P>
<P>
"This victory is the effort of the whole team," said Zidane. "There
has been a lot of critism concerning our performances in the
friendlies but the friendlies could not prove anything.
</P>
<P>
"It's same for my teammate Duggary. You can see he performed well
tonight," he added.
</P>
<P>
French coach Aime Jacquet had been blasted for picking the
Olympique Marseille striker, who had previously a low scoring ratio at
international level.

<HEADLINE> Tunisia Calls for Peaceful Solution to Conflicts Between Eritrea, Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Zine Al-Abidine Ben
Ali Friday reiterated his call on Eritrea and Ethiopia to solve their
border disputes through dialog, the Tunisia-Africa News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ali made the call during his separate meetings with Ethiopian
Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin and Eritrean Minister of Local
Government Mohamud S.
</P>
<P>
Mesfin and Sherifo arrived here Friday in their north African tours
to rally support for their stands on the disputes.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993. Ever since then,
the two countries have been at odds over at least six border areas. On
May 6, armed clashes broke out between the two sides for a
400-square-kilometer rocky land.
</P>
<P>
During their meetings with Ben Ali, Mesfin and Sherifo conveyed him
messages from the presidents of their countries, asking for Tunisia's
efforts to help stop their armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ali expressed readiness to exert efforts to help the two
neighbors in the Horn of Africa settle the disputes in the framework
of the Organization of the African Unity, which has called for an
immediate ceasefire and a negotiation between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> . DeU8j!la Trying to Gain Faster Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The 1998/99 budgets of Kenya,
Uganda and Tanzania read at their respective parliaments Thursday
have spelled out far-reaching tough measures with an eye to
faster economic growth, local analysts said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The three East Africa Cooperation (EAC) members meshed their
budget calendars for the first time in a show of harmony to
symbolize the new-found spirit of the EAC treaty expected to be
signed by their heads of state in November.
</P>
<P>
All three have been struggling to cope with high costs of
devastated infrastructure as a result of drought earlier 1997 and
then months of El Nino rains and floods at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Tanzania have already missed their low revenue
targets this year, while Kenya suffers from a budget deficit
reaching 2.7 percent of gross domestic product in the 1997/98
fiscal year to end on June 30.
</P>
<P>
"I am asking all of you to tighten your belts so we can
achieve a balanced budget this year and thereafter achieve
surpluses," said Kenyan Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae in his
budget draft.
</P>
<P>
"We are faced with a daunting task of how to achieve faster
economic growth, preferably in excess of seven percent," he said.
Kenya's economic growth fell from 4.6 percent in 1996 to 2.3
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
He proposed a severe slash in public spending which is
estimated at 30.5 percent of GDP in 1997/98.
</P>
<P>
The painful measures include the retrenchment of 100,000 civil
servants and teachers, and the reduction of government borrowing
requirements by at least five percent.
</P>
<P>
Nyachae also vowed to speed up privatization, enforce the tax
system, improve infrastructure especially roads, keep inflation
within one single digit level and intensify fights against
corruption and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
In new capital Dodoma in central Tanzania, Minister of State
in the President's Office Nassoro Malocho said just before the
budget reading that the country will focus on repairing the
infrastructure in the coming fiscal year during which economic
recovery would be slow.
</P>
<P>
"Our expectations for developments in 1998/99 are not
ambitious... Our development targets have been trimmed to
realistic levels in keeping with our ability as a nation to
deliver," he said,
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Finance Minister Daniel Yona said he expected to
raise 699.5 billion Tanzanian Shillings (1.076 billion U.S.
Dollars) in domestic revenue in 1998/99, or 13.4 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's economic growth rate in 1997/98 fiscal year is
estimated at 3.5 percent, below the target of 4.5 percent, while
revenue collection is expectedly to hit 627,500 million Tanzanian
Shillings (about 946 million Dollars), about 10 percent below the
target.
</P>
<P>
About 650 Tanzanian Shillings equal to one U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
Yona said the government plans to collect 695,165.9 million
Tanzanian Shillings from its domestic sources and spend 1,007,786
million Tanzanian Shillings in the coming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
In Kampala, Ugandan Finance Minister Gerald Sendaula said that
Uganda will focus on five key areas of security, education,
roads, poverty eradication and pay reform in 1998/99.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's gross domestic product grew by 5.5 percent in
1997/98, up from 5.0 percent in 1996/97 but slower than the
targeted seven percent.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government now aims to increase its revenue
collection by 17.6 percent for 1998/99 to 940 billion Ugandan
Shillings (0.82 billion U.S. Dollars) from expected 798.8 billion
Ugandan Shillings in 1997/98, said Sendaula.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan budget remained cautious avoiding major policy
changes effected in last year's budget but with expected increase
on tax revenues, local analysts said.
</P>
<P>
"If we want more spending, we must face the reality of raising
the necessary funds domestically," said Sendaula.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government also intends to reduce the duty rates
on fuel and drinks in a bid to get closer to the levels of those
in its east African neighbors.
</P>
<P>
However, economic and tax harmonization on a broader scale
will be a formidable task among the three east African countries
where per capita income ranges from 200 to 300 U.S. Dollars a
year, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The tax take in Kenya's relatively industrialized economy, for
example, amounts to around 28 percent of GDP, while in Tanzania
and Uganda with more agricultural economies, the figure is close
to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Under the would-be EAC treaty, the three countries seeks to
eliminate internal tariffs by 2000, regularize external tariffs
and implement a customs union with five years starting from 1999.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Withdraw From South Lebanon Unconditionally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIRUT, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Australian House of
Representatives Ian Sinclair Friday called on Israel to withdraw from
south Lebanon unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
Sinclair made the call when he was visiting the village of Qana
in South Lebanon, where 106 civilians were killed in Israeli raids
in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said any agreements or security arrangements Israel demands
should be negotiated after the Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
He called for an unconditional Israeli implementation of the
United Nations Security Council Resolution 425, which demands
unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On April 1, Israel decided to endorse the resolution. But it said
it would not pull back its troops unless security arrangements are
made with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected the offer, insisting that the withdrawal be
unconditional.
</P>
<P>
The Australian house speaker said that he hopes that the Qana
massacre would become an incentive for more efforts to make peace in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Sinclair, who arrived here Wednesday from Syria, has held talks
with Lebanese leaders on bilateral ties and regional affairs in his
three-day visit.

<P>
NEW YORK, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese yen dropped to
another eight-year low against U.S. dollar Friday after traders
were confirmed that the Japanese economy suffered the first full
year of decline in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell against the mark, which also gained on the bad
news out of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose to 144.72 yen in late New York trading, up from
143.79 yen Thursday. During Asian trading, the dollar hit 144.75
yen, a level not seen since August 1990.
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive day the U.S. currency approached
an eight-year high after several weeks of moving through
seven-year highs.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also was changing hands at 1.8056 marks in New York,
down from 1.8087 Thursday. During trading, however, the dollar
reached 1.8106 marks, a level last seen in late April.
</P>
<P>
The bank lowered its key rate half a percentage point Friday to
17 percent, a move that surprised the markets.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday: 1.4984 Swiss francs, up from 1.4965; 6.0545 French
francs, down from 6.0675; 1,779.00 Italian lire, down from

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Says Russia on Right Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 12 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin said Friday
that Russia is on the right path and all the problems dogging the
country would eventually be overcome.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a grand reception in the Kremlin marking the Day of
Russia, Yeltsin said, "The history of a new, democratic Russia
began eight years ago. We have a glorious past stretching over
1,000 years and a great and happy future."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the declaration of Russia's sovereignty
eight years ago that marked the beginning of the breakup of the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
That day was formerly declared Russia's Independence Day, but
was later renamed as Day of Russia. "Russia had never been a
colony and there was no such thing as independence," a government
spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In Yeltsin's address, which was broadcast live by state
television, the president said the past fews years "were a heavy
test for everyone of us. We had to overcome obstacles."
</P>
<P>
"It was difficult, but we have stayed on the course and did
not turn back."
</P>
<P>
However, Yeltsin acknowledged that changes in the years had not
resulted in a noticeable improvement in living conditions. "Russia
has not become a prosperous and stable economy nor are its
citizens well provided for or confident of their future," he said.
</P>
<P>
As Yeltsin made the speech, hundreds of miners were
demonstrating in blistering summer heat in central Moscow,
demanding that the government pay back their wages and Yeltsin
step down.
</P>
<P>
The miners, who were picketing the White House, the seat of
Russia's federal government, held such posters as: "Yeltsin, give
us our money back," and "Yeltsin, we brought you up, we will bring
you down."
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov has indicated that he is
prepared to talk with the miners if they give up political
demands, but they remain defiant.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Russian citizens, including teachers, doctors and
army officers, often have to wait months to get their salaries.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev told a news conference on Thursday that the government
owed miners some 3 billion rubles (500 million U.S.
dollars).

<HEADLINE> GM UAW Strike Expands, Workers Threaten Long Walkout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Auto Workers stepped
up its pressure on the General Motors Corp. Thursday night when
some 5,800 UAW members started their strike at the Delphi Flint
East complex, according to an AP report reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The plant supplies parts for nearly every GM vehicle made in
the United States, Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The walkout came six days after UAW workers went on strike
across town at the Flint Metal Center, a stamping plant. That
strike has caused the layoffs of nearly 25,000 workers at two
dozen other plants. Effects of the strike have spread to nine
states, Mexico and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Most of GM's other North American assembly plants could be
affected by the end of next week, which will further affect other
parts plants owned by GM and its suppliers. GM, the No. one car
making giant in the United States, has 28 wholly owned major
assembly plants in North America with 296,500 hourly workers.
</P>
<P>
Jobs are the primary issue. The UAW fears GM may transfer work
out of both Flint plants or even close them. The Delphi plant is
considered especially vulnerable because the low-tech parts it
makes can be produced much more cheaply outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
GM also is considering moving production of its next generation
of small cars to a low-wage country from its big Lordstown, Ohio,
plant. And it has leaked that the automaker plans to double
production in Mexico over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Striking workers said they fear losing their jobs to overseas
workers.
</P>
<P>
GM said in a statement that it was disappointed the UAW had
decided to strike both plants. It said it "will have a ripple
effect on thousands of GM employees, vehicle consumers, supplier
facilities, stockholders and communities."
</P>
<P>
Some industrial analysts believed that the effect of a combined
strike could be greater than that of a 1996 strike because GM's
vehicle inventories are leaner. The 1996 strike lasted 17 days and
cost GM 900 million U.S. dollars after taxes.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that talks between negotiators of GM and the UAW
are scheduled to resume at both plants Friday morning.

<HEADLINE> Popular Discussion on Land-Use Law Revision Encouraged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature has
received 577 letters on the draft of the revised Land-Use Law from
ordinary people, who concern themselves to the law, which has
bearing on their basic interests.
</P>
<P>
Many farmers, grass-roots rural officials, those in charge of
land-use management and township enterprises aired their views to
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC),
said Bian Yaowu, vice-chairman of the Legislative Affairs
Commission of the NPC Standing Committee, today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 836 people signed on a letter to the most
authoritative body.
</P>
<P>
Within the one month after the draft law was promulgated, the
NPC Standing Committee summoned relevant officials, law and
economics experts and representatives from democratic parties to
discuss on the draft.
</P>
<P>
"The discussion pooled the wisdom of the people and will
guarantee the quality of the law-making," Bian said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the letters have showed consensus on the land
management system in accordance with the different uses, namely,
land for farming, construction and idle land. But some advocated
for clear legislative definitions with their use.
</P>
<P>
Bian went on to say that the new legislation for land-use would
include this kind of stipulations and safeguard the interests of
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, China has adopted the existing land-use law, which
is considered somewhat unappropriate for the current market
economy.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee made public the draft law in early
May.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Producers Prices Pick Up 0.2 Pct in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. prices paid to factories
and other producers rose 0.2 percent in May, reflecting a record
increase in prescription drugs and the first rise in energy costs
in eight months, the Labor Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted increase, matching the rise in April,
followed a string of five declines, according to the department.
Through the first five months of the year, finished goods costs
measured by the Producer Price Index (PPI) have fallen at an
annual rate of 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The monthly gain was largely attributed to a 10.7 percent
increase in prescription drugs, which in turn was driven by a 585
percent rise in a single class of drugs, minor tranquilizers, the
department said.
</P>
<P>
Without the prescription drug increase, producer prices overall
would have been unchanged.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report Friday, the Commerce Department said
business inventories rose a modest 0.2 percent in April. That's
much smaller than the increases of 0.6 percent in March and 0.7
percent in February.
</P>
<P>
Business sales declined 0.1 percent in April after a 0.7
percent increase in March.
</P>
<P>
Energy costs shot up 0.8 percent. It was all gasoline, up 4.3
percent. Heating oil fell 1.1 percent, and residential natural
gas, 0.5 percent. Electricity was unchanged. Energy costs last
increased in September.
</P>
<P>
Food prices fell 0.3 percent, reflecting a 20.9 percent drop in
vegetables, the most in 17 months. Lettuce, which had soared
earlier in the year when El Nino's rains washed out California
fields, came down 59 percent. Fruit, however, rose 2.3 percent.
Beef, pork and fish prices also increased.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices
increased 0.2 percent, the same as for the overall index. That
reflected both the drug increase and a 2.8 percent rise in tobacco
costs. May's rise in tobacco followed a 3.4 percent rise the month
before. Tobacco companies are raising prices to pay the
multimillion-dollar cost of settling liability lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
Costs fell 0.1 percent at the intermediate level and 0.3
percent at the crude level.

<HEADLINE> Russia Still Against NATO Use of Force in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia expressed Friday its
opposition to NATO military intervention in Kosovo, claiming that
non-military means has not been exhausted.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeev told the press after the
NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council that his country is trying to
look through other non-military means in the effort to help solve
the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Russian defense chief stressed that a United Nations
Security Council resolution is needed in the event of NATO use of
force.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever method to be used has to be in accordance with the
U.N. Security Council resolution," said the defense minister.
</P>
<P>
When asked how Russia would vote should there be a show of
hands in the U.N. headquarters, Sergeev said that it is only the
president who can answer this question.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is scheduled to meet
Slobodan Milosevic, president of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, early next week, is opposed to NATO use of force.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the NATO pronounced mock air raids in
Albania and Macedonia, the Russian defense minister said that he
is not quite clear whether it is meant as a humanitarian manouver
or a demonstration of force.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, who attended the joint
press briefing with Sergeev, said that the NATO aim is to find a
U.N. resolution in New York.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, who said Thursday that it
is not imperative for NATO to get a U.N. mandate to resort to the
use of force, said at a separate briefing Friday that from two
days of meetings among defense ministers from NATO member states,
Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council member states as well as Russia
and Ukraine, he saw a broad consensus that a legal framework is
needed for outside military intervention.
</P>
<P>
But opinions differed among ministers as to whether it has to
be a U.N. resolution or a mandate by the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe or Article 51 of the U.N. Charter
itself.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that Russia would risk isolating itself in the
international community if it did not try to bring Milosevic to
the negotiating table.

<HEADLINE> Economist Predicts Continuing Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese economist said today
that China's economy will continue to improve in the second half
of this year despite the influences of the shaky economic
situations in Japan and other countries in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
"China's economic growth in May was far from fortuitous and
resulted from effectiveness of measures the Chinese Government
adopted to stimulate domestic demand and promote investment in
infrastructure construction." according to Professor Cheng
Xiusheng from the State Council Development Research Center. Cheng
made the comments at today's symposium on regional economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that China has recorded industrial
value-added of 776.8 billion yuan between January and May, up 7.9
percent on last year's same period. The May figure hit 168.1
billion yuan, a year-on-year rise of eight percent or slight
increase in the margin for April.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the economist also expressed concern about
devaluation of the Japanese Yen. "The negative impact of the
financial turmoil in Southeast Asia has begun to affect on the
Chinese's economy and the unexpected recession in Japan may
possibly spark another crisis in Asia," said Cheng.
</P>
<P>
China's export volume rose 5.4 percent in the first five months
of 1998, with the May falling by 1.5 percent, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Analysts further noted that devaluation of Yen may reduce
Japan's domestic demand for Chinese products and could possibly
restrict to some extent the latter's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
However, Cheng expressed his belief investments in
infrastructure construction will be a major factor in increasing
the speed of China's economic locomotive.
</P>
<P>
"Investments will certainly outstrip levels for the first half
of this year and may even increase by more than 15 percent." Cheng
said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Centennial of Independence, Jubilant Fete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- National flags were displayed and
waved everywhere. White doves were released. Bells were tolled and
fireworks were set off. The Filipinos put on a fiesta Friday,
jubilantly celebrating the centennial of the country's
independence from Spain.
</P>
<P>
The celebration started early Friday. At 6 a.m., the people
were waked by simultaneous ringing of church bells and ship sirens
all over the country. Then President Fidel Ramos and
representatives from 32 countries and regions re-enacted the
proclamation of independence in Kawit, Cavite province, south of
Manila.
</P>
<P>
On the same day 100 years ago, General Emilio Aguinaldo, leader
of the revolutionary movement against the Spanish colonialists,
declared the country's independence in Kawit. Aguinaldo later
became the first president of the republic.
</P>
<P>
But according to history, the Philippines did not gain
independence immediately. Under the Treaty of Paris signed in
December 1898, Spain, which was defeated by the United States
after ruling the Philippines for about 330 years, ceded the
islands to the latter. It was until July 1946 that the Philippines
became an independent republic.
</P>
<P>
To let the Filipinos learn again the values of the country's
historic struggle for independence and use these for development
in the future, the Philippine government set June 12 as the
country's independence day, also called the national day, to imbue
people with patriotism.
</P>
<P>
At exactly 7 a.m., national flags were raised simultaneously
all over the country. Then sky-diving exhibitions, regattas and
other activities were held by the Manila Bay. In the presidential
palace, President Ramos toasted the occasion with diplomats and
dignitaries in a vin d'honneur at 11 a.m..
</P>
<P>
The celebration culminated in a grand centennial parade at the
Luneta Park in Manila. At 2:30 p.m. hundreds of thousands of
people had gathered at the park to join or witness the parade
which depicted the country's quest for freedom in a tableau of
color, costumes and creative floats.
</P>
<P>
In his centennial speech during the parade, President Ramos
said the first centennial was simply the beginning of greater
things to come to the Philippines as long as the people hold true
to unity and courage.
</P>
<P>
He said the country is standing on the threshold not only of a
new century, but of a new Filipinism, "a new sense of ourselves,
and our capabilities and our national destiny." He called on the
people to take the opportunity to renew themselves as a nation and
work for the country's future.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the parade, the people were treated to a
spectacular display of fireworks. In 30 minutes, about 19,000
shells of fireworks rocketed from four barges docked at the Manila
Bay, lighting up the skies with various patterns like
chrysanthemums, heart-shaped stars and the colors of the
Philippine national flag.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Tourism Secretary Mina Gabor said the fireworks show
was "unprecedented" in the Philippines' history because of its
color and shape, adding that the fireworks were synchronized to
about 25 local medley songs and controlled through a computer.
</P>
<P>
The Filipinos' centennial fever will stretch to the days after
June 12. According to the Philippine Centennial Commission,
various social sectors including the disabled and religious groups
will showcase the gains of the last 100 years on June 13, the
first day of the second century.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Expo Filipino, another highlight of the
celebrations, will be inaugurated by President Ramos and foreign
dignitaries at Clark Special Economic Zone, a former U.S. Air
Force base about two hours' drive north of Manila. A total of 15
countries will participate in the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines began preparing for the centennial five years
ago. In 1994, the government set up the Philippine Centennial
Commission and organized various activities including cultural
shows, trade fairs, exhibitions and sports activities this year.
</P>
<P>
"I would like this centennial to make every Filipino not only
aware of his past but proud of his past. It is very important that
the present generation pass on the torch to the next generation,"
said Salvador Laurel, chairman of the centennial commission.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture Remains Pakistan's Economic Mainstay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The agricultural sector which is
the backbone of Pakistan's national economy, continues to hold the
 position in the next financial year.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the budgetary proposals for the fiscal 1998-1999
(July 1-June 30), Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz Friday told the
National Assembly that after exports the agricultural sector is
the second pillar of the strategy of economic growth and
self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the agriculture incentives package
announced in April 1997 has had encouraging results.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of agriculture rose from 0.1 percent in 1996-97
to 6 percent during the current year, he said, adding that record
production of wheat of 19 million tons and of sugarcane of 53
million tons have been realized during this year.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, he said, import of wheat for next year is likely
to be less than 1 million tons as against 4 million tons this
year.
</P>
<P>
"We are now self-sufficient in sugar and have also an
exportable surplus," he said.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concerns over the lower yield of cotton, he said
that if untimely heavy rains had not caused damage to the cotton
crop, agriculture's growth would have been over 6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Pak Defense Outlay Up Despite Financial Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has increased its
defense expenditure by 8.4 percent in the new fiscal year budget
(July 1-June 30) despite financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
According to the budget proposals presented by Finance Minister
Sartaj Aziz in the National Assembly Friday afternoon, the defense
expenditure for the 1998-99 fiscal year is 1.45 trillion rupees
(about 3.3 billion U.S. dollars), registering an 8.4-percent
increase over the revised estimates of the outgoing fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The defense outlay in the new budget accounts for 29.3 percent
of the government's current expenditure which has been estimated
at 4.957 trillion rupees (11.3 billion dollars). Together with an
expected debt servicing of 2.756 trillion rupees (6.3 billion
dollars), the two take up 84.8 percent of the current expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said in his budget speech that "the brave
armed forces are prepared to face any challenge and it is our duty
to take full care of their needs."
</P>
<P>
He said national security is Pakistan's "first priority" as
"we are prepared to make any sacrifice for the security and
solidarity of our homeland."
</P>
<P>
"To strengthen national defense and upgrade defense capability
to a level that no one could look at us with malaise is a critical
element of our policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said an outstanding feature of Pakistan's national
security is the success in the nuclear field. "We are committed to
use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes but will not tolerate
a situation in which the regional security balance is disturbed,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Stresses Self-Reliance in Face of Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Finance Minister
Sartaj Aziz has urged the country to generate internal strength in
a liberal framework for guaranteeing economic and national
security and facing the sanctions bravely in a bid to achieve
self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the Federal Budget for 1998-99 (July 1-June 30) in
the National Assembly Friday afternoon, he stressed the need for
fiscal and financial sustainability. "Our economic growth should
be based on national resources and dependence on external means
should be minimized."
</P>
<P>
He said, "Our needs of food and other consumable items should
be met from domestic sources mainly and availability of energy
should be based on harnessing of natural resources." "The human
resource should be strengthened through education, particularly in
scientific and technical fields."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue with the liberal and deregulated framework of
our policies. Foreign investment, particularly in modern, hi-tech
and export industries, will be encouraged," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz noted that despite the difficult financial situation
together with the sanctions imposed by some Western nations in the
wake of Pakistan's nuclear tests late last month, Pakistan is
expected to achieve a 6-percent growth rate in GDP with 5.4
percent in agriculture and 7.2 percent in manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
To raise the level of investment to 18.7 percent of GDP, a
major portion of it, or 17.13 percent of GDP, will be generated
from domestic savings, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said Pakistan will further reduce the inflation rate
from 8.2 percent in the outgoing fiscal year to 8 percent in the
new fiscal year, expand exports by 15 percent, contain imports and
bring down the current account deficit to 1.5 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The government has also set the target of further reducing the
budget deficit to 4.7 percent of GDP in the forthcoming fiscal
year from 5 percent of GDP in the current fiscal year, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
The targets are difficult but not beyond reach, Aziz Saud,
adding that besides effective measures the government will
emphasize motivation of the private sector to increase production,
exports and investment.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the confidence that the private sector will give
its full support in ensuring economic growth and the people's
well-being.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the sanctions, he said that though they have
created temporary difficulties, "these have given us an
opportunity to review our traditional approach and look for other
alternatives."
</P>
<P>
"We should translate the determination and expectations of the
nation into a bold strategy capable of facing the new challenges.
I consider these sanctions as a blessing in disguise," the
minister said.

<HEADLINE> Larger Winter Wheat Harvest Forecast in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The production of the U.S.
winter wheat is expected to be increased to 1.74 billion bushels
and more supplies in storage due to sluggish exports, the
Agriculture Department reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
A larger-than-expected crop coupled with more wheat in stock is
likely to continue downward pressure on prices paid to farmers,
which have already hit a seven-year low this month.
</P>
<P>
The price forecast for all varieties of wheat is projected to
be around 3 U.S. dollars a bushel, down more than 1 dollar from
1997 (one bushel of wheat is about 27.24 kilograms).
</P>
<P>
The increased winter wheat estimate is largely due to improving
per-acre yield prospects, according to the department. Farmers are
now expecting to harvest almost 43 bushels of wheat an acre, which
would be second all-time only to last year's 45 bushels.
</P>
<P>
This boost in wheat production comes as exports are expected to
drop some 25 million bushels, mainly because of Asia's economic
crisis, which will translate into ending stocks of 827 million
bushels, up 61 million bushels from the May estimate.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. farmers are still expected to harvest 7
percent less wheat than in 1997. The total U.S. wheat crop is
forecast at 2.3 billion bushels.
</P>
<P>
The current estimate for the 1998 corn crop remained unchanged
from last month at 9.6 billion bushels (a bushel of corn is about
25.42 kilograms). The soybean projection was steady at 2.8 billion
bushels, which would be a record (a bushel of soybeans is some
27.216 kilograms).
</P>
<P>
Estimates for the U.S. corn crop remained virtually unchanged
from last month, including projected prices of up to 2.45 dollars
a bushel.
</P>
<P>
Soybean exports, however, were cut 30 million bushels compared
to the May estimate, which will leave a 10-year high of 425
million bushels in stock once this year's record large crop is
harvested.
</P>
<P>
Soybean prices are expected to remain steady at between 4.75
and 5.75 dollars a bushel.
</P>
<P>
The cotton forecast was lowered 1 million bales compared to
May, mainly because of adverse weather in California and Texas
(one bale of cotton is 480 pounds). Exports and domestic mill use
of cotton are both forecast below last year, and price is down
almost 5 cents a pound from 1997.

<TEXT>

<P>
MONTPELLIER, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian coach Hristo Bonev
said he was very disappointed about the draw with Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
"We're very disappointed not to have won because we were better
than Paraguay. In the first half were in a good position to score.
We had lots of chances but we just couldn't pull it off." said Bonev.
</P>
<P>
Bonev blamed the refree of the match:"Maybe the penalty that the
refree didn't blow at the beginning of the match could have changed
the outcome. But I still think we played very well."
</P>
<P>
The Paraguay coach Paulo Cesar Carpeggiani was also not
satisfied with the result:"We think it's an unfair result--we had a
lot of chances. We should have made full use of the advantage we
had over the Bulgarians."
</P>
<P>
Paraguay's star goal-keeper Jose Luis Chilavert Gonzalez said
after the match:"We feel really at home in Montpellie. That should
have helped us to win. We played well and I'm quite happy. I'm
proud of our quality of play."
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Roberto Acuna of Paraguay blamed their draw with
Bulgaria for poor finishing:"We were not able to score. We're going
to try to win the next match and not lose our calm for the rest of
the competition."

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Poul Thomsen, chief negotiator
for Romania of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), will come to
Bucharest next week to approach a possible new stand-by loan
agreement with the Romanian government.
</P>
<P>
Making the announcement here Friday, IMF representative here
John Hill said that the IMF will send five experts to Bucharest,
who will hold talks primarily on how faithful Romania is to its
governing program over 1998-1999 and whether it is possible to
conclude a new agreement.
</P>
<P>
The latest stand-by agreement Romania concluded with the IMF
expired in May. The agreement, amounting to 301.5 million DST, was
divided in five instalments and could be delivered only if
economic and legislative criteria were satisfied. Romania hasn't
drawn but two of them standing for 120.6 million.
</P>
<P>
Four loan agreements were concluded after 1990 between Romania
and the monetary body but none came to its normal end because the
Romanian party fell short of observing its initial commitments.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile said after his latest
meeting with Poul Thomsen on April that Romania wished to conclude
with the IMF an 18-month agreement instead of 13-month in the
previous agreements, and so did Finance Minister Daniel Daianu.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The International Court of Justice
at the Hague of the Netherlands, ruled Thursday that it has
jurisdiction over the dispute between Nigeria and Cameroun over
the Bakassi Peninsula, which is claimed by both countries.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the oil rich Bakassi in the Altantic was
filed at the international court by Cameroun in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In December 1995, Nigeria filed a preliminary objection on the
jurisdiction of the international court, on the ground that
Cameroun had extended its claim to Nigeria territory, a stretch
of over 1,800 kilometers from the Altantic to Lake Chad Basin.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria also objected on the ground that the dispute could be
handled through bilateral talks or within the Lake Chad Basin
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The dispute has resulted in incessant clashes between Nigeria
and Camerounian troops since 1993.
</P>
<P>
By the ruling of the court Thursday, the two countries are now
obligated to present their claims and evidences to the court,
local press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The hearing of the case may last for several years, reports
said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's New Leader to Meet Parties on Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's new leader General
Abdulsalam Abubakar will meet leaders of the country's five
political parties Saturday on the transition to civil rule
program.
</P>
<P>
Chief Ogbuefi Ozomgbachi, national secretary of the
Grass-roots Democratic Movement, has confirmed the receipt of an
invitation letter dated June 10, The Punch newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting Saturday is believed to be part of the
consultations now going on concerning the transition program,
under which a presidential election is to be held on August 1.
</P>
<P>
The death of late leader General Sani Abacha, however, has
deprived the parties' sole candidate for the election.
</P>
<P>
General Abubakar has pledged to continue with Abacha's
transition program, for which, he said he will consult with all
relevant agencies at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
The country's pro-democracy groups, however, has urged
Abubakar to forget about the transition and hand over power to
Moshood Abiola, the beloved winner of the June 12, 1993 election
annulled by the then military government.
</P>
<P>
Abiola was put into jail by the Abacha government on June 23,
1994, when he announced himself the president of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The pro-democracy groups have vowed to go on with their mass
rallies nationwide Friday to mark the June 12 election, despite
stiff warning from the government.

KHARTOUM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- There have been an upsurge of
meningitis in Sudan with 39 people having died of the disease so far
this year as against seven in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Ra'i Al-Akhar daily here reported Friday that 299 meningitis

<HEADLINE> Annan to Open U.N. Conference on Criminal Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan goes to Rome, Italy, Monday to open the U.N. Diplomatic
Conference on the establishment of the international criminal
court, his spokesman announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting will discuss issues related to the
creation of a permanent judicial institution with a global
jurisdiction to try individuals for war crimes and crimes against
humanity.
</P>
<P>
"The idea now is to create such a court by agreement among
states in the forms of an international treaty," according to a
U.N. backgrounder.
</P>
<P>
A 13-part, 116-article draft statute for the legal body is put
forward for discussion, with a number of political issues
remaining unsolved.
</P>
<P>
They include whether or not state consent would apply with
inherent jurisdiction of the court, whether the prosecutor would
be able to initiate criminal action independent of the Security
Council or the complaint of any state, the backgrounder said.
</P>
<P>
Other issues include whether the Security Council could stop the
course of investigation or prosecution if it considered it a
matter of international peace and security, the definition of war
crimes and whether or not to include the crime or aggression under
the jurisdiction of the court.
</P>
<P>
The conference is expected to finalize and approve a draft
convention to establish the court and the text will be submitted
to the U.N. General Assembly later this year for its
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Annan stays in Rome until Wednesday. He is also scheduled to
open a conference Monday on "crisis management and the NATO reform
-- the test-case of Bosnia for collective security in the next
century."

LONDON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Western members of the six-nation
Contact Group comprising the United States, Russia, Britain,
France, Germany and Italy Friday approved new sanctions against
Yugoslavia, but Russia voiced opposition to these new sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the final press conference after the special
foreign ministers meeting, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said, "President (Slobodan) Milosevic will be making a grave
mistake if he imagines that the international community will be as
slow to respond in Kosovo as it was in Bosnia."
</P>
<P>
Under the final statement, foreign ministers from the United
States, Germany, France, Italy and Britain confirmed their
decision to implement the ban on new investment in Serbia and
freeze funds held abroad by the Belgrade government.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to take steps to ban flights by Yugoslav
carriers between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and their
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov made it
clear that Russia was opposed to all these punishment measures and
possible use of force against Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Primakov told reporters after the meeting, "Measures are being
considered against Yugoslavia. We are against these measures, but
at the same time, there will be an exceptionally important meeting
with Milosevic."
</P>
<P>
Primakove was referring to the meeting between Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and President Milosevic due to take place
in Moscow next week.
</P>
<P>
All the Contact Group ministers "welcomed the invitation by
President Yeltsin to President Milosevic and stressed the
importance of President Milosevic taking advantage of this meeting

Official statistics have showed that Tunisia's exports of

JERUSALEM -- Israel's trade deficit dropped by a dramatic 36

annual terms from November 1997 to May 1998, and imports 2.23
billion dollars, a decrease of 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The declining trade deficit along with the increase of imports of

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian FM Rejects Direct Talks With Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin
Friday rejected a call by Eritrea for direct talks with Ethiopia on an
end to their border war.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark upon his arrival here Friday evening for talks
with Egyptian officials on his country's border conflicts with
Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Direct talks are unacceptable while "occupation" is going on, he
was quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mesfin described the clashes between the two countries as
"explosive" and accused Eritrea of aggression.
</P>
<P>
Showing support to a peace plan proposed by the U.S. and Rwanda and
backed by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), he said Eritrea's
rejection made it difficult to reach a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
The main feature of the four-point U.S.-Rwandan peace proposal is
Eritrea's retreat from the Badme area, under Eritrean control since
May 12, to its 1994 borders, and the reinstatement of the Ethiopian
administration.
</P>
<P>
"The Rwandan-U.S. initiative is still valid. Ethiopia will#o its
best to reach a peaceful solution to the crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea have argued peacefully over their border for
years, but the dispute turned violent on May 6, with each side
accusing the other of incursions. Hundreds of people were reportedly
killed.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian envoy is expected to meet with his Egyptian
counterpart Amr Moussa later Friday and will deliver a message from
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Mesfin paid a one-day visit to Tunisia Thursday where he expounded
his country's viewpoint regarding the Ethiopian-Eritrean border
dispute.
</P>
<P>
He visit came one day after Eritrean Minister of Local
Government Mohamod Sherifo left Cairo after handing over a message to
Mubarak from Eritrean President Issayas Aferwerki.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean minister had asked Mubarak for mediation within the
African initiative to end the devastating struggle between the two
neighboring countries in the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has sent two messages to leaders of both Eritrea and
Ethiopia, calling for an immediate end to fighting to make way for
African mediation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, among the world's poorest, are at odds oveIt
least six areas along their common border. Eritrea gained independence
from Ethiopia in 1993. Their current border row centers on a 400
square kilometers rocky triangle of land along their western border.
</P>
<P>
The OAU has reportedly agreed to send a high-level mediation
team to the disputed border area between Ethiopian and Eritrea for
mediation to end the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The delegation may include six African heads of state on
mediation efforts in Asmara and Addis Ababa.
