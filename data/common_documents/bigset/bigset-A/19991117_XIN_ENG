<HEADLINE> OAU Investigators Leave for Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The first group of
investigators of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) left here
Tuesday for the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to
investigate ceasefire violations.
</P>
<P>
At the Lusaka International Airport, the investigators,
altogether 17 of them, were seen off by Zambian President, DRC
peace mediator Frederick Chiluba, Vice President Chriaston Tembo
and some government ministers.
</P>
<P>
At the send-off ceremony, Chiluba said it is a great
achievement that, in spite of the difficulties met in the
implementation process, the ceasefire has been generally observed
by all the parties.
</P>
<P>
However, the president complained that although the signing of
the ceasefire agreement was greeted with widespread goodwill by
the international community, the goodwill did not translate into
concrete assistance to enable the implementation process to begin
as quickly as expected.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Military Commission (JMC) set up to verify the
implementation of the ceasefire agreement signed in Lusaka in July
and August this year by all the parties involved in the DRC war,
was unable to begin its work principally due to lack of resources,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said for the JMC to start its work, his country has
contributed 100, 000 U.S. dollars. Uganda, Zimbabwe and Namibia
have each pledged a similar amount and South Africa has pledged
one million U.S. dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said OAU has made a pledge of 500,000 dollars, out of
which 300,000 dollars has already been given to the JMC.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba urged all the countries which have made pledges and
those that intend to do so later, to make available these
resources as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The JMC needs the resources urgently, he said.
</P>
<P>
The investigators need the support and cooperation not only of
all their parties, but also that of the whole international
community, said Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
It is learnt that the second group of OAU investigators will
leave here for DRC on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Host Meeting of Quadripartite Coordination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A meeting of the
Quadripartite Coordination Committee at the Ministerial Level on
International Cooperation on Chernobyl will open at the United
Nations on November 18, 1999, a press release said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is aimed at increasing support for the 1999 United
Nations Appeal for International Cooperation on Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
More than 13 years after the tragic nuclear accident, many are
unaware of the serious long-term consequences that are being faced
by some 7 million people in the most affected areas of Belarus,
the Russian Federation and the Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The sad fact is that while the explosive stories of the clouds
of radiation have long since faded from international headlines,
the most serious health ramifications of Chernobyl are yet to be
confronted by the innocent victims. Only a minute fraction of the
resources to help the needy has been mobilized to date.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Appeal, which requests a total of 9.5
million U.S. dollars, is aimed at bringing quick and tangible
relief to the affected communities.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the Quadripartite Coordination Committee
on International Cooperation on Chernobyl is to raise awareness of
the persistent economic, social, health and environmental
consequences of this disaster.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations urges all donors to respond generously to
the appeal, as an act of solidarity with over 7 million innocent
people whose lives have been torn asunder by the Chernobyl
disaster.

<HEADLINE> Poor Weather Hampers Air Strikes on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Federal aircraft flew
no missions over Chechnya Tuesday because of bad weather
conditions and the federal command's determination to avoid
civilian casualties, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The military said that the frontline planes bombed only rebel
positions selected in advance and on targets identified visually,
Interfax reported, citing federal sources.
</P>
<P>
However, Mi-8 and Mi-24 combat helicopters supported federal
forces on the ground in the breakaway republic Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Crews of Su-24 bombers and Su-25 attack planes are in stand-by
status and will resume their combat tasks when the weather
improves, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Su-24 and Su-25 aircraft flew some 50
reconnaissance and attack missions on militant positions. Mi-24
helicopter gunships also flew over 30 flights in support of ground
troops.
</P>
<P>
Federal troops, citing preliminary reports, said air strikes in
the previous day destroyed a rebel ammunition depot, two
anti-aircraft installations, a food storage facility, a command
post and a communications center, five strongholds and 18
vehicles, five of them KAMAZ trucks, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
To prevent attempts by mercenaries to enter Chechnya, Su-24
frontline bombers created another blockage in the mountains of
south Chechnya and also damaged a bridge.
</P>
<P>
As federal forces advance deeper into Chechnya, the Chechen
rebels are stepping up their resistance and intensively preparing
the capital Grozny for an all-out defense, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The militants have planted mines at all industrial facilities
and administrative buildings, the airport and roads into the city,
Interfax quoted the federal forces headquarters in the North
Caucasus as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chechen field commanders Shamil Basayev and Khattab are
directly in charge of preparing the defenses of Grozny, it said.
</P>
<P>
Russia launched the current offensive about seven weeks ago
following armed incursions led by Basayev and Khattab, a Jordanian
native known only by his last name, into neighboring Daghestan and
a spate of apartment building explosions that killed some 300
people in Moscow and two other cities. The Russian authorities
have accused Basayev and Khattab of masterminding the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted military sources as saying that militant
emissaries are actively recruiting mercenaries in neighboring
North Ossetia, Ingushetia and Dagestan, offering monthly wages of
2,000-8,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The federal headquarters, citing operational reports, said over
300 mercenaries have come to Chechnya through Tajikistan,
Azerbaijan and Georgia and that some 500 more trained militants
are expected to be brought into Chechnya from Afghanistan along
the same route.

<HEADLINE> FBI Takes Over EgyptAir 990 Crash Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) of the United States is taking over the
investigation of the crash of EgyptAir 990 from the National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Investigators doubt that the plane crash, which resulted in the
death of all 217 aboard, may have been caused by a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigation found that someone in the cockpit
uttered a prayer before the jet's autopilot disengaged and the
plane started its fatal plunge.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S. rules, the NTSB is in charge of the
investigation of air transportation accidents while the FBI has
jurisdiction over destruction of an aircraft and crimes committed
aboard an aircraft.
</P>
<P>
If investigators conclude the plane was brought down by foul
play, they will try to determine whether the perpetrator was
assisted by a terrorist group in a suicide plot or acted alone
because of a personal problem, the source close to the probe said.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-bound passenger plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean
off the Massachusettes coast 40 minutes after takeoff from the
Kennedy International Airport in New York on October 31.
</P>
<P>
The cockpit voice recorder was recovered from the ocean floor
by a remote-operated robot Saturday after a two-week search.
</P>
<P>
Speculation about a possible hijacking, crew fight or pilot
suicide has lingered because the flight data recorder shows that
the plane's autopilot was turned off, the aircraft put into a
dive, the throttles cut back and the engines shut off.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Fleeing to South Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus News Agency (CNA)
reported Tuesday that 21 Turkish Cypriots have fled northern
Cyprus and arrived at the government-controlled south.
</P>
<P>
These people, including three families, have sought refuge in
the southern coastal town of Limassol, where there is a sizable
Turkish Cypriot community, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Cyprus' Justice and Public Order Minister Nicos
Koshis has pledged the government's determination to help them.
"Cyprus belongs to Turkish Cypriots too and the whole matter will
be examined by the government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south, which was internationally recognized, and the Turkish
Cypriots-controlled breakaway north since 1974 when Turkey invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Koshis said that most of the Turkish Cypriots crossed into
"free areas," the buffer-zone between the two rival sides on the
island, from the British bases in the north and "this is the
reason why it is difficult to control their arrival."
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman of Cyprus' Welfare Department said on Tuesday
that the Cyprus government has dealt with the matter as soon as
these people came to the buffer areas and has made temporary
arrangement on the issue, which she did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Investigations are underway into these people' status, the
spokeswoman said, adding that if they are found to be Turkish
settlers, the matter will be referred to relevant authorities.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots accounted for 18 percent of Cyprus' population
before 1974. However, following the war, the percentage has
declined due to massive influx of Turkish settlers in northern
Cyprus and the emigration of Turkish Cypriots, CNA said.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Appreciates Egypt's Peace Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Foreign Minister
Hong Soon-young on Tuesday voiced appreciation for Egypt's offer
to mediate between his country and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak "has a huge weight not only in
Middle East region but also in the world," Hong, who arrived in
Cairo on Saturday for a four-day visit, told reporters after
meeting with Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Seoul in April, Mubarak proposed to play a
role in mediating a peace agreement between DPRK and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Mubarak reiterated keenness on helping
bring closer the views of the two Koreas, spelling out his
readiness to play a role in mediating between them, Hong said.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate President Mubarak's initiative to set up direct
dialog between the two Koreas and the day will come when this
initiative succeeds in realizing the cherished goal," he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his country's support for Egypt's call for the
elimination of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, and
underlined the importance to maintain consultations on bilateral
economic and trade relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Since opening diplomatic ties in 1995, Egypt and South Korea
have rapidly developed political and economic relations. The
bilateral trade volume amounted to 590 million U.S. dollars in
1997. South Korea has so far invested 160 million dollars in
Egypt.

LUSAKA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The first group of
investigators of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) left here
Tuesday for the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to
investigate ceasefire violations.
</P>
<P>
At the Lusaka International Airport, the investigators,
altogether 17 of them, were seen off by Zambian President, DRC

</P>
<P>
The Joint Military Commission (JMC) set up to verify the
implementation of the ceasefire agreement signed in Lusaka in July
and August this year by all the parties involved in the DRC war,
was unable to begin its work principally due to lack of resources,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said for the JMC to start its work, his country has
contributed 100, 000 U.S. dollars. Uganda, Zimbabwe and Namibia
have each pledged a similar amount and South Africa has pledged
one million U.S. dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said OAU has made a pledge of 500,000 dollars, out of
which 300,000 dollars has already been given to the JMC.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba urged all the countries which have made pledges and
those that intend to do so later, to make available these
resources as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The JMC needs the resources urgently, he said.
</P>
<P>
The investigators need the support and cooperation not only of
all their parties, but also that of the whole international
community, said Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
It is learnt that the second group of OAU investigators will
leave here for DRC on Wednesday.

ATHENS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Two Greek C-130 military
transport planes Tuesday flew humanitarian assistance to Turkey as
part of Greece's efforts to alleviate the repercussions of the
devastating earthquake that hit the neighboring country on
November 12.
</P>

The two aircraft carried three doctors, one mini-bus, 350

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
"oil-for-food" program for Iraq continues to have a positive
impact, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
His latest report, which covers the six-month period through
October 31, to the Security Council provides information on the
distribution of humanitarian supplies throughout Iraq, including
the implementation of the U.N. Inter-Agency Humanitarian Program
in the three northern governorates of Dahuk, Erbil and
Sulaymaniyah.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, 12 million tons of food have arrived
and continue to be distributed efficiently through the Iraqi
government's rationing system, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Health sector supplies worth over 729 million U.S. dollars have
reached Iraq although their adequacy varies according to the type
of drugs and supplies in question.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general notes that he would like to see the
government pay greater attention to providing basic medicines and
developing primary and preventive health care services.
</P>
<P>
Among his conclusions, the secretary-general stresses that in
order to maintain or increase the momentum of the program,
improvement in contracting, processing application, delivery and
distribution of supplies were "essential."

<HEADLINE> Russia Backs U.N. Efforts on Cyprus Issue: Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A Russian diplomat said here
Tuesday that Russia will discuss at the United Nations Security
Council the U.N. invitation to the two sides of Cyprus for
indirect talks over the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with Cyprus' House of Representatives
(parliament) Speaker Spyros Kyprianou, now the acting president,
Russian Charge d'Affaires to Cyprus Sergei Rokov said Russia will
back the U.N. efforts aimed at a settlement to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has extended invitations to
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash to "proximity talks" at the U.N. headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
Rokov pointed out that Russia supports a solution based on the
relevant U.N. decisions.
</P>
<P>
Annan said on Sunday that both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot sides have accepted to invitation to appear at the talks
on December 3 to prepare the ground for "meaningful negotiations"
towards a comprehensive settlement.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the fact that Annan's invitation does not
refer to the U.N. resolutions on Cyprus, Rokov said "this is
something which we will discuss in New York with Mr. Annan and the
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council."
</P>
<P>
He said Russia "will surely support" the secretary-general's
effort so as to secure "good results."
</P>
<P>
As for his meeting with Kyprianou, Rokov said they discussed
various issues of common interest which covered the current
situation on Cyprus and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to settle the Cyprus issue have remained deadlocked
over the past two years as the Turkish Cypriots, backed by Turkey,
insist that their breakaway state in northern Cyprus be
internationally recognized and talk with Nicosia on state-to-state
basis.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot entity is recognized only by Ankara.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- For the third time in his drug-
ruined career, Ben Johnson, the Toronto sprinter, has been
reported to develop a positive result on a doping test.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 37, protested in Toronto Monday against a report by
the German news agency DPA that he failed a random drug test on
October 7 by the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport.
</P>
<P>
"They"re calling it a masking agent, but I wasn't taking
anything that I'd have to mask it. They didn't find anything else,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have to laugh. This is unreal. Any time it's close for me to
get reinstated or to run fast, something happened," the former
sprinter declared, denying any wrong-doing.
</P>
<P>
He said the test apparently discovered traces of a water pill
he had been given by a Los Angeles pharmacist after he went into a
drugstore complaining of painful bloating.
</P>
<P>
The DPA report came after Johnson announced plans for an anti-
drug foundation this summer in the hope that the world governing
body of track would allow him to return to competition.
</P>
<P>
He was banned from competition for life in 1993 after a second
positive doping test.
</P>
<P>
But Johnson continues to train despite the rejection by the
world organization of his appeal for return.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Resorts to Referendum for Political System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Referendum is the best way for
the Ugandan people to decide on the political system the country
will have after the year 2000, a parliamentary spokesman has said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua Tuesday afternoon, Parliament
Spokesman Kagole Kivumbi said that referendum is the fairest and
most democratic way for the parties in the country to compete.
</P>
<P>
"A referendum will not put any party in a favorable or
unfavorable condition," he said, adding that it is the people's
constitutional right to choose their own political system.
</P>
<P>
He said the Parliament has postponed its debate on the
Political Parties Bill which is said to give more freedom to other
parties.
</P>
<P>
Under Uganda's Constitution enacted in 1995, no political
parties are allowed to hold conferences and run for election.
However, party members can run for election in his/her personal
capacity.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution stipulates that a referendum should be held to
decide the country's political system after the National
Resistance Movement (NRM) rules for five years. It is widely
expected that the NRM will win the referendum.

ISLAMABAD, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. official said here

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Yet Lose Its Vote in U.N. General Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Appropriating nearly 1
billion U.S. dollars in back dues and assessments to the United
Nations might not be enough to prevent the United States from
losing its vote in the General Assembly next year, U.N. officials
said.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.N. official, according to a New York Times report
published Tuesday, estimated that the United States must come up
with at least 350 million U.S. dollars by the end of December to
avoid forfeiting its vote.
</P>
<P>
But legislation worked out by U.S. Senator Jesse Helms,
Republican of North Carolina, and U.S. Senator Joseph R. Biden
Jr., Democrat of Delaware, would initially pay only 100 million
U.S. dollars, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"The possibility of the United States' losing its vote is real
because the United Nations Charter says that any country failing
two years behind will be stripped of its right to vote until it
repays the debt," the newspaper said. "Usually only nations mired
in poverty fall sufficiently behind to lose their votes."
</P>
<P>
At present, the U.S. arrears totaled some 1.7 billion U.S.
dollars, and its refusal to pay the debt in full, in time and
without conditions has led the United States into isolation at the
world body.

<HEADLINE> India to Seek Issue-based alliances at WTO Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- India would seek
"issue-based" alliances on a quid-pro-quo basis to maximize gains
in areas of national concern like social and environmental clauses
at the World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting at Seattle towards
the end of this month, a cabinet minister said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with major political party leaders, Minister
for Commerce and Industry Thiru Murasoli Maran said though New
Delhi was "not writing on a clean slate" on various trade issues,
the government's endeavor would be to protest India's interests
and "optimize" the benefits to be gained from multilateral trading
system.
</P>
<P>
the comparative advantages of countries particularly low-wage
developing countries in no way be put into question by erecting
such non-tariff barriers to trade, Maran told Congress and left
parties which wanted the government to adopt "pro-active" role at
Seattle to protect the national interests.
</P>
<P>
Both the Congress and left parties were unanimous that India's
approach should be to firmly resist the trade-labor standards
linkage and attempt to enlarge the environmental window in the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
The interactive meetings with various parties were held
separately and would continue till Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> IMF Expects 6 Pct Growth for Thailand Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's economy, on the
U.S. dollar term, is expected to grow by five to six percent next
year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s Thailand Mission
Chief Ranji Teja said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Foreign Correspondent Club of Thailand, Teja
said the IMF expects the Thai economy to grow by four percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Thai government forecast a three to four percent
growth rate for the country's gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Teja said the expected growth will not be driven by investment
but by consumption, which is "turning around."
</P>
<P>
However, he didn't expect to see consumption reach the
pre-crisis level in 1996 because people will not spend so much for
fear that the economy may turn bad or they may lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
The IMF official said that Thailand's inflation situation this
year is "benign" at zero percent, while it could rise to two
percent next year.
</P>
<P>
"The export performance is quite good," he said, adding that
exports growth may reach five percent this year and even higher
next year.
</P>
<P>
As for the reserves, he said the situation is quite secure,
citing that Thailand had withdrawn from the 17.2-billion-dollar
IMF rescue package in September.
</P>
<P>
Looking back at the financial crisis, Teja said he still thinks
that free capital flow is the right way for development.
</P>
<P>
The lesson people should learn from the crisis is that capital
flows with no regulations of how they are used can be very
dangerous, he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite giving a rather optimistic forecast for the Thai
economic growth next year, Teja said IMF does not expect the
economy returns to its heydays of nine to ten percent growth
before the crisis.

HARARE, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Minister of the Lands
and Agriculture Ministry of Zimbabwe Olivia Muchena has said
economic growth in Sub-Sahara Africa largely depends on the
performance of the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening a regional implementation workshop for the
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)-funded
projects in Bulawayo on Tuesday, Muchena said improved
agricultural productivity depends, in turn, on development and
adoption of better farming technologies.
</P>
<P>
"We have high expectations that the collective expertise and
experience in IFAD-funded projects can offer specific
recommendations that can be used to contribute to the economic
growth and uplift the living standards of farmers living in
marginal areas," she said.
</P>
<P>
She commended IFAD for implementing projects and programs in
Zimbabwe which have increased access to productive resources by
smallholder farmers and enhanced food security through sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
IFAD is currently funding the smallholder dry areas resource
management project, the south-eastern dry areas project and the
smallholder irrigation support program in the African country, she
said.
</P>
<P>
She said that these projects will focus on demand-driven
research and extension, aiming at development of livestock,
wildlife and dry-land crop production techniques appropriate in
marginal rainfall regions.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 agricultural economists, administrators and farmer
representatives from eastern and southern Africa are attending the
four-day workshop.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
is preparing a new electricity policy to end a state-owned power
company's monopoly in the energy sector by allowing domestic or
foreign private companies to invest in the field.
</P>
<P>
The new policy will be implemented soon after it is approved by
the cabinet, Minister for Energy and Minerals Abdallah Kigoda said
at a meeting of the Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited
Master Workers Council Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kigoda admitted that electricity tariffs in his country are
very high compared with other east African countries and it is
posing a threat to Tanzania's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania Electric Supply Company Ltd. is charging over 14
U.S. cents per unit while other countries charge six cents per
unit.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government has welcomed more private power
generation as it reviews its energy policy to allow for both power
generation and distribution in order to reach the majority people

<HEADLINE> Canadian Minister Confirms WTO Deal with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Trade Minister
Pierre Pettigrew Tuesday confirmed his country's readiness to sign
a deal with China on its entry into the World Trade Organization
(WTO) in 20 days.
</P>
<P>
"Canada is well advanced in its negotiations with China and we
are confident that we can reach an agreement before the next WTO
Ministerial Meeting in Seattle, November 30 to December 3, 1999,"
the minister told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He believes that "China chances of joining the WTO are not only
good but that its entry is imminent," once the multilateral
agreement in the WTO is negotiated on China's accession.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks to Xinhua a day after China and
the U.S. signed a breakthrough agreement in Beijing on China's
entry into the 130-plus-member WTO.
</P>
<P>
China is yet to reach similar deals with Canada and the
European Union in her efforts of 13 years to join the world's
biggest trade body.
</P>
<P>
Both the United States and Canada are seeing bright prospects
for the global economy with the participation of more than 1
billion Chinese people in WTO.

<HEADLINE> UK Inflation Rises Slightly in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 16 (Xinhua) - The UK's underlying rate of
inflation which excludes mortgage interest payments, crept up to
2.2 percent in October, rising from 2.1 percent the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
The figures released by the Office for National Statistics
Tuesday shows the headline rate was also up at 1.2 percent
compared to 1.1 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
The main reason given for the rise in inflation was an increase
in motoring costs, with both insurance premiums and petrol prices
higher.
</P>
<P>
The headline rate was also affected by mortgage lenders passing
on part of the September rise in interest rates to homeowners.
</P>
<P>
City analysts were expecting the October figures to show little
change from September, when the headline rate was at a 36-year
low.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England, in its latest quarterly inflation report
last week, forecast that inflation would fall still further next
year before climbing back up to target level at the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts believe that the Bank will still raise interest
rates - currently 5.5 percent - to about 6 percent in the spring
to choke off any build-up to inflationary pressures.

<P>
The officials said that coffee prices increased by between 21
to 29 U.S. dollars per bag (50-kg) from the pervious auction two

Tuesday's auction at the Nairobi Coffee Exchange saw the sale
of all 23, 377 bags it offered, compared with 22,504 bags for the
last auction.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Dairy Firms Want Compensation Over Dioxin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian Dairy Industry
Confederation (CBL) expressed Tuesday hopes to get compensation
for losses in damages because of dioxin-fear crisis.
</P>
<P>
The CBL said it would sue the Belgian government for about 2.5
billion Belgian francs (64 million U.S. dollars) in damages over
its "incompetent" handling of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Five months after the peak of the crisis, dairy companies have
still not received a penny," CBL lawyer Didier Putzeys said in a
written statement.
</P>
<P>
The country's dairy industry has been since the end of May this
year when the government found that the cancer-causing chemical
dioxin had entered into the food chain through contaminated animal
feed.
</P>
<P>
Millions of dollars worth of food products had been pulled out
of shelves throughout the country while many countries around the
world had banned the Belgian food.
</P>
<P>
The CBL said in the statement that its 39 dairy firms faced
huge bills to recall, store and destroy dairy products, compensate
customers, and rebuild its shattered public image. These costs
were unfair because no dairy products had been found to be
tainted.
</P>
<P>
"The dairy industry was dragged into this crisis completely
unjustly," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"What's more, the sector was the only one in the food industry
to have a dioxin monitoring system."
</P>
<P>
The CBL also accused the Belgian government of incompetence,
citing insufficient supervision, delay in providing information
and lingering problems with establishing lists of suspect firms.
</P>
<P>
"Because the Belgian state has not given us a single positive
signal, the CBL feels obliged to take the matter to a tribunal,"
the CBL said, adding it was ready to stop legal moves at any time
if given such a gesture.

LAGOS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria would cut back its
petroleum import for the first time in recent years thanks to the
improvement of its refineries, the state-run Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation said Tuesday.

<P>
Jackson Gaius-Obaseki, General Manager of the corporation, told
an oil industry conference in Lagos that no fresh orders were
planned for the first quarter of 2000 since the existing stock had

"We're producing more gasoline," the general manager said,
adding that if the entire system shuts down today, there's still
enough gasoline for the most populous African country in the next
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Despite being Africa's biggest oil producer, Nigeria has been
forced to import fuel by the failure of its four refineries with
an output capacity of 445,000 barrels per day.

<HEADLINE> UNFPA Sends Maternal Health Supplies to Orissa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Populations Fund (UNFPA) is shipping emergency reproductive health
supplies, including equipment for the safe delivery of newborn
infants, to victims of the cyclone in Orissa, India, the agency
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fund is responding to a request for help from the state
government of Orissa.
</P>
<P>
The supplies will arrive in India on November 17 and will be
distributed through the state health system and international aid
agencies. UNFPA is part of the United Nations - coordinated relief
for cyclone victims in the eastern Indian coastal state.
</P>
<P>
The supplies arriving next week can be used at local health
centers by doctors to carry out normal deliveries, to perform
sutures under local anaesthesia, and to stabilize potentially
dangerous conditions such as haemorrhage before transferring
patients to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
Other equipment being sent is intended for more complicated
deliveries and can be used to perform caesarean sections and to
resuscitate mothers and babies.
</P>
<P>
UNFPA has been working in several very poor districts of Orissa
prior to the cyclone which hit the state of Orissa weeks ago,
assisting local governments and communities groups in the areas of
reproductive health, family planning and women's empowerment.
</P>
<P>
UNFPA is the largest internationally funded source of
population assistance to developing countries. The Fund assists
developing countries to improve reproductive health and family
planning services on the basis of individual choice, and to
formulate population policies in support of efforts towards
sustainable development.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Top Legislator Calls on Mauritian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PORT LOUIS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese top
legislator Li Peng called on Mauritian President Cassam Uteem on
Tuesday and expressed his hope that the two countries will expand
their sincere and fruitful cooperation to all fields.
</P>
<P>
Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress, told Uteem that China is ready to expand such an
cooperation with Mauritius in political, economic, cultural and
other fields on the basis of mutual respect, equality and treating
each other on equal footing.
</P>
<P>
He said since the two countries established diplomatic ties 27
years ago, bilateral exchanges and cooperation have been growing
steadily and the common ground shared by China and Mauritius on
some important international issues has also been expanding.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Mauritian exchanges can be traced back to as early as the
middle of the 18th century, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 200 years, the population of Chinese Mauritians
has surpassed 30,000. "They have made contribution to the
friendship between the two countries," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Uteem said Chinese Mauritians, together with other ethnic
groups on the island, have made great contribution to the
development of Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
He said Port Louis now has frequent exchanges with its sister
city of Foshan in China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Uteem voiced his confidence that Mauritius-China relations will
continue to develop.
</P>
<P>
The Mauritian president told Li that Mauritius is also willing
to expand cooperation with China in international organizations.
</P>
<P>
And the member countries of the Indian Ocean Rim Association
for Regional Cooperation (IORARC) also hope that China will
establish relations of cooperation with the IORARC, Uteem added.
</P>
<P>
Li reiterated that China, also a developing country, attaches
great importance to enhancing unity and cooperation with all other
developing countries including Mauritius. "We will stick to the
policy," Li reassured.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here on Monday evening for a two-day official
goodwill visit aimed at enhancing bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Mauritius is the first leg of Li's six-nation tour of Africa
and Asia. After concluding his visit here Wednesday, Li will
proceed to South Africa, Kenya, Israel, Palestine and Oman.

<HEADLINE> China's Entry to WTO to Benefit Chilean Trade: Press </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The entrance of China into
the World Trade Organization (WTO) would mean great benefits for
the Chilean economy, said the newspaper "El Mercurio" on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that China's entry into the WTO would enormously
help the negotiation of the exchange of products, in addition to
the solutioning of problems between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to director of multilateral affairs attached to the
Chilean Foreign Ministry Mario Matus, the eventual inclusion of
China in the WTO is essential for Chile, and would bring many
benefits to the Chilean economy.
</P>
<P>
It was still early to predict which local products would be
favored, as this depends on the results of talks between China and
the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
Matus believed that the agricultural field is one of the areas
with the highest potential growth, as it is one of Chile's
strongest export markets, said the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Cermis Tragedy: Compensation Bill to Victims Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Italian Lower House's Defense
Committee Tuesday approved a bill to provide financial damages to
the families of the Cermis tragedy's victims.
</P>
<P>
In February 1998, a U.S. Marine jet sliced a ski-lift cable in
Mt. Cermis of northern Italy, sending 20 tourists aboard a
cable-car to their death.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which sets aside 76 billion lire ( about 42 million
U.S. dollars) for the 20 families, now goes to the Senate where it
is expected to meet with speedy approval.
</P>
<P>
According to the NATO charter, the United States will reimburse
three quarters of the 3.8 billion lire ( about 2.1 million U.S.
dollars) that will be paid to each of the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
Defense Committee Chair Valdo Spini recalled that U.S.
President Bill Clinton had attempted to authorize immediate
compensation but was foiled by the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
The measure passed Tuesday also envisages the appointment of a
special commissioner to assess and authorize other claims.
</P>
<P>
The disaster occurred when the tailfin of a U.S. Marine EA-6B
Prowler surveillance plane sliced the Cermis ski-lift cable during
a ground-hugging training flight out of the NATO air-base at
nearby Aviano.
</P>
<P>
Seven Germans, five Belgians, three Italians, two Poles, two
Austrians and one Dutch citizen were killed in the incident.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Marine Captain Richard Ashby, pilot of the low-flying
plane, was freed in October after five months of detention.
</P>
<P>
Ashby was charged with but cleared of manslaughter charges in
the case but sentenced to six month's detention for concealing a
video of the flight.

<HEADLINE> Entrepreneurs in Fujian Welcome Sino-US WTO Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Entrepreneurs in Fujian
Province, east China, have expressed their satisfaction over the
Sino-U.S. agreement on China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"In the long run, China's entry into WTO will benefit China's
automotive industry. And the dream of the ordinary Chinese to have
a car will be realized earlier," said Ling Yuzhang, chairman of
the board of the province's Automotive Industrial (Group)
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Ling said that although the 16 automobile manufacturers in the
province will be somewhat affected, most of their products are
middle-grade and not competitive with the imported high-grade cars.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Guoqiang, assistant to the general manager of the Xiamen
Overseas Chinese Electronics Co., a leading color TV producer,
said that after China's entry to WTO, fierce competition will
emerge in the appliance market. The company will reduce the cost
of their products and improve aftersale services to compete with
foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the cancellation of trade barriers after China's
accession to the WTO will help increase the company's
international competitive power, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yongxin, vice general manager of the Nanfu Battery Co. Ltd.
said that the company has been competitive with foreign firms and
occupied a large share of China's battery market because of their
high-quality products. The entry to WTO will not have much of an
impact on the company.
</P>
<P>
Nanfu batteries have been exported to 56 countries and regions
all over the world. The entry to WTO will bring more capital,
technology and talent to the company, which will help further
sharpen its competitive edge, said Chen.

<HEADLINE> HK CE Meets International Advisors on Economic Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 17 (Xinhua) -- China's accession to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) would be good for China, good for
the world and good for Hong Kong, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region Tung Chee Hwa said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive met his Council of International Advisors,
comprising distinguished world business and corporate leaders,
Wednesday to discuss the global economic outlook and Hong Kong's
long-term development strategy.
</P>
<P>
On China's entry into the WTO, Tung said his advisors believed
this would be very beneficial to world trade, and would be good
for China and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Overall trade with China's mainland will increase and the pie
will get larger. Hong Kong stands to gain, particularly its
service industries which will gain access to a much larger market,
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
According to Tung, he and his international advisors reviewed
economic prospects in North America, Europe, Japan and East Asia.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also covered Hong Kong's latest economic
performance, its international positioning as a world class city
and international tourist destination, and its close economic ties
with China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
The international advisors held that while the Asian economies
had improved, reform measures must continue, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said his advisors held the view that growth in Western
economies would be sustained, and Hong Kong would stand to benefit
and its economy should continue to achieve positive growth in real
terms in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The advisors noted that last year's intervention by the Hong
Kong government in the stock market was effective.
</P>
<P>
"The advisers consider that the linked exchange rate has served
Hong Kong well and plays a key role in underpinning Hong Kong's
economic stability," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive said his advisers believed that Hong Kong
needs to continue its efforts to enhance its competitiveness, to
continue to adjust its cost structure and to maintain its
attractiveness as an international business center.
</P>
<P>
"The advisors support our policy initiatives to upgrade our
quality of life by improving the environment, and to improve
education and the standard of English. " Tung said.
</P>
<P>
These measures will attract investments and quality personnel
to Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
The advisors believe that Hong Kong is well placed to
capitalize on its position as a global financial center, given its
strengths, quality physical infrastructure, resourcefulness of
human capital and unique economic links with the mainland, he said.
</P>
<P>
To sustain Hong Kong's economic development, Tung's advisors
raised some proposals including making preparations to maximize
the opportunities flowing from China's entry into the WTO, and
looking for ways to improve Hong Kong's business environment and
to strengthen its competitiveness.

<HEADLINE> 2 Hezbollah Fighters Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Two members of a leading
anti-Israel Lebanese guerrilla group were killed in an armed
confrontation with Israeli forces in south Lebanon, the group's
statement said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jihad Hojazi, 26, and Ali Al Khatib, 22, died on Tuesday of
injuries sustained last week in attacks against Israeli outposts
inside the Israeli-occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Late in the day, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah held a mass
funeral for the two "martyrs" attended by thousands of its
supporters on the southern suburb of the capital city Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of this year, a total of 32 Lebanese
guerrillas, mostly from Hezbollah, have been killed in south
Lebanon while 13 Israeli soldiers were also killed over the same
period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by Hezbollah, or
Party of God, has since been fighting to oust the Israeli forces
from the country.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Election Commission to Form Probe Body on By-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Election Commission
(EC) on Wednesday decided to form a probe body to investigate into
allegations on the recently held by-elections to the Jatiya
Sangsad (parliament), the official BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The four-member committee would submit its report to the EC
within 10 days after its formation.
</P>
<P>
The committee would investigate into the written allegations
raised by Abdul Kader Siddiqui, an independent candidate in the
by-polls and an expelled ruling Awami League (AL) leader, and
different election monitoring bodies and national dailies, the BSS
quoted an EC source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kader Siddiqui, in a letter on Tuesday evening, urged the chief
election commissioner to take necessary actions against "rigging
and casting of false votes" in the by-election in the Tangail-8
constituency, about 80 kilometers northwest of here, and the EC
has been seeking consents from the Law Ministry and the Supreme
Court to form the probe body.
</P>
<P>
AL candidate Shawkat Momen Shahjahan bagged 75,975 votes from
78 of the 82 polling centers in the by-election on Monday,
defeating his nearest rival, Siddiqui, who received over 60,148
votes, according to the EC. Polling in four polling centers were
suspended due to violence and alleged rigging.
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui, who resigned from the parliament after he was
dispelled from the party for "violating party discipline" earlier
this year, had rejected the election, saying massive rigging was
done by the ruling party, press reports said.
</P>
<P>
"I will not accept the result whether I win or lose," he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The by-election, which was boycotted by major opposition
parties, was marked by violence, intimidation, impersonated and
multiple voting, police firing and closure of polling stations,
the Fair Election Monitoring Alliance was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Russia Accuses U.N. Official of Twisting Facts on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government
Wednesday accused U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary
Robinson of "completely misunderstanding" the current situation in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The comment was made in response to Robinson's statement
Tuesday in Geneva that serious violations of individual rights and
humanitarian laws have taken place in the breakaway republic of
Chechnya, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"This statement by Mary Robinson demonstrates her lack of
understanding of the current situation in Chechnya," the Russian
Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Our impression is that the high commissioner is influenced by
the forces that are putting pressure on Russia in connection with
the events in the North Caucasus," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Robinson kept silent while militants committed massive and
gross violations of human rights. They took hostages, conducted
executions, engaged in slave trading, and dealt in torture and
murder," it added.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the high commissioner "did not respond to
the bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk and Volgodonsk," which killed
some 300 people.
</P>
<P>
The statement vowed that "the Russian authorities must fight
terrorists and bandits," criticizing Robinson of giving "a
statement on the basis of obviously distorted information."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. secretary general's special representative Sadako
Ogata is expected to visit the region in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Ogata, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Wednesday met
with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. She will also meet
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said Ogata would visit Chechen territory controlled by
the federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
Moscow hopes that Ogata's trip to the North Caucasus,
including Chechnya and Ingushetia, will help her "assess the
situation in this region objectively and coordinate humanitarian
relief for this region through U.N. agencies," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia is prepared to brief the UN and the
international society the actual situation in the North Caucasus,
adding that "there is nothing to conceal. Our policy is open and
clear."

<HEADLINE> Chechnya Issue to Overshadow Summit: OSCE Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chechnya issue will cast
a shadow over the upcoming summit of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Norwegian Foreign Minister and
the organization's Chairman-in-Office Knut Vollebaek said here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Vollebaek said Chechnya will
be one of the major issues to be discussed at the summit, a move
likely to irritate Russia, which insists that the issue is its
internal affair.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov stressed that
Moscow does not want the Chechnya issue discussed at the summit,
saying "local matters" should be avoided at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Vollebaek expressed the hope that the
issue will not affect the signing of an adaptation agreement to
the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, which has been
viewed as a corner stone of European security.
</P>
<P>
Though admitting Russia's right to safeguard sovereignty and
territorial integrity and fight terrorism, Vollebaek accused the
country of using force in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Vollebaek's accusation was echoing the United States and other
western governments' call for an end to Russia's offensive in the
rebel Russian republic.
</P>
<P>
Russian troops backed by tanks and artillery are launching
large scale attacks on the Chechnya-based militants, who twice
invaded neighboring Dagestan this summer and are blamed for a
series of apartment bombings across Russia that killed over 300
people in September.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin said Monday that Russia will
not curb its military offensive in Chechnya under western
pressure, and vowed to continue until all rebel fighters have been
wiped out.
</P>
<P>
"We won't stop as long as a single terrorist remains on our
territory," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that western countries "have no right to criticize
Russia for exterminating bandits, murderers who cut off their
victims' heads, and terrorists on its territory."
</P>
<P>
Vollebaek told reporter that the Russian decision to allow an
OSCE chairmanship delegation to visit Ingushetia is welcomed as a
first step to settlement of the Chechnya conflict.
</P>
<P>
The delegation was in Ingushetia, another Russian republic
neighboring Chechnya where Chechen refugees have fled the
fighting, to prepare a report on the refugees' situation for the
summit.
</P>
<P>
However, Vollebaek said the delegation has not been allowed to
visit northern Chechnya as Russia saw it as incompatible with the
OSCE mandate.
</P>
<P>
Vollebaek expressed the hope that Russia will allow the OSCE to
open an office in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim-populated Chechnya declared independence in October
1991, which has never been recognized by Russia.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE summit, due here Thursday and Friday, will mainly
deal with the organization's future role, arms control, regional
conflicts and economic cooperation.

LONDON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army (IRA)
Wednesday announced it is ready to appoint a go-between to begin
talks with Northern Ireland's disarmament mediator only when a
power-sharing government is set up in the province.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time for the outlawed group to address
disarmament in a positive light, changing its attitude that the
subject was not one for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said that a Protestant-Catholic power-sharing
executive could be established by December 8.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by IRA said the IRA middleman would be in
contact with retired Canadian general John de Chastelain, head of
Northern Ireland's disarmament commission.
</P>
<P>
"The IRA is willing to further enhance the peace process and
consequently, following the establishment of the institutions
agreed on Good Friday last year, the IRA leadership will appoint a
representative to enter into discussions with General John de
Chastelain and the Independent International Commission on
Decommissioning," it said.

<HEADLINE> Gas Processing System Bringing Changes to Rural Areas in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The advent of a marsh gas
generating system in Chinese villages has turned human and
domestic animal excrement into a fueling material to solve cooking
fuel and sanitation problems.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Agriculture said China's
countryside is susceptible to flies and mosquitoes because there
no effective dejecta cleaning and treatment services offered.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of infectious diseases has dropped by 80 percent
in Tiantang Village in Gongcheng County, the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region in southwest China, since a marsh gas fueling
system was installed to 140 households in the village in 1993.
Bacteria and the eggs of insects can be eliminated through
anaerobic zymolysis, said local technicians.
</P>
<P>
The natural environment around the village has been much
improved as people do not need to use timber as kindling. An
estimated 2,133 hectares of timber is protected every year because
of the this new form of energy. 420,000 households in Guangxi have
installed the methane-generating system, which has helped save 290,
000 hectares of forest.
</P>
<P>
In Hubei Province, central China, the energy has replaced coal
as the main source of fuel in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
"The reform in energy leads the way for sustainable development
in China's vast rural areas," said Gu Shuhua, a professor with
Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
Statistics provided by the Ministry of Agriculture show that a
6-8 cubic meter methane-generating gas pit can produce enough gas
to last a household for a year and is equal to the energy of
burning 2.5 tons of straw and tree branches.
</P>
<P>
In Gongcheng County, the farmers who use the gas save 1,994
yuan, compared with those who still employ traditional forms of
fuel. This gives a strong incentive to using this new form of
energy.
</P>
<P>
Women are the most ardent supporters for this new form of
energy because they do the cooking. In many Chinese villages,
cooking occupies most of the daily chores of women. However, with
marsh gas, cooking becomes as easy and convenient as in urban
areas which use coal or natural gas.

<HEADLINE> Normalcy Returns to Sri Lanka's Ghost Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Defense Ministry
said Wednesday that normalcy was returning to the northern town of
Vavuniya which had almost been deserted last week due to threats
of attack from Tamil Tiger rebels.
</P>
<P>
A ministry statement said, "more than 40 percent of the shops
have been opened and large crowds were observed moving" in
Vavuniya, about 250 km north of the capital Colombo.
</P>
<P>
It said around 60 percent of the government officials have
reported for duty and most of the government departments have been
functioning satisfactorily.
</P>
<P>
Traffic resumed as public and private buses have operated from
Vavuniya, said the statement, adding that there were no reports of
people leaving the area.
</P>
<P>
Tamil Tiger rebels on Wednesday withdrew its earlier request
for people to leave Vavuniya in view of the difficult conditions
that displaced people had encountered.
</P>
<P>
But the rebels of separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) in a clandestine radio broadcast asked people to stay away
from the main army camp in Vavuniya, saying the camp could still
be attacked.
</P>
<P>
Up to 100,000 people have reportedly fled the once-bustling
town last week after repeated threats of attack since last
Wednesday from the LTTE rebels who have overrun 10 smaller towns
and capture a vast area of territory from government troops
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The government poured thousands of army reinforcements into
Vavuniya in the past week to resist any possible rebel advance.
</P>
<P>
The ministry statement said conflicts continued on Tuesday
between government troops and the rebels in Sri Lanka's north and
east. Nine rebels were killed in three separate incidents while a
soldier and a civilian were killed in another two clashes.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting for a separate state for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Manila Readies 8,000 Houses for State Employees: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Wednesday that the government is ready to distribute
some 6,000 to 8,000 socialized and low-cost housing units to
public school teachers, policemen, and other government workers.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said in a radio speech that these houses are among the
more than 25,000 housing units that were left unoccupied during
the previous administration after private contractors and
developers submitted fictitious applicants to collect money from
the government.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he has already ordered an investigation to uncover
those behind this anomaly.
</P>
<P>
The president also voiced confidence that his government would
be able to meet its target of building 350,000 housing units each
year for the next five years, especially after the private sector
gave full support behind the government's mass housing program.
</P>
<P>
"Our target is reachable. I've already consulted with the
private sector and housing experts and they said that this is
possible," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Estrada noted he will tap the private sector by
issuing housing bonds to generate at least 90 billion pesos (2.25
billion U.S. dollars) each year for the mass housing program.

<HEADLINE> Editorial: Keeping Sound Economic Growth to Welcome New Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Central Economic Working
Conference that concluded today is a vital part of China's
transcentury development strategy, says an editorial to be
published Thursday in the People's Daily, the nation's leading
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, headlined Keeping Sound Economic Growth to
Welcome the New Century, points out that the meeting was held at a
key point in China's reform and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
Five high-level tasks for the year 2000 were scheduled at the
meeting. Topics for discussion included the ongoing implementation
of a series of policies and measures to stimulate economic growth,
expansion of domestic demand and restructuring of the economy, as
well as accelerating scientific advancement to improve the country
's technological abilities.
</P>
<P>
These major tasks also cover technological upgrading of
industrial enterprises, deepening economic reform of state-owned
enterprises, and the ongoing push to improve people's living
standards.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says the year 2000, which represents the end of
one century and the beginning of another, is the final year of
China's ninth Five-Year Plan (1996 to 2000).
</P>
<P>
Economic growth is necessary at the dawn of the 21st century,
and succeeding in the five set tasks will guarantee stable, rapid
economic growth and encourage overall social development.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that led by the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China with Jiang Zemin at the core, China has
been witnessing major victory in 1999 amid various challenges and
severe tests.
</P>
<P>
China has many favorable conditions for maintaining its steady
economic growth in the coming years, it says.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the editorial says, officials at various levels,
especially senior officials, should direct the Party and people to
speed up the country's modernization drive. In order to implement
decisions made by the conference, the Party's leadership over the
economic work should be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
It points out that the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation could
not be achieved without the leadership of the Party. Under the new
situation, Party officials at various levels, especially the
senior officials, should continue to learn as much as they can
about new technology and improve their management skills.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait, Bahrain Back GCC Development March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait and Bahrain
expressed here Wednesday their support for the development of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states, apparently showing unity
ahead of the GCC summit due in Saudi Arabia later this month.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting between Kuwaiti Emir Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah
and his visiting Bahraini counterpart Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa
Al-Khalifa, the emirs stressed the necessity to support the march
of the GCC members for the welfare of their stability and security.
</P>
<P>
GCC leaders will gather in the Saudi capital Riyadh on
November 27 to tackle economic issues among members, and find ways
to strengthen inter-GCC relations affected by disputes between
members or with outside countries.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance
established in 1981, comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti-Bahraini talks also tackled bilateral relations,
stressing coordination and continuous discussions between the
leadership of the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Hamad arrived here earlier Wednesday for a one-day official
visit, the first since he took power following the death of his
father Sheikh Isa Bin Salman Al-Khalifa last March.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, the Bahraini emir said his visit will
consolidate the deep-rooted relations between his country and
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Since Kuwait and Bahrain are members of the GCC, the two states
are also closely bounded economically. Bilateral trade was
registered at 22 million Bahraini dinars ( 58.52 million
U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait Stock Exchange was also linked up with Bahrain Stock
Market under an accord signed in 1997 on boosting cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Nearly 80 Billion Dollars Spent to Improve China's Highway Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- China has so far injected
nearly 80 billion U.S. dollars into highway construction projects
now underway throughout the country, Vice Minister of
Communications Li Juchang said today.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1999 alone, the country has invested 180
billion yuan (some 22 billion U.S. dollars) on highways, and more
than 22,980 kilometers of trunk roads are being built.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, China's total length of highway open
to traffic will reach 1.3 million kilometers, the official said,
adding that this means more remote towns and villages will have
access to better roads.
</P>
<P>
"All the projects are proceeding rapidly and we are also making
great efforts to improve the quality of highway construction," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Expressways are a major part of the current construction plan.
By the end of 2010, seven expressways will run from the east to
the west, and five expressways will link the country's south and
north areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has more than 10,000 kilometers of expressway
that have opened to traffic, ranking the fourth in the world in
terms of length.

<HEADLINE> Education Takes Lion Share of Budget In Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Federal Executive
Council (FEC) Tuesday proposed a sum of 500 billion naira (about 5
billion U.S. dollars) as its expenditure for the year 2000 with
education taking the lion's share of the budget.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is expected to be presented to the National
Assembly for approval within one week, local media quoted
Information Minister Dapo Sarumi as saying.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown of the proposed budget showed that education took
the highest allocation of 40.36 billion naira (about 403.6 million
U.S. dollars)

while defense, which used to take the lion's share of the budget,
came second with 34.1 billion naira (about 341 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The significant aspect of the budget proposal is that
agricultural inputs and equipment have been removed from the
valued added tax items, Sarumi told reporters Tuesday after the
first session of the two-day FEC meeting presided over by
President Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
The exemption, he said, would not apply to imported rice,
wheat, maize, corn, frozen chicken, edible oil and dry vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Sarumi described the budget as a realistic one because it was
made based on an oil price of 18 U.S. dollars per barrel while the
present price has risen to about 25 U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The government is expecting to secure 8.47 billion U.S. dollars
from sale of crude oil and petroleum tax in 2000 as against 7.53
billion U.S. dollars this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that by September this year, the nation's
debt stock stood at 28.54 billion U.S. dollars, which required
about 2 billion U.S. dollars to service next year.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sets Ultimatum to Arrest Killers of Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo Tuesday issued an ultimatum to the country's Bayelsa
State, ordering the governor of the state to bring the killers of
11 policemen into justice, local newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I give you 14 days within which to restore law and order in
your state and effect the arrest and prosecution of all those
responsible for these killings, failing which I shall set in
motion a process to declare a state of emergency in Bayelsa
State," the president said in the ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
Eleven Policemen held hostages in Balyelsa, a state in the
Niger Delta of the country, were killed by local militant Ijaw
youths in two separate cases within the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
On the rape allegations in the state, the president said that
he felt disgusted and shocked when hearing the alleged rapes by
military personnel but later the probe result showed that the
accident was stage-managed and orchestrated to malign and
discredit the military, the Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper
Wednesday quoted Obasanjo as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I know that no soldier would be so beastly as to commit such a
criminal act in the full glare of cameramen," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Niger Delta, an oil-producing region, has long been a
hotbed of ethnic feuds and violence. It has claimed thousands of
lives over the past two years and seriously threatened the normal
operations of multinational oil firms operating there.

<HEADLINE> Filipino Oil Firms Urged to Absorb Price Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Consumer and Oil
Price Watch (COPW) Wednesday urged the big three oil companies to
better absorb part of the under recovery on oil price increases
from August to October 1999.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Raul Concepcion, private sector chairman
of the COPW during a press briefing held here.
</P>
<P>
He explained that during the period, the under recovery
amounted to 0.32 peso for Caltex and 0.38 peso for Petron and
Shell, saying the manufacturers could not pass the increases onto
the public.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the average oil price decrease for the month
of October was 11 centavos.
</P>
<P>
This decrease was based on the average decrease of crude oil by
0.43 U.S. dollar (October 21.47 dollars vs. September 21.9
dollars) and the appreciation of the peso by 6 centavos (October
40.29 pesos vs. September 40.23 pesos), he said.
</P>
<P>
Concepcion's computation came out in response to claims by the
oil firms for under recovery since April 1999.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, he vowed to verify as to whether the price
increases are faster when the price of crude rises and slower when
the price of crude decreases.
</P>
<P>
"We will compute monthly the price increase or decrease from
October 1997 to March 1999," he added.
</P>
<P>
The monthly computation, he said, is meant to find out if there
was a decrease of 6.17 dollars in the average price of crude
before prices started to increase in April this year.
</P>
<P>
"The average price of crude in the last quarter of 1997 was
18.21 dollars compared to the 15-month average of 12.04 dollars
experienced up to March 1999," Concepcion said.
</P>
<P>
The three oil giants are claiming that the price increases they
imposed on their petroleum products were based on the price
adjustments of crude in the world market.

<P>
ATHENS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis Wednesday called on the people and political parties to
keep calm for the national interests during U.S. President Bill
Clinton's first-ever visit to Greece this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Greece should maintain democratic legality in spite of any
reaction to Clinton's visit scheduled for Friday and Saturday,
Simitis said before departing for Istanbul, Turkey, for a summit
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Greece should not give the sign that it
was awaiting Clinton "as clients awaiting the patrons."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's visit, which had been planned for last week, was
delayed due to the recent violent acts against the U.S. business
in Athens as well as mass protests against the U.S. and NATO
policies toward the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Two cars, one with American license plates, were torched in
Athens early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the visit will go smoothly, the Greek government
has taken strict measures with some 15,000 police officers
deployed at the Athens airport and the center of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The Athens police chief announced Tuesday that all protests,
rallies and marches in Athens would be banned "for reasons of
public safety" during Clinton's visit.

<HEADLINE> Manila Opts for Peaceful Solution in Dealing With MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Despite recent skirmishes with
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) troops, peace solution
remains as the Philippine government's leading option in dealing
with the secessionist rebels.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada made this clear Wednesday
in a radio speech, even as he maintained that the government
remains in control of the situation in the south.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is my dream for Mindanao. If we have peace, development
not only in Mindanao but in the whole country will be
accelerated," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president, who was scheduled to visit Davao City, Mindanao,
Wednesday afternoon, said he may also make a side trip to North
Cotabato province in central Mindanao to see for himself the
status of a ceasefire between the government and the MILF.
</P>
<P>
The president also reiterated his call to residents of Muslim
Mindanao to support his administration's efforts for peace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado reportedly echoed
the president's call as he urged the MILF anew to support the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Our position has not changed. We still look for a negotiated
peaceful settlement. And if the MILF does its share, we won't have
any problem," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
He noted the AFP had to engage the MILF in confrontation last
weekend only because it had to protect civilians affected by the
fighting in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF have called a truce after fighting
in Mindanao last weekend. The MILF is one of several rebel groups
conducting peace talks with the government.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Clinton to Meet as More Pullout Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak is to meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Turkey
Wednesday on the latest developments in the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are in Turkey to attend the summit of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which
is to be held in Istanbul Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is set to begin once Clinton comes back from his
visit to Turkey's western quake-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will discuss what White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart called "all issues," including the late dispute over the
maps of the second-stage Israeli troops withdrawal from West Bank
land.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Tuesday continued to
reject the maps on the Israeli proposed 5 percent West Bank
redeployment, with senior negotiator Saeb Erekat saying the
problem is no longer a question of territory, as much as one of
principle.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians demanded the transfer of areas more densely
populated than what Israel had proposed. The Israeli government
insists that it be Israel's sole authority to decide which land is
to be transferred.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast Special Coordinator Dennis Ross, meeting over the
past two days with Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
failed to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
There are no reported contacts between the two sides Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Turkey, Barak and his Foreign Minister David Levy
will also meet leaders from Turkey, Portugal, Spain, Egypt,
Jordan, and other European and Mediterranean countries.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, 54 OSCE members will discuss
security and arms control issues and the situation in the Balkans
and Chechnya. Israel, like other Mediterranean countries
affiliated with OSCE, holds observer status in the organization.
</P>
<P>
Barak will leave Thursday for the U.S., where he will address
the General Assembly of the North American Jewish Federations in
Atlanta. He will spend the weekend in New York, where he will meet
Jewish leaders, give interviews and open the weekly trading on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
Barak will go to London next Tuesday to meet British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and return to Israel next Wednesday morning.

<HEADLINE> WWF Urges Sustainable Use of Natural Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund for
Nature (WWF) Wednesday stressed the need to integrate the economy
with sustainable use of natural resources to protect the
environment.
</P>
<P>
The biggest challenge in the next century for many
environmental conservationists will be to compel humanity to
undertake measures that will help protect and conserve the world's
natural resources, WWF Director-General Claude Martin said in
Malaysia Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Awareness of the need to integrate the economy with sustainable
use of natural resources has begun to attract the attention of
some countries, Martin said at the WWF annual conference in Kota
Kinabalu, Sabah, East Malaysia, according to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
He cited China as an example, saying the Chinese government
decided to integrate the environmental aspect into development
programs at the beginning of a project.
</P>
<P>
"This goes to show that China is further than anyone else
because they have realized that the future of their 1.2 billion
people relies on the fertility of their soils, sustainable use of
the forests and the quality of water," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the level of awareness for a sustainable
economy in some advanced countries was somewhat moderate because
of the strong presence of industrialist lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
He said that among the many things the WWF foresee as an
effective solution to prevent destruction to nature is to abolish
subsidies to non-sustainable economic activities and that the WWF
had been fighting hard to persuade governments to do so.

<P>
Development of western China will receive strategic priority as
the government channels more funds, technology and talent to the
region. Key measures for this include infrastructure development,
afforestation, and the advance of science, technology and
education. Large areas of cultivated land in the region will be
turned back to forests, step by step, while crop mixtures will be
overhauled.
</P>
<P>
The government will also continue to promote the development of
towns and townships in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Third, the government will try to accelerate scientific and
technological advancement and improve the country's ability to
innovate. It will continue to increase investment in research and
development and push for the establishment of a venture investment
system.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, as the top priority, the government will strive to
reach the target of a three-year drive to reform state-owned
enterprises (SOEs).
</P>
<P>
Fifth, the government will continue to improve the people's
living standards by raising the income of urban and rural
residents, especially low-income people. It will try every
possible means to improve the income of farmers and provide care
for low-income urban residents by establishing and perfecting the
social security system.
</P>
<P>

To deal with these problems, the conference set five top tasks
for next year.
</P>
<P>
First, the conference pointed out that development is the key
both for solving current economic difficulties and for long-term
development in the next century. Next year China will continue to
carry out pro-active fiscal policies by issuing additional
treasury bonds for financing construction.
</P>
<P>
The role of monetary policies will be further exploited, and
the money supply will be appropriately increased in a bid to give
greater financial support to economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The conference warned that attention also should be paid to
minimizing financial risks, strengthening monetary and credit
administration, and safeguarding financial security.
</P>
<P>
It also pointed out that increased consumption can have a great
impact on economic growth, so efforts should be made to spur urban
and rural consumption and open more channels for consumption, the
key to which is increasing the sales of residential housing,
education, and several other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Second, the government will take economic restructuring as the
focal point of its work for next year, and longer.
</P>
<P>
In adjusting industrial structures, China will consolidate the
primary industry, enhance the secondary industry, and expand
tertiary industry.

year target set by the Central Government for SOE reform and
development, which is a key economic task.

circulation, science and technology, education, housing, and
social insurance.
</P>
<P>
The conference stressed the importance of speeding up
scientific and technological progress and enhancing technical
renovation.
</P>

the latest scientific and technological results worldwide, and
make strides in developing and renovating their own technologies.

<HEADLINE> Light Industry Slows Down Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- China's light industry has
slightly slowed down its development pace, with total industrial
value for the first nine month this year at 2 trillion yuan, still
up 11.6 percent from the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
The country's heavy industry saw a 12.8 percent growth in
industrial value during the same period, sources from the
Information Center under the State Administration of Light
Industry said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts note that the current development pace is quite normal,
and the slight slow-down can be attributed to the high standard
set in the corresponding period last year, when light industry
output boomed.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the export of light industry products
continued to rise, reaching 41.5 billion U.S. dollars in the
January-September period. In September alone, light industry
exports hit 5.6 billion U.S. dollars, the highest monthly figure
record so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The top five products with the highest export revenue were
range hoods, air conditioners, soft drinks, canned food, and home
refrigerators.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on Direct Air Service Across Taiwan Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A seminar to promote the
realization of direct air service across the Taiwan Straits opened
today in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day event, more than 100 experts and scholars in
civil aviation circles on both sides of the Taiwan Straits will
express their common desire for early direct aviation across the
Straits at an early date.
</P>
<P>
The experts will have discussions and exchange views on world
trends in civil aviation, flight safety, airport management, the
latest technology, and the business end of the direct air service
and air cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Shen Yuankang, deputy director of the Civil Aviation
Administration of China (CAAC), said that China's mainland is now
preparing to open direct air service across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Shen urged the Taiwan authorities to consider the situation and
positively respond to the Chinese people's desire for cross-
Straits postal, air and shipping services, and take specific steps
to speed up the process leading to opening direct air service.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of direct air links across the Straits is
the trend of the times and the aspiration of the people, and the
relevant conditions are now available," he noted.
</P>
<P>
To date, Shen said, Taiwan airlines have sent 1,200 staff
members to the mainland, and the mainland has organized trips for
32 delegations consisting of 126 aviation experts to visit Taiwan,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have hosted over 50 seminars to explore the
possibilities for investment in civil aviation and cooperation on
joint transportation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Shen said, "we established the Macao Aviation
Company and Hong Kong Dragon Airlines (Dragonair) with the
mainland as their major shareholder, thus opening an airline
linking the two sides of the Taiwan Straits via Macao and Hong
Kong."
</P>
<P>
The seminar is being sponsored by the China Civil Aviation
Association.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Cracks Down on Loan Defaulters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A major crackdown was
launched on bank loan defaulters on Wednesday with the arrest of
big defaulters, including prominent politicians and
industrialists, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Former federal minister Anwar Saifullah, former Chairman of
Pakistan International Airlines Air Marshal Wiqar Azim and
renowned industrialist Asif Sehgal and some leaders of the
Pakistan People's Party were among those arrested Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown started as a one-month deadline expired on
November 16 and raids are being conducted across the country to
nab those big defaulters who had failed to clear their outstanding
loans by zero hour Wednesday, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The drive, which may take months to conclude, is the first of
its kind in Pakistan and is being carried out by the army and
civilian agencies jointly and backed up by intelligence
organizations, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a top-level meeting attended by Interior Minister
Moinuddin Haider and Director General of Federal Investigation
Agency Malik Asif Hayat decided to show no leniency toward any
loan defaulters during what the officials called an unprecedented
operation.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after assuming the office of the supreme executive last
month, Pakistan's Chief Executive General Pervaiz Musharraf urged
loan defaulters to pay their dues by November 16. Otherwise they
will face severe punishment, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Official figures indicate that the amount of non-performing
loans in Pakistan had risen to 250 billion rupees (4.8 billion
U.S. dollars) in 1998 from 80 billion rupees (1.5 billion dollars)
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Ittefaq Group owned by deposed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
is the No. 1 defaulter and owes the banks 3 billion rupees (58
million dollars), according to official records.

Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi have surrendered to the

Meanwhile, thousands of displaced persons from the city of
Vouga threatened by UNITA have fled to Kuito, capital city of the

<HEADLINE> Progress Reported in China's Building of Defensive Shelters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- China has made major
breakthroughs in building defensive shelters for military use in
terms of integrated protection, efficiency, fast reaction, and
survival capability, according to the Department of the General
Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
The past decades have witnessed the remarkable development in
the building of military shelters, a major part of defensive
facilities in China, which have been upgraded from former simple
tunnels and ditches into multi-purpose and modern structures.
</P>
<P>
New materials, technologies and processes have been widely
adopted for building these shelters which form an underground "
Great Wall" for China.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, China has gradually established an integrated
research system for building shelters, which is oriented to
winning hi-tech battles in the future.
</P>
<P>
To date, researchers have harvested more than 100 major
scientific research results, and some of them will enable high-
ranking military leaders to work out plans that are more
scientific and closer to reality.
</P>
<P>
Scientists also have achieved several technical inventions such
as an automatic control system that initiates power generators in
the tunnels seconds after the breakdown of external electricity
supplies.

Conference which closed here today.
</P>

relationship between improving enterprises' external conditions
and transforming their managerial mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The conference noted that the country has taken many measures
to relieve these enterprises' debt burdens, streamlining and
laying off surplus personnel, and separating social functions from
the enterprises' main business, all of which will be continued in
the coming year.
</P>
<P>
As far as the enterprises are concerned, priority should be
given to establishing the modern corporate system and setting up
managerial mechanisms adaptable to the market economy, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
The conference urged various localities and enterprises to
handle the relationship between the long-term goal and the phased
targets for SOE reform and development, which will be a long task.
</P>
<P>
The economic working conference stressed the importance of
meeting the three-year target set by the Central Government for
SOE reform and development, which is a key task of the country's
economic work.
</P>
<P>
While focusing on SOE reform and development in the coming year,
reform moves should be carried out in the sectors of finance,
circulation, science and technology, education, housing, and
social insurance.
</P>
<P>
The conference stressed the importance of speeding up
scientific and technological progress and enhancing technical
renovation.
</P>
<P>
It urged various enterprises to track, introduce and assimilate
the latest scientific and technological results worldwide, and
make strides in developing and renovating their own technologies.
</P>
<P>
The conference called for further reform in the scientific and
technological system and the establishment of a mechanism

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua)-- China today expressed its
confidence in achieving the economic growth target set at the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
This confidence was expressed by the Central Economic Working
Conference, which was held in Beijing on November 15-17.
</P>
<P>
Top Chinese leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li
Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing attended the
conference.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin made an important speech at the three-day

beginning of this year, and put forward guidelines and major tasks
for next year's economic work. Premier Zhu Rongji expounded on the
implementation of next year's economic tasks.
</P>
<P>
The conference said that the government's economic policies
have been sound and effective this year, citing as proof good
agricultural harvests, rapid industrial growth, the rebound of

and an unreasonable economic structure.
</P>

well as challenges in developing its economy with the world
economy undergoing structural adjustment, the rapid development of
science and technology, and an ever more powerful influence
exerted by multinational companies.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Five Tasks for Economic Work in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Maintaining an active fiscal
policy, restructuring the economy, and developing western China
will receive top priority in the Chinese government's plan for
economic work in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
The Central Economic Working Conference which concluded today
set five top tasks for year 2000.
</P>
<P>
First, the government will continue to carry out an active
fiscal policy by issuing additional treasury bonds. The major part
of government investment will continue to be directed to
infrastructure and technological upgrading.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a growing money supply will give fiscal
policy a larger role in promoting economic growth. On the other
hand, the country will improve the regulation of the capital
market and take stricter measures to safeguard financial security
and minimize risks.
</P>
<P>
The government will also try to jump-start the consumption of
housing and education so as to invigorate these markets.
</P>
<P>
Second, the government will take economic restructuring as the
focal point of its work for next year, and longer.
</P>
<P>
In adjusting industrial structures, China will consolidate
primary industry, enhance the secondary industry, and expand
tertiary industry.
</P>
<P>
Development of western China will receive strategic priority as
the government channels more funds, technology and talent to the
region. Key measures for this include infrastructure development,
afforestation, and the advance of science, technology and
education. Large areas of cultivated land in the region will be
turned back to forests, step by step, while crop mixtures will be
overhauled.
</P>
<P>
The government will also continue to promote the development of
towns and townships in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Third, the government will try to accelerate scientific and
technological advancement and improve the country's ability to
innovate. It will continue to increase investment in research and
development and push for the establishment of a venture investment
system.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, as the top priority, the government will strive to
reach the target of a three-year drive to reform state-owned
enterprises (SOEs). Regarding the crucial meaning of the reform of
the SOEs, the government expressed determination to achieve
success in this three-year campaign. It will grasp the central
link of SOE reform by pushing forward reform of the financial,
circulation, science and technology, education, housing and social
security sectors.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, the government will continue to improve the people's
living standards by raising the income of urban and rural
residents, especially low-income people. It will try every
possible means to improve the income of farmers and provide care
for low-income urban residents by establishing and perfecting the
social security system.

DAR ES SALAAM, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and Rwanda
Tuesday officially launched the Commission on Transport aimed at
easing transport pressures for the landlocked tiny central African
nation, the Guardian newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the agreement on the establishment of

<P>
The commission will study the building of a rail corridor
connecting the two countries through Tanzania's western Kagera
Region and leading to the eastern terminal of the Dar es Salaam
seaport.

The corridor will help Rwanda ease its transportation problems
by opening its business gateway to the world via the Dar es Salaam
port, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda has no railways. Highway and aviation are its major
means of transportation. It has to seek helps from its eastern
neighbors of Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya to use their railways for
importing and exporting goods.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Willing to Join GCC Defense Pact: Prince </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Jordan is considering
joining the common defense pact of the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC), Jordanian Prince Faisal Bin Al Hussein has said.
</P>
<P>
Faisal, brother of Jordan's King Abdullah Bin Hussein, who is
in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) attending the ongoing Dubai 2000
Aerospace Exhibition, said "Arab-Arab general defense cooperation
will take time, but if GCC states have an intention, Jordan is
ready to examine it."
</P>
<P>
However, Jordan so far has not made such an offer to the six
member states of GCC - the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar
and Bahrain, the Gulf News daily reported Wednesday, quoting
Faisal.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has expressed willingness to join forces if the six
countries entertain the idea. But no formal contact in this
respect has been made.
</P>
<P>
Defense ministers of the GCC states are meeting in Dubai, an
emirate of the UAE, to further improve their military cooperation
by signing a joint defense pact.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is being held on the sidelines of the Dubai 2000
Aerospace Show, which has attracted some 500 exhibitors from more
than 30 countries.
</P>
<P>
Prince Faisal, one of the VIP guests at the Dubai air show,
said that Arab-Arab reconciliation would take time in view of the
damaged relations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
There is "no speedy solution, although we hope there would
be," said the prince.
</P>
<P>
On Arab relations with Israel, Faisal said normalization of
ties with the Jewish state would naturally happen in light of
existing Egyptian, Jordanian-Israeli relations and the desire to
achieve comprehensive and just peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan signed peace treaties with Israel in 1979 and
in 1994 respectively.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the peace process moves become real especially in
the West Bank, Lebanon and Golan Heights," the prince said.

<HEADLINE> Supermarkets Welcomed in Lhasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 17 (Xinhua)-- Since appearing just two years
ago in Lhasa, supermarkets have become very popular among the
Tibetan people, according to one local industry and commerce
official.
</P>
<P>
The Tiexinren, or a "close friend of customers" as locals call
it, run by the Lhasa Municipal Grain Administration, which opened
in May 1997 as the city's first supermarket, now has 10 branch
stores around town.
</P>
<P>
The 56-square-meter Jiafule (Household Fortune &AMP; Happiness)
supermarket, which opened four months ago, services at least 200
customers a day with daily average sales of 5,500 yuan (some 620 U.
S. dollars), according to cashier Liu Zhengang, and on the
weekends there can be as many as 400 customer a day.
</P>
<P>
Ren Lei from Lhasa Sub-administration for Industry and Commerce
said that providing high quality, inexpensive commodities is the
main reason that supermarkets so popular. They also turn in more
taxes than ordinary shops.
</P>
<P>
A survey of several best-selling commodities selected by a
reporter shows that in one large local department store, the
prices for these goods were ten percent higher than in the Jiafule
supermarket.
</P>
<P>
Some small retail stalls here are also facing stiff competition
as more and more people now pay attention to quality, brand names,
and the shopping environment.
</P>
<P>
Zong Ji, one local supermarket fan and a female clerk of the
Tibetan Branch of the Bank of China, expressed his satisfaction
with the convenience of supermarket shopping now. In the past, she
recalled, she had to "bother" the sales persons to fetch things
she wanted to buy in the department stores.
</P>
<P>
With the steady improvement of local residents' living
standards and the recent government increase of salaries for civil
servants, a growing number of workers in Lhasa have become the
majority of supermarket patrons, Ren noted.

<HEADLINE> hke111725#-#- Disease Breaks Out in Vietnam's Flood-Hit Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Diseases have begun hitting
thousands of people in Vietnam's central provinces in the
aftermath of the worst floods in half a century, the local
newspaper The Saigon Times Daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever, diarrhea, flu, eye infections and respiratory
ailments have broken out in five of the eight central provinces
badly hit by the disastrous floods early this month.
</P>
<P>
The devastated Thua Thien-Hue Province has discovered the first
two cases of typhoid and 85 cases of diarrhea following the
floods, which claimed 592 lives and caused losses of up to 3.72
trillion Vietnamese dong (about 266 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In Da Nang, 9,400 people have eye infections, the largest
number compared with other flood-hit provinces, 10,981 have flu,
5,935 have diarrhea and 29,536 have skin diseases.
</P>
<P>
There have been 64 people suffering from dengue fever in Quang
Binh while 2,518 cases of diarrhea, 4,929 cases of flu and 1,687
cases of eye infections have been reported in Quang Tri.
</P>
<P>
In Binh Dinh, 405 people have respiratory illness, 571 have
diarrhea, 550 have flu and 462 have eye infections.
</P>
<P>
In these provinces, more than 1,000 people suffer from
dysentery.
</P>
<P>
Local officials earlier warned that there were some possible
outbreaks of illness because water sources have been polluted by
dead animals.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Pasture Area Combines Livestock Raising and Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, November 17 (Xinhua) -- North China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, the largest of the five pasturing areas in the
country, is utilizing crop stalks from its southern region to
raise its northern livestock, bringing profits and at the same
time protecting the environment, said local officials.
</P>
<P>
Farming in the south produces an annual yield of 24 billion kg
of crop stalks, and with only 6 billion kg processed every year,
the surplus provides an abundant supply of fodder for livestock.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the local people now will first crossbreed livestock
in the north to improve the quality of the species, and then
transport them to the south to gain weight, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
It has been calculated that one sheep will need 1,000 kg of
fodder during its growing period, and cattle 200 kg. This new
method has not only lessened the financial burden on northern
breeders, but has produced a high yield of livestock and abundant
organic fertilizer and crop harvests in the area, added the
officials.
</P>
<P>
By October 20 this year, 744,000 head of livestock had been
raised in the southern area, and this figure is expected to reach
as high as one million by the end of this year, said local
officials.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous regional government has also helped set up a
comprehensive sales service system to support the popularization
of this new method.

<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua)-- United Nations Secretary-
General Kofi Annan attended a roundtable meeting on the UN in the
21st century this morning, and listened to Chinese experts' views
on the issue of world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, the secretary-general pointed out that
state sovereignty remains the foundation of international
relations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the area of world security, in recent years,
more and more domestic conflicts have arisen, rather than
international disputes. Therefore, solutions to these conflicts
will bear more and more on the cardinal principles of national
sovereignty and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Controversy over this question remains, he said, adding that
his is willing to listen to Chinese experts.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed dialogs between civilizations, noting that the
UN has set 2001 as the year for such dialogs. Different cultures
are all treasures of the mankind, and reinforcing dialogs between
the various cultures will help enable peaceful co-existence among
all the world's people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese experts suggested that the principles of the UN
Charter should be followed, and that the UN should listen more to
developing countries in order to play an even more effective role
in the new century.

<HEADLINE> NTSB to Stay in Charge of EgyptAir Plane Crash Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will continue to take charge of
the investigation into the cause of the crash of an EgyptAir plane
on October 31, NTSB chairman Jim Hall announced late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Before making the final decision on whether to transfer the
responsibility of investigation to the Federal Investigation
Bureau (FBI), the NTSB will fully evaluate the latest
investigation development regarding a religious utterance in the
cockpit voice recorder, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary findings show that someone in the cockpit voice
recorder uttered a prayer before the jet's autopilot disengaged
and the plane started its final plunge into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
According to Hall, the task of analyzing the cockpit voice
recordings has become more difficult as the conversation between
the pilot and the crew was in Arabic.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Cable News Network (CNN) quoted a State
Department official as saying that teams of Egyptian technical
experts are expected to arrive in Washington Wednesday and
Thursday to join the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-bound jetliner, a Boeing 767-300 on EgyptAir 990,
crashed in the Atlantic Ocean off the Massachusetts coast, killing
all 217 people on board.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S. rules, the NTSB, set up in 1967, conducts
independent investigations of all civil aviation accidents in the
United Sates without regulatory or enforcement powers.
</P>
<P>
Once it has been established that an air tragedy is due to a
criminal act, the FBI takes over the investigation, with the NTSB
providing any requested support.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Wideband Digital Seismograph </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Some 30 of China's 37
seismographs, which will be connected to create a national
earthquake monitoring network, have been installed with a wideband
digital device.
</P>
<P>
During the strong earthquakes that jolted Taiwan in late
September, all digital seismographs responded by accurately
recording the quake data. However, other seismographs in the
cities of Luoyang, Shenzhen and Wuhan, which still use out-
fashioned electromagnetic simulators, failed to record because of
the high scale of seismic magnitude and the long distance.
</P>
<P>
According to Cai Yaxian, an expert with the China Seismological
Bureau, digital seismographs with the world's widest bandwidths
have been independently developed by scientists at the bureau.
These devices can automatically record data from major tremors.
</P>
<P>
Japan already has bought 20 of these seismographs.

<HEADLINE> California Sues U.S. Interior Department Over Offshore Oil Leases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Californian state
government Tuesday sued the U.S. Interior Department for blocking
its decision to let oil companies begin planning to drill along
some of the state's scenic coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed with the U.S. District Court in Oakland by
the state attorney general's office on behalf of the California
Coastal Commission (CCC). It asked for preliminary and permanent
injunctions on Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt's action pending
review by the commission.
</P>
<P>
Babbitt last Friday notified Sara Wan, the CCC chairman, that
the Interior Department extended a drilling suspension on 36 oil
leases in California's offshore waters and ordered a review to
find out how the drilling would affect the environment.
</P>
<P>
Oil companies had spent 1.25 billion U.S. dollars to drill
along 40 coastal areas, but the drillings were stopped by the
federal government in 1990 after local communities demanded to
study the impact on the environment and economy.
</P>
<P>
State Gov. Gray Davis said Babbitt had made an "incorrect
reading of the law" by extending the leases. Davis said the state
has the right to review any actions made on the leases under
federal law.
</P>
<P>
"The feds froze us out and that's why we're suing," Davis said.
"California is entitled to be the engine, not the caboose."
</P>
<P>
Tim Ahern, spokesman of the Interior Department, defended
Babbitt's action. "We feel that our decision was consistent with
the law," Ahern said after the lawsuit was filed. "Down the road
the California Coastal Commission will have a chance to review
this process and will have a veto," he said.
</P>
<P>
The leases were issued between 1968 and 1984, before a
moratorium on offshore leasing in California.
</P>
<P>
Many California residents oppose offshore drilling and still
remember the 1969 oil spill off Santa Barbara that spoiled miles
of beach and killed hundreds of birds.

<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The newly established
Information Engineering University attached to the Chinese People'
s Liberation Army (PLA) will cultivate professionals for future hi-
tech warfare involving the use of information technology.
</P>
<P>
Major General Zhou Rongting, president of the university, made
this remark recently in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The new PLA university, located in Zhengzhou, the capital of
Henan Province, was founded through the merger of three military
schools in the same city, the Information Engineering Institute,
the Measuring Institute, and the Electronic Technology Institute.
</P>
<P>
All major subjects related to the military use of information
technology are being taught at the new university, said the
president. Zhou pledged to build the university into a world-class
school with all the necessary hardware and software.
</P>
<P>
The leadership of the school will make every effort to set up a
new mechanism which will allow talented people to play a proper
role, Zhou noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the university plans to further strengthen major
specialties including information safety, modern communications
technology, and space technology, and to create a number of new
specialties such as remote image information engineering,
satellite-navigation and -positioning engineering, and map data
bank applications.
</P>
<P>
The university's primary goal is to turn its teaching and
research achievements into productive forces and fighting
capability, Zhou stressed.

<HEADLINE> Afro-Americans' Income up But Still Behind Whites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 16 (Xinhua) -- An annual report released
Tuesday said the thriving U.S. economy has lifted African-
Americans to unprecedented levels of employment and income, but
they continue to lag behind whites in economic assets, educational
achievement and access to health care.
</P>
<P>
"There are two headlines," said Hugh Price, president of the
National Urban League that submitted the report. "Things have
never been better," he said, citing an all-time low unemployment
rate, a growing black middle class and the lowest rate of out-of-
wedlock births in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The 247-page report presents statistics, charts and essays on
employment and wage gaps, health disparities and educational
levels that alternately are encouraging and sobering.
</P>
<P>
Some information in the report suggests that shifts in behavior
within the black community could lead to greater economic gains.
For example, research shows that blacks are less likely to be
married than whites. Some researchers therefore contend that
individualist lifestyle is an economic drag.
</P>
<P>
The numbers back that contention, according to the report. In
1997, black families had a median income of 28,602 U.S. dollars
while median white family income was 46,745 dollars -- a
difference of 18,143 dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the gap narrowed sharply for married households. Median
income for black married couples was 45,375 dollars while white
married couples' median income was 52,098 dollars -- a difference
of 6,723 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Aside from praising the impact the booming economy has had on
the nation's 35 million African-Americans, the report lays out
causes and possible solutions to the gulfs that remain between the
races.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Efforts to Expand Domestic Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to
implement a series of policies next year to promote economic
development and expand domestic demand, according to the Central
Economic Working Conference which concluded here today.
</P>
<P>
The conference pointed out that development is the key both for
solving current economic difficulties and for long-term
development in the next century. Next year China will continue to
carry out pro-active fiscal policies and continue to issue bonds
for financing construction.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure construction and corporate technological
upgrading will continue to be the key targeted sectors for
investment, while at the same time close attention will be paid to
structural readjustment. Efforts should be made to mobilize social
investment and spur on consumption, the conference said.
</P>
<P>
According to the conference, the role of monetary policies will
be further exploited, various monetary policy tools will be used
in a comprehensive way, and money supply will be appropriately
increased, in a bid to give greater financial support to economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The conference stressed that finance should give further
support to infrastructure construction and technological upgrading,
and ensure working capital for enterprises that enjoy good market
shares and are profitable.
</P>
<P>
Debt-to-equity swaps should be well carried out to help
alleviate the debt burdens of large state-owned enterprises.
Credit policies capable of promoting the development of mid-sized
and small enterprises of different ownership should be formulated.
The proportion of direct financing should be increased, and
efforts made to standardize and develop the capital market.
</P>
<P>
The conference warned that attention also should be paid to
minimizing financial risks, monetary and credit administration
should not be loosened, and financial security can only be
realized by economic development.
</P>
<P>
It also pointed out that increased consumption can have a great
impact on economic growth, so efforts should be made to spur urban
and rural consumption and open more channels for consumption, of
which the key is to heighten the selling of residential housing,
education and several other sectors.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Confirms Use of Defoliants in Demilitarized Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Defense Ministry of South
Korea confirmed Wednesday that the country had sprayed defoliants
along the south of the Demilitarized Zone in late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The United States made the initial proposal to spray the
defoliants and South Korea accepted it, said a ministry spokesman
at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
South Korea decided to use herbicide along the front-line fence
to guard against spy infiltration from the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) and asked for 45,000 gallons from the
United Nations Command, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"We sprayed the herbicide twice in 1968 and 1969 for the
purpose of preventing any infiltration routes for North Korean
soldiers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the exposure level was minimal as the
chemicals were sprayed on the ground instead of in the air.
</P>
<P>
However, he also said the dangers from exposure in terms of
sprayed amount, method and region are far less than those in
Vietnam, but the likelihood of contamination in the spraying
process still exists.
</P>
<P>
"The government is willing to conduct investigations after it
starts studying the extent of damage. We will review the
appropriate measures on the government level regarding the law on
the use of defoliant," added the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
More than 21,000 gallons of toxic defoliants were sprayed in
1968-1969 along the south of the Demilitarized Zone by some 7,000
South Korean soldiers who didn't know they were spraying three
kinds of toxic material -- Agent Orange, Agent Blue and Monuron.
They were not given warning, masks or other proper protective gear,
South Krona media reports said Tuesday quoting a declassified
document of the U.S. Department of the army.
</P>
<P>
Under the code name Vegetation Control Program 1968, the toxic
defoliants were sprayed in the area some 100 meters wide and 155
miles long along the south of the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
The United States once denied using defoliants in any other
country except Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean media reports accused both the U.S. and South
Korean governments of covering up the fact in the past 30 years,
saying that many South Korean soldiers might have suffered cancers
or other diseases from the sprayed defoliants.

<HEADLINE> Ancient China Develops Iron Metallurgy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A recent archeological study
in China has proven that the ancient Chinese developed iron
metallurgy by themselves rather than learning it from other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Professor Han Rufen, of the Institute of Metallurgy and
Material History of the Beijing University of Science and
Technology, said that since the early 1990s Chinese archeologists
have unearthed man-made ironware, including adzes, swords, spears
and daggers, in the tombs of the Western Zhou Dynasty (1100 B.C.-
771 B.C) in central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
This discoveries show that ancient China, like other ancient
regions such as Egypt, Mesopotamia and Anatolia, also developed
the art of metallurgy.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have learned that the ancient Chinese began to
use ironware in the middle Shang Dynasty (1600 B.C.-1100 B.C.),
and this discovery proves that for as long as more than 500 years
China's use of man-made ironware coexisted with that of other
ancient regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
The sword discovered in the tombs puts the Chinese grasp of
smelting techniques two centuries earlier than previously thought,
said Han.
</P>
<P>
He added that man-made ironware was rare during the Western
Zhou Dynasty, as it was a symbol of power and high social status
at that time.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAS VEGAS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- At this year's Comdex
computer trade show, which started on November 15 in Las Vegas,
one can see that the Internet will soon be invading practically
every aspect of our life.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the desktop dominated the Comdex computer
trade shows, with exhibiting companies introducing the latest
advances in PC technology. This year, however, it is all about
devices, just as Hewlett-Packard Co. chief executive Carly Fiorina
said.
</P>
<P>
But the devices are not just Internet terminals and hand-held
computers. Companies are pitching such prosaic objects as alarm
clocks, wristwatches and gas pumps as Internet devices.
</P>
<P>
During her keynote address Monday, Fiorina presented an HP
project under development called Cool Town - a place in which
everything is connected to the Internet. An alarm clock, for
example, would afford you a few extra minutes of sleep if traffic
is light.
</P>
<P>
John Chambers, Cisco Systems Inc. chief executive officer,
demonstrated an Internet-enabled gas pump featuring a touchscreen
that provides access to traffic reports, maps and a personalized
page for news, stocks and sports scores.
</P>
<P>
Even Microsoft Corp., the king of desktop software, is getting
into the act. Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief executive
officer, showed off Internet technology for a device called the
Auto PC. The device would allow drivers to schedule tune-ups at
the nearest facility, access traffic reports and download their
favorite songs in digital format from the Web.

LOS ANGELES, November 16 (Xinhua) -- IBM Corp. said Tuesday it
has formed a new division that will work with business clients to
enable them to transmit their Web contents to cell phones.
</P>
<P>
IBM plans to target companies such as banks that provide
financial services and firms using internal business applications,
according to a report from the company.
</P>
<P>
The new division will use a wireless standard called Wireless
Application Protocol (WAP) which was developed by Motorola,
Ericsson and Nokia to allow Internet text to be accessed to mobile
phones, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"WAP phones are reaching the market now and there are not that
many services out there, but the market will explode and demand
for our services will grow," said Mark Bregman, an IBM e-business
executive. "We want to be in the race early on. We've already got
100 customers in the pipeline."
</P>
<P>
"It's still very early days for WAP but it's a bit like the
Internet in the 1980s. So once it takes off, it will move very
rapidly," Bregman said.

<HEADLINE> Accountability Ordinance Promulgated in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 17 (Xinhua) -- As part of the new Pakistani
government's efforts to eradicate corruption, President Rafiq
Tarar promulgated an accountability ordinance late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, a person involved in corruption may face
severe punishment, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A person who commits the offense of corruption shall be
punishable with imprisonment of up to 14 years, besides possible
fines, according to the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
The ordinance will also pave the way for setting up a National
Accountability Bureau in the South Asian country to handle
corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
The ordinance with immediate effect came concurrently with a
deadline set by Pakistan's Chief Executive General Pervaiz
Musharraf for loan defaulters to pay their dues.
</P>
<P>
Those who fail to pay back their defaulted loans by November 16
will face legal actions, the general said after he assumed the
office of the supreme executive of Pakistan in a coup last month.
</P>
<P>
The ordinance was promulgated whereas there is an emergent need
for the recovery of outstanding amounts from "those persons who
have committed default in their payment of amounts to banks and
other agencies," according to the APP report.
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is applicable to cases involving loan default,
corruption, misuse of power, misappropriation of property,
kickbacks, commissions and others.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary for the new government to set up a National
Accountability Bureau to expedite the disposal of these cases,
according to the ordinance.

<HEADLINE> EU Endorses Record High Aid to Jordan Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
approved 128.9 million euro (some 126.3 million U.S. dollars) in
grants for Jordan next year, the largest ever annual financial
commitment to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The aid package was announced here at a press conference
Tuesday evening by James Moran, who is visiting Jordan as head of
a European Commission (EC) delegation.
</P>
<P>
The aid package was endorsed at a meeting of EU representatives
in Brussels, Belgium, on Monday and the EC is expected to decide
in the next two weeks on four programs to assist Jordan's economic
restructuring program, modernize its local industries and upgrade
its key sectors of water and tourism, Moran said.
</P>
<P>
The EU assistance was aimed at encouraging economic reforms of
the desert kingdom and rewarding its role in promoting the Middle
East peace process, he added.
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the package is a 80-million-euro (78.4
million dollars) grant in rapid-disbursing special aid for next
year's budget to alleviate the social costs incurred by economic
readjustment in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Another 40 million euro (39.2 million dollars) will be
disbursed to improve the competitiveness of the private sector of
the kingdom to meet challenges in view of the establishment by the
year 2010 of the Europe-Mediterranean free trade zone, and
Jordan's bid to enter the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a Euro-Jordan Association Agreement in 1997 with
the EU for full political, economic and social partnership within
the framework between Europe and 12 Mediterranean countries.
</P>
<P>
For years, foreign aid remains one of the pillars of the
Jordanian economy along with tourism and labor exports revenues.

<HEADLINE> Hungry Kenyans Cross Into Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Drought has forced some 5,000
people in northern Kenya to cross into Ethiopia with their cattles
in search of food and water, the Daily Nation newspaper said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A two-year drought has resulted in severe shortages of food,
pasture and water in the northwestern Turkana district bordering
Ethiopia, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted district councilman Osman Eleman as saying
that residents of Kibish district on the Kenya-Ethiopia border had
abandoned their home in the area, 720 kilometers north of the
capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
An emergency relief shipment of 22,500 kilograms of maize
arrived in the district last week, but the relief food was
diverted for sale by a provincial official, the paper said, adding
that the official was arrested when he was found selling the
maize.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan members of parliament Tuesday urged the House to set up
a select committee to tour the affected areas and report the state
of the problems.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported that due to the prolonged drought, some 20
 districts in the country were facing food shortage and threatened
by famine.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Kenyan government has attached great importance to
the famine problem and allocated a total of two billion shillings
(about 26.7 million U.S. dollars) as a relief fund to the
drought-stricken areas.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Enters Quarter-finals of Chase Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 16 (Xinhua) -- World number one Martina
Hingis Entered the quarter-finals of the WTA Tour Chase
Championships here Tuesday after beating France's Sandrine Testud
7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-5) in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss teenager, who took the court after a tribute to now-
retired Steffi Graf, seemed in control after winning the first-set
tiebreak and breaking Testud in the opening game of the second set.
But Testud managed to save a break point in the third game and
broke Hingis in the fourth game.
</P>
<P>
A rejuvenated Testud received treatment on her left hand
following the fifth game, but it did not affect her game as she
forced a set point with Hingis serving at 4-5. But Hingis
prevented a third set with a backhand winner down the line and
eventually held serve.
</P>
<P>
Testud took a 2-1 lead in the tiebreaker, but two straight
backhand errors off her serve allowed Hingis to take a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
Hingis built a 5-4 lead when Testud missed a backhand wide in
the open court and was serving to close the match, but Testud hit
a lunging forehand down the line to draw even.
</P>
<P>
However, a netted backhand by Testud gave Hingis match point at
6-5 and she closed out her sixth straight win over Testud when the
Frenchwoman hit a forehand long for her 32nd unforced error of the
match.
</P>
<P>
Dominique Van Roost of Belgium spent just over an hour to
defeat Elena Likhovtseva of Russia 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Van Roost advanced to a meeting with sixth seed Nathalie
Tauziat of France, who posted a comfortable 6-3, 7-6 (8-6) victory
over South African Amanda Coetzer.

<HEADLINE> Family Education At Home Considered Unsuitable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey conducted by
the Institute of Psychology attached to the Chinese Academy of
Sciences has revealed that two thirds of families lack adequate or
proper education to instruct their children.
</P>
<P>
After a three year investigation, Professor Wang Jisheng of the
Insitute of Psychology concluded that while most parents are
caring for their children's education in every possible way, few
are succeeding.
</P>
<P>
Thirty percent out of 1,800 parents surveyed in Beijing are "
highly protective" of their children. They act more like baby-
sitters. Some of their children are unable to peel an apple even
by the time they reach high school.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wang said that parents who are overly protective of
their children tend to produce children who are dependent, shy and
incompetent, and show little creativity or imagination.
</P>
<P>
Another 30 percent are "overly interfering" parents, who
restrict their children in every possible way. As children are
behaving more like their parents, they are sure to lack the
ability to make decisions or solve problems by themselves.
</P>
<P>
Some 7-10 percent of parents surveyed were "severely punishing
" their children. They tend to scold and even hit their children.
Such children might develop into depressed, rude and indifferent
adults.
</P>
<P>
Only 30 percent of parents are "understanding and democratic",
said the professor. His conclusions were made after surveying 60
top students from Beijing and Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
He said almost all understanding parents are trying to provide
a more carefree environment for their children so they will grow
and develop naturally. These parents tend to praise and encourage
their children rather than scold or beat them.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wang noted that very few parents spend money on books
about psychology or pedagogy though they spent a lot of money on
providing their children with nutritious foods.

<HEADLINE> China Removes Mines around Xiamen Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, November 17 (Xinhua) -- China has successfully removed
mines around the port of Xiamen in southeast China's Fujian
Province. These mines are remnants of the war against Japanese
invaders in the 1930s and later.
</P>
<P>
There is a 26 sq.km. sea area suspected of containing mines.
Ships have not been able to navigate in these waters, said Huang
Herong, director of the Port Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The project to remove the mines at a cost of 105 million yuan
started in September 1997. Removing the mines has helped open 32.
98 sq km of nautical area and made dredging work of the sea bed
near the port possible. 4.8 million cubic meters of port channel
has been cleared of silt to allow big freighters and oil tanks
with 100,000 dwt passing through the port.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen which ranks 63rd among the world's top 100 container
ports will be installed with advanced computer-controlled port
management and monitoring systems by the end of next year.

<HEADLINE> Australian Snow-boarders' Bodies Begin to Be Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Australian police Wednesday
began airlifting the bodies of four snow-boarders, who had been
missing since August, off the Snowy Mountains in the New South
Wales state (NSW).
</P>
<P>
Dean Pincini, 25, Tim Friend, 25, and brothers Paul, 24, and
Scott Beardsmore, 26, all from Sydney, failed to return from a
three-day mountain trip in appalling conditions in August.
</P>
<P>
There have been numerous intensive searches over the past two
days and the bodies were spotted in a hole in the snow.
</P>
<P>
A police helicopter brought the first body bag down to the
Charlottes Pass resort, near Perisher in the NSW.
</P>
<P>
The bodies are to be taken back by road to Sydney, Police said.
</P>
<P>
The final two bodies were found Wednesday morning close to the
two victims discovered Tuesday in the remains of a snow cave in
Kosciuszko National Park.
</P>
<P>
Police said the four snow-boarders appeared to have taken
shelter in a snow cave after setting out in blizzard conditions on
August 7.
</P>
<P>
It is believed the four dug a snow cave to shelter from the
storm, which searchers said produced an enormous snow dump.
</P>
<P>
Neville Owen, captain of the Kosciuszko snow search, said the
two bodies found Tuesday were under four meters of snow and it was
likely they died of asphyxia or hypothermia.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Oldest University to be Privatized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has approved
Chulalongkorn University's draft bill which would shift the
country's oldest institution of higher learning out of the
traditional civil service system, the Bangkok Post reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Thienchai Keeranant, the rector of the university, was quoted
as saying that the university had tried since 1992 to rid itself
of the bureaucracy to improve the educational and administrative
structure.
</P>
<P>
So far, four Thai universities have been granted autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The bill allows university officials two years to decide
whether to continues as civil servants or as employees.
</P>
<P>
Also according to the bill, the institution will be
administered by the university council comprising outside members.
The council will assume the role of the Board of Trustees
monitoring both administrators and academics alike.
</P>
<P>
Universities, in compliance with government policy, will be
pressured to open the door to foreign investors with market forces
taking a firm grip on the education system, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A group of Chulalongkorn academics expressed strong opposition
to the break Tuesday, saying the university, one of the most
prestigious in Thailand, could be subject to the mercies of the
market.
</P>
<P>
One of the them was quoted as saying that privatization will
leave the university under market forces, sparking money-worship
and treating education as a mere commodity.
</P>
<P>
What is more important, he said, is that students will be
saddled with the unbearable burden of rising fees, and education
will be reserved for the rich.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Approves Credit to Support Paddy Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has approved
a credit line of seven billion baht (181.8 million U.S. dollars)
to shore up paddy prices for the 1999-2000 crop year, the Bangkok
Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
State-owned Public Warehouse Organization (PWO) and Marketing
Organization for Farmers (MOF) would buy a total of 500,000 tons
of rice from December to April, the Bangkok Post said.
</P>
<P>
Krung Thai Bank, the state-run commercial bank, the
Export-Import Bank and probably the Government Savings Bank would
lend money to the agencies to support the price-intervention
program.
</P>
<P>
Loans would be at prevailing market rates, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said his ministry would
guarantee the loans to PWO and MOF.
</P>
<P>
Charging market interest rates would force the agencies to act
efficiently and responsibly, Tarrin said.
</P>
<P>
Commerce ministry officials believed that rice farmers can
break even if the program can keep the price of paddy with 15
percent moisture content at 5,000 baht (129.8 dollars) a ton.
</P>
<P>
Commodity prices have been falling worldwide, and some say
farmers' incomes could fall 20 to 30 percent this year, especially
if there is a rice surplus.
</P>
<P>
The price-intervention program will start immediately, as the
last two months of the year are usually good for rice exports.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is negotiating big contracts with Iran, Indonesia and
Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh May Open Third-Round Bidding for Gas Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is likely to open the
third-round bidding for gas exploration in the country within six
to seven months, The Financial Express reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Areas which were relinquished by international oil companies
and the left-out blocks of the second-round bidding would be
available for the bidding, a senior official of the Energy
Ministry was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping to open the third-round bidding within next six
to seven months," he said.
</P>
<P>
The whole country has been divided into 23 blocks for
exploration of gas and oil, of which eight blocks were allotted to
bidders in the first round of bidding, which started in 1993, with
six awarded to four U.S. companies and two to a British company.
</P>
<P>
The oil companies have succeeded in striking gas in three
blocks, and two of the companies are now supplying gas to the
national grid, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The second-round bidding started in 1997, but the process is
yet to be completed as the government has started negotiations for
the production sharing contract with two companies only.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two foreign companies submitted 37 proposals for 12 out
of the 15 blocks, and 11 blocks were awarded to different
companies in the second-round bidding.
</P>
<P>
The current estimate of gas reserve in Bangladesh is 30 to 40
trillion cubic feet, including 13 trillion cubic feet already
discovered.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Interest Rates Rise as Economy Strengthens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's central bank,
the Reserve Bank, raised interest rates Wednesday, and signaled
more to come.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash said interest
rates need to rise to guard against the economy overheating and
pushing up inflation.
</P>
<P>
"The Reserve Bank's foot is easing on the accelerator but not
applying the brakes, at least at this stage," Brash said.
</P>
<P>
He raised the official cash rate, the rate at which banks lend
to each other, from 4.5 percent to five percent.
</P>
<P>
That is likely to see the major banks lifting floating and
short-term rates, probably within the next month.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand has basked in the lowest interest rates in 30
years.
</P>
<P>
Brash said his bank expects the economy in the country to "have
bounced back quickly" in the third quarter of the year, though the
most recent official figures on growth in the economy showed a
small fall of 0.3 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
More rate rises will follow, he added.
</P>
<P>
Brash said the official cash rate could hit 6.5 percent or more
by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the picture of the economy Brash paints is of growth
returning, inflation rising and unemployment slowly falling. He
predicted that the economy in New Zealand will grow four percent a
year during the next two to three years.

<HEADLINE> Australian Govt May Need to Cut Spending: Forecaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Australian federal
government could be forced to make more budget cuts next year to
protect the surplus, the country's leading economics forecaster
Access Economics said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In its latest budget monitor, Access predicts that the
country's 5.4-billion-Australian dollar (3.6 billion U.S. dollars)
surplus forecast for 1999-2000 could turn into a
500-million-Australian dollar (330 million U.S. dollars) deficit.
</P>
<P>
The turnaround would be mainly due to the need to find up to
1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.12 billion U.S. dollars) to pay
for Australia's military commitment for East Timor, and 1 billion
Australian dollars (660 million U.S. dollars) in concessions on
the goods and services tax (GST) package.
</P>
<P>
"Those two things that have cropped up since the budget, the
compromise with the Democrats on the GST and the cost of spending
for Timor, may just tip us into cash deficit," Access director
Chris Richardson told ABC television.
</P>
<P>
He said the government could overcome the deficit through
accounting procedures, further spending cuts or increased revenue.
</P>
<P>
"If things don't go the government's way, then next May could
see a tougher budget than many people expect," Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
The government is currently finalizing its mid-year budget
forecast which will take account of the cost of the troop
deployment to East Timor.

<HEADLINE> Desertification Being Tamed in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, November 17 (Xinhua) -- According to The State
Forestry Administration said, desertification in the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, northwest China, was reduced from 16,500 sq km
in 1990 to 12,600 sq km in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to experts and scholars, alleviation in
desertification is resultant from a campaign introduced by Ningxia
eight years ago encouraging individuals and enterprises to fight
desertification.
</P>
<P>
In Yanchi County, for example, where desertification makes up
20 percent of the total land area, farmers have grown liquorice,
jujube and other kinds of plants for control of desertification.
Consequently, desertification was reduced by 30 percent and forest
and grass covered areas rose from 9 percent to 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
In southern mountainous areas where soil-eroded land made up 76
percent of the total area, farmers were mobilized to plant trees
and grasses. Incomplete statistics disclose that 67,000 ha of
grass and 200,000 ha of forest have been planted in the last eight
years.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia has reclaimed 92.12 sq km of soil-eroded land. Mud and
silt washed into the Yellow River has was reduced by 40 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia has also controlled desertification in a 4,000 sq km
area.

<HEADLINE> China Drills Asia's Deepest Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Work on a 5,000-meter deep
well has just started in Donghai County in northern part of east
China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Drilling of the well will cost 168 million yuan (20.2 million
US dollars) and be used for collecting geological information deep
underneath the earth's surface.
</P>
<P>
Xu Zhiqin, a scientist in charge of the well-drilling project,
said that Donghai County has been chosen as the well site because
it is located along a high pressure metamorphic belt which is
important to global geological studies.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu, the mantle material 10,000 meters under the
earth's surface along the belt was raised up near the surface
during a drastic orogenic movement 200 million years ago. The
drilling well, said Xu, will actually go through the rock stratum
once buried 10,000 meters under the earth's surface.
</P>
<P>
Geological data obtained through the drilling well in Donghai
will be much richer than in many other areas and will be of great
value to geological studies and seismic activities.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are only about 12 scientific drilling wells
with a depth of at least 3,000 meters in the world.

<P>
HAIKOU, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The entry into the WTO (World
Trade Organization) of the People's Republic of China and later of
Taiwan region will strengthen agricultural cooperation, said agro-
scientists across the Taiwan straits.
</P>
<P>
The entry will force Taiwan to reform its agricultural industry
and cut its labor intensive industries. The Chinese mainland will
have to improve the quality of its agricultural products and
introduce technology, investment and modern operation, said Niu
Ruofeng, ex-president of the Institute of Agriculture and Economy
attached to the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science.
Cooperation between the two sides has great potential and
possibility.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland is very likely to become Taiwan's supplier
of many farm products after the entry into the WTO, said Chen Fu
Xiong, who works at the No.1 University of Science and Technology
in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's investment in the Chinese mainland has exceeded 1.5
billion U.S. dollars. The State Council has approved of

environment in the south.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a 4,212-km pipeline from southern Xinjiang to
Shanghai will be built to stimulate the development of the natural
gas resources in the Tarim Basin. This will ease the energy
shortage in the developed Yangtze River Delta in east China.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Government Welcomes Saab bid for Celsius Defense Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish government
Tuesday hailed the country's aerospace group Saab AB's acquisition
of Celsius AB defense materials group as of great importance in
sharpening Sweden's international competitive edge in this sector.
</P>
<P>
Defense officials held that the merger is of immense
significance both for prompting the country's restructuring of the
war industry and for whetting the competitiveness of its military
products on the world market.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between the two large Swedish
defense groups, Saab AB, which is mainly owned by British
Aerospace Plc and Investor AB, announced that it would take over
partly state-owned Celsius for 5 billion kronor (600 million U.S.
dollars) in a bid to create "a leading Nordic defense company" in
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The merged agglomerate, with 18,300 employees, would be the
biggest military equipment maker in the Nordic region, with an
annual turnover of 22.5 billion kronor (2.7 billion dollars), Saab
officials revealed. It would focus on developing control and guide
systems, military aircraft and missile systems.
</P>
<P>
Saab forecast that the deal will cut back 400 million kronor (
48 million dollars) in its operation spending and help Swedish
defense companies participate in future international cooperation
in war industry.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Test Swimmers at Asian Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Swimming
Federation (PRSI) will send its swimmers to the Asia Championships
in Pusan, South Korea, in March before they take part in the
Olympics in Sydney in September next year.
</P>
<P>
The federation's deputy in charge of athletic development
Kristiono Sumono said that it would not send swimmers to the
Olympics if they failed to fulfill the targets set for them in the
championships.
</P>
<P>
"We expect them to finish fifth in all individual events and
third in all team events at the championships," he was quoted by
the Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The federation plans to send male swimmers Richard Sam Bera,
Wisnu Wardhana, Albert and Felix Christiadi Sutanto, Akbar
Nasution, Steven Chandra and females Elsa Manora Nasution and
Siripiya Sutanto.
</P>
<P>
So far, only Richard (50m and 100m freestyle), Wisnu (50m
freestyle), Albert (100m and 200m butterfly and 400m individual
medley), Akbar (200m breaststroke) and Elsa (100m backstroke) have
qualified for the Olympics B qualification based on their best
times in the Southeast Asian Games in Brunei Darussalam in August
this year.
</P>
<P>
"In Asia, Indonesia must be able to compete against China,
Japan and the ex-Soviet countries. By being in the top five in
Asia we can join the elite of the continent. It will be very
difficult for us to compete against the strongest countries in the
world," Kristiono said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the country's 4X100m freestyle relay team could
qualify for the Olympics, which means that Felix could join the
Olympics team.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if their swimmers performed poorly the
federation would cancel its plan to send them to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
As a warm-up to the championships, the federation will send the
swimmers to the Grand Prix Final in Hong Kong of China on January
8 and 9.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The number of diabetics is
rising in China's rural areas because of poor diet, an increasing
lack of exercise and poor health-maintenance information, a report
said today.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the number of people with diabetes in rural
areas has outgrown the suburban diabetic population, the English
newspaper China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 3.3 percent of the Chinese
population has diabetes, and the number is rising by 0.1 percent
each year.
</P>
<P>
The rural diabetes rate is caused by a tendency of non-
scientific eating habit as their incomes increase, experts said.
</P>
<P>
People in rural areas should get more exercise and eat less
sugar and fatty meats to defend themselves against the disease.
</P>
<P>
And those who have a family story of the disease should have
examines to detect it as soon as possible, the experts noted.
</P>
<P>
However, to give people regular medical checkups, rural China
needs better medical equipment and better trained health-care
workers, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Seizes 10 Kg Heroin at Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Over 10 kilograms of heroin
worth more than 15 million rupees (210,000 U.S. dollars) were
seized at Sri Lanka's Bandaranaike International Airport in
northern suburban Colombo, police sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The seizure, the largest so far this year, was made on Tuesday
evening following information received by Police Narcotics Bureau
(PNB) detectives, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The detectives recovered the heroin from a Sri Lankan who
arrived from the Chennai Airport on an Indian Airlines flight.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old man from Colombo had the narcotics concealed
among 38 sarees tightly packed in polythene bags, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The previous largest haul of heroin amounting to nine kilograms
was made by the PNB at Peliyagoda, in the suburbs of Colombo,
earlier this year. Two men from Mawanella in Kegalle District were
arrested while transporting the heroin.
</P>
<P>
The smuggling of heroin into Sri Lanka has been on the rise due
to its strategic location between two main drug producing areas,
the Golden Triangle of Myanmar, Thailand and Laos and the Golden
Crescent comprising Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka, plagued by the drug problem at home, has also been
used by major drug traffickers as a transit point to transport
large quantities of heroin to Europe and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria May Reshuffle Cabinet After December 10: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 SOFIA, November 16 (Xinhua) - Bulgarian Prime Minister
Ivan Kostov said here on Tuesday that there will be no change in
the government before December 10. He said changes would be
possible only after Bulgaria receives an invitation to start EU
membership talks.
</P>
<P>
Kostov spoke to the press after a meeting of the ruling Union
of Democratic Forces (UDF) which he chairs.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made his plan for a cabinet reshuffle
public after the first round of local elections on October 16.
</P>
<P>
 At the Tuesday meeting, the National Council (the leadership
of the UDF) analyzed local election results. It adopted a
resolution assessing responsibility for the loss of votes during
the impending changes in the government at UDF municipal and
district levels.
</P>
<P>
The resolution says that some negative aspects, such as
nominating unsuitable candidates, acts of arrogance, haughtiness
and of deriving undue benefit from power, should also be taken
into account when summing up the election results.
</P>
<P>
The National Council decided to set up a commission to
evaluate the UDF's political behavior and organizational
performance in local elections.
</P>
<P>
 The commission will also work out a draft resolution on the
parliamentary elections for the year, which will be discussed at
the UDF National Conference. Ivan Kostov, the UDF leader who will
chair the commission, will nominate its members.
</P>
<P>
The UDF parliamentary group will assess the behavior of all
MPs and make decisions for an improvement in their political
activities.
</P>
<P>
The National Council believes the UDF should revise its
behavior as a coalition partner. The UDF's cooperation with the
partners in the United Democratic Forces (UtDF) coalition was
described as inefficient.  A recommendation was made to meet
demands of some UDF partners and change the UtDF formula in order
to reckon with the presence and political sway of all parties in
the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the positive fact that voters are becoming less
motivated by ethnic or religious considerations, the National
Council expressed the opinion that both the UDF and the ethnic
Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) had made mistakes at
central and local levels.
</P>
<P>
It was suggested they seek parliamentary interaction with the
MRF in the European and Euro-Atlantic area of the country's
foreign policy. The resolution says that the local chapters of the
UDF should seek partnership and form coalitions with the MRF in
municipal and regional governments.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the responsibility of the National Executive Board
will be the dominant topic at the UDF National Conference," UDF
floor leader Ekaterina Mihailova said. "The date of the National
Conference will be discussed at the next National Council in early
December," she said.
</P>
<P>
One of the mistakes made during the election campaign is that
the MPs were made to take on too many political and organizational
responsibilities, which hindered them from doing their
parliamentary job well, Mihailova said.
</P>
<P>
"There are views that some cabinet changes should be made; it
is up to the Prime Minister to say what they will be," said
Mihailova.
</P>
<P>
She held that the cabinet reshuffle will be made in
consultation with the parliamentary majority of the UtDF.

<HEADLINE> Hunter Turn Tiger Protectionist in SE China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 17 (Xinhua)-- Huang Zaiqiu, a 75-year-old
tiger hunter is well known for his heroic and brave feats in south
China's Fujian province when in the 1950s he killed three tigers.
</P>
<P>
The number of South China tigers in China has declined
dramatically in the past few decades from 4,000 to some twenty or
thirty living in highland reserves in Fujian, Hunan, Sichuan and
Jiangxi provinces. Wild tigers have only been spotted periodically
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The South China tiger which resides in the Meihua mountains in
Fujian was listed under national protection in 1988. Local
officials invited Huang to come out of his hermetic existence in a
forest and help as a tiger guide and share his knowledge and
expertise on the tiger.
</P>
<P>
As soon as Huang learnt that the South China tiger was a
protected species, he was shocked beyond comprehension. Huang
comes from a long line of hunters and the thought of protecting a
predator was unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
However, after working for a few years as a warden for The
State Forestry Administration and the World Wildlife Fund, Huang
gradually saw the tiger and the environment in a whole new light.
</P>
<P>
Huang takes every opportunity to educate his villagers with
what he has learned from his research colleagues. His words are
more understandable to local villagers than any pronouncements
coming from the government because of his wealth of experience.
</P>
<P>
Huang was recently awarded by the local government as the "Best
South China Tiger Protection Activist", which for Huang, sounds a
lot more better than "heroical tiger hunter".
</P>
<P>
Despite his old age, Huang often walks several dozens
kilometers of mountain road in his efforts to protect the tiger.
</P>
<P>
Huang is delighted that several hundreds of thousands yuan has
been donated by the young people to set up a Wild Life Reserve
Park in the Meihua Mountain.

<HEADLINE> Serena Williams Withdraws from Chase Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Open champion Serena
Williams was forced to withdraw from the season-ending Chase
Championships after sustaining a back injury during a Tuesday
morning practice session, WTA Tour officials announced.
</P>
<P>
Williams, 18, was to have made her debut in the 16-player
season finale as the fourth seed Tuesday night against Dominique
Van Roost of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
"This was the first year I've qualified for the Chase and I can
't believe this had to happen," Williams said in a statement
released by the WTA Tour.
</P>
<P>
Williams will be replaced in the singles draw by 19th-ranked
Russian Elena Likhovtseva. The doubles team of Serena and sister
Venus Williams will be replaced by Spaniard Conchita Martinez and
Argentine Patricia Tarabini, the WTA Tour said.
</P>
<P>
Williams is the second marquee name to pull out from the season
finale. Last week, injured three-time champion Monica Seles was
forced to withdraw from the tournament that is already missing
recently retired former champions Steffi Graf and Jana Novotna.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Flamengo officially
rescinded star striker Romario's contract Tuesday for sneaking out
of training camp to go to a nightclub, the club's president said.
</P>
<P>
Romario, the FIFA Player of the Year in 1994, and two other
players, Fabio Baiano and Leandro Machado, went to a nightclub
hours after Flamengo's 3-1 loss to Juventude last Wednesday in the
final round of the regular season of the Brazilian national
championship.
</P>
<P>
Flamengo needed a win to keep alive its chances of making the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
The Club president Edmundo Santuo Silva said the team had
already contracted a replacement for Romario but declined to name
him. The two names most frequently cited in the Brazilian press
are Savio of Real Madrid and Leonardo of Milan.
</P>
<P>
Romario's contract expires in December, and the 33-year-old
striker reportedly has had at least five offers to play in Brazil
and abroad.

<P>
SAN JOSE, November 16 (Xinhua) -- China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) will be beneficial to Costa Rica, Vice
Foreign Trade Minister Anabel Gonzalez said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican official said in a statement that China's entry
into the WTO would constitute "an important step" toward achieving
the goal of integrating one of the world's most important
countries into the market economy.
</P>
<P>
As to the bilateral talks between Costa Rica and China over the
latter's WTO accession, eight rounds have been held and Costa Rica
hopes that the talks driven by Ambassador Ronald Saborio will come
to a success in the next few weeks, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica requests concession from China in about 90 tariff
clauses, Gonzalez added, saying that China's entry into the WTO
would mean greater competition for Costa Rica, particularly in
such products as clothing.

<HEADLINE> Keegan: England's Failure Would be Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- England football team manager
Kevin Keegan warned Tuesday that failure to reach Euro 2000 would
be "the biggest disaster ever to happen to England".
</P>
<P>
Keegan's men are in the driving seat with a 2-0 lead going into
the second leg of the qualifying play-off against Scotland at
Wembley on Wednesday. It seems unthinkable that skipper Alan
Shearer and company could surrender the advantage given to them by
Paul Scholes' brace at Hampden Park on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But England coach Keegan, who is likely to name an unchanged
side if defender Martin Keown is passed fit, knows there is still
a job to be completed before the celebrations can begin in earnest.
</P>
<P>
He is determined that England will run out at Wembley with a
positive outlook and attempt to turn on the style rather than be
content to hold on to the advantage obtained in Glasgow.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said: "We worked really hard on Saturday to get to where
we are now in the tie and it will be a terrible waste of effort if
we don't go on to complete the job.
</P>
<P>
"When I came into this job I didn't know if I would be there
when it happened but I always felt we would qualify for Euro 2000.
What I didn't know was what a rocky road it would be - and still
is.
</P>
<P>
"On the one side you have got one foot towards Euro 2000. Then
at the back of it you are saying 'hold on, if we don't go through
now, this is probably the biggest disaster ever to happen to
England'.
</P>
<P>
"We've got to do a professional job, finish off Saturday's work,
but it's also the chance to give the fans and the critics some
more belief that we can go to Euro 2000 with a winner's chance.
</P>
<P>
"It will certainly not be our intention to go out there and
think that 0-0 will suffice."

<HEADLINE> Keown May Miss Return Leg of England-Scotland Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- England defender Martin Keown,
who has a calf strain, only has a 50-50 chance of playing in the
European Championship play-off return leg match against Scotland
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But goalkeeper David Seaman has recovered from a similar knock
and will play.
</P>
<P>
Coach Kevin Keegan said: "David's kicking was the main concern
but he's had a fitness test and he's fine.
</P>
<P>
"Martin Keown missed training this morning and I'm giving him
24 hours but if he doesn't make it Aston Villa's Gareth Southgate
will play.
</P>
<P>
"Martin has a habit of not missing games but he needs to be fit
enough to play."
</P>
<P>
Apart from those worries, Keegan expects to play pretty much
the same side that won 2-0 at Hampden Park in the first leg.
</P>
<P>
Keegan added he had been impressed by the passionate Scottish
fans at Hampden on Saturday - but the play-off would be decided on
the pitch.
</P>
<P>
He said: "You have to know what the game meant to the Scots.
They are great supporters, the Scots. You cannot take that away
from them.
</P>
<P>
"We knew we were going into a cauldron. But a football match is
not decided on how the national anthems are sung.
</P>
<P>
"On Wednesday everyone can let rip and then we ll decide the
tie on the pitch. It is not the European Song Contest," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Able to Pay $350 Million UN Dues to Keep Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States will be able
to pay 350 million U.S. dollars in owed dues to the United Nations
this year in order to keep its seat in the General Assembly of the
world body, State Department spokesman James Rubin said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Our current estimates indicate we need to pay the United Nations
some 350 million U.S. dollars by the end of the year to avoid losing
our vote," Rubin told reporters at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the Clinton administration will seek the funds from the
departments of Justice, Commerce and State to pay "calendar '99
assessments in full with no unacceptable conditions."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currently owes the U.N. 1.6 billion U.S. dollars. The U.N.
charter calls for taking away the vote of a country at the General
Assembly behind two years in its dues.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration and Congress reached a tentative
agreement on Sunday that the U.S. will pay back its dues to the U.N.
with conditions that the world body will agree to reduce the U.S.
share of dues from 25 percent to 20 percent, and the U.S. share of
peacekeeping costs from 31 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, U.S. will pay nearly one billion U.S.
dollars in arrears to the U.N., but it prohibits U.S. funding for
family planning groups that promote abortion rights for women.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is "the best possible under terrible circumstances,"
Rubin said, adding, "We're not happy about this agreement."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made it clear that the agreement would be a "one-year
agreement that will be debated again and hopefully with a different
outcome in another year."
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed, "We are pleased that the tentative agreement
has broken the impasse over the United Nations arrears."

<HEADLINE> FBI Takeover of EgyptAir Probe May Be Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A takeover by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of the investigation into the cause
of an EgyptAir plane crash may be delayed, U.S. sources said late
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The possible delay stems from Egyptian officials who requested
more reviews of Flight 990's cockpit tapes, the sources said. There
were no details available of the precise objections.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, the White House said investigation of the
crash which caused the death of 217 on board the Boeing 767-300
plane on New York-Cairo route would be carried out by FBI instead
of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).
</P>
<P>
Some section of the U.S. media even guesses that the
announcement of the takeover may be made as early as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. sources indicated that the change of the investigation
lead should await until the objections are solved by Egyptian
officials, FBI and NTSB.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigation found that someone in the cockpit
uttered a prayer before the jet's autopilot disengaged and the
plane started its fatal plunge early morning October 31.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S. rules, the NTSB is in charge of the
investigation of air transportation accidents while the FBI has
jurisdiction over destruction of an aircraft and crimes committed
aboard an aircraft.
</P>
<P>
If investigators think the plane was brought down by foul
play, they will try to determine whether the perpetrator was
assisted by a terrorist group in a suicide plot or acted alone
because of a personal problem.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have so far not ruled in or out technical, human
or criminal aspects leading to the crash, and they are actively
analyzing the tapes of two "black boxes" -- the flight data
recorder and the cockpit voice recorder.

UNITED NATIONS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA) announced Tuesday that it is distributing
emergency home delivery kits to mothers in East Timor whose
maternal mortality rate ranks among the highest in the world.
</P>

UNFPA's supplies, enough to serve a population of 400,000
people, about the number of women in East Timor for three months,
arrived in its capital of Dili last week and they are being
distributed by non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that 830 mothers per 100,000 live births in
East Timor die from pregnancy-related causes.
</P>
<P>
Some 85 percent of babies in East Timor are delivered at home
and 60 percent of these home deliveries are not attended by
trained health personnel.

<HEADLINE> Algeria's President Restates Terms For Ties With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Algerian President
Abdelaziz Bouteflika Tuesday restated the terms his country
demands for restoring relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema,
Bouteflika said that "Algeria is ready to restore diplomatic
relations in 24 hours, but we ask for a withdrawal from the Golan
Heights, the Territories and South Lebanon, meeting the U.N.
Security Council's resolutions."
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika said the situation in the Middle East, and above all
the conduct of Israeli authorities, did not appear "seductive".
</P>
<P>
"There will be no diplomatic relations before a withdrawal from
the Golan Heights and South Lebanon," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Widely considered his country's best hope for healing the
wounds from seven years of civil conflict, Bouteflika was welcomed
with "solidarity" to the Italian capital Tuesday by Italian Prime
Minister Massimo D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the two Mediterranean leaders at Palazzo
Chigi, marked the first official visit for Bouteflika since his
election in April.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian head of state, who arrived in Rome Monday, thanked
Italy for its role both in that nation's war for independence and
the recent years of bloodshed involving Muslim extremists and
government troops.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika had originally been invited to visit Italy by
Italian President of the Republic Carlo Azeglio Ciampi when they
were both in Rabat on July 25 for the funeral of Morocco's King
Hassan II.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Condemns Attacks on UN Offices in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Tuesday condemned the attacks on the U.N.
offices in Afghanistan and called for increased security for
U.N. humanitarian personnel and facilities.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Security Council held closed-door
consultations on Afghanistan during which the Council was briefed
on the latest situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sanctions against Afghanistan's biggest warring party the
Taliban went into force Sunday after its failure to hand over
Saudi dissident bin Laden, after which angry demonstrators
attacked U.N. offices in Kabul and other cities.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council reiterated its demand that the Taliban
turn over Bin Laden as set out in its relevant resolution.
</P>
<P>
The Council emphasized the importance of the humanitarian
assistance to Afghan people and commended the courage shown by
U.N. and other international personnel as well as their will to
continue to provide humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
 The Council urged all states to enhance humanitarian
assistance to Afghan people and call upon parties in Afghanistan
to enable access of humanitarian assistance to the people in need.
</P>
<P>
Bin laden, a Saudi dissident who lives in Afghanistan, is
accused of plotting the bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania last year which killed at least 220 people.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has accused the Taliban of not doing
enough to stop the violent protests.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Monday reminded the
Taliban of its responsibility of protecting the safe of U.N.
property and U.N. personnel in the country.

of them can resist the common will to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
Spain and Portugal have converted themselves into indispensable
bridges for the strengthening of ties between Latin America and
the European Community, underlining the fact that the
Ibero-American conferences prepared the way for the celebration
this year of the Rio Summit with the cooperation of the two
regions, said Castro.
</P>
<P>
The Ibero-American Summit, grouping 21 member states, aims to
foster cooperation among Spanish-and Portuguese-speaking nations.
But only 16 heads of the state attended Tuesday's summit.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the host country, the Chiefs of State and
Government from Spain, Portugal, Mexico, Guatamala, Honduras,
Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil,
Paraguay, Uruguay and The Dominican Republic are attending the 9th
Ibero-American Summit.
</P>
<P>
Chilean President Eduardo Frei did not come to Havana to
protest the arrest of former Chilean leader Pinochet in Britain on
an extradition request from Spain. Argentine President Carlos
Menem followed suit in solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Other absentees are Presidents of Coata Rica, Nicaragua and El
Salvador, because of political differences with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the Summit, which has "Ibero-America and the
international financial situation in a globalized economy" as its
central theme, the participating presidents will approve the
Declaration of Havana, the final document of the Summit.
</P>
<P>
They will also approve seven special declarations on regional
themes, including the peace process in Colombia, the return of the
Panama Canal, the reconstruction of Central America and the peace
agreements reached between Ecuador and Peru, among others.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks Consolidate Position in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Foreign capital banks this
year have consolidated their position on Romanian banking market,
by holding now 48.9 percent of the total assets and 69.7 percent
of the capital accounts, the official Rompres news agency reported
on Tuesday citing Central Bank Governor Mugur Isarescu as saying.
</P>
<P>
The foreign banks held only 26.8 percent of the total assets
and 34 percent of the capital accounts at the beginning of this
year, according to Isarescu.
</P>
<P>
Four of the first seven banks in Romania have foreign majority
capital, central bank's governor added.
</P>
<P>
According to Isarescu, the most difficult test for the reform
in Romania was the economic crisis in Russia in the summer of
1998. In conditions of growing disbalance of payments and an
extremely high foreign debt service, the Romanian authorities
avoided administrative steps, seeking instead an overcoming of the
crisis by speeding up the reform measures.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the possibility of taking administrative
measures, such as freezing the prices, and invited to a close
analysis of the consequences induced by such steps.
</P>
<P>
The objectives that the Central Bank constantly pursued over
this period were and still are reducing the disbalance of foreign
payments, money supply control, reconsidering inflation and
watching the banking system.
</P>
<P>
Nine commercial banks with foreign capital and around ten other
Romanian commercial banks with shares of foreign capital operate
in Romania. The number of Romanian banks is 36.

<HEADLINE> Protests Banned in Athens During Clinton's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- For reasons of public safety,
all protests, rallies and marches of organized groups throughout
central Athens and from the airport to the center of the capital
will be banned during U.S. President Bill Clinton's forthcoming
visit to Greece on November 19-20, Attica police chief Giorgos
Skaltsas announced late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ban will go into effect as of Friday at 3 p.m. local time
until Saturday at 5 p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
The police chief warned that any attempt to violate the ban
will be opposed with all legal means while participants in such
protests will be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, traffic police in the Attica prefecture announced
Tuesday that several main streets and roads leading from the
Athens airport to the center of the city via Piraeus will be
closed to traffic at certain sections during the arrival and
departure of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who was to start his first-ever visit to Greece last
Saturday, delayed and shortened his Athens trip amid security
concerns and the prospect of anti-American protests.
</P>
<P>
All left-wing political parties, pacifists, trade unionists and
students oppose Clinton's visit to Greece, and they have decided
to stage a series of protests in Athens and other cities to
demonstrate their opposition to U.S. and NATO policies.

<HEADLINE> German Wise Men Predict Short Term Growth in Year 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Germany's economic advisory
panel, known as the Five Wise Men, Tuesday released their
prognostic report that said the world's third largest economy
would grow by 2.7 per cent in year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The panel led by Prof. Herbert Hax said German economy would
grow by mere 1.4 percent this year and labelled Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's economic policy as "confusing."
</P>
<P>
In their report titled "Economic Policy under Pressure of
Reform," the Wise Men said Schroeder's economic policy caused the
financial market "insecure" and criticized Schroeder's employment
policy. The report was submitted to Schroeder in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
However, the Wise Men praised Shroeder's 30-billion-mark
austerity program, saying, "the consolidation of the state
finances is focused on important issues."
</P>
<P>
The growth will attribute to prosperous export sector, forecast
to expand by 6.6 percent, while capital investment is expected to
grow 3.4 percent and private consumption by 2.1 percent, the Wise
Men said
</P>
<P>
The report gave a harsh judgement to Finance Minister Hans
Eichel's 8-billion-mark corporate tax reform plan by saying it was
"insufficient". The Wise Men urged a more sweeping plan to cut
corporate tax by 30 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
They also demanded a reform of Germany's social welfare system
and more flexibility in labor market. One Wise Man, Prof. Juergen
Kromphardt, warned against lower demands in next year caused by
slow income growth.
</P>
<P>
The Wise Men projected 218,000 jobs to be created in next year,
thus the unemployment in Germany would drop to some 3.9 million
from over 4 million in this year.
