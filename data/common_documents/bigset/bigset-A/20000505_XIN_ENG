<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Reimposes Censorship on Foreign Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka Thursday reimposed
censorship on the Colombo-based foreign media with regard to
reporting of the civil war between government troops and Tamil
Tiger rebels.
</P>
<P>
The censorship was reimposed as part of the Public Security
Ordinance that was invoked on Wednesday by the government to deal
with a fresh offensive by rebels in the northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Under the new regulations, the government has powers to stop
sale and distribution of newspapers seen contravening national
security interests and shut down printing presses.
</P>
<P>
The government last imposed censorship on foreign media in 1998,
but later lifted it. War news in local newspapers is already
censored by the government.
</P>
<P>
The government's move came as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam rebels have scored stunning victories against government
troops in recent weeks in their push toward Jaffna, their former
stronghold which they lost to government troops in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Adopt more IT-related Laws: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHIANG MAI, Thailand, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will adopt
more information technology-related laws to make the country
better adapted to the information age, Arthit Urairat, science,
technology and environment minister of Thailand, said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar co-organized by the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) and the International Business Machines Corporation,
Arthit said so far Thailand has adopted six IT-related laws,
including electronic transaction act, electronic signature act,
data protection act, electronic funds transfer act, computer crime
act and universal access act.
</P>
<P>
Among them, the electronic transaction law is based on the
United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)
model law on electronic commerce and recognizes the validity of
contracts created by electronic communications, the minister
explained, adding that electronic signature law is based on
UNCITRAL draft uniform rules on electronic signatures to provide
the security and authentication of electronic commerce transaction.
</P>
<P>
More new laws related to the regulation of IT industry are in
the process of being drafted, Arthit said.
</P>
<P>
The Internet will have tremendous impact on life, work and
progress of the human being, he said, calling the coming era the
era of "networked and networkable products and services."
</P>
<P>
The Internet can greatly reduce cost of production, make the
global market borderless and timeless and allow easier goods
delivery. "Growth in the future depends on the growth of the
internet," the minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
Electronic commerce is considered an important trade strategy
for Thailand and will be included in the ninth and 10th National
Economic and Social Development Plan.
</P>
<P>
The ADB is going to hold the 33rd annual meeting of the board
of governors in Chiang Mai, some 1,000 kilometers north of Bangkok,
from May 6 to May 8.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations peacekeeping force
in Sierra Leone warned on Thursday that the recent attacks on UN
troops by rebels could lead to violent confrontations between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in the west African country's capital
Freetown, the UN force also accused the rebels of the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) of completely destroying
disarmament camps in the country's central towns of Makeni and
Magburaka, in addition to taking dozens of UN personnel hostage
and killing of its soldiers.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the UN force said that there had been sporadic
gun shots on Wednesday night in the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, RUF leader Foday Sankoh made a broadcast message
Wednesday promising "immediate measures" to free the detainees.

<HEADLINE> U.N. For Dismantling Pro-Israeli Militia: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Roed Larsen, envoy of the United
Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, told a press conference here
Friday that the U.N. shares Lebanon's view the pro-Israel South
Lebanon Army (SLA) should be dismantled during the Israeli
withdrawal process.
</P>
<P>
After his third round of meeting with Lebanese leaders, Larsen
stressed that Israel must "cease all communication with the SLA and
the Israeli-allied militia have to give up their heavy weapons."
</P>
<P>
"These are the conditions of the United Nations to verify the
(Israeli) withdrawal" from south Lebanon, said the U.N. deputy
secretary general.
</P>
<P>
Larsen reiterated that Israel should release all Lebanese
detainees in Israeli jails, most of whom being held for years
without trial or even without charges.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the Security Council will decide on the
land dispute between Israel and Lebanon over Shebbaa Farms, adding
that the U.N. will identify the border line.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized Shebbaa Farms during the 1967 Mideast war. The
highly fertile farms are located at the foot of Mount Hermon,
Syria's highest mountain which is now under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israel said the farms belong to Syria, and that a withdrawal
from the area would be dealt with in its peace talks with Damascus.
</P>
<P>
But Lebanon argued that the area was transferred to Lebanon in a
1951 agreement between Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Larsen expressed welcome to a joint statement issued Thursday by
foreign ministers of Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, in which they
agreed that U.N. peacekeeping force should be deployed into south
Lebanon after Israel's withdrawal, scheduled by July.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy deplored Israel's repeated attacks on Lebanese
civilians and civil facilities, saying "any attacks against any
civilians are unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Larsen left Beirut later Friday to the village of Nakulla in
south Lebanon to supervise the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL) and he will go to Syria on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Larsen is on a two-week Mideast tour starting late April from
Israel. After Syria, he will also visit Jordan and Egypt,
accompanied by a team of political, military and legal advisors.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is expected to decide this month whether to
reinforce or withdraw UNIFIL, based on Larsen's report following
his visit.

<HEADLINE> IPU Calls for Lifting Sanctions, Without Mentioning Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU)
concluded its six-day 103rd conference here on Friday with a call
for lifting all sanctions that most badly affected civilians.
</P>
<P>
The appeal fell short of mentioning Iraq despite intensive
lobbying efforts by the country.
</P>
<P>
As part of a final resolution on world peace, stability, and
development, the IPU requested "the abolition of those types of
sanctions that hit civilians, and especially children, the
hardest," but did not mention the name or cases of any country.
</P>
<P>
During the IPU session, the Iraqi delegation, headed by National
Assembly Speaker Saadoun Hamadi, lobbied hard to draw attention of
the participants to the plight of Iraqi people under the decade-old
international sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Hamadi said on different occasions that some 1.5 million Iraqis
died under the embargo, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, and now over 7,000 Iraqi children are dying monthly due to
malnutrition or lack of necessary medication.
</P>
<P>
He called the crippling sanctions as a "war of massive
slaughter" that had been more barbarous than weapons of massive
destruction, and urged for a joint Arab action to help end the
ordeal of Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the IPU conference also passed resolutions on the
rights of refugees and the promotion of dialog between different
cultures and civilizations.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva-based IPU was founded in 1889. With 144 members at
present, it makes its biannual conference the largest forum for
international parliamentary diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Its next session is expected to be held in October in Jakarta,
Indonesia.

DAMASCUS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
phoned Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh on Friday over the
recent Israeli air raids on Lebanese infrastructures and the
scheduled Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Annan expressed appreciation for the joint statement issued
Thursday after a meeting between Shareh and his Egyptian and Saudi
counterparts, Amr Moussa and Prince Saud al-Faisal, in Syria.
</P>
<P>
The three ministers agreed in the statement to hold the United
Nations responsible for the implementation of the U.N. Security
Council Resolutions 425 and 426 through the U.N. mission on the
Lebanese-Israeli borders.
</P>
<P>
Shareh told Annan that Syria was always committed to the U.N.
Charter and U.N. resolutions, pointing out that the Israeli attacks
against Lebanese civil targets triggered the ongoing tension in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Israeli fighter jets launched air raids in the small hours of
Friday on two Lebanese power stations and the Beirut-Damascus
highway, injuring at least dozen Lebanese citizens.
</P>
<P>
Israel said the offensive was a retaliation for the Lebanese
Hezbollah rocket attacks on north Israel mid-Thursday, which killed
an Israeli soldier and wounded another soldier and five civilians.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Thursday evening, Hezbollah claimed
responsibility for the attacks, saying they were avenging the
Israeli attacks that killed two Lebanese civilians Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Roed Larsen, envoy of the United Nations Secretary General Kofi
Annan, will start his visit to Syria on Saturday as part of his
ongoing Mideast tour that has taken him to Israel and Lebanon and
will also take him to Jordan and Egypt.

DAMASCUS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright phoned Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh on Friday over
the latest developments in the Middle East and the escalating
tension in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The two sides condemned targeting civilians in both Lebanon and
Israel and urged the warring parties to exercise self-restraint.
</P>
<P>
Shareh asserted that reports verified by Lebanon showed that
Israel was to blame for the recent escalation in south Lebanon, the
Arab-Syrian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Syria is against the escalating tension and the renewed attacks
on Lebanese civilian targets, Shareh told Albright, noting that the
attacks coincided with Israel's talks about its intention to pull
out from south Lebanon by July, ending its 22-year occupation
there.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes bombed two power stations in Lebanon, the
Beirut-Damascus highway and a guerrilla arms depot early Friday in
retaliation for rocket attacks by Lebanese Hezbollah on northern
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The guerillas rocketed northern Israel Thursday afternoon for
the deaths of an 80-year-old woman and her 40-year-old daughter and
Israel's earlier air strikes against the Lebanese civilian targets
which wounded at least 12 Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
Expressing deep regret over civilian victims, Albright
reiterated her call on the warring sides to maintain self-
restraint.

WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) announced Friday that it will invest up to 41
million U.S. dollars in the Kipevu II power project, the first
private power project in Kenya to be financed on a non-recourse
project finance basis.
</P>
<P>
The project, whose total cost is 86 million dollars, will build
a 74 megawatt diesel engine generation plant in Mombasa, Kenya's

<P>
Kenya has an acute shortage of power, and Kipevu will provide a
much needed stable source of electricity that will contribute to
economic growth, said the IFC, part of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The IFC's financing consists of an equity investment of up to 1.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori To Win 45 Pct Votes: Polling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Current Peruvian President and
presidential candidate Alberto Fujimori would win the elections in
a second electoral round with 45 percent of the votes, according
to a poll published Friday by the Apoyo firm.
</P>
<P>
The poll, taken at a national level, gives 43 percent of the
voting preferences to opposition candidate Alejandro Toledo,
leader of the Peru Posible party.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori and Toledo will vie in the ballot boxes for the
presidency of Peru in a run-off election on May 28 after none of
them obtained 50 percent of the votes plus one in April 9
elections.
</P>
<P>
The number of persons who will drop a blank ballot represents
four percent of the electors, according to the Apoyo probe, while
eight percent still do not decide whom of the two candidates they
will give their vote to.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian president obtains the bigger electoral acceptance
at the level of the Peruvian capital, with 48 percent of the
suffrages, and the opposition hopeful gets 38 percent of the
preferences.
</P>
<P>
Toledo has first place in other cities of the interior of the
country with 47 percent of the vote against Fujimori's 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Apoyo asked the polled about Fujimori's
credibility and that of Toledo, and the first obtained 49 percent,
while the second got 35 percent.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Invention to Revolutionize Flying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Romanian engineer Grigore Nica
from Bucharest has invented an aircraft whose design can
revolutionize flying, the daily Libertatea reported in its Friday
issue.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft is a disc, looking like a "classical" UFO, able to
take off easily even if it is very big and very heavy. The
inventor said the ship can remain suspended in the air regardless
of the altitude, it can move also on the vertical and easily enter
the outer space, and its speed can increase progressively,
continuously and virtually indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft works according to the principle of annulling the
gravitational force by the centrifugal force, by energy build-up
in the edges. Not only the performance but also the structure are
similar to a UFO's in science fiction.
</P>
<P>
The ship is composed of three functionally interdependent discs,
with a common symmetry axis and the barycenters on the same
vertical axis.
</P>
<P>
The author of the invention said he established the technical
data of the design as early as 1987 but was afraid then to make
public his invention. Not long ago he decided to present the
design to Romtehnica corporation, specialized in foreign trade
with military equipment and services. The file was subsequently
tabled with the State Office for Inventions and Trade Marks, for
getting a license.
</P>
<P>
According to the daily Libertatea, a document signed by
Romtehnica managers, both the National Defense Ministry and the
Agency of Research for Military Technologies showed interest in
the invention. The specialists of these institutions believe the
theory in question is correct. The sizes are being calculated for
the building of a prototype.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Hard-liner Defends Crackdown on Reformists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A hard-line Iranian official on Friday
defended the recent conservative crackdown on the reformist
campaign, insisting that freedoms should not conflict with Islamic
principles.
</P>
<P>
Social and political freedoms should not be opposed to the
Islamic principles, and the Guardians Council has the
responsibility to guarantee the independence of the Islamic system
and national unity, said Mohammad Yazdi, former judiciary chief.
</P>
<P>
Addressing thousands of worshipers during the weekly
congregational prayers, Yazdi also accused the reformist press of
questioning the Islamic principles and norms and the cleric ruling
of the country.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came after the conservative judiciary jailed several
reformist journalists and ordered the closure of 17 publications
last week, as part of the hard-liners' efforts to curb the
reformist campaign fostered by President Mohammad Khatami since he
took office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the February parliamentary elections, Yazdi said
that monitoring the election process is among the duties of the
conservative-dominated Guardians Council, of which he is a member.
</P>
<P>
Reformists allied with the president won more than two thirds of
the 224 seats decided in the first round of elections, ending long-
time conservative control of the parliament which has stymied much
of Khatami's effort for social and cultural reforms.
</P>
<P>
The election watchdog Guardians Council annulled the results in
several constituencies, depriving nine reformist winners of the
right to enter the new parliament. This move stirred up a series of
protests across the country.
</P>
<P>
The council also keeps on delaying the approval of the election
results in Tehran, the most important constituency where reformists
won 29 of the 30 seats in the first round of elections.
</P>
<P>
On the runoff election which started Friday in 52 constituencies
in 22 provinces, Yazdi said its results would be declared by next
Wednesday so that the new parliament would start work on May 27.
</P>
<P>
The runoff will decide the winners of 66 seats not yet decided
because candidates did not get the minimum 25-percent votes needed
to enter the parliament directly.
</P>
<P>
Only after the runoff will the Guardians Council decide whether
to approve the first round results in Tehran and let the new
parliament start work on time, local reports said.

<HEADLINE> Polling Extended in Iran's Parliamentary Runoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The polling for the Iranian
parliamentary runoffs was extended by two hours in all the 52
constituencies due to massive turnout, the Interior Ministry
announced.
</P>
<P>
The voting was scheduled to end at 7 p.m. (1430 GMT) but was
extended to 9 p.m. (1630 GMT), the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The polling started at 9 a.m. (0430 GMT) in 52 constituencies in
22 provinces and some 132 candidates run for the remaining 66 seats
of the 290-seat Majlis (parliament).
</P>
<P>
The result of the runoffs was scheduled to be announced on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The reformist allies of President Mohammad Khatami are expected
to repeat the landslide victory in the February polls despite the
conservative crackdown which shut down almost all outspoken
reformist newspapers in the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
The reformists took over more than two third of the 224 seats in
the first round, ousting the longtime conservative majority in
parliament that had stymied most of the Khatami's reform programs.
</P>
<P>
But the conservative Guardians Council nullified the results in
52 constituencies, depriving nine reformists of their victory, and
forcing others to the runoffs.
</P>
<P>
It also delayed confirmation of results of Tehran constituency,
the biggest and most important one in which the reformists had won
29 out of the total 30 seats.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the fate of the first round polls in Tehran
constituency might rely on the result of the runoffs as the
election watchdog Guardians Council claimed it had found errors in
vote counting.
</P>
<P>
The Guardians Council waits to see the result of the runoffs to
decide whether to confirm or nullify the result of Tehran
constituency, political analysts here said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Winds of Change Blow in Turkish Presidential Election by Huai Chengbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the three rounds of ballots held in the parliament, Sezer,
the presiding judge of the Constitutional Court, won 281, 314 and
330 votes respectively, beating all his rivals, including the
Parliament Speaker Yildirim Akbulut.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has arrived at a crossroads of development at the turn of
century. Its being accepted as a candidate for membership of the
European Union last November has tremendously inspired the people.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing President Suleyman Demirel declared toward the end of
1999 that "Turkey will face a bright future and assume a place as
one of the major developed countries of the world (in the new
century)." To achieve this end, stability and change are two
things that people always have in mind.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the parliament refused to go along with the demands
of the leaders of the tripartite coalition government to extend the
tenure of Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Although the 76-year-old statesman, if still in office, would
serve as a guarantee of stability, many deputies contended that to
maintain stability was not Demirel's patent.
</P>
<P>
The deputies, aware of the general demand for change in the
country, have instead accepted Sezer, the joint candidate of
leaders of the three ruling parties and two opposition parties, as
the new president.
</P>
<P>
A poll showed that there is a general public approval for Sezer
despite he is from outside the parliament. It appears that Sezer is
widely regarded as a symbol of democratization and reform.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that those who opposed him have gone to great
lengths trying, without success so far, to find something to
crucify him with.
</P>
<P>
"As a dignified jurist, Sezer will go to the presidential
mansion as a man who enjoys the trust of citizens with a wide
variety of political views," commented Milliyet (National), a major
Turkish newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Sezer will take over the presidency from Demirel on May 16.
</P>
<P>
With so many people applauding, it is a good beginning for his
political career. But in the long-run, the judge-turned political
leader may find it harder to run a country than handle a case.
</P>
<P>
There is a long way to go.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Bombing Costs Power Plant Millions of Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Baddawi power plant in Tripoli,
northern Lebanon, was pulverized thoroughly in early Friday's
Israeli air raid, suffering a loss of millions of U.S. dollars,
Voice of Lebanon Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
George Mouawad, chairman of Lebanon's state-run Electricite du
Liban (EDL), was quoted as saying that the generating plant, the
relay stations and all high-voltage lines were completely
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Rebuilding the Baddawi facility would take at least two years,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel's 45-minute air strikes began at 2:45 Friday morning
(0045 GMT), targeting the Basleem power relay station in the
capital city of Beirut, Tripoli's suburban power plant of Baddawi,
a gas filling station in the Bekaa Valley town of Brital, a
Hezbollah arms depot near Baalbek and the Beirut-Damascus highway.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli attacks were a retaliation for Lebanese Hezbollah
guerrillas' Katyusha rocket attacks on northern Israel late
Thursday, in which one Israeli solider was killed and several
civilians injured.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah fighters were avenging Thursday morning's Israeli air
raids on south Lebanon which killed an 80-year-old Lebanese woman
and her daughter.
</P>
<P>
Parts of Tripoli and Beirut were blacked out after Friday's
Israeli attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese police said the Basleem station was hit twice by
Israeli jets in low-flying missile-shooting runs that jolted many
Beirut residents out of bed. An eyewitness was quoted as saying the
Basleem plant was now "a wreck."
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in three months that Israel bombed power
stations in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli jet fighters pounded three Lebanese power stations on
February 8, causing widespread power outage and wounding at least
20 civilians.

<HEADLINE> IPU Backs Palestinian Refugees` Right to Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The 144-member Inter-Parliamentary
Union (IPU) on Friday expressed support for the right of
Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland in an apparent
victory for the Arab bloc at the end of the 103th IPU conference in
Amman.
</P>
<P>
In one of its final resolutions of the conference, the IPU also
voiced its strong support for all efforts leading to a just,
durable and comprehensive peace in the Middle East, and for the
famous "land for peace" principle guiding the peace process between
Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, proposed by the German delegation, called for
the Jewish state to comply with U.N. resolution 194, which said the
Palestinian refugees should be allowed to return home.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are over 3 million Palestinian refugees who are
taking shelter in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and other countries after
they fled their home because of the creation of Israel in 1948 and
successive wars between Israel and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Though outvoted, the Israeli delegates had also proposed their
own version on the Palestinian refugee issue, but only mentioned
a "just solution to the problem of Palestinian refugees" without a
specific reference to the U.N. Resolution 194.
</P>
<P>
The resolution marked an apparent victory for Arab
parliamentarians who had conducted a heated debate with their
Israeli counterparts and Israel`s supporters during the six-day
session.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians from Egyptian, Iraqi and Syrian and other Arab
countries had taken to the podium, accusing Israel of trying to
deprive the Palestinians of their rights to return to their home.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the refugee issue, the IPU conference also adopted
two final resolutions on ways of promoting world peace, stability
and development as well as promoting dialog between different
cultures and civilizations.
</P>
<P>
A record 1,400 representatives from 128 parliaments and over 20
international organizations had participated the conference in
Amman.
</P>
<P>
The 103rd IPU was opened here on Sunday by Jordanian King
Abdullah Bin Hussein and its next session is expected to take place
in Jakarta, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The IPU, founded in 1889 and now with 144 members, is the
largest international parliamentary organization, and its biannual
conferences serves as the biggest venue for parliamentary
diplomacy.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Israeli Attacks on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Friday strongly condemned Israeli attacks on
Lebanese civilian areas, economic centers and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said the Israeli invasion against Lebanon is the
continuation of violation by the Israeli regime of the ceasefire
accord signed in April 1996, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes bombed two power plants in Lebanon and a
guerrilla arms depot in retaliation for rocket attacks by Lebanese
Hezbollah on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
The guerillas rocketed northern Israel Thursday afternoon for
the deaths of an 80-year-old woman and her 40-year-old daughter and
Israel's earlier air strikes against the Lebanese civilian targets
which wounded at least 12 Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis are trying to make up for their failure in
realizing their expansionist policies on the eve of withdrawal of
their troops from south Lebanon, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern over the continuation of Israeli raids
against Lebanese people, Asefi called for the international
community to use every possible means to stop the Israeli assaults.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which Iran has refused to recognize and termed as a
threat in the region, has announced to withdraw from south Lebanon
where it set a self-claimed security zone to safeguard northern
Israel from guerilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God supported by Iran and Syria, has been
spearheading a resistance war to end Israeli occupation in south
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Russia Strengthens Chechnya Security for Victory Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia's federal forces have beefed
up security regime in Chechnya for fear that rebels may conduct a
number of subversive and terrorist acts during the forthcoming
Victory Day celebrations, Interfax reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
May 9th will mark the 55th anniversary of the anti-fascism war
victory in Russia. According to the Russian federal forces'
command, "during the upcoming Victory Day holidays the bandits
intend to organize a number of subversive acts at military and
civil facilities in Chechnya, especially in Grozny and other
heavily populated areas."
</P>
<P>
"To prevent provocative acts by the extremists, the command of
the Interior Ministry grouping in Chechnya has taken additional
security measures," said the command.
</P>
<P>
Driving restrictions have been tightened in the republic and
additional checks at the checkpoints, including those along the
Chechen administrative border, are now being conducted, the
military said.
</P>
<P>
The federal block-posts have been reinforced in regions where
the situation remains complicated. The temporary police stations,
especially those in southern and southeastern districts of
Chechnya, have been strengthened to conduct preventative
operations.
</P>
<P>
The special operations to search and destroy the dispersed
guerrilla bands, their bases and arms and ammunition caches in
mountainous and foothill areas of Chechnya will not be suspended
during the holidays, the military said.
</P>
<P>
"Close interaction has been established between defense and
interior ministry units and other armed structures operating in
Chechnya in order to react swiftly to possible threats from bandit
formations," it said.
</P>
<P>
However, another Interfax report said rebels made a new attack
on a federal convoy in Chechnya Friday and from one to three
Russian servicemen were killed.
</P>
<P>
According to the command of the eastern grouping of the Russian
forces, rebels only opened fire on the last vehicle in the convoy
in the area of Serzhen-Yurt because they were few in number and
could not stage a large-scale attack.
</P>
<P>
The command said federal troops promptly repelled the attackers
through concerted actions.
</P>
<P>
But Kremlin spokesman on Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky denied
the report, admitting that there were clashes Friday in Serzhen-
Yurt, where rebels opened fire on federal intelligence officers in
cars.
</P>
<P>
"One serviceman was killed and another was wounded and his life
is out of danger," while four bodies of rebels were discovered at
the clash site, he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Impose Direct Federal Rule on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Moscow will introduce direct federal
rather than direct presidential rule in the republic of Chechnya
by the end of this month, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Nikolai
Koshman told the press Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under federal rule, territorial departments of federal
ministries will be set up in Chechnya for two to three years, said
Koshman, who is also the cabinet's envoy in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Initially, two or three officials of every ministry will work
on the department boards. They will select the personnel from
local population. The territorial boards will eventually become
local authorities in Chechnya, he said.
</P>
<P>
A Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament) member will be
elected in Chechnya on August 20, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the federal parliamentary elections were not
held in the single-mandate constituency of Chechnya due to the
anti-terrorist campaign there.
</P>
<P>
However, the elections of the Chechen president cannot be held
in the republic sooner than at the end of 2001 or early 2002,
Koshman said.

<HEADLINE> Belarus, Russia Can Form Union Army Grouping: Lukashenko </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Belarus President Alexander
Lukashenko said Friday that his country and Russia may create a
combined army grouping to strengthen the security of the Belarus-
Russia Union State on the Western front.
</P>
<P>
The Belarus armed forces can be reinforced by a group of
Russian troops and the creation of a united grouping is possible
in the event of a military conflict or its threat, Lukashenko told
an interview with the Russian newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star).
</P>
<P>
"In this case, we would deploy the Belarussian army and back it
with units from Russia's western regions as a second echelon," but
"in peacetime, we do not intend to bolster anything," Lukashenko
said.
</P>
<P>
The reason for backing the Belarus army with Russian units,
according to Lukashenko, is NATO's military presence in Europe. "
What they have there is not 300,000 but a million, trained, and
armed servicemen, so we will not defend ourselves on our own," the
president stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Belarus-Russian united army grouping will probably consist
of 500,000 soldiers rather than 300,000, which will be discussed
at a meeting of the Supreme State Committee of the Belarus-Russian
Union due in May, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Estimates 318 Staff Held in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- As many as 318 U.N. staff may
now be taken hostage by rebels in Sierra Leone, a U.N. spokesman
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told a press conference that no
new fighting had been reported but there had been reports of
movement by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels, possibly
involving the use of U.N. armored personnel carriers captured from
peacekeeping forces they detained.
</P>
<P>
"The number of detentions of U.N. personnel by the RUF,
meanwhile, continues to climb," he said. "The latest estimate
could be as high as 318."
</P>
<P>
The latest figure included 92 personnel reportedly detained
Thursday, minus four crew members and two passengers of a
helicopter who were released earlier Friday, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, approximately 208 members of the Zambian
contingent which were on their way to Makeni and with whom the U.N.
mission had lost radio contact yesterday, were disarmed and
detained by the RUF," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And 24 other U.N. personnel are being held in Kailahun,"
Eckhard said. Meanwhile, a Nigerian contingent of more than 100 U.
N. peacekeepers were also detained "but later released, minus
their weapons."

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls on Uganda, Rwanda to Immediately End Fighting in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Friday adopted a presidential statement, calling on Ugandan and
Rwandan forces to immediately end their fighting in Kisangani in
the northern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, expressing its "grave concern" at the
renewed fighting, "condemns unreservedly the outbreak of military
hostilities in Kisangani," the statement said. "This renewed
fighting (is), once more, threatening the implementation of the
Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement."
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council demands that these latest hostilities
cease immediately and that those involved in the fighting at
Kisangani reaffirm their commitment to the Lusaka process and
comply with all relevant Security Council resolutions," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation Security Council adopted the presidential
statement at the end of the four-hour closed-door meeting,
beginning Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
"The Council is also concerned by reports of the killing of
innocent Congolese civilians," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also reaffirmed its commitment to the
national sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political
independence of the DRC, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan troops clashed in the DRC before dawn
Friday in Kisangani, killing five civilians and wounding nine in a
burst of shelling and gunfire, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The latest fighting took place as a U.N. Security Council
mission is visiting the DRC and the capitals of the countries
involved in the many-sided conflict in the central African country.
The visit is intended to secure agreement to the deployment of the
U.N. peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have been long backing rebels in the DRC to
fight the government headed by President Laurent Kabila, supported
by Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, in the nation's long-standing
armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
In a peace agreement signed last August and renewed in mid-
April this year, the warring sides committed to a cease-fire. They
said they would let the United Nations deploy a 5,500-member U.N.
peacekeeping mission in the DRC.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets Japanese Prime Minister for G-8 Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the one-hour and 15-minute meeting, the two leaders also
discussed the recovery of Japan's economy. Clinton said
information technology can be a growth stimulus for Japan.
</P>
<P>
"They spent most of their time talking about the upcoming G-8
summit," a senior administration official told reporters at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
Describing the meeting as "warm, cordial, convivial," the
senior official said, "The prime minister spent a fair amount of
time helping the president understand the special significance of
Okinawa, and the reasons why the Japanese government favored
holding the summit on the island."
</P>
<P>
Clinton will be the first U.S. president to visit Okinawa since
America relinquished the island's postwar administration to Japan
in 1972.
</P>
<P>
U.S. military bases on Okinawa are a source of friction for
residents, who have been angry at the American presence there
since two Marines and a sailor raped a local schoolgirl in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The small island houses about two-thirds of the more than 50,
000 U.S. military personnel stationed in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the meeting started, Clinton said he hopes to
speak with the residents there. "I want to talk to the prime
minister about how we should do that."
</P>
<P>
"But we tried to be sensitive to the concerns of the people and
to be highly respectful. And where mistakes have been made, we've
tried to correct them and we will continue to do that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Mori talked about the agenda for the G-8 summit,
which is to be attended by leaders from Britain, Canada, France,
Italy, the U.S., Japan, Germany and Russia. The agenda includes
health issues, vaccines, education, poverty, and information
technology, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton shared the experience in the United States in economic
development. In Japan only 35 percent of Japanese schoolchildren
have access to the Internet, but in the United States, it's 95
percent, the official added.
</P>
<P>
"So in that context of the importance that information
technology has, as we've seen in our country how important
information technology is -- to spur economic growth, create jobs,
create wealth -- we believe that this is something that can be of
great interest and significance for the Japanese people," the
official added.

<HEADLINE> Five U.N. Hostages Released in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Rebels in Sierra Leone have released
five of the estimated 92 United Nations personnel they have been
holding hostage over the past two days.
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcast Cooperation (BBC) Friday quoted a U.N.
spokesperson as saying in Freetown, capital of the west African
country, that the five - a helicopter crew and a passenger - had
now returned to an airfield in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeepers are being held by rebels of the Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) headed by Foday Sankoh, who accused the U.N.
peacekeepers of trying to force his fighters to disarm.
</P>
<P>
He had earlier warned the U.N. force not to reinforce military
positions near his stronghold.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want violence here again. It's provocation. You
provoke the men, you make a big mistake," Sankoh said in an
interview with the BBC.
</P>
<P>
After RUF rebels killed four Kenyan soldiers and took dozens of
other U. N. peacekeepers hostage in attacks earlier this week,
U.N. Secretary- General Kofi Annan wanted a rapid-reaction force
deployed immediately, rather than waiting for reinforcements due
next month.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Backs Zimbabwe's Land Distribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 5 (Xinhua) (C South African President Thabo Mbeki
Friday supported the redistribution of land among the
dispossessed black people of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the Zimbabwe International trade Fair in
Bulawayo, the country's second largest city, Mbeki said South
Africa was also hopeful that the land question in Zimbabwe, which
has seen the invasion of about 1,000 white owned commercial farms
by war veterans and land-hungry peasants, would be resolved
successfully in a non-confrontational manner.
</P>
<P>
He said both South Africa and Zimbabwe, which experienced
extensive land dispossession of the indigenous majority by
colonizer, were confronted by the challenge to resolve this
colonial legacy.
</P>
<P>
"Our peoples, on both banks of the Limpopo River, both black
and white, have a responsibility to recognize the fact that the
land question constitutes an important part of the national
agenda," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Accordingly, they must commit themselves to work together to
resolve this central question. To advance the common good," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africans were convinced that it would be in the
best interest if the land question in Zimbabwe was dealt with in
a cooperative and non-confrontational manner among all
Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
"Accordingly, we trust that ways and means will be found to end
the conflict that has erupted in some areas of Zimbabwe,
occasioned by the still unresolved land question in the country,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, who also paid tribute for the role Zimbabwe took in the
fight against apartheid, said peace, stability, democracy and
social progress in Zimbabwe were as important for the country as
they were for the rest of the region.
</P>
<P>
"We know from our history that you are ready to assist us to
achieve peace, stability, democracy and social progress in our
own country," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So are we, in the common interest, willing and ready to work
with you for peace, stability, democracy and social progress in
Zimbabwe, in our region and the rest of our continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said land redistribution in both Zimbabwe and South
Africa, also imposes the obligation to ensure that such land was
used productively to help provide a better life for the ordinary
people.
</P>
<P>
He said it was inevitable that any resettlement program must be
 accompanied by investment in agricultural development as well as
the rural social and economic infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"Our economies must therefore generate the necessary resources
to ensure that this happens," said the South African president.

<HEADLINE> 150,000 Angolans Suffer from AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Angola has an estimated150,000 people
 suffering from AIDS, accounting for 1.4 percent of the population
of the southwest African country, a senior government health
official said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"When I say we have an estimated 150,000 cases, I mean that
this is the number we should have registered if our health
services worked satisfactorily countrywide," said the director of
the national anti-AIDS campaign, Dulcelina Serrano.
</P>
<P>
Given the lack of proper health facilities across much of the
war-torn country, only 5,764 cases of AIDS had been officially
registered by February, with Cabinda province, a northwest
enclave, and the areas around the capital Luanda, showing the
highest rates, Serrano said.

<HEADLINE> Rand Rebounds on Profit Taking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The embattled rand clawed back
early losses and managed to end the day six cents off its
intraday worst level on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The local currency was last quoted at 6.9680 to one U.S.
dollar, weaker than its previous close 6.8760, but off its
intraday worst level of 7.0300.
</P>
<P>
The rand hit new record lows against the dollar early in the
trading session and continued to hover at around historic lows
for much of the day.
</P>
<P>
"Pre-weekend short profit-taking and a rebound in the
euro/dollar propelled it off its fresh lifetime low of 7.0300," a
dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The dealer said the euro staged a slight recovery against the
dollar and that had aided the rand's recovery.
</P>
<P>
"In light of recent events surrounding the onslaught on rand
and the euro, local and offshore investors are looking for a
safe-haven currency and the US dollar seems to have been the
main successor," another trader said.
</P>
<P>
A state-of-the-nation speech by South African President Thabo
Mbeki on Thursday, in which he had been seen to be adopting a
"rather soft" stance on Zimbabwe, had also not helped, dealers
added.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki took pains on South African television on Thursday to
allay concerns that his government has been covertly backing
invasions of white farms in Zimbabwe by praising white South
African farmers and by indicating that the South African media
haven't fully reported his previous statements on the Zimbabwean
situation.

Friday urged the people of Zimbabwe and South Africa to work

anti-racist struggle.
</P>
<P>
He said as neighbors who shared the same trenches in the common

</P>
<P>
The president was officially opening the Zimbabwe International

</P>
<P>
He said, "Practically, together we must decide what we have to
do, again sharing a common trench of struggle to address an
agenda which among other things includes overcoming the legacy of
colonialism and apartheid."
</P>
<P>
He said other things which needed to be resolved were the
achievement of a better life for the masses and expedition of the
process of balanced and mutual regional integration. "We also
need to protect the achievements we have scored so far to ensure
that ours is a region of freedom, democracy, peace and stability,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was important through using the instrument of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) to speed up the
process of the economic integration of the region.
</P>
<P>
"More importantly, we have to ensure that the SADC protocol
comes into force during this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said although there was a gross trade imbalance between
Zimbabwe and South Africa, which was in favor of his country, he
still believed that the two countries still shared a common
obligation of helping to drive the growth of the other economies
in the region. "But without peace and stability we cannot achieve
sustained development," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Expects to Receive More Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano
said here on Friday that the sum of 452.9 million U.S. dollars
pledged at a donors conference in Rome to assist flood-ravaged
Mozambique was not the final figure since other donors had
promised to declare their contributions later.
</P>
<P>
Chissano also expressed satisfaction with the response from the
 international community, saying that the amount promised exceeded
450 million dollars Mozambique had initially requested.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference on his return from Italy,
Chissano said that even some of those countries that made pledges
during the Rome conference on Thursday said they are prepared to
grant additional amounts if the need arises.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on the assurance of transparency in the
use of the funds granted by the donors, Chissano said that
Mozambique prepared the reconstruction program in cooperation with
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and various donor
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"It was the UNDP that suggested that the money be channeled to
the Bank of Mozambique (the Mozambican Central Bank), which shows
confidence in the Mozambican government. This is an
acknowledgement that Mozambique knows how to use the funds", said
Chissano.
</P>
<P>
On reconstruction priorities, Chissano explained that all
sectors are equal in priority, and thus work will start
simultaneously in all sectors.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that there may be cases where a certain donor
stipulates that the money must be used on a specific project, and
Mozambique would respect such conditions.

CAIRO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary General
Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid on Friday condemned the latest Israeli
bombing raids on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said in an interview that the Lebanese resistance
against Israel's occupation in south Lebanon is legitimate and
should be supported.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief said Israel should withdraw from south Lebanon as
well as the Golan Heights, which it seized from Syria in 1967,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The pan-Arab bloc will hold an emergency meeting Saturday
afternoon at the level of permanent delegates to discuss the
Israeli attacks, Abdel-Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the escalation of Israeli military attacks on
Lebanon would adversely affect the stability of the area.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes bombed two power stations in Lebanon and a
guerrilla ammunition depot in retaliation for rocket attacks by
Lebanese Hezbollah on northern Israel.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Falls to 30-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate
dropped to a three-decade low of 3.9 percent in April from 4.1
percent the month before, putting more pressure on the Federal
Reserve to raise interest rates to prevent inflation from
accelerating.
</P>
<P>
April's unemployment rate was the lowest since January 1970,
when it also stood at 3.9 percent, the Labor Department reported
Friday. Many analysts were expecting April's unemployment rate to
fall to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
A total of 340,000 people found jobs in April, more than the
315,000 jobs many analysts expected. The unemployment rate for
blacks fell to an all-time monthly low of 7.2 percent from the
previous low of 7.3 percent set in March. The rate for Hispanics
dropped to a record low of 5.4 percent, surpassing the previous
low of 5.6 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
The Fed has raised interest rates five times by a quarter-point
each since June 30 in an effort to slow the red-hot economy and
keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
Given the outlook for strong continuing growth, many analysts
widely expect the central bank will push rates higher at its next
meeting on May 16. The unemployment report increases the odds that
the Fed will move rates up by a more aggressive half-point,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
The hiring of 73,000 temporary census workers was a big factor
in boosting payrolls, government analysts said. Excluding the
census hiring, employment would have grown by a more modest 267,
000, those analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Many economists also believed that the late Easter holiday was
a factor in boosting job growth by pushing some hiring, mostly
retail, into April.
</P>
<P>
In March, a whopping 458,000 jobs were created, more than the
government previously estimated, helped along by a longer-than-
normal survey period that allowed more jobs to be counted and a
big burst in hiring for the census.
</P>
<P>
In April, the service sector, the driving force of job creation
in the United States, led the way in job growth as 380,000 workers
were hired.
</P>
<P>
Even manufacturing, which lost around 248,000 jobs last year,
created jobs in April, adding 11,000 workers. But construction
companies lost 55,000 jobs in April.
</P>
<P>
Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, in
April rose twice as fast as many analysts were predicting. Average
hourly earning went up by 0.4 percent to 13.64 U.S. dollars. Many
analysts were forecasting a 0.2 percent rise. In March, wages grew
by 0.3 percent, slightly less than the government reported one
month ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at a photo opportunity, Clinton expressed
his hope that Japan would continue to rebuild rapidly, relying on
the "inherent strengths" of a highly skilled, educated work force.
</P>
<P>
"We support a strong Japanese economy. I think there are a lot
of inherent strengths in the economy, most of all in the people
and the level of skill and education and capacity to grow," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's getting better... I believe that they will return
to big growth, I hope sooner rather than later," Clinton told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Mori are also discussing the summit of the Group of
Eight in Okinawa, Japan, scheduled in July. Clinton will be the
first U.S. president to visit Okinawa since America relinquished
the island's postwar administration to Japan in 1972.
</P>
<P>
U.S. military bases on Okinawa are a source of friction for
residents, who have been angry at the American presence there
since two Marines and a sailor raped a local schoolgirl in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The small island houses about two-thirds of the more than 50,
000 U.S. military personnel stationed in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he hopes to speak with the residents there. "I
want to talk to the prime minister about how we should do that."
</P>
<P>
"But we tried to be sensitive to the concerns of the people and
to be highly respectful. And where mistakes have been made, we've
tried to correct them and we will continue to do that," he said.

<HEADLINE> Love Bug Hit 46,000 Government Computers in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- At least 46,000 government computers
of Canada have been hit since early Thursday morning by an e-mail
worm virus called "ILOVEYOU," local reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The worldwide strike by the love bug affected key Canadian
departments ranging from Canada Customs to Statistics Canada,
leaving countless e-mails sitting unanswered.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the government has been hit hard by an
Internet virus, according to Canadian Industry Minister John
Manley, whose department reported 6,000 computers being affected
Thursday, with normal daily traffic of more than 100,000 e-mail
messages coming to a dead halt.
</P>
<P>
Although many organizations were reported to have a handle on
the problem by the end of Thursday, the love bug is expected to
continue its rampage Friday.
</P>
<P>
The federal government has asked computer experts to contact
local governments across Canada to eradicate the virus, which
already affected one of the largest companies, J.D. Irving Ltd.,
Thursday in the eastern province of New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
While describing the situation as "a Pearl Harbor attack,"
Canadian government officials believe there have been no critical
functions ever hampered.
</P>
<P>
There has been a tiny fraction actually infected and there have
been no major problems reported beyond the lost computer access,
officials say.
</P>
<P>
The virus has affected 270,000 computers worldwide and has
caused the damage of up to 1 billion U.S. dollars in North America.
</P>
<P>
It deletes image and music files, including the popular MP3s.
It also installs a file in the user's local drive that appears to
scan the drive looking for network passwords before sending these
passwords elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> European Central Bank Chief Reassures Public on Euro Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Wim Duisenberg, head of the
European Central Bank (ECB), issued an unusual statement on Friday
reassuring the public about the single currency.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg said in the statement, directed more to the general
public than to the financial market, that consumers should not
worry about the euro's recent decline.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the European Central Bank would "continue to
do all it can" to control inflation.
</P>
<P>
"I understand their concerns, since a persistently lower euro
exchange rate might ultimately lead to higher prices in the shops,
" said the European central banker in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
"It may also undermine the perception of the euro as a stable
currency."
</P>
<P>
The Dutchman said that the ECB has over the past six months
taken measures to counter risks to price stability and the bank
has increased its benchmark lending interest rates four times
already.
</P>
<P>
"It (the bank) will continue to do all it can to maintain price
stability in the euro area," said Duisenberg.
</P>
<P>
The statement came one day after the euro exchange rate against
the U.S. dollar plunged to an all-time low of 0.8845 dollar. The
single currency for 11 European Union member states has seen a
steady decline since peaking at 1.18 dollars just after the euro's
debut on January 1 last year.
</P>
<P>
The euro exchange rate against the dollar has since dropped by
23 percent.

<HEADLINE> Sezer Elected New Turkish President in Third Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Ahmet Necdet Sezer, presiding judge of
the Constitutional Court, was elected the 10th president of Turkey
with 330 votes in the third round of balloting Friday.
</P>
<P>
He garnered three-fifths of the votes in the 550-seat
parliament, far more than the 276 votes required in the third round
to become the president.
</P>
<P>
As the joint candidate of the three ruling parties and two main
opposition parties represented in parliament, Sezer had been
considered the favorite for presidency and stood good chance to
win.
</P>
<P>
Ten candidates were competing in the race in the first round of
voting on April 27. Three of them dropped out before the second
ballot.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of Grand National Assembly (parliament) Yidirim Akbulut,
who was once seen as the strongest challenger for Sezer, decided to
give up before the third round, clearing the way for Sezer.
</P>
<P>
Sezer has been leading with an outstanding advantage over all
other competitors throughout the three rounds of balloting in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
During the first two rounds, Sezer took the lead with 281 and
314 votes respectively, short of the two-thirds majority of 367
required to be elected in these two rounds but far exceeding his
nearest rivals.
</P>
<P>
Sezer was seen as a staunch advocator of democratic reforms,
which are essential to Turkey's aspiration of joining the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
The president-elect was born in western Afyon province on
September 13, 1941. He graduated from Afyon High School in 1958 and
Ankara University's School of Law in 1962.
</P>
<P>
The career lawyer was assigned as a member of the Constitutional
Court in 1988 and voted head of the court 10 years later.
</P>
<P>
Soon after taking the position, he banned the Islam-based
Welfare Party for attempting to overthrow the secular order. But he
has called for the 1982 Constitution drawn up under army rule to be
overhauled.
</P>
<P>
Recently, he said that "Turkey must make the necessary changes
to its law and Constitution so as to conform to the universal
standards in the field of human rights."
</P>
<P>
Sezer will take over the presidency in an inauguration ceremony
to be held on May 16 when the outgoing President Suleyman Demirel's
tenure expires.

of Turkish President-elect Ahmet Necdet Sezer.
</P>
<P>

September 13, 1941.
</P>
<P>
He graduated from Afyon High School in 1958 and received higher
education at Ankara University's School of Law and graduated in
1962.
</P>
<P>
Sezer completed his compulsory military service at the Military
Academy as a reserve officer, following which he was assigned
judiciary duties, first in Dicle and later in Yerkoy. He was later
assigned to the Court of Cassation as a member of an investigative
panel.
</P>
<P>
After furthering his education at the Ankara Law School in 1977
and 1978, Sezer received his master's degree as a member of the
judges' panel at the Court of Cassation.
</P>
<P>
While serving as a member of the Second Legal Chamber at the
Court of Cassation, Sezer was selected by Turkish president from
three candidates and on September 27, 1988, was assigned as a
member of the Constitutional Court.
</P>
<P>
On January 6, 1998, Sezer was voted head of the Constitutional
Court.
</P>
<P>
Sezer was a father of three children.

<HEADLINE> Lee Hsien Loong Praises Role of Clan Associations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong affirmed Friday that "clan associations have
played an important role in Singapore's development from a migrant
colony to an industrial nation" and "continue to play an important
role" in the country's modern society.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister made the remarks at the 15th
anniversary dinner of the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan
Associations (SFCCA).
</P>
<P>
He said that in the uncertain and difficult conditions of the
early days of Singapore's history, clan associations provided
important life rafts for the many Chinese migrants who came to
Singapore in pursuit of a better life and played an important role
in strengthening bonds between fellow migrants from the same
village or clan, offering support, companionship and practical
help.
</P>
<P>
Lee said clan associations still have a role to play in modern
Singapore against a drastic change in backdrop although
Singaporeans are now enjoying the benefits of fast growing economy,
better living standard, ownership of substantial assets and many
organizations have sprouted up to carry out functions similar to
those of clan associations.
</P>
<P>
Referring to great challenges facing SFCCA in the knowledge era
such as global competition, skills retraining and upgrading,
integration of new arrivals and the moderation of widening income
disparities, Lee emphasized that clan associations continue to
play an important role in Singapore society because people need
mutual support and fellowship and seek stable references to
emotionally anchor themselves during such time of great change and
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
He urged clan associations to help their members adapt to the
changing environment, preserve the core Chinese values and
heritages, engage the younger generations of Singaporeans, induct
fresh blood into their leadership ranks and upgrade their
organizational capabilities.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 300 clan associations in Singapore, 189
of which have affiliated themselves with the SFCCA which was set
up in early 1986 as the leading body of clan associations.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will oppose the
payment of an apparent 18 million rand (about 2.4 million U.S.
dollars) ransom demand for the release of two South Africans being
held hostage in the Philippines, a senior government official said
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Principally we are opposed to ransom payments. You will only
encourage others to do the same," said Deputy Director-General of
South African Foreign Affairs Department Jerry Matsila in
Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
According to Matsila, indirect information indicated that the
abductors wanted 2.4 million U.S. dollars from the Philippine
government for the release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The latest demands of the hostage takers pertained more to
local politics, he said.
</P>
<P>
Muslim extremists captured two South Africans, Carel Strydom
and his wife, in an armed raid on a Malaysian resort island on
Easter Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Also taken hostages were nine Malaysians, three Germans, two
French, two Finns, two Filipinos and a Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
The hostages have been taken to the southern Philippine island
of Jolo where they are being held in a reed hut in a rebel camp.

<HEADLINE> EU Launches Out-of-Court Settlement for Consumer Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union on Friday
launched a pan-European network for out-of-court settlement of
consumer disputes.
</P>
<P>
Establishment of the extra-judicial network was hailed as an
important initiative toward creating an effective and practical
environment to boost consumer confidence in cross-border
transactions and trade, especially in the ever growing sector of e-
commerce.
</P>
<P>
"The European extra-judicial network marks an important
milestone to give consumers access to simple, low cost and
effective means of resolving cross-border conflicts," said David
Byrne, EU commissioner for consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
The network will cover any consumer dispute over goods and
services. Problems over deliveries, defective products, or
products or services that do not fit consumers' description will
be dealt with by a single, one-stop national contact point in each
EU member state.
</P>
<P>
The contact point or "clearing house" as it will be called will
help the dissatisfied consumer with information and support in
making a claim to the out-of-court dispute resolution system in
the country where supplier of the products or services is located.
</P>
<P>
This network of clearing houses will be operational by the
second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Resorts to traditional litigation are neither practical nor
cost effective for consumers and businesses alike. The newly
introduced dispute settlement network can reduce costs,
formalities, time and such obstacles as language problems in cross-
border disputes by offering consumers easy access.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner called on the EU member states to commit funds
for building the clearing houses "as quickly as possible."

<HEADLINE> DPRK Condemns U.S. List of Terrorism Sponsors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) Friday condemned the United States for listing it
as a state sponsor of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"The United States should put an immediate stop to the
fruitless effort to do harm to the DPRK, " said a Foreign Ministry
spokesman when asked by a reporter from the Korean Central News
Agency, the country's official agency.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department issued an annual report Monday on
patterns of global terrorism, which listed the DPRK as one of the
so called "state sponsors of terrorism." Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya
and Syria are also on the list.
</P>
<P>
"The DPRK government always values justice and peace. It has
always been opposed to all manners of terrorism," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned that the DPRK reappeared on the U.S. list
while the two nations are set to resumes talks on improving ties.
</P>
<P>
"It is a clear indication that the U.S. policy to isolate and
stifle the DPRK under the pretext of 'terrorism' still remains
unchanged," he added.
</P>
<P>
Each year, Washington issues a report on global terrorism,
which includes a list of what it considers as state sponsors of
terrorism. And those listed will be blocked from receiving loans
from international organizations.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A couple of China's favorite scenic
spots have received a record number of tourists during the seven-
day Labor Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
The World Horticulture Expo garden in southwestern Yunnan
Province has hosted a daily average of 21,000 visitors in the past
four days, with the largest tally at 23,000 on May 1, the first
day of the holiday.
</P>
<P>
That number also stands as the all-time high since October 31,
1999 when the expo concluded.
</P>
<P>
The Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang City, northwest China's Gansu
Province, sold 15,000 tickets on May 2 and 3, setting a record for
daily visitors to the world's largest cave fresco collection.
</P>
<P>
Di Huizhong, a researcher at the caves, said that the historic
site's administrators had predicted only 2,000 to 3,000 travelers
daily at best, and were shocked at the size of the crowds.
</P>
<P>
The ticket price was cut from 50 yuan (about 6 U.S. dollars) to
20 yuan, and service men, students, the handicapped, and people
over 70 get into the caves for free from May 1 to May 4.
</P>
<P>
All of Dunhuang's hotels and hostels are completely booked, and
overflow crowds have been moved to hotels in nearby counties.
</P>
<P>
Di said that the total number of holiday travelers will be
around 30,000 to 40,000, with most coming from Guangdong, Beijing,
Shanghai, Qinghai, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

<HEADLINE> Week-long Spring Holiday Awakens Royal Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A railway used by imperial
families traveling to see their ancestors' graves was re-opened
for tourists during China's first week-long spring holiday, which
started May 1.
</P>
<P>
The railway, linking Beijing with Yixian County of Hebei
Province neighboring Beijing, was built in 1902, during the Qing
Dynasty (1644-1911). More than 10,000 laborers constructed the
line using 620,000 taels of silver in six months.
</P>
<P>
It was designed by Zhan Tianyou, a renowned Chinese expert on
railways who studied in the U.S. as a youth.
</P>
<P>
The royal family members rode the train to the western Qing
Mausoleum, one of the most well-kept imperial mausoleums in China,
occupying an area of more than 200 square kilometers. Four
emperors, nine queens, and 80 concubines, princes, princesses, and
brothers of emperors were buried in the tomb.
</P>
<P>
The railway suffered near-destruction during the Japanese
invasion in World War II.
</P>
<P>
The high tourist count at the Qing Mausoleum inspired Beijing
and Yixian County to reopen the rail line to the public.
</P>
<P>
A special train with eight antique cars set off on the railway
last Saturday. The special tourism railway has been connected to
the state railway network.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Heilongjiang Province in northeast
China plans to turn six million mu (400,000 ha) of farmland into
forests and grassland in the next 11 years.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said in the first phase of the program this
year, the province will seed 2.69 million mu (179,300 ha) of
farmland with trees and grass.
</P>
<P>
When the work is finished in 2010, the area of forests in
Heilongjiang will increase to 19.1 million ha, they added.
</P>
<P>
The plan is part of the drive to improve the ecological
environment in the province, they said.
</P>
<P>
Excessive reclamation and logging in past years has caused soil
erosion in Heilonjiang, known as a major grain-production base in
the country.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Heilongjiang has made tremendous progress in
tree-planting and returning farm land to forests; last year, 1.3
million mu (86,600 ha) of farmland were turned to forests and
grassland.

The president also expressed his deepest sympathy to the
families of four hostages in Basilan executed and tortured by the
Abu Sayyaf extremists as well as to the kin of the victims,
including soldiers ad civilians, killed in isolated clashes
between the military and rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
He called on the kidnappers to immediately release their
captives, a gesture, which, he said, is not only humane but
practical.
</P>
<P>
"I condole with the families of the victims of this latest
conflict. I sympathize with those who have been injured and to
many more who have been displaced," he told reporters at the
Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
"As for the remaining hostages in Basilan and Sulu, I pledge
that the government will do everything necessary to resolve the
problem and save them at the soonest," he added.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen hostages, mostly children, have already been rescued
by the military during operations in Basilan. The Abu Sayyaf
tortured and killed four of the adult hostages, including a priest,
before fleeing with their remaining captives.
</P>
<P>
Another set of hostages, mostly foreigners, are now holed up
with their kidnappers in Jolo island in Sulu. The hostages include
a Filipino, 10 Malaysians, three Germans, two French nationals,
two South Africans, two Finns, and one Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
The military has already cordoned off the area to prevent the
kidnappers from escaping. Negotiations led by Governor Nur Misuari
of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao are now being
conducted to secure the hostages' safe release.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Troops Foil Rebel Attempts in Jaffna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops Friday
managed to foil several attempts by rebels of Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to infiltrate the defense lines in the
northern Jaffna peninsula, an official report declared.
</P>
<P>
"LTTE terrorists made several abortive attempts to push back
troops from their forward-defended localities in general area
south of Kilali. Troops supported by artillery and mortar fire
effectively repulsed all terrorist attempts compelling them to
withdraw southward," the government's Special Media Information
Center said in its situation report.
</P>
<P>
It said that two soldiers were killed and another wounded in
the exchange of mortar fire, while 458 LTTE rebels were been
killed between April 27 and May 4.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting for an independent homeland for
minority Tamils in the country's north and east since 1983, have
scored a series of stunning victories since late April and
threatened to recapture Jaffna town, the cultural center of Sri
Lanka's minority Tamils and former stronghold of LTTE rebels which
they lost to government troops in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report said government troops were in a stronger position
after their April 22 pull out from Elephant Pass, a strategic
causeway linking Jaffna peninsula and the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
The government set up the Special Media Information Center
after it imposed censorship Thursday on the Colombo-based foreign
media with regard to reporting of the civil war between government
troops and LTTE rebels.
</P>
<P>
Invoking the Public Security Act, the entire Sri Lankan nation
was mobilized on Wednesday on a war footing to deal with LTTE
attempts to retake Jaffna town.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have neither responded to the government's
declaration of being on a war footing nor to the claim of
casualties for the last few days.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHIANG MAI, Thailand, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Closer cooperation with

</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting with NGO members, Chino said over half

<P>
Moreover, he said he had ordered that a comprehensive review of
ADB's overall programs of cooperation with NGOs be undertaken and
finished within this year.
</P>
<P>
The review will aim at strengthening existing relations with
NGOs and developing new ones. "I would like to see the level of
cooperation between ADB and NGOs further increase in the future,"
said Chino.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated that the ADB's poverty reduction strategy "
calls for closer cooperation with NGOs through effective
consultation and cooperation in new reduction initiatives."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the ADB is very interested in learning NGO's
views and concerns and wants to continue dialogue and consultation
with NGOs and civil society.
</P>
<P>
ADB is going to hold an open forum on cooperation between ADB
and NGOs here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 33rd Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the ADB is
going to be held in this mountainous city, some 1,000 kilometers
north of Bangkok, from Saturday to Monday.

LUANDA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China will build the first motorcycle

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urged to Send Peacekeeping Forces to Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council has been
urged to send peacekeeping forces to the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC) immediately.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Institute of United Nations seminar on the
theme "Status of Economic Development and the United Nations
System" in Lusaka on Friday, Ambassador of Egypt to Zambia Abdel
Ghaffar Eldib accused the Security Council of failing to implement
the cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
That's why it has taken long to send the 5,500-personnel troops
to that country, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the United Nations to honor the cease-fire agreement
signed last July in Lusaka by all parties involved in the crisis
so that peace can be restored in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
"How can African countries benefit from the United Nations if
it fails to help them in solving their problems like war within
that country?" he said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador also urged the United Nations to fully support
the economic development for African countries so that the living
standards in the continent can be improved in all aspects.
</P>
<P>
Africa should get united so that they can create one strong
body and speak in one voice at the United Nations meetings, Eldib
said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC),
the ambassador said the two regional organizations should work
together towards the improvement of the economic development in
Africa so that their members can benefit from them.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- An electronic virus disguised as a love letter raged around
the globe on Thursday, worming its way into potentially millions
of personal computers and cutting the e-mail life-lines that serve
individuals, businesses and governments.
</P>
<P>
-- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan appealed to Washington and
key European capitals to transport three battalions of
peacekeepers from Jordan, India and Bangladesh into Sierra Leone
to reinforce the U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. House of Representatives voted 309 to 110 to grant
more than 70 African and Caribbean countries broad new trading
privileges by expanding duty-free access to American markets.
</P>
<P>
-- The number of U.N. peacekeepers held hostage by rebels rose
to more than 90 in the West African country of Sierra Leone, where
a tense calm followed four days of escalating clashes between the
peacekeepers and insurgent fighters.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. productivity growth slowed during the first few months
of 2000, but a longer-term measure suggests it may be too early to
conclude that productivity has started to weaken.
</P>
<P>
-- Financier George Soros called on the European Central Bank
to intervene in support of the euro. The 12-nation European
currency this week fell to below 90 U.S. cents for the first time.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial Questions Scottish Police Officer over Bomb Devices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, The Netherlands, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Testimony at the
Lockerbie trial on Friday related for the first time to the
explosive device that caused the mid-air bombing of the Pan Am
Flight 103 killing 259 people aboard and 11 others on the ground.
</P>
<P>
A Scottish police officer was questioned by the prosecutor and
then cross-questioned by the defense lawyers about the bomb and
its detonator.
</P>
<P>
Gordon Ferrie, a detective chief inspector at the time of the
bombing, gave testimony about the scene that his men witnessed as
the day broke on December 22, 1988, some 12 hours after the Boeing
747 plunged to the ground in pieces in a blaze of fire.
</P>
<P>
He also told the court that the police initially focused the
inquiry on Palestinian organizations.
</P>
<P>
The New York-bound airliner exploded in mid-air and crashed to
the ground from 10,000 meters, wiping out a street of the town.
</P>
<P>
Two Libyans, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Kahlifa
Fahima, denied placing a bomb in Malta in a suitcase that later
was transferred onto the Pan Am Flight 103 in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
The defense counsel, who launched a special defense on the
first day of the trial by blaming two Palestinian groups and
individuals, questioned the police officer about the kind of the
bomb detonator that might have been used.
</P>
<P>
The police officer was also questioned about Palestinian
attacks on Israeli airliners in the early 1970s by using
barometric trigger that caused mid-air bombing after reaching
certain altitudes.
</P>
<P>
A three-year investigation immediately after the tragedy led to
the issuance in 1991 of an arrest warrant for al-Megrahi and
Fahima.
</P>
<P>
In August 1998, the United States and Britain accepted a Libyan
offer of a trial in the Netherlands under the Scots Law and the
two accused Libyans surrendered themselves to the Dutch police in
April 1999.
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to last at least one year and is
estimated to cost some 3 million U.S. dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
Court officials said that the court would hold sessions almost
daily through July 28 before adjourning until August 22.

<HEADLINE> Largest Auction Website for Chinese Art to Open (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's premiere auction house
announced today that it will open a comprehensive website for
online auctions of Chinese art and cultural relics next month.
</P>
<P>
Together with Cable &AMP; Wireless HK Telecom (CWHKT) and Soft Bank
China Venture Capital (SBCVC), China Guardian Auctions Co., Ltd.
has invested heavily into the on-line auction house, which debuts
June 18 at www.guaweb.com.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yannan, Guardian's president, would not reveal the exact
cost of the site, but said, "Guaweb must carry on Guardian's high
standards and will try to be an influential website worldwide."
</P>
<P>
Guardian has gained an international reputation in its field
among domestic and overseas collectors.
</P>
<P>
SBCVC, a venture capital company which started up four months
ago, and CWHKT, a world-leading IT company, are working with
Guardian to expand its web business.
</P>
<P>
Guaweb will establish its own board of directors, and will not
act as a subsidiary of Guardian.
</P>
<P>
However, the online auctioneers will use Guardian's business
links for gathering, appraising and selling auction lots, said
sources from Guaweb.
</P>
<P>
According to Guardian's development plan, Guaweb will mainly
trade in items of traditional Chinese art and precious cultural
relics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it will also experiment with auctions for public
property and second-hand consumer goods from businesses or
individuals.

<HEADLINE> Charity Leaders Call for Building Sustainable Communities (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Business, government and non-
governmental sectors must join hands to explore diversified
resources to build sustainable communities, delegates to an
international charity conference here have said.
</P>
<P>
The "United Way International (UWI) World Assembly 2000" is
being held from May 4 to 6 for leaders from corporations,
foundations, international non-government organizations to explore
new and innovative ways to meet the welfare needs of the
communities.
</P>
<P>
The assembly "provides an opportunity to share experiences and
information and to explore ideas in enhancing fund-raising
initiatives," said Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region Tung Chee Hwa while addressing the opening
ceremony on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
To explore new and innovative fund-raising initiatives, panel
discussions were held for representatives from UWI affiliates to
introduce in details their charitable practices and volunteer
programs.
</P>
<P>
These discussions are enlightening, said president of China
Charity Federation Yan Mingfu, who believes China's fund-raisers
can learn from their western counterparts in many respects.
</P>
<P>
"Charities in western countries have a long history of hundreds
of years, and as a result, in legal protection, institutional
maturity and their volunteer program, they have done a better job
than us." said Yan, also head of the Chinese delegation to the
conference.
</P>
<P>
Noting that some western countries' taxing system encourages
donations, Yan cited the specific provisions on levying of
donations in some countries, where people can be 100 percent tax-
free when donating a heritage to a charitable organization.

Chinese charitable organizations have things to do in raising
the society's awareness of charity and partnering with government
and non-government sectors to create sustainable communities, Yan
said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong people were praised by Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
for their generosity in supporting relief efforts in all parts of
the world, and by UWI Chairman Arthur P. Bellis for their "long
tradition of caring for those in need."
</P>
<P>
Darwin Chen, chief executive of the Community Chest of Hong
Kong which finances 140 Hong Kong charitable agencies, believed
all sectors of a society should join force in building harmonious
and sustainable communities, stressing that welfare of communities
requires support from the public as well as the government.
</P>
<P>
Charity concerns two aspects, Chen said. One is to provide
necessary service, including supporting the old, orphans and the
disabled, the other is to improve service quality and find
resources to support such kind of service, he elaborated.
</P>
<P>
Chen praised the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
government for its increasing support to charitable causes and
also called for people's support in helping build a caring society.
</P>
<P>
The UWI was established in 1974. Headquartered in Virginia, U.S.
, the organization now has affiliates in 35 countries and regions,
including the Community Chest in Hong Kong and China Charity
Foundation on the mainland.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- The Moroccan Supreme Council for Planning and Economic
Recovery on Thursday approved the 2000-2004 Five Year Plan, which
targets at a 5.5 percent economic growth rate.
</P>
<P>
The 140-billion-dirham (13.8 billion U.S. dollars) plan, the 8th
in Morocco since 1956, expects a kick-start growth rate of 3
percent this year due to the current dry season in the country.
</P>
<P>
DOHA -- Qatar is taking steps toward a return to the
international bonds market in few weeks to raise about 1.5 billion
U.S. dollars from 30-year maturity treasury bonds, thus becoming
the second Gulf country into the field.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The current economic stagnation in Egypt would come to
an end with the start of the coming fiscal year in July, said
Egyptian Finance Minister Mohamed Medhat Hassaneen on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Besides injecting funds, the Egyptian government has adopted
some measures to cope with the stagnation, including credit policy
revision, interest rates reduction, psychologically qualifying
market dealers and promotion of available liquidity, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- The Yemeni-EU Joint Commission concluded its 9th
session in Sanaa on Wednesday stressing the need to "establish EU-
funded businesses in Yemen and encourage Yemen's farm exports to
the 15-nation bloc."
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued at the conclusion of the meetings,
the two sides agreed on speeding up the endorsement of the Pact on
Supporting Free Trade Zones Authority with 1.8 million euros (1.6
million U.S. dollars) and funding the structural reforms at the
ministries of health, social affairs and insurance, and civil
aviation in Yemen.

<HEADLINE> Israeli North Hit By Guerrilla Rockets For Second Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Katyusha rockets fired by Lebanese
Hezbollah guerrillas Friday struck Galilee Panhandle and other
Israeli northern areas for a second straight day, wounding several
persons, damaging properties and triggering fire.
</P>
<P>
Four waves of rockets landed in the areas, where local residents
just emerged from a night in their bomb shelters and went to market
for the weekend, according to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
They had been ordered by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to lock
themselves into shelters overnight after the Hezbollah's Katyusha
attacks against the same areas Thursday afternoon, the fiercest
offensive in more than a year, killed an IDF soldier and wounded 28
civilians.
</P>
<P>
However, the shopping crowd was scattered back to their
underground havens immediately after hearing the rocket blasts on
Friday morning. They were advised to continue staying there until
further notice.
</P>
<P>
To prevent possible food shortage, the army distributed food in
the north for the Jewish Shabbat.
</P>
<P>
Senior military analysts pointed out that the accurate launching
of these Katyusha rockets was undoubtedly intended to kill as many
persons as possible and not just as a scare tactic.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah, who have been fighting against Israeli occupation
in the so-called security zone in south Lebanon for decades,
claimed responsibility for Friday's attacks, saying that the
rockets are the answer for Israel's overnight air raids against
Lebanon infrastructure targets.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Air Force (IAF) attacks, which Israel claimed were in
turn the reprisal for Thursday's Katyusha rockets fired by
Hezbollah, blasted power transformers in Lebanon early Friday,
cutting off power supply for large areas.
</P>
<P>
It also targeted guerrilla strongholds and severed the Beirut-
Damascus highway.
</P>
<P>
Although the international community is calling on both sides to
refrain from attacking civilians, the cries for further retaliation
against Hezbollah are currently loud from Israeli political
echelons.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who toured the northern areas
Thursday night, stressed that no country in the world will tolerate
bombardment of its population center by Katyusha rockets, and
Israel will not let these "terrorist attacks" pass without
punishment.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh warned that if Hezbollah
continued cross-border rocket firing, the IDF's response will be
upgraded to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Ariel Sharon, leader of the opposition Likud party, said at a
party meeting on Friday that the IDF must act decisively to send
Lebanon and Syria, the major power broker in Lebanon, a serious
message that "they must fight terrorism directed at Israel."
</P>
<P>
Even President Ezer Weizman, a traditional dovish figure, said
Friday morning that Israel will "darken Lebanon's world" if the
Hezbollah attacks continue.
</P>
<P>
The president, a former IAF Commander, also praised the IDF's
accuracy in reprisal raids against Lebanese infrastructure sites
overnight, while he was visiting Kiryat Shemona, the border town
having been the major target of Hezbollah attacks.
</P>
<P>
It is still not clear if the escalating situation will affect
the scheduled July pullback by Israeli army from the buffer zone,
which was set up by Israel in 1985 with a self-claimed aim to
protect its north from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
On March 5, Israeli cabinet approved a withdrawal from the zone
by July, but with a warning that Israel will not hesitate to
revenge if any militant groups test its strains on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt. Assessing MILF Move on Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Friday that his government is now studying the move by the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) to declare a 48-hour
unilateral ceasefire in Mindanao effective Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing at the Presidential Palace, the president
expressed the hope that this would pave the way for the resumption
of formal peace negotiations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"We are aware of the declaration by the MILF of a 48-hour
unilateral ceasefire in Mindanao effective 6 a.m. tomorrow," said
the president.
</P>
<P>
"The government is assessing this MILF move, which we hope
will clear the way for the return of the government and the MILF
peace panels to the negotiating table," he added.
</P>
<P>
Estrada stressed that his government remains committed to
extend the hand of peace to those who seek it, but is also
determined to defeat those who choose war.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that despite the clamor for peace by an
overwhelming majority of the people, MILF elements and Abu Sayyaf
extremists have launched attacks against government troops and
engaged in criminal acts that have claimed the lives of military
combatants and innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
"These MILF and Abu Sayyaf elements have openly challenged the
Republic. We have responded, and will continue to respond, to
their criminal acts in the swiftest, most appropriate manner," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the integrity of the Philippines is non-
negotiable and the government will fight against all form of
terrorism, torture, murder and kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he admitted that the roots of the Mindanao conflict
are deep and complex, which "can be resolved only by a
comprehensive, political economic, social, cultural and even
ecological approach."
</P>
<P>
Philippine government troops have engaged in battles with two
rebel groups, the MILF and the Abu Sayyaf, in the last few days in
Mindanao. About 20 government soldiers and more than 100 rebels
were killed in the battles.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Africa to Continue Quiet Diplomacy Towards Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Yu Dabo
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki headed for Zimbabwe on Friday amid mounting domestic demand
for tougher reaction and growing international concern over the
situation in that country.
</P>
<P>
He will meet his Zimbabwean counterpart Robert Mugabe to sort
things out in a "quiet diplomacy" which will go far beyond the
expectations of various political parties at home. His visit,
therefore, would be unlikely to produce what the opposition
parties had expected.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech to the nation on Thursday, Mbeki defended
his government's quiet diplomacy over the crisis in Zimbabwe,
saying South Africa would "work consistently and without making
the noise of empty drums to help the sister people of Zimbabwe to
find a just and lasting solution to the real and pressing land
question in that country."
</P>
<P>
His address followed increasingly strident calls from
opposition parties and international elements for Pretoria to take
a tougher line with Zimbabwean President Mugabe over land
invasions and the collapse of the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki has endured criticism for refusing to openly condemn
Mugabe's support of farm invasions and for failing to come up with
South African initiatives to solve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's farm invasions have set off fears among South
African commercial farmers that the same invasions could happen to
them. In a move to quell such fears, Mbeki pledged that South
Africa would not slide into a similar land crisis.
</P>
<P>
But his address failed to ease criticism at home. Opposition
parties lambasted his address as an ineffectual apologia which did
nothing to address the crisis of human and political rights in
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean crisis has helped push the rand, currency of
South Africa, to a new low against the U.S. dollar on Thursday,
bringing more pressure on Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said one major reason for the South African
government to insist on a "soft approach" towards the Zimbabwean
land crisis was that Pretoria has similar land problems and too
much reaction would put the government in an awkward situation.
</P>
<P>
There have been urgent calls for land reforms in South Africa
where the minority whites own most of the farm lands and the
majority of blacks are landless. "If the government reacted too
strongly to Zimbabwe's land crisis, it might make the black
majority in South Africa unhappy," said a diplomatic source asking
for anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The South African government, which wanted a smooth and
peaceful land reform, apparently objected the radical move by the
Zimbabwean war veterans to seize land. But in this subtle
situation, it had to seek a balanced approach and the quiet
diplomacy was the best choice, the diplomatic source said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki has made it clear that the land dispossession of the
indigenous black majority in Zimbabwe was a colonial legacy which,
first of all, needs to be addressed by both Zimbabwe and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Out of this consideration, South Africa has time and again
called on Britain to help solve the crisis. South Africa could
offer help but did not want to spearhead the campaign, according
to a government source.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean situation was different from that of Mozambique
earlier this year when South Africa sent troops to the country to
help fighting the flood, the same source said.
</P>
<P>
However, the quiet diplomacy pursued by the South African
government was not a passive or apathetic one, the source
stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, South Africa was ready to work
together with the British and Zimbabwean governments to achieve a
common commitment to end violence and create conditions for the
withdrawal of demonstrating war veterans from the farms they had
occupied.
</P>
<P>
"Quiet diplomacy does not mean silence," the source noted.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to wipe out scepticism, Mbeki said he had not been
silent on the issue, contrary to press reports which failed to
cover all that he had said.
</P>
<P>
The president warned that there were racist attempts to create
an atmosphere of fear in South Africa.

<HEADLINE> EC Warns of Love Bug Virus Mutants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on Friday
warned that "love bug" computer virus mutants might appear in the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, said that less than 1 percent of the institution's
computers were affected by the virus that was first detected
toward midday on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It was a serious attack," said one commission spokesman, who
added that the commission immediately gave warnings to internal
computer users.
</P>
<P>
The software suppliers of the commission soon provided the
European institution with anti-virus programs.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman warned that variant virus was expected to
enter the commission in the coming days though no virus mutant had
been spotted so far.
</P>
<P>
When asked, the spokesman said that the commission was not in a
position to confirm that the "love bug" computer virus had
originated from the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Computer security experts here said that the "love bug" virus
has infected millions of computers in the world and is likely to
spawn more versions and linger for a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
The fast-spreading computer virus was believed to have
originated from two Philippine E-mail addresses. The virus first
hit companies in Taiwan and Hong Kong before spreading further to
Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The original virus appears in an E-mail as "ILOVEYOU", enticing
users to open the letter, which will do damage to the user's mail
system. One of the virus' variant uses the word "Joke" in the
subject line of the document.

<HEADLINE> EU Pledges More Aid for Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on Friday
announced an offer of an additional 67.5 million euros (62.7
million U.S. dollars) for reconstruction and rehabilitation in
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The move has brought to 73.5 million euros (68.3 million
dollars) worth of European Union humanitarian aid to the African
country since the February floods there.
</P>
<P>
The EU pledge met 15 percent of the aid appealed by the
Mozambique authorities for reconstruction and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
"This is the most tangible and meaningful manner by which the
European Commission can help the people of Mozambique rebuild
their lives and economy," said EU Humanitarian Commissioner Poul
Nielson.
</P>
<P>
In last February, Mozambique was struck by torrential rainfalls
and following cyclones, which together triggered devastating
flooding affecting the country's extensive areas.
</P>
<P>
The EU's executive body said its new offer will fund projects
of flood protection, rebuilding of transport and rural
telecommunications systems, basic social services and public
health in Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Producer Prices up in EU, Euro Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The industrial producer price index
rose in both the European Union and the euro zone in March this
year, Eurostat reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based statistical office of the European
Community said that the industrial producer prices went up in
March by 0.5 percent compared with the previous month while the
prices rose by 0.6 percent in the euro zone in the same period of
time.
</P>
<P>
For the 15-nation union and the 11-nation single currency club,
the industrial producer price index posted the same increase in
February, Eurostat said.
</P>
<P>
As in previous months, the March increase was led by the index
for intermediate goods that rose by 0.8 percent in the EU and by 0.
9 percent in the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
Compared with March last year, the industrial producer prices
were up by 5.6 percent in the European Union and by 6.2 percent in
the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
The increase again stemmed mainly from the intermediate goods
sector. The prices rose much less in other sectors, although the
annual rate of most of them has edged slightly up in the past six
months, Eurostat said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Banks to Review Strategies to Stay Competitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's entry to the World Trade
Organization could force large domestic Chinese banks to consider
seeking capital from sources other than the state in order to
effectively counter foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
This could push banks toward Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)
and tapping the international capital markets, said Credit Suisse
First Boston (CSFB) in a report released Friday in Hong Kong on
China's financial sector reform.
</P>
<P>
John Hobson, CSFB's director and head of the Asian Banking
Research, pointed out in the report that the successful listing of
the Chinese banks will be dependent upon factors including
corporate governance and disclosure, legal and regulatory
framework, operational efficiency, technology and most importantly,
credit quality.
</P>
<P>
"The four largest state-owned banks, Agricultural Bank of China,
Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China, control approximately 70 percent of the
banking system including problem assets," said Hobson.
</P>
<P>
The four asset management companies set up by the four banks
had already taken on problem loans totaling 350 billion yuan (39.5
billion U.S. dollars) by late 1999 and a total of 1 trillion yuan
(121.95 billion U.S. dollars) is expected to be carved out from
the banking system soon. This will undoubtedly help improve the
asset quality of the state-owned banks and is an important step
forward.
</P>
<P>
China entry to the WTO will allow foreign integrated financial
groups access to the market.
</P>
<P>
"To compete going forward, we believe Chinese financial
services supermarkets will need to emerge. In our view, the
regulatory framework will also need to adapt further and possibly
a super-regulator will emerge as has occurred in some other
markets," added Hobson.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- An inter-departmental red tide
working group announced on Friday that they found four red tide
sightings within Hong Kong waters, keeping the public well
informed of the latest monitoring situation.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the working group said a red tide formed by
Prorocentrum sigmoides was observed at Kat O Fisheries Substation
of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department on April
29 but it had dissipated the next day.
</P>
<P>
On May 3 and 4, the staff of the department also reported other
three red tide sightings, still persisting in the sea areas.
</P>
<P>
All red tide species identified are non-toxic, the spokesman
said. "They have been sighted in Hong Kong waters before but led
to no associated fish kill," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that red tides formed by these species could
have a potential to affect cultured fish through oxygen depletion.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said red tide was a natural phenomenon and the
department's pro-active and comprehensive phytoplankton monitoring
program would continue monitoring red tide occurrence to minimize
its impact on the mariculture industry.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM to Meet Annan on Withdrawal from S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
will travel to New York next week for a meeting with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to discuss issues concerning Israel's
planned pullout from south Lebanon by July, Israel Radio reported
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting comes at a time when the northern border of Israel
is witnessing an escalation of conflicts beween Hezbollah
guerrillas and Israeli forces, which have inflicted casualties on
both sides.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, U.N. Middle East special envoy Terje Larsen is
paying a three-day visit to Lebanon starting on Wednesday to
discuss Israel's proposed withdrawal from south Lebanon and the
future of the international peacekeepers deployed there for the
past 22 years.
</P>
<P>
Larsen, who held talks with Israeli officials on the pullout
last week, told reporters that the United Nations is looking
forward to implementing Resolutions 425 and 426, which demand a
full Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon as well as the return of
the Lebanese government's authority over the area.
</P>
<P>
The U.N envoy held talks with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud
and Prime Minister Salim Hoss on the pullout, which Israel said
will be completed by July 7. Hoss told Larsen that Israel's
withdrawal should include the release of all Lebanese prisoners and
the return of all occupied land, including Shabaa Farms, a disputed
area that edges the Golan Heights and was once held by Syria.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, three key Arab foreign ministers, Faruk Shareh of
Syria, Amr Moussa of Egypt and Saudi Arabia's Prince Saud al-
Faisal, voiced their support for the United Nations to take control
of security in south Lebanon following Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The three ministers, winding up talks in the Syrian city of
Palmyra, 240 kilometers northeast of Damascus, said in a statement
that the United Nations should shoulder its responsibilities in
accordance with the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-strong U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL),
established in 1978 in line with Resolution 425 from nine
countries, was primarily deployed in the western and central
sectors of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In the event of a complete pullout of the Israel Defense Forces
(IDF), it is expected that the U.N. peace force will be required to
be deployed to the international border, which will necessitate the
expansion of the force.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which for years has evaded U.S. and international calls
for contributing IDF personnel to U.N. forces, is considering the
issue of repaying the U.N. forces for filling up the void left in
south Lebanon as a result of its pullout and "sponsoring" the
pullout itself, the Israeli daily Ha'artz reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided in March to pull back its forces in south Lebanon
with or without a peace deal with Syria, the main power broker in
Lebanon. It has also formally notified the United Nations of its
withdrawal determination.
</P>
<P>
But Beirut has warned Israel of more frontier violence if it
quits Lebanon without a peace accord with Syria, which backs the
Hezbollah guerrillas fighting in the south.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh said Wednesday that there
is still chance of establishing peace with Israel. He told
reporters after talks with his Egyptian and Saudi counterparts
that "contacts in this regard did not stop."
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Russia is reportedly launching a new Middle
East peace initiative to bring the deadlocked Israeli-Syrian talks
back on track. Russia's Mideast special envoy Nicolai Kartuzov, who
is now visiting Israel, said on Wednesday that his country would
like to send a special envoy to Syria to help restart its talks
with Israel.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Interview: Malaysia Achieves in Betterment of Rural Life (by Wu Dingbao) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 5 (Xinhua) -- After having made efforts for
decades, Malaysia has achieved tremendously in improving the rural
life, Rural Development Minister Azmi Khalid said.
</P>
<P>
In peninsular Malaysia, 98 percent of villages now have metal
roads of 6-foot wide suitable for one car passing and the villages
are linked with 40-foot wide rural roads to highways, the minister
told Xinhua in a recent exclusive interview.
</P>
<P>
Again in peninsular Malaysia, 98 percent of rural areas where
45 percent of the country's some 22 million population are living
have tap water and electricity, he said.
</P>
<P>
And 90 percent of villages in Malaysia have telephone
facilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that to Malaysia, rural development is a
political and national agenda to enable the rural people to be
active economically and to ensure political stability in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The responsibility of bettering the rural life is not only with
the Rural Development Ministry, but with the whole government,
because historically, regions away from cities were occupied by
Malays who formed the political base in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
"So UMNO (United Malays National Organization), the backbone of
the government, made it a national policy to develop rural areas,"
the minister said, adding "Strategically, we started with basic
infrastructure including building roads joining village to village
and house to house, providing water for irrigation and drinking,
and electricity and telecommunication facilities."
</P>
<P>
Azmi said that the government spent a lot on rural development.
For example, he said that for the last five years (1996-2000), the
government allocated 3.4 billion ringgit (894.736 million U.S.
dollars), among which 1.4 billion ringgit (368.421 million dollars)
for village and rural roads construction, 1.27 billion ringgit (
334.21 million dollars) for water supply, and the rest amount for
other purposes.
</P>
<P>
He said that for the next five years (2001-2005), his ministry
is asking for 5 billion ringgit (1.315 billion dollars) for rural
development mainly in the areas of roads construction, water and
electricity supply, rural industry, rural education for pre-school
kids, and human resources development and religious education.
</P>
<P>
All these basic amenities are planned to create an environment
where the people can be active economically.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, the government pays great attention to
education in rural areas by setting up schools and providing
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
"For students from remote areas, we have hostels for them to
stay. There are many residential schools in rural areas throughout
Malaysia," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Education is the main part on which the government has really
spent money," he added.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the minister said that by now, only 6.8 percent of
the country's population are poor in comparison with that more
than half of its population were poor when Malaysia became
independent in 1957. "We are targeting that by the year 2005, we
want to eradicate the poverty."
</P>
<P>
"Now the Malaysian society is peaceful with different races
living together, respecting each other.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia is a multi-racial country. For that, we must continue
to have peace, so we must make sure that people are economically
active, living comfortably, we do not allow that one race is rich
and another poor, so that we can enjoy political stability and
continuous economic growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our vision is that the rural areas are developed to be
attractive places with very good environment and all necessary
facilities and economically viable and to be decent places to
bring up families, and are linked up by roads and highways with
any other parts of the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
"By the year 2020 when Malaysia achieves its vision of becoming
a developed nation, 74 percent of our population will be living in
urban areas because by then towns become bigger and rural areas
now will be no more rural," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the challenge to Malaysia is to make
sure that the population growth (at an annual rate of 2.5 percent)
does not spoil the environment. For that, he said, the government
enacted laws for environment protection.

<HEADLINE> African Nations Urged not to Support Togolese Presidency of OAU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Foreign Minister Joao Miranda
has advised all the African countries to abstain the support for
the imminent Togolese presidency of the Organization of the
African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, this attitude of the Angolan
government is based on the United Nations report on the sanctions
against the Angolan rebels which asked the regional organizations
to avoid organizing and holding international or regional meetings
in the countries cited by the U. N. report as major supporters for
the Angolan rebels led by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
But according to the decision made at last summit of OAU, Togo
will assume the presidency of the Pan-African organization in July
of this year. The present presidency of OAU is assumed by
Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Miranda made the declaration when meeting with the African
ambassadors to Angola during which he informed them of the U.N.
report on the sanctions against Jonas Savimbi that was put forward
by the head of the U.N. Angola Sanction Committee Robert Fowler in
early March.
</P>
<P>
The minister solicited the support from the diplomats for the
engagement and collaboration in the application of the sanctions
imposed by U.N.
</P>
<P>
"At this moment, Togo is unsuitable for lodging and presiding
the next OAU summit," Miranda stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Togolese government has been accused by Angola of violating
the U.N. sanctions against Savimbi by providing education
opportunities for the relatives of Savimbi, said local analysts.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Warns S. Leone Rebels of Facing Possible Prosecution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the United Nations
peace- keeping mission in S. Leone (UNAMSIL) has warned the
country's former rebel leaders of possible prosecution of their
holding U.N. personnel hostage and killing of its soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here Friday morning from Freetown quoted
spokesman Philip Winslow as saying in the West African capital
that an amnesty granted to rebels under last year's Lome peace
accord did not cover acts.
</P>
<P>
"Those responsible will definitely be prosecuted," he said at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
In another latest development, the U.N. officials in New York
on Thursday had revised the death toll among peacekeepers down
from seven to four. They said that no bodies had been recovered
yet.
</P>
<P>
They put the number of UNAMSIL peacekeepers and civilians staff
being held in Makeni and Kailahun in the east of the country at
69, up from 49 previously, but said that the total could be even
higher.
</P>
<P>
The UNAMSIL spokesman in Sierra Leone also warned on Thursday
that the recent attacks on U.N. troops by rebels could lead to
violent confrontations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He accused the rebels of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
of completely destroying disarmament camps in the country's
central towns of Makeni and Magburaka, in addition to taking
dozens of U.N. personnel hostage and killing of its soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Rwanda Clash In DRC, Kills Five </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan and Rwandan forces fought
each other outside the rebel-held Kisangani in the eastern part
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on Friday, according
to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
At least five civilians died and nine others wounded in the
clash, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Shaban Bantariza, Ugandan army spokesman, refused to confirmed
the clash in a telephone interview with Xinhua. But he said
further information might be available later.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have been close allies for years in the
Congolese conflict. Tensions have steadily increased between the
two allies since march 1999 for they are backing rival rebel
forces in the DRC. Both Uganda and Rwanda have in recent weeks
reportedly reinforced their forces stationed near Kisangani, the
third largest city in the DRC. Rwanda accused Uganda was massing
troops in the same area recently.
</P>
<P>
The two estranged allies staged massive offensives against each
other in Kisangani In August 1999.

<HEADLINE> Livingstone Officially Declared London Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Ken Livingstone, the independent
candidate and maverick MP expelled from Labor, was officially
declared as London's first directly elected mayor on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Livingstone won the poll despite a late surge in support for
Tory Steve Norris - with Labor's Frank Dobson trailing well behind
on a disastrous election night for Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
Livingstone, who stood as an independent after being rejected
by the ruling Labor party, won easily in a low turnout, according
to the official results of Thursday's vote.
</P>
<P>
Only a third of London's five million voters cast their ballots.
But the left-winger's victory hurt Prime Minister Tony Blair's
Labor party, whose hand-picked candidate Frank Dobson was pummeled
into an embarrassing third place.
</P>
<P>
Livingstone won the vote after second preferences were
calculated during a marathon election count.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere across England, Labor lost control of 14 local
councils as the Tories and Liberal Democrats gained ground. But
there was a surprise as the Conservatives lost to the Liberal
Democrats in the Romsey by-election.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair said he would be speaking to
Livingstone following his victory -- but said his views about
London's new mayor had not changed.
</P>
<P>
He said: "It is important that we do what we can as a
government to make sure that this works for London and works for
Londoners. We accept our responsibility in that regard."
</P>
<P>
But Blair made it clear Livingstone would not be allowed to
return to Labor after standing against an official party candidate.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Plans to Build Marine Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region government has planned to build a marine
park in Tung Ping Chau in the new territories to help conserve the
rich and diverse marine life in the area.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa has given directions in the
Executive Council to the Country and Marine Parks Authority to
prepare a draft map for Tung Ping Chau Marine Park.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the project Friday, a government spokesman said the
proposed fourth marine park, which would cover about 270 hectares
of coastal and sea area around Tung Ping Chau, is of high
conservation value.
</P>
<P>
"The proposed park helps conserve the rich and diverse marine
life in the area, protect breeding grounds for fish stocks and
provide opportunities for scientific research," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Country and Marine Parks Authority has started to consult
relevant district councils, rural committees, fishermen
organizations, village representatives, various green groups and
other sectors on the proposed designation in the preparation of
the draft map. So far, a majority of them have supported the
proposed designation of the marine park.
</P>
<P>
A notice on the draft map will be gazetted when it is ready.
The draft map will be made available for public inspection and
objections raised will be carefully considered.
</P>
<P>
Most of the land of Tung Ping Chau has been designated as
country park since June 1979. The proposed Tung Ping Chau Marine
Park is confined to the sea area below the high water mark.
</P>
<P>
A study, commissioned by the Agriculture, Fisheries and
Conservation Department on the ecological value of the area in
1998, confirmed that it was a suitable site for marine park.
</P>
<P>
The Country and Marine Parks Board and the Marine Parks
Committee were consulted on the proposed designation of Tung Ping
Chau Marine Park and both supported the proposal.

that points (during my visit) in a bid to promote the flow of (
Chinese) tourists to Indonesia," Shihab said, citing that China
with its huge population is a very potential market for tourism in
Indonesia.

<P>
BANGKOK, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand (BOT), claimed
Friday that it will not interfere with the recent tumbling of the
Thai baht, saying that the depreciation was caused by outside
factors.
</P>
<P>
Therachai Puvanathnaranuban, BOT Assistant Governor said in an

exchange trading volume remain normal, BOT has no plan to
intervene, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
"However, BOT will continue to monitor the situation closely,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Therachai said the weakening of the Thai currency is largely
due to investors' expectation that the United States would raise
its interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Thursday afternoon, the baht tumbled to between 38.52 and 38.00,
to the dollar down from 38.35 to 38 to the dollar in the morning

<HEADLINE> hke050556 --Indonesian Gov't to Sign Peace Accord With Aceh Separatists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The government of Indonesia and the
Acehnese separatist group (GAM) are planning to sign a memorandum
of understanding (MoU) on the reduction of tension and violence in
country's Aceh province, a senior official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in a press conference here, Foreign
Minister Alwi Shihab said the MoU is due to be signed in Geneva,
Switzerland on May 12, by the Indonesian government permanent
representative there,Ambassador Hasan Wirayuda and the GAM
representatives.
</P>
<P>
"In principle, we want to solve the Aceh problem, but not its
territorial issues but just the problem of the Acehnese who are
now suffering due to contracted conflict between the separatists
and the central government. We want to focus our talks with the
GAM in Geneva on how to help the Acehnese people and stop their
misery," Shihab said.
</P>
<P>
The main substance of the agreement is not to continue the
violence but to lay down weapons, a government official said
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Shihab said the international community has given their support
to Indonesia to defend its territory from disintegration threats.
</P>
<P>
The GAM, an underground armed group in the western-most
province of Indonesia has been fighting for 25 years to demand an
Acehnese independence.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of civilians and military officers as well as
separatist members died in the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"There is no problem with integrity of territory in Indonesia,
including Aceh province (it will remain Indonesia's province). We
are not going to talk about political issues in Geneva,"Shihab
said.
</P>
<P>
He further said that with the signing of the MoU, both sides
are expected to agree to reduce tension and violence in the
predominantly Moslem province of Aceh.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope that we are going to find a best solution to
resolve the Acehnese issue. We always give priority to a dialogue
measure in this point," Sihab said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Build 100,000 Model Rural Communities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is planning to
 transform 100,000 rural settlements in the country into rural
model communities in a bid to uplift the living standard of rural
dwellers.
</P>
<P>
This Day, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Friday quoted Minister
of Information Jerry Gana as saying that the plan was a clear
indication of the high premium the government attached to the
development of the country' s rural communities as an instrument
for achieving sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the media in the capital Abuja Thursday, Gana said
that every year 1,000 communities in each of the country's six
geo-political zones would be targeted for transformation.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the model communities, when eventually on
board, would be equipped with adequate infrastructural facilities
and support services.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the plan would enhance productivity and
income- generating activities to stimulate rural economic growth
and development, said the minister, adding that all federal
ministries would have their activities properly harmonized and
coordinated for better results during the process.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated the determination of the government to
pursue its national food security program, saying the food
security scheme was designed to store food stocks against times of
emergency and to facilitate price stabilization.

<HEADLINE> Livingstone Heads for Victory in London Mayoral Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Ken Livingstone, the independent
candidate and maverick MP expelled from Labour, is heading for the
political history books as London's first elected mayor, according
to initial results released Friday.
</P>
<P>
Livingstone is set to triumph in the poll despite a late surge
in support for Conservative candidate Steve Norris.
</P>
<P>
Frank Dobson, the Labour candidate who beat Livingstone in the
party's bitter selection battle, was trailing on 13 percent, a
major blow to party leaders who had been determined to stop
Livingstone.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere across England, Labour lost control of 14 local
councils as the Tories and Liberal Democrats gained ground.
</P>
<P>
In the elections for the 14 Greater London Assembly (GLA)
constituency seats, the Tories won eight to Labour's six, with the
BBC predicting that the parties will each take nine seats in the
25-member assembly when the "top-up" results are calculated.
</P>
<P>
The GLA results showed Livingstone clearly in front with 41
percent of first preference votes, indicating that he would win
the mayoralty with the help of second preference votes.
</P>
<P>
Despite a low turnout, the final mayoral result is not expected
until 1100 GMT on Friday after problems with counting equipment.
</P>
<P>
Norris polled 26 percent of first preference votes in the first
GLA seats to declare, while Liberal Democrat Susan Kramer is
battling for third place with Dobson on 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
In English council elections, Labour lost control of Bradford,
Hartlepool, Oxford and Portsmouth, with Tory gains in Cherwell,
Eastbourne, Solihull -- a major target for the party -- and Torbay.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sees Thomas/Uber Cups as Olympic Stepping-stone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JAKARTA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports Council
(KONI) considers the Thomas and Uber Cups as the benchmark for its
goals in the Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
KONI Vice Chairman Arie Sudewo said Friday the players'
performance in the cups, badminton's premier team events, next
week would indicate their chances in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"I hope our men's and women's team will be able to achieve the
target of retaining the Thomas Cup for the 12th time and reaching
the semifinal of the Uber Cup. That will help us to win gold
medals in the Olympics," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Friday
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has targeted winning gold in at least the men's
singles and men's doubles at the Olympics from September 15 to
October 1.
</P>
<P>
Arie encouraged the players to win the Thomas/Uber Cups over
spectators through sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
"Don't fear your opponents. You are on the same court with the
same conditions. All you have to do is do your best without
ignoring the values of sportsmanship. Shuttlers must be able to
maintain their condition, boost their fighting spirit and self-
confidence to win," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the International Badminton Federation issued the
list of 162 Olympic qualifiers on Wednesday. A total of 19
Indonesian shuttlers qualified for the event.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Enraged Over Slain Hostages' Torture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
has expressed outrage over the torture of four civilian hostages
who were later executed by the extremist group Abu Sayyaf in the
southern Basilan province.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said Friday the president
was also deeply saddened after receiving reports of the torture of
the victims from the Cabinet Cluster E.
</P>
<P>
"The president was angered and saddened by this report. It was
clear that the victims were tortured severely and later killed by
the Abu Sayyaf," Zamora said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated the government's assurance to the victims'
families that they will get justice for their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
The four tortured hostages included a priest and three teachers.
"We will finish this. We hope for the recovery of the remaining
hostages," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
Citing reports reaching the Cabinet Cluster E, which handles
political affairs and national security concerns, Zamora said the
four victims were tortured before being slain, and not killed in a
crossfire as the extremists claimed.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the four victims were recovered on Wednesday by
the military along with 15 hostages abducted by the Abu Sayyaf on
March 20. About 10 other hostages taken by the extremist group are
still unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
Zamora added that the government is now verifying reports that
Abu Sayyaf leader Khadafy Janjalani and spokesman Abu Sayyaf were
killed in Wednesday's encounter with the military in Basilan.

BANGKOK, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand moved up a place from 34th
to 33rd in the latest competitiveness survey of 47 nations
conducted by the International Institute of Management Development
in Switzerland, The Thai government said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The institute was quoted by a Thai government report as saying
that Thailand had made a significant improvement during the past
year in the fields of educational investment, tourism and import
and export businesses.
</P>
<P>
However, the institute said that the country still lags behind
other countries in technological and telecommunications
development and the availability of computers.
</P>
<P>
Some Thai research bodies have urged the government to invest
more in scientific and technological research and development, and
liberalize the telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
Thailand used to command 29th place in the institute's
competitiveness ranking, but slipped to 39th place in 1998 before
moving up to 34th place last year.

<HEADLINE> "LoveLetter" Virus Infection Confirmed in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Infocomm Development Authority
(IDA) of Singapore Friday confirmed the spreading in Singapore of
the new computer virus dubbed "LoveLetter" and issued a media
alert to advise PC users of necessary precautions to protect
themselves against potential virus attacks.
</P>
<P>
In a press release released Friday afternoon, IDA said, "
Instances of the 'LoveLetter' virus spreading in Singapore have
been reported to SingCERT (Singapore Computer Emergency Response
Team)." SingCERT is a joint operation unit set up by the IDA and
the National University of Singapore to assist companies in
handling computer incidents such as computer hacking and viruses.
</P>
<P>
Without giving any detail of these instances, IDA only said
that the Sysmantec AntiVirus Research Center began receiving
reports regarding this worm in the early hours of May 4, 2000, and
the worm appeared to have originated from Manila in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
According to IDA, the worm has been known to arrive in an e-
mail message with its subject in the form of "ILOVEYOU." When
activated, it sends itself to e-mail addresses in the Microsoft
Outlook address book and spreads itself via micro and infects
files on local and remote drives.
</P>
<P>
Quoting unnamed anti-virus experts, IDA strongly advised
infected PC users to refrain from using the infected computer on
account that the virus replicates itself many times within the
infected computer.
</P>
<P>
It also advised PC users to take necessary precautions to
protect against virus attacks in general and to regularly observe
seven items of precautionary practices such as the installing and
updating of anti-virus software, exercising caution in reading e-
mails from unknown sources, making regular back-ups of important
data files.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Proposed Investment Projects Drop in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Approved investment projects in
Cambodia in the first three months of this year fell to 31.6
million U.S. dollars from 120 million dollars in the same period
last year, the Cambodia Daily reported Friday, quoting figures of
the government.
</P>
<P>
Only 23 proposed projects were approved in the first quarter,
compared with 32 proposed projects in the same period in 1999,
according to the Council for the Development of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The totals for the first quarter also were down dramatically
from fourth quarter 1999 with 31 pledged projects worth 239.4
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the decline to lingering negative image and
the slow recovery in Asia financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Another reason may be the government's new investment policy
which requires investors to deposit up to 2 percent of its project
's capital amount into a performance bond.
</P>
<P>
According to the development council data, there are no tourism
investment projects approved in the first quarter. Almost all of
the investments approved in the first quarter were for
manufacturing industries such as textiles and machine assembly
while garment manufacturing accounted for 12 projects with 18.7
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
This year's figures also show that nearly 60 percent of the
investments were made by investors from the Asia-Pacific region
excluding ASEAN members which accounted for only 7.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Hold Third Round of Voting for Presidency  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The third round of voting in
presidential election is set to be held in Turkey on Friday, during
which Ahmet Sezer is expected to be elected with high votes.
</P>
<P>
A total of six candidates, if there is no new withdrawal until
the election hour, will be competing in the third round.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predicted that Chief Judge of the Constitutional Court
Ahmet Sezer, who received 281 votes in the first round and 314
votes in the second round, will be elected in this round with more
than 400 votes.
</P>
<P>
The presiding judge who secured support from both within and
outside Parliament has so far won the most votes during the first
two rounds of balloting.
</P>
<P>
The Parliamentary General Assembly will convene at 3.00 p.m.
local time, and the deputies will cast their ballots in a secret
way.
</P>
<P>
Sezer is in outstanding advantage among the six contenders, the
rest of whom are Mail Buyukerman, independent Eskisehir Deputy;
Dogan Gures, Deputy of True Path Party (DYP); Sadi Somuncuoglu,
Deputy of Nationalist Movement Party (MHP); Nevzat Yalcintas,
Deputy of Virtue Party (FP); Rasim Zaimoglu, Deputy of DYP.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Constitution, a candidate should get no
less than 276 votes in favor which is the simple majority of the
deputies, in the third round of voting to become the president.
</P>
<P>
In case of failure, two of the candidates who receive the
highest votes in this round, will attend the fourth round on May 9,
during which a candidate also should get 276 votes to win.
</P>
<P>
If a president is not elected in the fourth round, then the
parliament will be dissolved and new general elections be held. In
this event, incumbent President Suleyman Demirel will keep his post
until a new President is elected.
</P>
<P>
If Sezer is elected as the new president, he will take over the
presidency on May 16 when Demirel's term expires.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Fires Katyushas on Northern Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Hezbollah guerrillas Friday morning
fired several Katyusha rockets into northern Israel, following
Israeli air raids on Lebanon overnight, Sound of People Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military sources have confirmed the rocket attacks, but
did not disclose any casualties, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hezbollah said in a statement that it had fired on "
the Zionist settlements of Shlomi and Kiryat Shmona in reprisal for
repeated Israeli aggressions against Lebanese civilians."
</P>
<P>
It also warned Israel against continuing these attacks on
Lebanon
and vowed to respond to such attacks.
</P>
<P>
On the wee hours of Friday, Israeli war planes bombed two power
stations in Tripoli and Beirut in retaliation for Hezbollah's
Katyusha rocket attacks on northern Israel late Thursday, during
which one Israeli solider was killed and several civilians injured.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied parts of south Lebanon since 1978. It set up
a 15-kilometer-deep security zone there in 1982 with a claimed aim
of protecting its northern settlements from cross-border guerrilla
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hezbollah, or Party of God, with the backing of Iran
and Syria, has been spearheading a guerrilla war to oust Israeli
forces and their proxy militia South Lebanon Army from the country.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Israel formally informed the United Nations of its
decision to withdraw from south Lebanon by July in implementation
of the U.N. Resolutions 425 and 426, with or without a peace
agreement with Lebanon and its major power broker Syria.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Names New Commander of National Guard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Lieutenant General Evangelos Florakis
has been appointed as new commander of Cyprus' National Guard, the
Cyprus Weekly newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The appointment is to be subjected to approval by the Council of
Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Florakis, a retired military man, will replace Lieutenant
General Dimitris Demou, whose term of office ended last week.
</P>
<P>
Florakis, born in Arta, Greece, in 1943, has served in Cyprus on
two previous occasions.
</P>
<P>
He started his military career as a Cadet in 1962 and while he
climbed up the brass ladder, he graduated from various other
military schools, including the Parachuting Academy in Greece.
</P>
<P>
His last post in Greece, as recent as 1999-2000, was the
commander of the 2nd Army Corp.
</P>
<P>
The National Guard, the Cyprus Republic's armed forces, consists
of some 20,000 servicemen commanded by a Greek mainlander, plus a
reserve force of 100,000.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus also has a 2,000-strong Greek contingent, which provides
for training for the army of the Republic of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island after a
failed coup in Nicosia seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The number of the Turkish Cypriot security forces in northern
Cyprus is put at 4,500 commanded by a Turkish mainlander, in
addition to 35,000 heavily armed Turkish soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Inflation Up Slightly to 3.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' year-on-year
inflation rose slightly to 3.7 percent in April from 3.3 percent
in March due to higher prices of services, housing and repairs,
and petroleum products, the National Statistics Office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The April inflation figure, the highest so far this year, was a
significant improvement from the 7.9 percent inflation registered
in the same month in 1999, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate for Metro Manila increased to 3.4 percent in
April from 3.2 percent in March. On the other hand, inflation in
areas outside Metro Manila went up to 3.8 percent in April from 3.
4 percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation rate averaged 6.6 percent in 1999,
better than the government target of 7 percent to 8 percent. The
Philippine government has set an inflation target of 5 percent to
6 percent for 2000, a goal most analysts believe is achievable.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Keep Military Cordon in Sulu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The military cordon in Sulu
surrounding the area where the kidnappers of the 21 tourists have
holed up will remain in place, the Philippine government
maintained Friday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio interview
that the government will put a premium on the hostages' safety,
but will not allow their kidnappers to escape.
</P>
<P>
"Our policy in his situation is containment in response to the
request of foreign governments. We don't want to assault the area
where the hostages, now divided into five groups, are being held,
but we cannot allow the kidnappers to get away either," said
Zamora.
</P>
<P>
"We maintain that the hostages' safety is our primary
consideration but we cannot allow the Abu Sayyaf to escape," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The hostages abducted from a Malaysian resort island on April
23 include a Filipino, 10 Malaysians, three Germans, two French
nationals, two South Africans, two Finns, and one Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
Zamora sad President Joseph Estrada has spoken to the
representatives of the foreign governments whose nationals were
among the hostages in Sulu to reassure them that Manila is doing
everything to secure the safe release of their citizens.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Press Secretary Ricardo Puno announced that a
delegation of Malaysian officials relayed to the president their
support for the Philippine government's handling of the hostage
situation in Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Puno, who is also the presidential spokesman, has stressed that
the negotiations concerning the release of the hostages are "
basically the function of the Philippine government."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Estrada administration has also
received several "expressions of support" from the other foreign
governments whose nationals are now being held hostage in Sulu.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Economic Recovery "Sustainable": Deputy FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHIANG MAI (Thailand), May 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's economic
recovery will sustain under the support of stable macroeconomic
environment, undergoing key reform programs and broad-based
recovery, said Thai Deputy Finance Minister Pisit Lee-artham here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar organized by the Asian Development Bank (
ADB), Pisit said the pace of Thailand's recovery is "gradual but
firm" with supporting indicators such as continuous growth of
gross domestic products in 1999, increase of production index,
recovery of private consumption and sharp increase in exports.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's economy grew by 4.1 percent in 1999 compared with an
unprecedented plunge of 10.4 percent in 1998, according to ADB
statistics released last week.
</P>
<P>
"This year Thailand's economy is expected to grow by 4.5
percent," Pisit said.
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the crisis, Thailand was able to keep low inflation,
low interest rate, stable exchange rate, lower external debt and
ample foreign exchange reserves and current account surplus," thus
creating a stable macroeconomic environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand also carried out a series of key reform programs in
the past two years, he said, citing the enactment and
implementation of bankruptcy, privatization and real estate laws.
</P>
<P>
Liberalization of foreign entries into economic sectors, good
governance to enhance transparency and accountability and social
and political reforms also helped create a favorable environment
for Thailand's sustainable recovery, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now a broad-based recovery is underway" in Thailand, Pisit
said, listing three factors such as recovery is shown in
manufacturing, service and export sector; further contribution
will come from new investment as excess capacity is being
exhausted and human and financial resources are reasonable
channeled.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted, there still exist a lot of risks on the
road to sustainable recovery, such as abort or delay of further
reform, huge public sector debt, prolonged private sector
restructuring, slow corporate restructuring and continued low
information technology usage.
</P>
<P>
Thailand needs to press on reform agenda and promote
international competitiveness, which will be a key to sustain
recovery in the globalized world, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 33rd annual meeting of the board of governors of the ADB is
going to be held in this mountainous city, some 1,000 kilometers
north of Bangkok from Saturday to next Monday.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Joins Arabian Travel Market 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has taken part in a
tourism fair in the Middle East -- the Arabian Travel Market 2000
(ATM 2000), held in Dubai of the United Arab Emires (UAE) from May
2 and 5, according to a statement of the Tourism Authority of
Thailand (TAT) available here Friday.
</P>
<P>
TAT led entrepreneurs of 20 tourist-related firms to join the
ATM 2000, aimed to promote Thai tourism in the Middle East, as the
upward trend of Middle Eastern arrivals in Bangkok in the first
quarter of this year was observed, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Over 175,000 Middle Eastern tourists visited Thailand in the
January-March period, an increase of 6.08 percent from the same
period of last year, with Israeli and UAE arrivals accounted for
the largest part, it added
</P>
<P>
The 20 tourist-related Thai firms, including hotels, travel
agents, and internet-based businesses, would exchange tourism
information, campaigns, and projects with their counterparts from
other countries, it stated.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Airways International Plc. (THAI), the national flag
carrier, had also cooperated with the TAT in supporting Thailand's
participation in the ATM 2000, along with its weekly flights to
the Middle East, as the Emires Airline of the UAE had also
provided daily flights to Bangkok to facilitate Middle Eastern
tourists, it said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Deputy Finance Minister Vies for Zanzibar Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Deputy Minister for
Finance Abdisalaam Issa Khatibu Thursday declared his intention to
run for the Zanzibar presidency in the general elections to be
held in October this year, newspapers here reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony held at the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM)'s
headquarters in the central town of Dodoma, Khatibu collected the
presidential nomination forms from CCM Secretary-General Phillip
Mangula after paying the non-refundable fee of 1 million Tanzanian
shillings (about 1,250 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"I reached the decision to run for the Zanzibar Presidency
because I believe that I have all the qualifications. It is my
constitutional right to do so," the 60-year old Member of
Parliament from Makunduchi, Zanzibar, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Khatibu, the first CCM member who joined the race for
Zanzibar's top government position, said he was not pressured by
anyone or group of people to vie for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Zanzibar's main opposition leader Seif Sharrif
Hamad declared his intention to join the presidential race in the
spicy Isles presidential, general and civic elections in Zanzibar,
which are scheduled to be held on October 29 this year.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar joined with mainland Tanganyika to form the United
Republic of Tanzania after a revolt in 1964 that ousted the Sultan
and Omani Arabs who ruled the Indian Ocean Island. However, it is
a semiautonomous state with
its own government and parliament.

<HEADLINE> Farm Acquisition not to Ruin Economy: Zimbabwean Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The compulsory acquisition of some
white-owned commercial farms by the government for resettlement
will not ruin the economy, Zimbabwean Minister of Information,
Posts and Telecommunications Chen Chimutengwende has said.
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that such resettlement will enable the resettled
people to grow enough crops to feed themselves and pay for the
health services and the education of their families," he was
quoted by Friday's daily Herald as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister dismissed British High Commissioner to Zimbabwe
Peter Longworth's assertion in a newspaper article on Wednesday
that Zimbabwe's economy would be destroyed if land was acquired by
the government.
</P>
<P>
The empowering of the people through access to fertile land is
a priority in the country's economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot leave 70 percent of our best arable land located in
areas with good rainfall to 4,000 former Rhodesians who only use
about 25 percent of it. Much of that land is not used at all
while millions of our people are landless," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that after taking the land that has been identified by
the government as suitable for resettlement, there would still be
plenty of room for white commercial farmers who are prepared to
share land with the majority.
</P>
<P>
"Peter Longworth is not saying the truth when he says the
British government has a large amount of money for land reform in
Zimbabwe," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The recent London land talks proved that it is impossible for
Zimbabwe to access such funds because of the conditions. We need
such funds for compensation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chimutengwende reaffirmed Zimbabwe's position on land that the
British government, which created the land problem in the first
place, would have to pay for compensation.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Uganda, Rwanda to End Quarrel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has urged
Ugandan President Yoweri President Museveni and his Rwandan
counterpart Paul Kagame to resolve the hostility between the two
countries, the New Vision daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The hostilities between Uganda and Rwanda worry us," Aldo
Ajello, EU special representative to the Great Lakes region, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I met and talked to Kagame and Museveni. They said that they
are in dialogue. They should stop the nonsense of fighting with
each other," Ajello said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we shall do our best to prevent any future
conflicts between Uganda and Rwanda."
</P>
<P>
Hostilities and marred relations between the two countries
occurred after the August 1999 clashes between the two armies in
Kisangani, the Democratic Republic Congo (DRC), and the recent
accusations by Rwanda that Uganda was massing troops in the same
area.
</P>
<P>
EU hopes that after the security concerns of Uganda and Rwanda
have been guaranteed, the Uganda Peoples' Defense Forces and the
Rwanda Patriotic Army will leave the DRC, Ajello said.
</P>
<P>
"No one has the legitimacy of occupying another country
forever," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Uganda not to Plan on Re-opening Kinshasa Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has no urgent
plan so far to re-open its embassy in Kinshasa, capital of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the New Vision daily
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Re-opening the embassy will need comprehensive discussions,"
Amama Mbabazi, state minister for regional cooperation, was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, "the Kinshasa government in 1998
acted in violation of the Geneva Convention governing diplomatic
missions."
</P>
<P>
Uganda's Embassy in Kinshasa was looted and shut down shortly
after rebellion broke out in the DRC on August 2, 1998. The DRC
government accused Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Although the embassy remains physically closed, Uganda has
maintained its diplomatic relations with Kinshasa, Mbabazi said.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni met with Ismail Tutwamoto
Lubenga, DRC minister of State for External Security, at his home
in Rwakitura Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lubenga delivered a special message from President Laurent
Kabila to Museveni, which concerned current efforts to resolve the
conflict in the DRC and the normalization of relations between
Uganda and the DRC.

<HEADLINE> Pound Slides After Bank Leaves Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England's Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC) has left base rates unchanged at 6 percent this
month, sending the pound sliding to its lowest level against the
dollar in almost four years.
</P>
<P>
There was sufficient surprise at the no-change verdict to
trigger a switch from sterling to the dollar. The pound dipped to
1.5360 U.S. dollars, its lowest since May 1996, before recovering
to 1.5423 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the move was a reaction to the pound's fresh
gains in recent weeks. Sterling has risen 4.5 percent in trade-
weighted terms since the committee last met.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the euro was only able to make modest ground against
the pound, closing less than 1p firmer at 57.85p. The combination
of the pound's dollar weakness and euro strength is a double blow
for UK manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly all our imported raw materials, including oil, are
priced in dollars, which raises the cost for manufacturers," said
Nick Parsons, chief currency strategist at Commerzbank.
</P>
<P>
Economists generally agreed that when the details of the MPC's
meeting are published in a fortnight's time, they will show that
the pound's relative strength persuaded a majority of the nine
committee members against a rate rise.
</P>
<P>
There was general relief at the MPC's decision, which came on
the same day that the British Bankers' Association announced
record lending to the private sector of 17.3 billion pounds (
around 26.6 billion U.S. dollars) in the first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
Industrialists were delighted. The Confederation of British
Industry said: "This was the right decision. It should be seen as
a signal that interest rates have peaked."
</P>
<P>
But in financial markets many believe it is only a matter of
time before the Bank tightens monetary policy further.

TIRANA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A delegation from Yugoslavia's
Serbian Chamber of Commerce signed a cooperation agreement with
its Macedonian counterpart during a two-day visit in Skopje,
capital of Macedonia, reports reaching here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The visit, the first to Macedonia by the Serbian Chamber of
Commerce, was aimed at promoting economic cooperation between the
two countries, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Macedonian Chamber of Commerce Dushan Petreski
and his Serbian counterpart Nedelko Suziq agreed that bilateral
economic cooperation has not reached the level where it should
have due to various reasons, including the impact of the Bosnian
War and lack of relevant agreements.
</P>

Petreski said he hoped the two government would conclude a free
trade agreement this year and improve bilateral trade conditions
while Suziq called for an early settlement of the visa issue to
facilitate Serbian businessmen in their travels to Macedonia.

During the two-day visit which ended Thursday, Serbian
delegates met with representatives of Macedonian companies for
talks on cooperation in the fields of energy, metallurgy, chemical
industry, textile, agriculture and trade, the reports said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli jet fighters on Friday
bombed two power stations in Lebanon and a guerrilla ammunition
depot in retaliation for a rocket attack by Lebanese Hezbollah on
northern Israel, the Israeli military said.
</P>
<P>
"The air raids were a response to the Katyusha fired at (the
northern border town of) Kiryat Shmona and the Galilee," the
military said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) will continue to take all
necessary action against Hezbollah and those backing it in order to
defend the northern border," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Beirut said the Israeli warplanes attacked early
Friday morning the power station of Bsalim on the outskirts of
Beirut and another station in Dier Amar, near the northern
Palestinian refugee camp of Beddawi.
</P>
<P>
The bombing also left a crater in the Damascus road near the
village of Tenayel, about 10 kilometers from the Syrian-Lebanon
border.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli raids on Lebanese infrastructure are the second one
this year. In February, Israel destroyed three Lebanese power
stations, prompting strong Arab condemnation.
</P>
<P>
The retaliation air strike was authorized by the Israeli
security cabinet which met Thursday night in Tel Aviv after
residents of the north were sent to bomb shelters because Hezbollah
launched five salvos of Katyusha rockets into the north Thursday
afternoon, killing a IDF soldier and wounding 25 others.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah rocketed northern Israel for the deaths of an 80-year-
old woman and her 40-year-old daughter and Israel's earlier air
strikes against the Lebanese civilian targets which wounded at
least 12 Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, is the main Lebanese military group
fighting against the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Finance Minister Avraham Shochat Thursday issued an
executive order banning the opening of any new personal savings
plans until transitional tax regulations are approved by the
Knesset (parliament) Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
The order was intended to prevent a mass, last-minute rush by
the public to open tax-free savings plans to avoid paying a 25-
percent tax on savings as proposed in the new tax reform package.
</P>
<P>
The sweeping tax-reform package, prepared by Finance Ministry
Director-General Avi Ben-Bassat and unveiled on Thursday, is
expected to take effect on January 1, 2001, provided it is endorsed
by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Ha'arez
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli cabinet Thursday night authorized a retaliatory
attack on infrastructure in Lebanon after Hezabollah's Katyusha
rockets killed one Israeli solider, wounded about 25 people and
sent about 200,000 residents of the northern Galilee to shelters
earlier in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak reiterated his position at the
cabinet meeting that Israel was not to be trifled with Hezbollah
during the planned pullout from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Washington called on the sides to show restraint and to return
to the Grapes of Wrath understandings of June 1996, when Israel and
Hezbollah agreed to refrain from hitting positions that could cause
civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv
</P>
<P>
-- The tax-reform plan drafted by the Israeli Ben-Bassat
Commission is expected to face a tough battle for approval in the
Knesset (parliament) with both opposition and coalition voicing
displeasure with all or parts of the program on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Although Finance Minister Avraham Shochat called for extensive
support for the plan, Knesset members believed he had left some
room for compromise and that the package would not pass a final
vote in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
The tax-reform proposal is expected to reach the Knesset for its
preliminary reading some time next month. Shochat hopes it will be
approved by the end of October.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Sri Lanka Thursday announced it would resume diplomatic ties
with Israel, and by next week it will send an official delegation
to Israel to establish relations with the Israeli government and
present an urgent request for military aid.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka, which is now fighting against Tamil rebels, has cut
off relations with Israel twice before, once in 1970 and once in
1990 under pressure from the Moslem community.

<HEADLINE> Iran Kicks off Runoff of Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran kicked off the second round of
the parliamentary election Friday morning despite of the delay by
the conservative Guardians Council to confirm the first round
result in Tehran constituency.
</P>
<P>
The polling started at 0900 a.m. (0430 GMT) in 52 constituencies
in 22 provinces and will last for 10 hours till 0700 p.m.. Some 132
candidates are running for the remaining 66 seats of the 290-seat
Majlis (parliament).
</P>
<P>
The reformist allies of President Mohammad Khatami are believed
to repeat the landslide victory in the February polls though they
are deprived of a voice in the campaign after the conservative
judiciary closed down almost all the mouthpieces of the reformists.
</P>
<P>
The reformists took over more than two thirds of the 224 seats
in the first round, ousting the longtime conservative majority in
parliament that had stymied much of the Khatami's reform programs.
</P>
<P>
However, observers said, the fate of the first round polls in
Tehran constituency will rely on the result of the runoffs as the
election watchdog Guardians Council claimed it had found some
errors in vote counting.
</P>
<P>
The Guardians Council waits to see the result of the runoffs to
decide whether to confirm or nullify the result of Tehran
constituency, the biggest and most important one in which the
reformists had won 29 out of the total 30 seats, political analysts
here said.
</P>
<P>
The council said on Thursday that it had found some errors in
the vote counting and vowed to continue a third recount to remove
riggings.
</P>
<P>
The Guardians Council has nullified the results in 12
constituencies, depriving nine reformists from entering the Majlis
and forcing others to the runoffs.

<HEADLINE> MILF Declares Truce in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The separatist Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) has declared unilaterally a 48-hour truce
starting 6:00 a.m. Saturday (22:00 GMT, Friday) in all areas of
conflict in Mindanao, the official Philippine News Agency said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the agency, the declaration was contained in a one-
page document signed by Al Haj Murad, MILF's military chief, with
authorization from Hashim Salamat, the front's reclusive chieftain.
</P>
<P>
"The MILF hereby unilaterally declares a 48-hour truce in
Mindanao to give all concerned a chance to resolve peacefully the
Mindanao problem," said the MILF.
</P>
<P>
Edgardo Batenga, chief negotiator of the Philippine government,
said the government would welcome very much the latest development
but stressed that the government is yet to study its move
regarding the MILF's pronouncement.
</P>
<P>
On April 30, the MILF ordered all its forces in Mindanao to an
all-out war against government troops that resulted to six days of
conflict and bombings on several parts of the southern island.
</P>
<P>
The military said 161 MILF rebels, 20 soldiers and five
civilians were killed in six days of clashes while more than 100,
000 villagers fled their homes.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, the largest rebel group in the Philippines, has been
fighting for an independent state in Mindanao during the past two
decades.

<HEADLINE> Second "Asian Miracle" Foreseeable: Sakakibara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHIANG MAI, (Thailand) May 5 (Xinhua) -- The second "Asian
miracle" can be probably achieved in the 21st century if Asian
countries can adapt to the changes brought by information
technology revolution, Eisuke Sakakibara, former vice finance
minister of Japan, said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar organized by the Asian Development Bank (
ADB), Sakakibara, dubbed as "Mr. Yen" for his then influence on
international financial market, expressed positive views on Asia's
economic perspective.
</P>
<P>
"Asia has a great future if we can quickly adapt our economic
and social system to the new environment while building a defense
mechanism to shield us from volatile and sometimes violent swings
in the globalized and virtualized markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
Saying the world is in a period of "great transformations from
old industrial-financial capitalism to what can be called
information or cyber-capitalism," Sakakibara warned Asian
countries to structurally change their economies and societies to
adapt to the new environment.
</P>
<P>
He cited three basic Asia possesses that will help the region
adapt to the IT revolution, which are the high savings ratio, the
high level of primary and secondary education and the sensitivity
and the ability to absorb high technology.
</P>
<P>
"Asia is well placed in the coming years to reap the rewards
of the IT revolution and could catch up with the U.S. in due
course," Sakakibara said.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned, the revolutionary IT transformation of the
world has had its negative side.
</P>
<P>
He pointing out the major cause of the Asian financial crisis
was the failure of crisis-hit countries to properly monitor the
process of transition from industrial capitalism where the state
played some significant guiding role to information capitalism
where the capital flow is free, guided by real time information.
</P>
<P>
He said Asian countries have to be vigilant and quickly create
the defense mechanism to forestall or at least shield them from
the next crisis that could hit them in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The 33rd annual meeting of the board of governors of the ADB is
going to be held in Chiang Mai, a mountainous city some 1,000
kilometers north of Bangkok, from Saturday to next Monday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Urged to Intensify Fight Against Tuberculosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A report released Thursday urges
U.S. policy makers to intensify the fight against tuberculosis by
detecting latent infections and strengthening public health
services.
</P>
<P>
The report -- "Ending Neglect: The Elimination of Tuberculosis
in the United States" -- was released by the Institute of Medicine.
It calls for rigorous screening programs targeting high-risk U.S.
communities, especially visa applicants from countries where the
disease is widespread.
</P>
<P>
The number of tuberculosis cases has dropped in the United
States in recent years, but swift action is still needed because a
global epidemic remains a potential source of new infections, the
report said. Some 40 percent of new tuberculosis cases in the
country are among immigrants.
</P>
<P>
"This country has entered a dangerous phase in which the
disease has retreated to specific communities, where it can lie
dormant and resist detection," said Morton N. Swartz, chairman of
the committee writing the report.
</P>
<P>
"Without decisive steps to identify and treat the undetected
cases, the disease could come back with a vengeance and exact a
heavy price," Swartz said.
</P>
<P>
Medical advances led to a fall in U.S. TB case numbers during
the 1960s. In 1972, the Congress eliminated funding dedicated to
fighting the disease. In subsequent years, experts said, many
public-health efforts designed to prevent tuberculosis collapsed,
infection rates rose and deadly drug-resistant strains of the
disease emerged.
</P>
<P>
Recommendations made in the report include improving screening
for latent infections among high-risk groups, reorganizing TB-
control systems to reflect the shifting patterns of the disease,
increasing efforts to assist other countries in fighting the
global epidemic, as well as improving methods for detecting and
treating latent infections as an aggressive strategy to eliminate
the disease in the United States.

JERUSALEM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli jet fighters on Friday
bombed two power stations in Lebanon and a guerrilla ammunition
deport in retaliation for a rocket attack by Lebanese Hezbollah on
northern Israel, the Israeli military said.
</P>
<P>
"The air raids were a response to the katyusha fired at
(the northern border town of ) Kiryat Shmona and the Galilee," the
military said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) will continue to take all
necessary action against Hezbollah and those backing it in order to
defend the northern border," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Beirut said the Israeli warplanes attacked
early Friday morning the power station of Bsalim on the outskirts
of Beirut and another station in Dier Amar, near the northern
Palestinian refugee camp of Beddawi.
</P>
<P>
The bombing also left a crater in the Damascus road near
the village of Tenayel, about 10 kilometers from the Syrian-Lebanon
border.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli raids on Lebanese infrastructure are the second
one this year. In February, Israel destroyed three Lebanese power

KUALA LUMPUR, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) will benefit Malaysian industries, a
senior official of the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM)
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed between Malaysia and China on April 12 to
conclude a bilateral market access negotiation in the context of
China's accession to the WTO will greatly benefit both economies
as China's entry into the WTO will not only serve to solidify and
further its recent economic reforms, but will also increase the
openness and transparency of the Chinese commercial environment,"
said FMM vice-president Mustafa Mansur here at FMM's one-day
seminar on "Updates on WTO and Implications of China's Accession
to the WTO on Malaysian Businesses".
</P>
<P>
China's decision to lift the tariff on 760 products of export
interest to Malaysia as announced following the signing of the
agreement will benefit major Malaysian industries and provide
stability and predictability for the local business community, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mustafa believed that China's WTO membership would strengthen
reform tendencies and as a result there would be an increase in
economic liberalization in China.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Friday expressed its
readiness to help in the negotiations to secure the release of 21
people kidnapped by six gunmen from Pulau Sipadan off Sabah, East
Malaysia if requested by the Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
All the 21 hostages are reported to be in a settlement on Jolo
island in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is satisfied with the response and actions taken by
the Philippines so far in handling the kidnap crisis, Inspector-
General of Police Norian Mai who just returned from a visit to the
Philippines told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia hoped negotiations would take place within a
short period.
</P>
<P>
The police chief said the Philippine government had given an
assurance that it would take military action only as a last resort
and if the situation warranted.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia would also continue to provide medicine,
clothing and foodstuff to the victims through Philippine
government channels.
</P>
<P>
He denied the reports that two of the victims had escaped,
saying the reports were not true.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar told a
news conference here Friday that Malaysia hoped that negotiations

NAIROBI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Kenyan newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain Thursday granted the Kenyan government 2.8 million
sterling pounds (about 5 million U.S. dollars) to facilitate the
implementation of the National Urban Poverty Partnership Project.
</P>
<P>
Daily Nation:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke began a five-day United Nations
Security Council mission to Africa Thursday in an effort to
consolidate an uneasy cease-fire in war-battered Democratic
Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
The People:
</P>
<P>
-- Opposition officials Thursday reported more political
violence in Zimbabwe, where a land-grab campaign aimed at white
farmers has stalled the already weak economy and threatens growing
international isolation.

<HEADLINE> Polish Zloty Tumbles to Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Polish zloty on Thursday dropped
to its record low of 4.585 to the U.S. dollar, after reports were
released showing an increase in the current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
Data released by the National Bank of Poland showed that the
deficit reached 1.43 billion U.S. dollars in March, higher than
the expected level between 1.1 billion and 1.3 billion. The
deficit in March accounted for 8.3 percent of the GDP, compared
with 8 percent in February, with a deficit of 954 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The root cause of the deficit increase was slumping exports and
interest payment of foreign loans. Zloty has dropped all the way
since the Polish government completely liberalized the exchange
rates last month.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation of the Polish zloty can spur exports, but it
can also deal a blow to confidence of foreign investors, according
to Polish economists. A currency crisis is possible as there are
phenomena of panic buying of dollars and underselling of zloty.

<HEADLINE> American Trans Air Inc. to Take Delivery of 47 Boeing Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 4 (Xinhua) -- American Trans Air Inc. (ATA)
announced Thursday it would take delivery of 47 Boeing commercial
jets, including 17 from leasing companies and 30 new planes worth
2 billion U.S. dollars at list prices.
</P>
<P>
Deliveries will begin in May 2001, according to a news release
from ATA, which also has an option for 50 more jets, including 10
757s and 40 737s.
</P>
<P>
The 757-300 lists at 81 million dollars while the 737-800 lists
at 57 million dollars, though airlines typically receive hefty
discounts from catalog prices.
</P>
<P>
The order follows one announced by American Airlines earlier
this week for 20 757-200s, worth about 1.4 billion dollars to the
Seattle-based aerospace giant.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the latest deal would be a significant boost for
Boeing's 757 line.
</P>
<P>
The orders are "a positive shot in the arm for the 757," said
aerospace analyst Robert Toomey of Dain Rauscher-PCG in Seattle. "
There had been some issues regarding the momentum of that product
line, and I think this helps it."
</P>
<P>
The orders make 757 production cutbacks "substantially less
likely, and the rate might even edge up," said Cai von Rumohr of
SG Cowen Securities in Boston.
</P>
<P>
ATA, a unit of Amtran Inc., said it will retire 24 727-200
narrowbodies and six L-1011 widebodies, and will look at buying
widebody jets in 12 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
ATA considered buying A320 and A321 narrowbodies, but chose
Boeing's package, which included financing and investments from
Boeing and aircraft lessors International Lease Financing Corp. (
ILFC) and GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS).
</P>
<P>
Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC) helped nail down the deal for
the Seattle manufacturer by agreeing to help ATA re-market the 24
727s, which might include modification for use as freighters.
</P>
<P>
"Boeing was extremely creative in resolving some of our issues.
They moved very, very fast throughout the negotiating process,"
ATA Chief Executive John Tague said.
</P>
<P>
Airbus said the European consortium had submitted an "
aggressive" proposal to try to win the ATA deal, but Boeing's
package was cheaper.
</P>
<P>
For ATA, which is the largest operator of commercial and
military passenger charters worldwide, the fleet upgrade will
slash its maintenance and fuel costs and propel it into the top 10
rankings among U.S. airlines, Tague said.
</P>
<P>
The airline expects operating revenues to grow from 1.12
billion dollars in 1999 to 1.4 billion dollars in 2000 and 1.7
billion dollars in 2001, Tague said.

<HEADLINE> Miller Leads Pacers to Enter Semifinals in Eastern Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Reggie Miller scored a career-high
41 points to lead the Pacers Thursday to the fifth and deciding
game victory over the Milwaukee Ducks 96-95 and won their first
round best-of-five series at three wins and two losses.
</P>
<P>
However it was Travis Best who hit the game-winner as
Indianapolis beat the Bucks and clinched the berth of the
semifinals at the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
Miller scored 18 points in the fourth quarter but Indiana
needed a boost from Best, who despite making just 2-of-14 shots up
that point, sank a 3-pointer from the corner with 16.5 seconds
left to lift the Pacers to victory in the first-round series.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers will meet the Philadelphia 76ers in the best-of-
seven semifinals series opening on Saturday in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Pacers, pressed to the limit by the young Bucks,
needed a big game from Miller, and the sharpshooting veteran
responded by making 15-of-25 shots and saving his best for the
tension-filled fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
The All-Star guard scored 14 of Indiana's 16 points during one
stretch in the final period.
</P>
<P>
"We kept going to him," said Indianapolis coach Larry Bird. "I
don't think it can get better than that. He kept us in it. Reggie
kept making all the shots. It was great playoff basketball. Both
teams played as hard they could."
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee had a chance to tie but Ervin Johnson missed one of
two free throws with 6.2 seconds to go. The Bucks got one last
opportunity after Jalen Rose missed two foul shots with 1.4
seconds left but Ray Allen's long, running 3-pointer was way off.

<HEADLINE> Massu Beats Third-Seeded Pozzi for Semifinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Sixth-seeded Nicolas Massu of
Chile Thursday edged third-seeded Gianluca Pozzi of Italy 2-6, 6-2,
6-2 and moved up to the semifinals at the U.S. Men's Clay Court
Championships in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.
</P>
<P>
In another quarterfinal, Ramon Delgado of Paraguay defeated
Markus Hantschk of Germany 7-5, 6-4, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
The Pozzi-Massu match was between the only two seeded players
left in the draw and it pitted age and guile against youth and
power.
</P>
<P>
In the first set, Pozzi used varied spins and slices to Massu
and break the Chilean's serve in the first and fifth games.
</P>
<P>
Pozzi seemed to still be in control of the match when a series
of unforced errors cost him his serve at 1-3 in the second set.
The momentum of the match quickly shifted in favor of Massu, who
broke Pozzi again in the eighth game to take the set.
</P>
<P>
Playing aggressively from just inside the baseline, Massu put
pressure on a suddenly error-prone Pozzi, breaking the Italian's
serve to take a 3-1 lead in the final set, then secured his first
career ATP Tour semifinal berth by breaking Pozzi again in the
final game.
</P>
<P>
Delgado, playing in his first tournament since undergoing
surgery on his left knee last November, continued his unlikely run
to the semis, winning each set with a service break in the final
game.

<P>
CANBERRA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 18,000 Australian
computer users have been hit by the "love bug" virus, Australian
Associated Press reported Friday.  Anti-virus
research company Trend Micro managing director Kenny Liao said at
least ten major corporations in Australia he knew about had been
hit severely.
</P>
<P>
"We can't confirm yet but we estimate this will be much bigger
than the "Melissa" virus which affected ten million computer
systems worldwide in 72 hours," Liao said.
</P>
<P>
The e-mail message "I Love You" is activated once opened. It
then searches for the user's address book and sends itself to
everyone listed.
</P>
<P>
It also has the capability to delete some files.
</P>
<P>
One of the main problems companies faced was the huge volume of
messages the virus was creating leading to systems crashing.
</P>
<P>
The New South Wales state government computer systems have not
been hit so far.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Information Technology Kim Yeadon said
employees were on full alert. He also offered help to the business
and community with information about the virus and details of how
to combat it on a government web page.

<HEADLINE> Payton Tops 7th NBA Defensive Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 4 (Xinhua) -- One day after leading Seattle to
a huge playoff victory over the Utah Jazz, SuperSonics guard Gary
Payton was named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team for the
seventh time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Making up the voting panel was the NBA's 29 head coaches, who
were not permitted to vote for players from their own team.
</P>
<P>
Payton produced his first career playoff triple-double -- 35
points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists Wednesday night and helped the
Sonics avoid first-round elimination and force a fifth and
deciding game.
</P>
<P>
The Sonics beat Jazz and set an NBA playoff record for fewest
points allowed in the second quarter, surrendering just seven. The
previous mark was nine by San Antonio against Utah on April 30,
1994.
</P>
<P>
Payton is just the sixth player in NBA history to be selected
for the All-Defensive First Team at least seven times.
</P>
<P>
He joins an elite group which is headed by Michael Jordan (nine
times), and includes Bobby Jones (8), Scottie Pippen (8), Walt
Frazier (7) and Dennis Rodman (7).
</P>
<P>
Together with Payton on the 1999-2000 team of defensive
standouts is Los Angeles Lakes guard Kobe Bryant, Miami Heat
center Alonzo Mourning, Minnesota Timberwolves forward Kevin
Garnett and San Antonio Spurs forward Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
Payton led all players with 24 First Team votes and was named
on a maximum 28 ballots, garnering 52 of a possible 56 points from
coaches whose best players often had to go up against the fiery
Seattle guard.
</P>
<P>
Mourning came in second in the balloting. The imposing Miami
center was named on 26 ballots and received 42 points.
</P>
<P>
This marks the second selection to the All-Defensive First Team
for both Duncan and Mourning. Bryant and Garnett are being honored
for the first time each.
</P>
<P>
The NBA All-Defensive Second Team consists of Portland's
Scottie Pippen and Clifford Robinson of Phoenix at forward, Lakers
center Shaquille O'Neal and guards Eddie Jones of Charlotte and
Jason Kidd of Phoenix.

<HEADLINE> 6 Pct GDP Growth Set for Next Fiscal in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The targeted growth is 0.5 percent higher than the expected 5.5
percent growth of GDP at the end of the current fiscal (1999-2000),
and the size of the next ADP will be around 170 billion taka (3.3
billion U.S. dollars), 15 billion taka (300 million dollars)
higher than the current ADP.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Planning Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir told the
newspaper that the coming ADP will include 200 new projects,
emphasizing the implementation of both the new and the old
projects.
</P>
<P>
He said the new ADP would give priority to four sectors,
including primary education, rural roads and telecommunications,
rural electrification and rural health-care services.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the implementation of the current ADP, the state
minister said 54 percent of the program under the ADP for the
current fiscal had been implemented, and the success ratio in
project implementation is the highest in last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
He, however, admitted that some foreign-aided projects could
not be implemented as the aid so far was not available due to
various reasons.
</P>
<P>
The government envisaged 65.26 billion taka (1.25 billion
dollars)as project aid in the current ADP, which was 41 percent of
the total ADP.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,293 projects had been taken under current ADP by
giving priority to education, poverty eradication, human resources
development, flood rehabilitation and improvement of social
services.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Calls for Rooting Out Drug Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Myanmar official has
called for rooting out narcotic drug problem in the country,
saying that the problem is an evil legacy left behind by the "
colonialists".
</P>
<P>
At an annual meeting of the Myanmar Central Committee for Drug
Abuse Control (CCDAC) here Thursday, Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt,
first secretary of the country's State Peace and Development
Council, said the problem is still being used by old and neo-"
colonialists" to get political benefit in disparaging Myanmar,
official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
He noted the government is trying to totally eradicate narcotic
drugs as a national task as the problem not only tarnishes the
image of the nation and social norms but also threatens the entire
mankind on the earth.
</P>
<P>
He charged that at present, some of the big "neo-colonialist"
countries, instead of rendering assistance to Myanmar's drug
elimination efforts, are exploiting the country's drug problem to
their political advantages and making fabricated accusations
against Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
In wiping out the problem of narcotic drugs, Myanmar not only
applies control and eradication method but also strives for
development of the areas where poppy was once grown, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for efforts to launch narcotic drug eradication
campaigns in the country in cooperation with agencies of the
United Nations, friendly countries and Southeast Asian family
nations to pass on correct information in countering the
fabrications spread by those from inside and outside the country
who are trying to gain political advantages by exploiting the drug
problem.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for developing country like Myanmar to
make harmonious and concerted efforts for drug eradication on
their own under the condition with insufficient technology,
equipment and strong financial backing.
</P>
<P>
He urged departments concerned to successfully carry out the
tasks of CCDAC with the aim of wiping off the soil and waters of
Myanmar's problem of narcotic drugs, the legacy of "colonialists",
which is casting shadow over the nation.

ROME -- An international donors' conference organized by the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Mozambique
government ended Thursday with a pledge to issue almost 453
million dollars over the next few months, much more than the
Maputo government initially requested to meet the cost of
reconstruction after disastrous flooding.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Undersecretary Rino Serri said that the success
of the conference lay in "the great ability with which Mozambique
presented itself to the conference, with rigorous analyses and
very serious and well- founded proposals."
</P>
<P>
Serri recalled that Mozambique had seen economic recovery in
the '90s after a bloody civil war. It was therefore necessary now
to ensure "a rapid resumption of this positive course", without
neglecting other areas of Africa. (UN-Mozambique)

<P>
The reports indicate that India, Pakistan and Russia have taken
special cognizance of the situation in Sri Lanka. The Indian
government Friday announced that it was urgently considering Sri
Lanka's request for assistance.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government Thursday resumed diplomatic relations
with the Israel government after a 30 year gap. Israel is a big
producer and exporter of weapons which the Sri Lankan army
desperately needs in its battle against the Tamil Tiger
separatists.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga Thursday promulgated wide
ranging Public Security Regulations including a stringent news
censorship extended to the foreign media here as well.
</P>
<P>
Wide powers have been vested in the military, police and the
administration to combat the Tamil rebels poised to recapture
their former capital of the Jaffna Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Under the new regulations, state authorities can seize aircraft,
ships and property without giving any reason and ban publication
of newspapers and prohibit demonstrations and strikes that may
harm the country's war effort.
</P>
<P>
The authorities can obtain the services of any person for
national security maintaining essential services.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Jaffna peninsula where government troops
Thursday battled relentlessly, causing significant damage to the
rebels and further consolidating their positions in the relocated
defense lines, military sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels, who have been fighting a 17-year war for an
independent homeland for the country's minority Tamils, have
claimed to capture their former stronghold northern Jaffna
Peninsula which recaptured by the government troops in May 1996.

</P>
<P>
It is estimated that opium production will further decline in
the country this year due to bad weather, destruction of poppy
fields by the authorities and setting up of opium-free zones under
the arrangement of ethnic groups, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has conducted opium survey for six times since 1993 in
cooperation with the U.S. under the two countries' anti-drug
program.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Myanmar began every-six-month collection of baseline
data about cultivation of poppy and drug addicts in the country as
a nationwide activity.
</P>
<P>
Later in 1999, Myanmar started implementing a 15-year plan(1999-
2014), aimed at total eradication of narcotic drugs in the whole
country. The plan covers 51 townships in the country's Shan,Kachin,
Chin and Kayah states.

<HEADLINE> No Demilitarized Zone Exists for Kosovo: Yugoslav Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav military on Thursday
refuted the remarks made recently by a U.S. general that there
exists "a demilitarized zone" along the border between the
troubled Kosovo province and the rest of Yugoslavia's Serbian
Republic.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Kosovo, Henry Shelton, chairman of the U.S.
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said NATO commander has the right to send
troops to "the demilitarized zone" on Kosovo's border with Serbia
proper.
</P>
<P>
The General Staff of Yugoslavia's armed forces said in a
statement that there does not exist such a demilitarized zone.
</P>
<P>
Under a military technical accord signed last June between NATO
and Yugoslavia, a five-kilometer-wide security zone was set up
along Kosovo's border with the rest of Serbia, which makes up
Yugoslavia together with Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
The zone is not under the administration of NATO and the NATO-
led peacekeeping force, known as the KFOR, is not entitled to
enter the area, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that it is the United Nations, not NATO,
that is governing the province. By making such a statement, it
added, the U.S. four-star army general was trying to deny the
basic views contained in relevant United Nations resolutions and
the military technical accord.
</P>
<P>
Such a groundless and willful move will neither help implement
the U.N. Security Council's Resolution 1244 and the military
technical accord, nor will it help restore stability in Kosovo,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
KFOR entered Kosovo last June following the withdrawal of
Yugoslav troops from the province after a 78-day NATO air campaign
against the country. The province has since been under the
administration of a U.N. special mission.

BUDAPEST, May 4 (Xinhua) -- France supports the eastward
expansion of the European Union but the qualification terms for
candidate members would not be lowered to speed up the process,
said visiting French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference held after his talks with Hungarian
Prime Minister Orban Victor, Jospin said France will do its utmost
to accelerate the reforms inside the EU and its enlargement.

process of its enlargement and that the EU will not make groups
among candidate members for their admission to the bloc, as the
process is a unified one, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jospin reiterated France's support for the EU's political
sanctions against Austria, which has allowed the ultra-right
Freedom Party into the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
France and Hungary signed several agreements on environment
protection, technical exchanges and education during Jospin's two-
day visit.
</P>
<P>
Jospin, who arrived in Budapest on Wednesday, also held talks
with Hungarian President Goncz Arpad and Foreign Minister Martonyi
Janos.

trading partner of Hungary.

though it could cause serious distress among them.

The nine patients were potentially exposed to the incurable

earlier on a dementia patient, who had since been diagnosed as

<P>
"Nine people were killed in the quake while several others

</P>
<P>
Six of the deceased were residents of Peleng island while the
other three were from Luwuk Banggai regency in mainland Central
Sulawesi.

quake centered at 1.36 degrees southern latitude, 123.57 degrees
eastern longitude and 33 kilometers beneath sea level.
</P>
<P>
"The quake shook across the Sulawesi, but the worst happened in
central Sulawesi, especially Luwuk Banggai regency," the
Meteorology and Geophysics Agency's Makassar office head Sunaryo
was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sunaryo said the continuation of the quake might occur, but it
would not as big as the beginning.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of houses in seven subdistricts in Banggai were
reportedly flattened.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the provincial administration Longkyu Janggolo
said tsunami up to six meters in height swept Luwuk and Peleng
island, forcing hundreds of people to flee.
</P>
<P>
"People who lost their homes are now temporarily taking shelter
in tents set up by local administration staff, and we have
supplied them with rice and medicines," Longky said.
</P>
<P>
In Luwuk, some 607 kilometers east of Palu, a pier was
seriously damaged, tens of houses collapsed, and a market burned
down due to a short circuit.

<P>
The Banggai islands and Banggai district -- some 1,080
kilometers northeast of Jakarta -- have a combined population of
some 600,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- About a million children and
teenagers from private schools paraded on streets in Colombia's
main cities on Thursday demanding the release of minor hostages
and an end to violence against children and young people.
</P>
<P>
The largest demonstrations were held in downtown avenues in the
capital city of Bogota and Cali, a city in southwestern Colombia,
where nine-year-old student Dagoberto Ospina, leader of student
campaigns for peace in the country, was kidnapped last week.
</P>
<P>
Ospina was forcibly taken from the "Alferez Real" college
school bus by three persons who carried weapons and grenades, in a
kidnapping that has greatly disturbed inhabitants of the city.
</P>
<P>
Class in nearly 5,000 private schools was suspended for
students to attend the peaceful demonstrations, which were called
by the National Confederation of Education Centers.
</P>
<P>
In Cali, the procession was more than five kilometers long,
with students holding placards reading "Release Dagoberto" and "
We want to play and be with our friends."
</P>
<P>
Residents in Cali also demanded the release of Carlos Alberto
Bernal, also a student, who was kidnapped together with his two
schoolmates more than a month ago by the National Liberation Army
guerrillas. His two classmates have already been set free.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Colombian government has pledged to take drastic
steps against kidnapping rampant in the country.
</P>
<P>
About 60 children were abducted during the first three months
of this year, up one-third from 1999, according to the independent
anti- kidnapping group Pais Libre.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government reported 2,945 kidnappings for last
year and accused the various groups of guerrillas of the
kidnappings.

"We trust that you and the authorities in the Philippines will

<HEADLINE> IPU Session Ends with Calls for Peace, Dialog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The 103rd conference of the Inter-
Parliamentary Union (IPU) was concluded here on Friday with final
resolutions calling for intensified international efforts for peace
and stability, dialog between different cultures and civilizations
as well as protection of the rights of refugees.
</P>
<P>
During six days of debates, the majority of the participants
agreed that the world is moving toward a multipolar system since
the end of the Cold War, with peace and development as the dominant
trend.
</P>
<P>
But they also agreed that the world is far from tranquil, due to
various conflicts of political, economic, racial and religious
origins.
</P>
<P>
Most delegates from developing countries called for a new and
just world political and economic order to solve international and
regional disputes through dialog, to bridge the gap between the
rich and the poor and to remove the disparity in economic
development.
</P>
<P>
In one of the final resolutions on peace and stability, the IPU
echoed the call of developing countries on parliaments in the world
to promote dialog and foster friendly ties between countries in
political, economic and cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
It also called for an equitable distribution of wealth between
countries, and called on the World Bank and other international
banking institutions to support poverty alleviation programs in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
In a second resolution, the IPU called on its member parliaments
to play a more active role in promoting dialog between different
cultures and civilizations, and take measures to promote cultural
diversity and protect minority cultures in their own countries by
means of legislation.
</P>
<P>
It called for more attention to equal rights between men and
women in political and economic lives, and to the rights of
children to education.
</P>
<P>
The IPU also took up the refugee issue as one of its major
themes at the conference.
</P>
<P>
In a third resolution on refugees, the IPU stressed that rights
of refugees displaced by war and occupation should be fully
respected.
</P>
<P>
It said it fully supports the rights of Palestinian refugees to
return to their homeland. It was seen as an apparent victory for
the Arab bloc of parliamentarians during their debates with their
Israeli counterparts and Israel's supporters.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are over 3 million Palestinian refugees in
Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and other countries, who had fled their
homes during successive Arab-Israeli wars in the past half century.
</P>
<P>
The IPU also stressed that it supports all efforts that could
lead to a just, durable and comprehensive peace in the Middle East,
and said it also supports the "land for peace" principle guiding
the peace process between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The conference was opened here on Sunday by Jordanian King
Abdullah Bin Hussein, and its next session is expected to be held
in October in Jakarta, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The IPU, founded in 1889 and now with 144 members, is the
largest international parliamentary organization, and its biannual
conference serves as the biggest venue for parliamentary diplomacy.

<HEADLINE> Virus Hits 10,000 Computers in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The "I Love You" virus has hit up to 10,
000 computers in Italy and is still blocking systems at the Rome-
based United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, experts
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to early estimates from the information technology
security expert Fulvio Berghella, the impact of the virus in Italy
was not as devastating as in the United States where 60 percent to
80 percent of computers are said to have been infected.
</P>
<P>
Berghella said firms of all types and numerous individuals had
been hit by the virus, unable to resist the temptation of opening
a file with such an attractive name.
</P>
<P>
Anti-virus experts are at work all over Italy trying to repair
the damage caused by "I Love You", which destroys all files of a
certain length.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile at FAO all computers were down Friday, forcing it to
fall back on faxes and telephones to communicate with the world.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Not to Increase Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Mexico will not increase its oil
production during the next two months, despite pressures exerted
in the international market to make the price of crude descend
even more, said the Energy Ministry of this country on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that the agreement related to the price of
crude made with Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Norway, would continue
until June 30.
</P>
<P>
Mexico will maintain this position, despite the United States
blackmail against the crude producing nations, with the firm
conviction that the price will be maintained above the 20 dollars
per barrel during the upcoming summer.
</P>
<P>
Mexico raised its oil output from April 1 by 125,000 barrels a
day after two years of the adoption of an agreement with the other
three countries, which made it recover in 1999 the international
prices of the product.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that after this determination taken jointly
with the oil producing countries, a renegotiation will be achieved
as a formula to prevent new jumps or "rebounds" that will take
again the quotations down the undesirable slide.
</P>
<P>
It said that with the present very low levels of inventories,
anything might send the prices soaring, and for that reason Saudi
Arabia, Venezuela, and Mexico have said that a bigger flow of oil
in the market is necessary.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Urges Additional Support for Drought Victims in Horn of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) on Friday urged government and individual donors to
continue giving generously to drought victims in the Horn of
Africa, saying that millions of dollars of additional support is
needed to save the lives of children this summer and to lessen the
impact of future drought.
</P>
<P>
"I urge both individual and government donors to give
generously, and to give now," said Carol Bellamy, Executive
Director of UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
"Every new relief undertaking must be funded before it can
begin, and that makes every day critical," she said.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy also urged donors to remember that, in addition to
Ethiopia, five other countries in the region -- Djibouti, Eritrea,
Kenya, Somalia and Sudan -- are also affected by the drought,
emphasizing that each one is in need of rapid international
assistance.
</P>
<P>
In addition to food, Bellamy stressed the importance of health
and water assistance.

<HEADLINE> British, Irish PMs Intensify N.Irish Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern were to keep talking with
Northern Ireland's main political parties as efforts to break the
peace process deadlock intensified.
</P>
<P>
The decision to keep talking has been taken after a day of
hectic activity at the venue, Hillsborough Castle, south of
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Blair said he believed there was a genuine desire by the
parties involved to move the process forward.
</P>
<P>
He admitted it would not be easy but insisted the will to make
things work was still there.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the terms have got to be right for all parties but I
think the desire to get it done is very strong," he said.
</P>
<P>
His comments followed a second day of talks which involved Sinn
Fein, Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and the Ulster
Unionist Party.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman confirmed that Blair spoke by telephone
with U.S. President Bill Clinton to update him about the talks on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Both Blair and Ahern were in Hillsborough for meetings with the
pro-agreement parties.
</P>
<P>
They met the smaller pro-agreement parties on Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Since Northern Ireland devolution was suspended on February 11,
both governments' meetings with the parties have been overshadowed
by an unbroken impasse between the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein
over IRA arms and power sharing.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams and SDLP leader John Hume both
called on the prime minister to restore the power-sharing
institutions before their party delegations held separate meetings
with Blair and Ahern.
</P>
<P>
Blair should make it clear he is restoring the institutions and
going ahead with the forward implementation of this agreement,"
said Adams.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Hillsborough, leader of the Ulster Unionists David
Trimble said he was still waiting to hear from republicans that
they will decommission their weapons.
</P>
<P>
"The question was put to them by Seamus Mallon (SDLP) in
January when he said 'Tell us if you're going to do it, tell us
when you're going to do it. What we're saying in the same spirit
is tell us what you're prepared to do," he said.
</P>
<P>
No-one was expecting a breakthrough before the "deadline" of
May 22, by which date, according to the Good Friday Agreement, all
parties should have made their best efforts to ensure
decommissioning takes place.

NEW YORK, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose on bargain-
hunting Friday as investors ignored more signs of hot U.S. economy
which could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates
again.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 165.37 at 10,577.86 and
the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 96.58 at 3,816.82.

<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index rose 23.06 at 1,432.63.

composite fell 43.84 points during the week.
