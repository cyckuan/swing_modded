<P>
SINGAPORE, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Long has said his country needs to thoroughly re-examine
its strategy and competitiveness so as to tide over the current
economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with unionists Monday, he said Singapore must
change policies where necessary and strengthen its competitiveness
in order to weather the current economic storm and prosper once
again.
</P>
<P>
As the whole country is facing a real test resulting from
regional economic crisis, he said, there is a need to change the
mindset of workers despite the country has ample reserves, a sound
economy and good tripartite relations.
</P>
<P>
"Workers not only need skills but also must be prepared to take
on shift duties," he said.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, many well paying jobs would continue to go to
skilled foreign workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the unionists to use the crisis as a chance to bond a
new generation of Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Seeks Elimination of Probation for Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
called on Congress Monday to enact measures designed to strengthen
and intensify the government's drive against illicit drugs and
other crimes.
</P>
<P>
In his first State of the Nation Address at the inaugural
session of the 11th Congress, Estrada said he wants, among other
things, the deletion of a provision in the Dangerous Drugs Act
that grants probation to offenders.
</P>
<P>
"I propose that Congress amend the Dangerous Drugs Act to
eliminate the possibility of probation for all offenders, even if
they say they are sorry. The only place for a drug dealer and the
addict is together in jail," he said.
</P>
<P>
To boost the government's battle against other lawless
elements, the chief executive also said Congress should amend the
Philippine National Police (PNP) Law so that police control will
devolve to the local government units.
</P>
<P>
Estrada expressed confidence that the devolved PNP will be more
effective in dealing with crimes within their areas of
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive also took the opportunity to defend the
creation of the Presidential Task Force Against Organized Crime,
saying it is needed to "hit crime, and hit it hard, so as to put
it out decisively."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ministry Says More Disaster Relief Work Is Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China's Civil Affairs Ministry
today asked local governments in flood-hit areas in southern China
to make better arrangements for their victims.
</P>
<P>
From mid-June to early July, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong,
Zhejiang, and Sichuan provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region and other areas south of the Yangtze River have been hit by
heavy rainfalls, causing floods and killing a number of people and
causing serious property losses.
</P>
<P>
More serious flooding has hit provinces on the middle and lower
reaches of the Yangtze and parts of northern China have entered
the flood season, while coastal areas in southeastern China are
being threatened by typhoons. The situation is very serious, the
Ministry says.
</P>
<P>
Governments in flood-hit areas need to try to provide
sufficient food, clothing, shelter, and medical supplies for
people in their areas, and should focus on moving people from
flood-stricken areas and providing shelter, the Ministry said. It
and the Ministry of Finance have already spent more than 300
million yuan (36 million U.S. dollars) on relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
It also said that civil affairs departments need to work on
preventing an outbreak of epidemic diseases. None has been
reported in disaster-stricken areas so far, but there is still a
great risk because of poor living conditions and the large number
of people in flooded areas.

<HEADLINE> Chuan Pledges to Give Tourism All Possible Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
pledged Monday that his government will give the country's tourism
industry all possible assistance.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said that his government will do everything possible to
ensure that the industry receives all possible assistance in its
efforts to facilitate the national recovery and save Thai jobs.
</P>
<P>
Chuan made the remarks at a rewarding ceremony during which the
Thai tourism industry rewarded its best and brightest with a
series awards and commendations designed to encourage innovation
and sensitive development of the industry, the country's biggest
foreign currency earner.
</P>
<P>
The list of award-winners includes villages, national parks,
arts and culture centers, universities, museums and attractions
which have worked hard to improve their standards and product
quality to cater to both domestic and international tourists.
</P>
<P>
Awards were also given to tour operators, diplomats, university
professors, company chiefs and journalists who have played a major
role in promoting the Thai tourism industry over the years.
</P>
<P>
The awards reflect a desire of the Tourism Authority of
Thailand (TAT) to develop new products that can encourage visitors
to stay longer and spend more in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thailand launched an "Amazing Thailand" campaign during 1998
and 1999, setting a target of 16 million foreign tourist arrivals
and 580 billion baht (14.5 billion U.S. dollars) income.
</P>
<P>
The government hoped that the boost of tourism will bring the
country its most-needed foreign currencies after the massive
foreign investment outflow following the outbreak of the financial
and economic crisis last July.

<HEADLINE> Greece: U.S. Officials' Statements Not in Harmony with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Greece said Monday that recent
statements made by U.S. officials were not in harmony with the
U.N. resolutions concerning the settlement of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that relations between Greece and the United
States were "at a good level," but there was room for further
improvement.
</P>
<P>
Good relations between countries must be based on mutual
respect, plain speech and a common understanding of issues of
mutual interest, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. initiative on the Cyprus issue had begun with a high
tone and the cultivation of expectations, he said, adding that
Washington would now decide at what pace the initiative develops.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that Greece would always express
objections when it perceived that there was a lack of sincerity
and the initiative did not reflect overall U.N. stances.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Reppas complained that the international community
had been lacking in not responding to Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides' proposal for the demilitarization of Cyprus while
pressures had not been brought to bear on neighboring Turkey to
make it comply with the demands of the international community.
</P>
<P>
He said that anyone who approaches the Cyprus problem solely
from the viewpoint of Nicosia's plans to deploy the Russian-made
S-300 anti-aircraft missile was either totally ignorant of history
or had other designs in mind.

<HEADLINE> Talks on Southern African Customs Union Going </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Negotiations to resolve
issues relating to the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) were
proceeding in good faith despite their complexity, South African
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki has said.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing leaders from the 14 Southern African
Development Community (SADC) countries at an international dialog
forum in Swakopmund, a coastal city of Namibia, South African
Press Association (SAPA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are, all of us as members of the customs union, very keen
to move forward with that process," Mbeki said Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
"It is complicated because it also relates to the future of
the SADC, which also has to relate to the negotiations with the
European Union (EU). It is wrong to pretend that it is possible
to answer any of those questions easily."
</P>
<P>
He said discussions on the customs issue had proceeded slowly,
but everyone involved had acted in good faith in dealing with
complex questions.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted insiders in the SACU negotiations as saying that
South Africa controlled almost everything and secretly decided
how much each member country should receive. This, they said,
was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
SACU members draw a large portion of their total revenue from
the customs union pool. All SACU members -- Namibia, Botswana,
Lesotho, Swaziland and South Africa -- belong to SADC.
</P>
<P>
SADC countries are negotiating the establishment of a free
trade area, which would threaten the existence of the SACU. Other
SADC member countries desire a relaxation of laws and regulations
governing the customs union to allow them a reasonable share of
profits.
</P>
<P>
The customs union's existence has also been threatened by free
trade negotiations between South Africa and the EU as massive
inflow of cheap EU exports would hurt economies of other SACU
countries.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Calls for Unity in Overcoming Economic Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
Monday appealed to all sectors to help his administration in
crafting quick and effective solutions to the country's nagging
problems.
</P>
<P>
In his first state of the nation address, Estrada plumbed the
depth of the nation's woes and offered reforms to slam the brakes
on the economic downturn and handcuff criminals and corrupt
government officials who helped push the country to the edge.
</P>
<P>
Speaking mostly in Filipino, he begged for time and
understanding, and offered a covenant of unity with the people so
that together they can tackle the problems that threaten to
undermine his campaign pledge help the poor.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also stressed that contrary to earlier statistics, the
country's poor has become poorer, and the rich has become richer
while the economy is drowning in red ink, with a 2.3-trillion-peso
(about 54.76 billion U.S. dollars) public sector tab, 70-billion
peso (about 1.67 billion dollars) budget deficit, double digit
inflation, and swelling unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
But the immensity of the problems neither means that the
government is helpless against them nor that the people are
powerless to help tackle them, he said.
</P>
<P>
He credited his predecessor, former president Ramos, for the
economic reforms that enabled the country to continue posting
positive growth while neighbors in the region registered negative
gross national product (GNP).
</P>
<P>
Despite the "formidable odds" arrayed by the regionwide
economic turmoil, he said he expected economic growth, as the GNP
is targeted to expand by 2 to 3 percent this year and inflation is
kept in the single digit, at around 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Faced with mounting woes, Estrada underscored the need to
undertake measures to cut spending, raise revenues and stamp out
graft and corruption.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the congress to give him the authority to
reorganize the government to make it truly effective, efficient,
responsive and accountable.
</P>
<P>
As to the peace and order problem, he said it is time to mount
an all-out war against criminals whose nefarious activities have
scared away investors.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Won Gains Strength Against Greenback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean won strengthened to
1,211 against the U.S. dollar since last December when the country
was gripped by a financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Opening at 1,245 against the dollar Monday, the won appreciated
to 1,208 in the morning and closed the day at 1,211.
</P>
<P>
The won, which closed at 1,695 at the end of last year and
traded at around 1,400 won for months, lost more than 40 percent
of its value in the wake the financial crisis caused by corporate
bankruptcies and bad loans of financial institutions last year.
</P>
<P>
After reaching 1,695 won against the dollar, the won gradually
found strength at 1,525 at the end of January this year, 1,383 at
the end of March, 1,373 at the end of June, and to 1,245 over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Observers attribute the won's appreciation to an abundance of
dollars on the market stemming from current account surpluses and
the introduction of foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
If this trend continues, it will be easy to break the 1,200 won
level against the greenback in the immediate future, they said.
</P>
<P>
South Korean exporters have expressed worries that the won's
renewed strength might damage the country's exports, prompting
speculation on possible government intervention.
</P>
<P>
However, the Ministry of Finance and Economy recently denied
the rumors saying the government would leave the fate of the won
to market forces.

to a peaceful settlement," South African Press Association (SAPA)
quoted Modise as saying.
</P>
<P>
Modise said a renewed civil war in Angola would affect the
entire southern African region and that South Africa was
extremely concerned about the worsening situation in that
country.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister added that another war in Angola would
also exacerbate the refugee problem in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"There are already two million refugees, some from as far as
Somalia, in South Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to repeated reports of the illegal trafficking of
weapons and supplies to Angola's warring parties, Modise said
that his government would do its utmost to thwart gun-running
from South Africa to Angola.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that none of our people are involved in this kind of
thing and if any are, they face very heavy sentences," he warned.
</P>
<P>
The latest setback to the Angolan peace process came with the
recent massacre of about 200 villagers in Angola's Lunda Norte
province.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government blamed the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) for the attack, but UNITA denied
it, saying that the massacre was the result of the tension
between the Angolans and the foreign diamond traffickers.

<HEADLINE> International Observers Happy With Election Proceeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 27 (Xinhua) -- International observers,
monitoring the Cambodian election, said Monday that the voting was
basically free and fair, fueling hopes that the election could be
a success.
</P>
<P>
Cambodians went to polls en masse on Sunday to vote in historic
elections that are expected to give the country a second chance
for peace, stability and a legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian National Election Committee (NEC) reported a
massive voter turnout of more than 90 percent, a much higher
figure than expected.
</P>
<P>
Glenys Kinnock, the European Union's chief observer, said she
was pleasantly surprised at the turnout, given reports of voter
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
"There was an enormous enthusiasm by the voters ... The crush
was fantastic," said Kinnock, who visited polling stations in
Kandal, Kompong Speu and Takeo provinces. "As always, the people
surprise you."
</P>
<P>
International monitors reported few cases of violence, ballot
stuffing or serious intimidation, she said, adding that reports
"generally have been favorable."
</P>
<P>
But she warned that "it's not time for euphoria either." She
said the counting process and acceptance of the results are still
to come. "Now we go on to the next hurdle, the next series of
hurdles."
</P>
<P>
Partial results are expected as early as late Monday, with the
ruling Cambodian People's Party, the ousted Funcinpec, and the
upstart Sam Rainsy Party all hoping to lead what most expect will
be another coalition government.

<HEADLINE> Prolonged Slump Expected for South Korea's Export Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 27 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's export industries,
except auto and semiconductor exporters, will see a protracted
slump by the end of this year, the Korea Chamber of Commerce and
Industry (KCCI) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Exports by the steel industry are expected to fall 5.8 percent
in the second half of this year due to a series of bankruptcies by
local steel makers.
</P>
<P>
On a yearly basis, the nation's steel production will likely
mark its first negative growth by falling 12.7 percent, said the
KCCI.
</P>
<P>
Production of general machinery and construction sector orders
in the second half will also decline by 24.5 percent and 59.6
percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, eight out of the nation's 10 major private think
tanks, which serve as research institutes for conglomerates, said
in a poll that it would be impossible for the nation to attain a
trade surplus of 50 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, as targeted by
the Federation of Korean Industries, a club of family-run chaebols.
</P>
<P>
The think tanks attribute the prolonged economic slump to a
credit crunch stemming from financial restructuring, which they
say will worsen the business climate.
</P>
<P>
The Hyundai Research Institute said that up to one million more
workers will lose jobs this year and South Korea would not be able
to return to a per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) of 10,000
U.S. dollars and an annual GDP growth of 5 percent even by 2002 if
no measures were taken.
</P>
<P>
However, the KCCI, in its business forecast for the second half
of 1998, said the nation's semiconductor exports in the second
half of this year will soar 41.2 percent, based on stable
international prices of 16- and 64-mega DRAMs and brisk Christmas
sales.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, South Korean auto manufacturers are expected
to increase exports 31.1 percent from the first half of this year
and 19.6 percent from a year earlier because of rising exports of
new models.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Holds Talks With Eritrean President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Eritrean President Isaias Afworki
arrived in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria Monday for
talks with President Hosni Mubarak on the worsening border row in
the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to the Middle East News Agency, the talks of the two
president in the Ras el-Teen Palace will focus on ways to resolve
the border dispute between Eritrea and Ethiopia, and on the Middle
East peace process stalemate as well.
</P>
<P>
Afworki had exchanged views with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
in Tripoli before coming to Cairo to continue his multi-leg
African tour.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean president, who had sent two messages to Mubarak in
June, is expected to seek an active role from the Egyptian leader
in halting the developing Ethiopia-Eritrea border conflict.
</P>
<P>
Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile Weldensae, after meeting with
Mubarak on June 14, told reporters that Mubarak "promised to do
his best and contact the Ethiopian side in order to reach a
ceasefire between the two parties and to bring about a peaceful
solution."
</P>
<P>
But recent remarks by Egyptian officials suggested that Cairo
is not going to spearhead the mediation effort despite repeated
appeals from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Marawan Badr, the Egyptian ambassador to Ethiopia, last week
said Cairo supported and participated in an Organization of
African Unity (OAU) resolution on the conflict during its recent
summit in Burkina Faso, and denied the Cairo has launched a new
initiative.
</P>
<P>
The OAU has sent four African presidents, of Burkina Faso,
Djibouti, Zimbabwe and Rwanda, to Ethiopia and Eritrea in a
renewed effort to end the hostilities.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is adopting a neutral stand vis-a-vis the dispute due to
the importance of its ties with both countries," Badr said in an
interview with "Ethiopian Herald" last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea have accused each other of incursions
since bloody clashes broke out over a 400 square kilometer rocky
triangle of land along their western border.
</P>
<P>
The conflict deteriorated recently, dashing the hope that
U.S.-led mediation would bring about a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak had sent messages to the two countries' leaders,
calling for an immediate end to fighting, and negotiations to
resolve the border row.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea and Ethiopia, among the world's poorest, are at odds
over at least six areas along their common border. Eritrea gained
independence from Ethiopia in 1993.

GENEVA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Swiss rider Laurent Dufaux, who was
banned from the Tour de France for doping, confessed on Monday
that he took performance-enhancing hormone EPO for three years.
</P>
<P>
"I took it for three years under strict medical supervision.
But I never abused it," Dufaux said in an interview with Swiss
daily Le Matin.
</P>
<P>
Dufaux, who was fourth in the 1996 Tour de France, and four of
his Festina teammates have admitted taking banned substances to
improve their performance, and the team director Bruno Roussel
confirmed they took part in an systematic doping.
</P>
<P>
The Tour de France then banned Festina riders to compete in
the race, including Alex Zulle, Armin Meier, Richard Virenque,
etc., though some of them denied taking dopes.
</P>
<P>
Dufaux said doping problem is much beyond people's thinkings,
but the cycling authority would make the confessed five scapegoats
rather than take more fierce measure to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
"I am afraid people will put a lid over the five who have
confessed, that they will be sanctioned and that nothing will
change," Dufaux said.

Cao wrote to the Italians about saving the tower when he
thought that he'd got the answer and said that all methods used
until now had been wrong, including putting lead casts in the
basement.

environment-related projects.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, said on Monday that it will use the fund for nature
conservation and environment demonstration projects.

Out of the 192 applications for nature conservation funds, the
commission chose 85 projects for this year's funding, 25 projects
more than last year.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the type of projects has shifted in the

types and species.
</P>
<P>
The commission also received 634 demonstration applications and
sorted out 116 projects for the fund.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration projects focus on waste treatment and
recycling, water issues, land use planning, air-related problems
and noise pollution.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be managed by the commission's financial
instrument, LIFE, which provides aid for the environment
throughout the European Union and in bordering regions as well.

<HEADLINE> PNA Welcomes Egyptian-Syrian Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Monday expressed welcome to Sunday's summit between Egypt
and Syria, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Redina, spokesman for PNA President Yasser Arafat,
told the news agency in a telephone interview that Palestinians
welcome the coordination between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Assad held a meeting on Sunday in Egypt's
Mediterranean port city of Alexandria on the latest developments
of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Redina said the Palestinians desire to maintain a unified
Palestinian-Syrian stance on the Arab-Israeli peace talks, and the
PNA is in constant contact with Arab leaders in a bid to adopt a
unified Arab stand to confront Israeli intransigence.
</P>
<P>
He said Arafat will address the upcoming ministerial meetings
of the Jerusalem Committee of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, to be held in Morocco on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have called on the committee to help maintain
the status of the holy city against Israel's judaization schemes.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, Redina said the
negotiations between the two sides last week yielded "nothing new"
regarding Israel's attitude towards a United States proposal on
its troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly called on Israel to withdraw from 13.1
percent more of the West Bank. The PNA has accepted the proposal,
but the Jewish state resisted it.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman denied there is any arrangement for a meeting
between Arafat and Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai or
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Arafat insists such a meeting depends on Israel's acceptance of
the U.S. proposal, he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Launches Investigation on Mobile Phone Service Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission announced
on Monday an in-depth investigation into mobile phone service
prices in eight member states.
</P>
<P>
Stefan Rating, spokesman for European Competition Commissioner
Karel van Miert, told the press that it was not an infringement
procedure but only an investigation.
</P>
<P>
He said the commission wants to suggest a benchmark for
cost-effectiveness for mobile phone services after the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union (EU), decided on the investigation after conducting an
inquiry into high mobile communications prices in all member
states.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 questionnaires sent out earlier this year indicated
the possibility of excessive or discriminatory prices.
</P>
<P>
The eight member states involved are Belgium, Ireland, Britain,
Austria, Spain, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Suspense Arises Over Election Outcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 27 (Xinhua) -- As ballot counting began amid
reports of unexpectedly high voter turnout in Sunday's election,
suspense arose over whether the vote would lead to another
coalition or political deadlock in strife-stricken Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Three main parties vying to control the new National Assembly
were set to split the vote and no single party would be likely to
obtain an outright majority to form a government, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Co-Premier Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party (CPP),
the Funcinpec party of the rival first-premier he ousted last
year, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and the party of former finance
minister Sam Rainsy, which bears his name, were expected to become
the backbone of Cambodia's politics after the election.
</P>
<P>
But for a party to form a government, it needs a two-thirds
majority in the 122-member National Assembly, or 82 seats, which
is an unrealistically high figure in the eyes of many observers.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the election appears certain to result in a
coalition government, which is only a year after the last one
collapsed in violence.
</P>
<P>
The CPP was expected to become the largest party in the
assembly and would have to form a coalition with either Funcinpec
or the Sam Rainsy Party, or possibly even both, with the CPP
naming the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The CPP has ruled Cambodia since the early 1980s and is
believed to enjoy strong support in the countryside. With control
over the armed forces, police, judiciary and media, the party
apparently maintains an upper hand in the political field in a
country where democracy is having a hard time taking root.
</P>
<P>
But Funcinpec and the Sam Rainsy Party are also forces to be
reckoned with. The factors that led to Funcinpec winning most
seats in Cambodia's last election in 1993 are still at work,
analysts said. Funcinpec can also count on a solid base of royal
sentiment among the masses.
</P>
<P>
The Sam Rainsy Party, a strong opponent of corruption and an
advocate for human rights, also enjoys much support, particularly
among the youth.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts are betting on a coalition between Funcinpec and
the CPP as the most likely possibility. But Prince Ranariddh told
Xinhua that he would never work again in a government led by the
CPP, making the viability of such an alliance doubtful.
</P>
<P>
A more pessimistic scenario foresees a breakdown in coalition
talks and an ensuing political deadlock. A Western diplomat
pointed to the possibility of a constitutional crisis if a major
party obstructs the 70 percent quorum required to convene the
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The chance of a constitutional crisis does exist because of
this absurd situation of a two-thirds quorum, said the diplomat.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to dismiss fears over post-election violence by the
CPP if it failed to secure political power in the election, Hun
Sen told reporters he would quit politics if the CPP did not win.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome, international observers monitoring the
voting have expressed satisfaction over the election which has
been peaceful, contrary to previous predictions about its
disruption and reports of voter intimidation.
</P>
<P>
"Cambodia has undergone great changes as the political struggle
has tilted towards elections instead of the force of arms," said
Karen Hill, a member of the Joint International Observers
Group. "There is reason to be optimistic about Cambodia's future."

<HEADLINE> Floods Hit Wuyuan, Leping in Jiangxi Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Floods from torrential rains that
lasted for one week have severely stricken the Wuyuan County and
Leping city along the Le'an River in east China's Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
About 28 townships and 60 percent of the residents in Wuyuan
County were affected by the floods, which have destroyed more than
12,000 houses and reduced the local early-rice output by half.
</P>
<P>
The area reported record-high rainfalls, and lasting heavy
rains triggered mud flow and pushed the water level in the Le'an
River to 2.65 meters above the warning level, according to local
governments.
</P>
<P>
Water-swollen Le'an River also posed severe damage to the
Leping City on the lower reaches of the river. Floods have
inundated eight townships in the area and put 180,000 people in
danger.
</P>
<P>
The rising floods have damaged about 129.6 kilometers of flood
barriers around the Leping City, and breached some of the dikes.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 1,116 industrial enterprises in Leping have
broken down due to the suspension of transportation and power
supply.

services to small and medium-sized industries in Iran as of July
28.

and land transportation between the two sides to address the
growing trade relations.

BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen college students left
Beijing today for the Hoh Xil Area in northwest China's Qinghai
Province to work for the environment near the source of the
Yangtze River, the State Environmental Protection Administration
reports.

COLOMBO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) began a two-day
meeting here Monday, continuing to review the progress in regional
economic cooperation and preparing the agenda for the grouping's
summit.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are discussing the provisional agenda for the
SAARC summit slated for July 29-31 and also its draft declaration.
</P>
<P>
They are also discussing a number of reports and draft
guidelines on the issues of food security, information,
telecommunications, visa exemption and SAARC's cooperation with
international and other regional organizations.
</P>
<P>
The agenda of the foreign ministers' meeting also includes the
arrangement for their informal meeting in New York during this
year's United Nations General Assembly and informal dialogue with
the European Union.

NEW DELHI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- India's Ministry of
Non-Conventional Energy would soon implement a 15-year renewable
energy program to augment grid electricity supply and substitute
fossil fuels in decentralized applications, said a report issued
by the ministry here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The country-wide program aims at achieving a 10 percent share
of renewable energy in the total installed capacity for grid
electricity by the year 2012. It is proposed to provide
electricity by means of solar, biomass, small hydro and wind
energy to all 80,000 non-electrified villages and households in a
phased manner by 2012, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It also aims at improving the quality of energy supply to rural
areas for bringing about an all round development through the
integrated rural energy program which would be expanded to cover
all blocks of the country by 2012.
</P>
<P>
The renewable program would address issues relating to

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges South Korea to Allow Ousted Diplomat Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 27 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will be able to settle
its diplomatic dispute with Russia if it allows Oleg Abramkin, an
ousted Russian counselor, to return to the Russian Embassy in
Seoul, a Russian diplomat said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"To put an end to the diplomatic conflict, Seoul should make
this kind of symbolic gesture of reconciliation," Valery Suhinin,
minister-counselor of the Russian Embassy in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Suhinin said that Abramkin was a victim of a diplomatic
dispute, insisting that the expelled Russian did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
South Korean intelligence officers claimed they have evidence
Abramkin went beyond his diplomatic status in collecting sensitive
intelligence in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The Russian diplomat's ouster came three days after Moscow's
expulsion of Cho Sung-woo, a counselor of the South Korean Embassy
in Moscow, on spy charges on July 4 this year.
</P>
<P>
If Abramkin, who had been scheduled to return to Russia in
September this year, is allowed to stay until then, Suhinin said,
the diplomatic conflict will be settled.
</P>
<P>
"Without Abramkin's reinstatement, the case will remain a
thorny issue blocking the improvement of relations between the two
countries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Suhinin said that Russia does not intend to take advantage of
the diplomatic row, or to put pressure on South Korea to make some
concessions on pending issues.
</P>
<P>
During the ASEAN Regional Forum, South Korean Foreign Minister
Park Chung-soo and his Russian counterpart Yevgeni Primakov met in
Manila, the Philippines, on Sunday to discuss the diplomatic
row. They failed to narrow their differences. Primakov reportedly
insisted that South Korea allow Abramkin to return to Seoul, but
Park refused.
</P>
<P>
Before the diplomatic conflict, the two countries enjoyed good
relations since the establishment of full diplomatic ties in
1990.

<P>
HONG KONG, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Secretary for Security of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Peter Lai Hing-ling
resigned here Monday for personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
Lai, who joined the civil service in 1973, told a media session
Monday that he made the decision entirely for his own personal
reasons.
"I wish to spend more time with my family who, as some of you may

<P>
The SAR government announced Monday that the Central People's
Government has, on the nomination and recommendation of the Chief
Executive, appointed Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, as Secretary for
Security to succeed Peter Lai. Ip, 47, is now Director of
Immigration.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa said Monday that he regretted
that Peter Lai would leave the Civil Service shortly but respected
Lai's personal decision.
</P>
<P>
Tung praised Lai for his "significant contributions to the Hong
Kong SAR" and said, "We have established a good working
relationship over the past year."
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive also expressed full confidence in Lai's
successor, Regina Ip, who, he believed, is highly suited for the

<HEADLINE> ARF Ends Meeting After Discussions on Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)
ended its annual meeting here Monday afternoon after discussions
on security issues of the Asia-Pacific region cooperation between
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its
dialogue partners.
</P>
<P>
In a closing statement issued at the end of the meeting, this
year's ARF chairman and Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs
Domingo Siazon said the participating ministers "exchanged views
on issues which have great bearing on the security environment of
the Asia-Pacific."
</P>
<P>
"We held productive dialogue on the various issues confronting
our region today and had a deeper and more intensive appreciation
of these issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers discussed "extensively" the prevailing financial
situation in the region and exchanged views on the factors that
caused the crisis and on how they should cooperate more closely in
meeting the challenges posed by it, according to Siazon.
</P>
<P>
Calling the one-day meeting "very productive," the statement
said, "once again we have proven that peace and security in our
region is indivisible and can be advanced through active dialogue
and coordination."
</P>
<P>
"As we conclude the Fifth ASEAN Regional Forum," Siazon said in
the statement, "I can say that all of us have contributed to the
evolution of the ARF as a process for building trust and
confidence, for creating a favorable climate for peace and
understanding and for fostering the habit of consultation."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it has been proven since the first meeting
in Bangkok in 1994 that "the ARF works and it has evolved as a
mechanism for addressing regional peace and security issues while
at the same time bridging gaps in the diverse interests of its
participants."
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting were foreign ministers or representatives
from the nine ASEAN member countries, the two observer nations and
the 10 dialogue partners.
</P>
<P>
Siazon noted that "exuding a spirit of commitment to see the
entire Asia-Pacific region working toward peace and security, we
welcomed the participation of Mongolia in the ARF."
</P>
<P>
"With the entry of Mongolia into the forum, we take another
step toward completing the geographical footprint of the ARF," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed welcome to Japan's assurances that Japan will
revitalize its economy and those of Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan that the value of the Chinese currency will be maintained.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the ARF's future direction, Siazon said, "We
acknowledged that decision-making by consensus is as valid then as
it is today."
</P>
<P>
A chairman statement was also issued at the end of the meeting,
spelling out the ARF's positions on issues ranging from Cambodian
elections to nuclear tests in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The ARF, which held its first meeting in Bangkok four years
ago, is now attended by the ASEAN's members including Brunei,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam; its 10 dialogue partners -- Australia,
Canada, China, the European Union, India, Japan, New Zealand,
Russia, South Korea and the United States -- and its two observers
Cambodia and Papua New Guinea.

<HEADLINE> ARF Optimistic Over Asia's Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers participating
in the 5th ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) Monday expressed optimism
that confidence in Asia would quickly return as the financial
crisis-hit economies carry out the necessary structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
"They (the ministers) expressed optimism that, as the affected
economies implement the necessary structural reforms, confidence
would increasingly return," Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo
Siazon said in the ARF chairman statement issued after the forum.
</P>
<P>
Siazon, who is currently the rotating chairman of the ARF, said
that the ministers discussed extensively the region's prevailing
financial situation and they were encouraged by initial signs of
progress toward financial stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also expressed full confidence that the economies
of East Asia would eventually regain their position as among the
fastest-growing economies in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting the interdependence among Asian economies, the ministers
welcomed the assurances of Japan that it will revitalize its
economy as well as the assurances of China that the value of the
yuan will be maintained.
</P>
<P>
While recognizing the need for structural reforms in restoring
confidence, Siazon said, the ministers called for a balanced
approach in addressing the socio-economic impact of such reforms,
particularly its impact on the less privileged sectors of society.
</P>
<P>
The ministers noted that certain aspects of the regional
financial crisis could have impact on the peace and security of
the region and agreed that the ARF would have an important role to
play in addressing these effects.
</P>
<P>
The ARF participants also agreed that the current Asian
economic difficulties should not undermine the process of the ARF
and other regional security dialogues and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The ARF was attended by the foreign ministers from the nine
ASEAN member countries and the 10 ASEAN dialogue partners, and
representatives from the two ASEAN observer nations of Cambodia

<HEADLINE> ARF Supports Peace Process on Korean Peninsula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The 5th ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) Regional Forum (ARF) Monday expressed its
"full and continued" support for the peace talks between the
Republic of Korea (ROK) and the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
"The ministers (participating in the forum) reiterated their
full and continued support for the talks and the KEDO (Korean
Energy Development Organization) project to help establish a
durable peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and promote
global nuclear non-proliferation," said Philippine Foreign
Secretary Domingo Siazon in the ARF chairman statement.
</P>
<P>
In the statement issued at the end of the one-day forum,
Siazon, currently holding the rotating ARF's chairmanship, said
that in view of the current financial difficulties that the KEDO
is facing, the forum called for more international contribution to
this organization.
</P>
<P>
During the annual ministerial forum, Siazon said, the ministers
welcomed the resumption of official dialogue between the ROK and
the DPRK in Beijing and the launching of the Four-Party Talks
Peace Process on the Korean Peninsula in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The forum also emphasized the vital importance of the
inter-Korean dialogue in promoting reconciliation and cooperation
between the ROK and the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The peace process on the Korean Peninsula was one of the topics
tackled by the ARF which also included the nuclear arms race in
South Asia, the prolonged Asian financial crisis, and regional
security environment.
</P>
<P>
The ARF was attended by the foreign ministers from the nine
ASEAN member countries and the 10 ASEAN dialogue partners, as well

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Slides Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Uncertainty over economic reforms
in Japan overwhelmed the Australian dollar Monday, causing it to
close almost three quarters of a U.S. cent lower.
</P>
<P>
At the end of trading in Sydney the local currency was buying
61.20 U.S. cents from 61.92 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The news on Friday that Keizo Obuchi had won the race to be
leader of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) did little
to placate market participants.
</P>
<P>
Movements in the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen exchange rate will
hinge on such news and likewise the fate of the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
Concerns over the Japanese yen has resulted in investment bank
Salomon Smith Barney downgrading its third quarter forecast for
the Australian dollar to 60.00 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
In the foreign exchange market, the Australian dollar closed at
86.95 yen from 87.47 and at 1.0879 German marks from 1.1056 here
last.

such testing and urged them to sign the Treaty on the

countries "to refrain from undertaking weaponization or deploying
missiles to deliver nuclear weapons and to prevent any transfer of
nuclear weapon-related materials, technology and equipment to
third countries."

Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapons Free Zone in enhancing peace and
security in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-one foreign ministers
attending the ASEAN annual meetings here Monday expressed their
support for the "generally peaceful" elections in Cambodia Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers welcomed the huge voter turnout in the July 26,

Regional Forum (ARF).
</P>
<P>
They expressed the hope that the next stages of counting
ballots and the proclamation of the winners will also be peaceful

<HEADLINE> More People Killed in Flood in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from flood has risen
to 110 in Bangladesh as of Monday with the number of
flood-affected people going up to 11 million, Jawadul Karim, press
secretary to Prime Minister Sheik Hasina, said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 36 flood-hit districts, the situation has deteriorated
in 18 districts, improved in 12 districts, and remained unchanged
in six districts, Karim told a press briefing at the prime
minister's office.
</P>
<P>
The situation is expected to improve in the extreme northern
districts along the Brahmaputra-Jamuna river and in the
southeastern hill basin, but will aggravate in the northwestern
districts along the Ganges river and in the central part of
country in the next 24 hours, according to a bulletin available at
the briefing.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen deaths were reported during the past 24 hours, but
press reports here put the number at 165, with 115,934 acres of
crops washed away or submerged, 2,935 kilometers of road damaged
and 2,500 kilometers of embankments ravaged.
</P>
<P>
Many of the flood victims have been made homeless, with more
than 56,000 evacuated to 133 shelters, the press secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,313 medical teams have been sent to the flood-stricken
areas, where over 7,560 people have caught water-borne diseases
with 7 of them died.
</P>
<P>
The Disaster Management and Relief Ministry on Monday allocated
300 tons of foodgrains and 500,000 taka (about 10,600 U.S.
dollars) in cash for the flood victims, a ministry official said
at the briefing.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has so far granted more than 6.9 million taka
(about 146,700 dollars) in cash and 4,400 tons of foodgrains for
the flood-hit people.
</P>
<P>
Flood is very common in Bangladesh, as 70-80 percent of the
country's annual rainfall concentrates in the July-October monsoon
season.

<HEADLINE> EU Proposes R&AMP;D Association With Candidate Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission requested
authorization from the Council of Ministers of European Union (EU)
on Monday to negotiate the association of candidate countries with
its research and development (R&AMP;D) programs.
</P>
<P>
Associated candidate countries for EU membership will
contribute to the budget of the R&AMP;D programs and in return
participate in the programs on an equal footing with EU member
states. They will enjoy basically the same conditions especially
with regard to funding.
</P>
<P>
Once approval has been obtained from the Council of Ministers,
the commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, will negotiate association with each of the 11 candidate
countries.
</P>
<P>
The candidate countries include 10 central and eastern European
countries and Cyprus. The European Union has invited Poland,
Hungary, the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovenia and Cyprus to start
accession talks.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia are also
applying for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
All the 11 candidate countries have formally informed the
European Commission that they wish association in the R&AMP;D
programs, known as the fifth Framework for Research, Technological
Development and Demonstration for the period between 1998 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
However, commission officials fear the financial contribution
required from the candidate countries could present some
difficulties, though the candidate countries will be offered a
reduction in their contribution in the early years.

the country will grow thanks to the increase of planting acreages
by 2.6 percent, up to 3.663 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
Nontheless, it was predicted that due to the drought in the
south and the floods in central Mozambique, the population
affected will top 245,000, and that 9,000 tons of white maize and
800 tons of vegetables will be needed before the new harvest
season sets in this September.
</P>
<P>
Presently, FAO and WFP is working closely with the Mozambican
government and the non-governmental organizations in the country
to provide relief aid to the victims of the natural calamities.
</P>
<P>
It was also predicted that this year Mozambique can have
59,000 tons of surplus maize in the north for exports to its
neighbors like Malawi.
</P>
<P>
The study estimated that besides, Mozambique has to import
67,000 tons of rice and 145,000 tons of wheat to meet its needs
this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Israelis have demolished 68
Arab homes in the occupied West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem since
the beginning of this year, three times higher than the number for
the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The figures were contained in a Jordanian government report on
Israel's illegal measures and inhuman practices in territories
under its control. The report was handed over Sunday by the
Jordanian Department of Palestinian Affairs to a visiting
U.N. team probing Israel's human rights violation activities in
the occupied Palestinian lands.
</P>
<P>
Israel is continuing its drive to demolish Arab homes, expand
and establish Jewish settlements on the Palestinian lands and
repress Palestinian civilians, said the report which was obtained
by Xinhua here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 320,000 Israelis have settled in the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank, including the Arab East Jerusalem since
1967, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report also included other details about Israel's
confiscation of Arab land, construction of Jewish settlements,
closure of occupied Arab territories and the expansion of
Jerusalem's boundaries.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the department also reviewed Jordan's policy of
supporting the Palestinians while the Middle East peace process is
retreating as a result of Israel's hard-line policy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, John de Saram, head of the three-member U.N. mission
and Sri Lanka's ambassador to the U.N., said that Jordan's report
constitutes an important reference on which the mission will base
its report for the U.N. General Assembly, the semi-official Jordan
Times reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Saram said that the mission had visited a number of countries
in the region to collect information about the Palestinians in the
occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the Israeli government has repeatedly
refused any U.N. fact-finding team's visit to the occupied
territories.

<HEADLINE> Natural Disasters Kill 2,571 People in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A total of 2,571 people have lost
their lives in various natural disasters that hit China in the
first half of the year, the Ministry of Civil Affairs said today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by 26 this month, natural disasters had
afflicted 280 million people in China, among whom some 17.23
million were once cut off from the outside world by the floods.
</P>
<P>
The disasters also destroyed some 3.85 million houses and
harmed the growth of 28.41 million hectares of crops, causing
direct economic losses estimated at 153.1 billion yuan (about 19
billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Civil Affairs, which takes charge of China's
disaster relief, said that this year a variety of natural
disasters, flooding in particular, frequented many parts of the
country, and that the situation was worse than in the same period
over the previous years.
</P>
<P>
In the past several months, disasters ranging from blizzards,
hailstones and frosts to earthquakes, rainstorms and floods have
been reported from many areas across the country.
</P>
<P>
From mid June to early July, a dozen provinces and autonomous
regions south of the Yangtze River, including Jiangxi, Hunan,
Hubei, Fujian, Guangdong and Guangxi, were stricken by serious
flooding caused by unusual heavy rains. Some of them now remain
under the serious threat of new and greater floods as the Yangtze
seems to be reaching the peak of its high-water season.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Civil Affairs said that relevant departments of
the central government have to date allocated 1.58 billion yuan
(about 195 million US dollars) for disaster relief across the
country.
</P>
<P>
By July 26, the ministry had also received 17.82 million yuan
and materials worth 22.45 million yuan in domestic and foreign
donations for disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
All the donated relief materials have been distributed to the
needy people in the disaster-stricken regions according to their
donors' wishes, said the ministry.

<HEADLINE> PLO Official Concerned About Egyptian-French </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official Monday
voiced his concern about the fate of the French-Egyptian
initiative aimed at advancing the Mideast peace process, saying
that Israeli intransigency will stumble the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Farouk Kaddoumi, director of the Political Department of the
Palestine Liberation Organization made the remarks after a meeting
with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa at the Cairo
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The two officials discussed the Egyptian-French initiative and
the coming meeting of Al-Qods (Jerusalem) Committee of the
Organization of Islamic Conference to be held in Casablanca,
Morocco, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The initiative calling for an international conference to
salvage the stalled Mideast peace process was raised in May during
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's visit to Paris.
</P>
<P>
When asked if he is hopeful that the initiative would help move
forward the peace process, Kaddoumi said "it is an attempt, but
the current Israeli stance will foil everything."
</P>
<P>
"There are numerous attempts to revive the stalemated peace
march but as long as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
remains in power all those attempts will be in vain," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that the deadlocked peace march has almost come
to "a dead end."
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi made a stopover here en route to Tunisia from Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
After the morning meeting, Moussa left for Paris for a two-day
visit to discuss with his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine the
details of the French-Egyptian initiative.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been deadlocked for 16
months due to Israel's move to build Jewish settlements in the
Arab East Jerusalem and its intransigent position on redeployment
from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is widely seen as a way to get the peace process
back on track.

<HEADLINE> Iran's New Interior Minister Vows to Safeguard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran's new Interior Minister
Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari Monday vowed to safeguard the public
freedom, saying that freedom is the natural right of Iranian
people.
</P>
<P>
"Freedom is not the thing that the interior ministry can give
to the people, rather a natural right of the people," Lari said at
a sworn-in ceremony held in the interior ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government and the interior ministry were
duty-bound to safeguard the people's right of freedom and prevent
any damage on that.
</P>
<P>
Lari also said his future policy would focus on political and
social development, security and prosperity of cities.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, the interior ministry will encourage the
people's participation by creating necessary conditions and
circumstances in line with the country's constitution and laws, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister underlined the importance of security and
tranquillity in the country, noting that the interior ministry
would make use of all possibilities to maintain security and
tranquillity in the society.
</P>
<P>
All sects should respect each other's views and beliefs, and
learn to peacefully co-exist.
</P>
<P>
Lari, who is also vice president for legal and parliamentary
affairs, praised the sacked Tehran mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi
for his hardworking for the country, expressed the hope that the
verdict on Karbaschi would not cause any negative impact on the
country's leadership.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was sentenced to five years in jail on graft charges
and banned from public office for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony where Karbaschi was also present, former
interior minister Abdollah Nouri said that the country's
administrators and managers should continue their efforts for the
country's progress.
</P>
<P>
Moderate Nouri was impeached by the conservative Majlis
(parliament) on June 21 on charges of issuing inflammatory
statements, using inexperienced managers and inability to maintain
law and order in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, Nouri was soon appointed Vice President for
Development and Social Affairs by moderate President Mohammad
Khatami, showing the president's determination to continue
political and social reforms in the country.

<HEADLINE> UK to Double Aid to Mozambique: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Great Britain will within months
increase its aid to Mozambique from the previous 33 million U.S.
Dollars to 49.5 million, a senior British official has said.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to double the aid to 66 million Dollars" in the
coming three years, said Clare Short, the visiting British
Secretary of State for International Development, the Noticias
daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Short made the remarks Sunday when she was visiting the
central city of Quelimane.
</P>
<P>
The British secretary was quoted as noting that the projects
assisted by her government need additional funds.
</P>
<P>
"Britain will continue providing support to Mozambique until
we are sure that it can walk on its own feet," Short said, adding
that Britain will keep watching to see Maputo's various efforts
for development so as to help it build up the basis for
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
However, Short stressed that what matters is not the provision
of money but how it is used, and used with transparency.
</P>
<P>
Britain used to offer 33 million Dollars in aid to Mozambique
each year for its development projects.
</P>
<P>
In central Zambezia Province, Short inspected British-assisted
projects in such fields as farming, land-mine removing, road
building and education. She also met local officials, leaders of
the non-governmental organizations and British citizens working
in the province.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival here Wednesday, Short said the aim of her visit
is to review the bilateral relations between Mozambique and
Britain and open up new realms of cooperations between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
During her stay here, she met with Mozambican President
Joaquim Chissano and held talks with Mozambican ministers
including the foreign minister. Short left for home Sunday.

TEHRAN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian and Iraqi officials agreed
on Monday to continue their joint efforts to search for those
missing in actions (MIA) during the 1980-88 war between the two
countries, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached in Abadan, Iran's border province of
Khuzestan at a meeting between head of Iran's committee in charge
of searching for MIAs Mir Feisal Baqerzadeh and his unnamed Iraqi
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed to exchange on Tuesday the remains of
some Iranian and Iraqi soldiers killed during the war, the report
said. No figure was given about the exchange.
</P>
<P>
In May, the two former enemies started their joint search for
the remains of dead soldiers close to their common borders and the
two sides exchanged the remains of 53 Iranians and 134 Iraqis last
month.
</P>
<P>
Tehran and Baghdad have agreed to speed up their efforts to
solve the issues of MIAs and prisoners of war (POW), which are the
main hurdles for the normalization of the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials recently announced that Iran and Iraq could
close the files of POWs within six months as the two sides showed

LONDON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
sacked four ministers on Monday in the first reshuffle of his
cabinet since the Labor Party won a landslide victory in the
general elections in May last year.
</P>
<P>
The BBC reported the four sacked ministers were Social Security
Secretary Harriet Harman, Transport Secretary Gavin Strang, Public
Services Secretary David Clark and Lord Ivor Richard, leader of
the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Baroness Margaret Jay, a junior health minister,

<HEADLINE> Smart Partnership Crucial for Southern Africa: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Smart partnerships were crucial
for the economic development in southern Africa and would help redress
its many problems, South African Press Association (SAPA) Monday
quoted Namibian President Sam Nujoma as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma was speaking Sunday night at a banquet for Southern African
Development Community (SADC) heads of state who are attending the
second Southern African International Dialog (SAID) in the Namibian
coastal town of Swakopmund.
</P>
<P>
"This impressive gathering is a reaffirmation of our commitment to
both the philosophy and practice of smart partnerships as a way of
engendering sufficient trust among different players in the process of
socio-economic development and wealth generation," Nujoma said.
</P>
<P>
"All parties to a smart partnership must recognize that their
success is inextricably intertwined with the success of their partners
and that the failure of one can lead to the failure of all.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no doubt that the increased reliance on smart
partnership will improve relationships between governments and the
private sector, between employers and their employees, and between
suppliers and customers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said cooperative working relationships were essential
in promoting trust among the different commercial players, adding
that smart partnership could best be achieved by networking at
the human level and by regular face-to-face contact to resolve
problems.
</P>
<P>
With recent regional achievements, including Namibia's
independence eight years ago, the end of South Africa's
white-minority rule in 1994 and the transformation of the
Southern African Development Coordinating Conference into the
SADC, Nujoma said, the region became a focus of attention as an
attractive emerging market.
</P>
<P>
The world began to look favorably to the region as an area
with bright prospects for increased growth in productivity,
trade, tourism and financial services, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said with these fundamental changes, southern Africa
had, by and large, come to enjoy peace and stability and these
factors had increased attraction to the enormity of its natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
"However, before the region and this continent can fully
realize their economic potential, we must work hard to overcome
the legacy of our past which was marked by racial tensions,
violence and unjust socio-economic relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This legacy left us with a number of limiting factors, such
as a very limited pool of skilled human resources and
institutional capacity as well as a certain degree of mistrust,
which put brakes on our drive toward development and economic
growth."
</P>
<P>
The SAID, which began Sunday, is being attended by the SADC
leaders and 350 representatives of labor and business in the region.

LAGOS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has cut its external debt
by 1.247 billion U.S. Dollars by the end of June through the Debt
Conversion Program (DCP) introduced in 1988, according to figures
from the Central Bank of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The bank said about 981.8 million U.S. Dollars of debt were
canceled through auctions organized monthly by it, while another
266.11 million U.S. Dollars were canceled outside auction.
</P>
<P>
Overseen by the Debt Conversion Committee, the program
involves the sale of an external debt instrument for a domestic
debt or equity participation in domestic enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The categories of debts which were canceled through auction
include provision notes, restructured and refinanced commercial
bank debts and Paris Club debts (debts to foreign governments).
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, a total of 165.3 million U.S. Dollars in
commercial bank debts were canceled through auction, while
another 64.14 million U.S. Dollars wiped out outside auction.
</P>
<P>
A total of 48.2 million U.S. Dollars in Paris Club debt were
removed through auction, with another 2.41 million U.S. Dollars
written off outside it.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's new military leader, General Abdulsalam Abubakar
promised last week to liberalize the DCP to encourage further
foreign participation in it.
</P>
<P>
The country's external debt currently stands at about 25
billion U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged Less Input in Jordanian-Israeli Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel is considering to make
concessions to solve the investment problem concerning its only
joint industrial zone with Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government is looking into the demands by Jordanian
investors for lowering Israeli input in the products that are
manufactured in the Qualifying Industrial Zone (QIZ), the
semi-official Jordan Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are studying the investors' request to lower our input to 8
percent (from 11.7 percent)," the newspaper quoted Roey Gilad, the
spokesman for the Israeli Embassy in Amman, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian investors in the Irbid QIZ, some 80 kilometers north
to Amman, earlier this month required Israel to reduce its input
in the zone to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached last November, which was backed by
the U.S., products from the zone can enjoy a duty-free entry into
the U.S. markets if Jordan and Israel each contributes a certain
amount of input into the exports.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, any piece of duty-free export to
the U.S. must contain 35 percent of input from the industrial zone
itself, with Jordan and Israel each paying a share of 11.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
But after the zone was designated in March, Jordanian investors
found that they invested a lot on the infrastructure in the zone,
so if the their input stays at 11.7 percent, then they might not
be able to make balance in a short time, let alone make profit for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Omar Salah, chairman of the Century Investment Group which
owns most of the manufacturing projects in the zone, said that the
11.7 percent input was agreed on only by the government, but the
investors have to make their own calculations.
</P>
<P>
The increase of Jordan's input will get more Jordanians
employed in the zone and help the Jordanian investors harvest
profit in a relatively short term, Salah said.
</P>
<P>
Salah was confident that Israel will cooperate and agree to
lower its input.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. trade department also supports the initiative of
lowering the (Israeli) percentage in order to encourage more
investments in Jordan," Salah said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade department has been surprised by the fact that
no Jordanian investors in the zone have applied for duty-free
entry to the U.S. markets since March.
</P>
<P>
He expected the problem to have been solved by October when a
U.S. official from the Department of Commercial Affairs visits the
region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jordanian government also voiced its support for
the investors on the cut request.
</P>
<P>
The agreement to build a joint zone was signed to make Jordan
share the economic dividends resulting from the 1994 peace deal
between Israel and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan had no direct foreign investment for years and badly
needs to create jobs.
</P>
<P>
For Jordan, the QIZ deal means new markets and over 2,000
jobs.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Addresses Grain Marketing System Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
recently that new efforts should be made to gain an accurate
understanding of grain purchasing and marketing policies, and
ensure that reform of the grain distribution system proceeds
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks during a workshop held between July 23-25
to discuss the restructuring of grain marketing systems. The
workshop was designed to help solve problems arising during
implementing grain marketing policies adopted during a related
national conference held in late April.
</P>
<P>
Restructuring the grain distribution system represent a major
aspect of the central government's reform agenda for this year,
and is main task in national economic development. Restructuring
is directly related to China's reform, development and stability,
said Zhu, adding that localities and related departments should
follow set policies to the letter in a bid to achieve good results.
</P>
<P>
He criticized various areas which have deviated from grain
reform policies as "having either a poor or one-sided
understanding of the central government's guidelines".
</P>
<P>
He noted that some areas have failed to take effective steps to
manage grain purchasing markets, and have instead either created
regional boundaries, or otherwise restricted trade at rural and
urban fairs.
</P>
<P>
The premier reiterated that grain marketing system reform
should focus on "three policies": open-ended purchases of surplus
grain at government prices; marketing grain at prices which earn
related enterprises a slight profit; and, setting aside special
funds for grain purchases.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Addressed Smooth Grain Marketing System Reform (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhu elaborated on the three policies by noting that grain
enterprises should provide better services, purchase all surplus
grain farmers offer for sale, and pay cash on delivery. He said
efforts should be made to ensure that grain purchasers, both
private and individual, are prevented from setting wholesale
prices for markets above county level and in turn controlling
grain trade activities. Zhu also called for a strict ban on
regional boundaries.
</P>
<P>
State-owned grain firms must observe the policy to selling
grain at prices which allow for minimum profits and no new losses
will be allowed in the process. Nongovernment grain enterprises
will be permitted to determine their own sales prices.
</P>
<P>
The Agricultural Development Bank should closely supervise the
management of grain purchase funds. Financial departments, on the
other hand, should secure timely and adequate provision of capital
for grain purchases.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also called on local governments and law enforcement
departments to deal harshly with violations of grain policies,
regardless of those involved in related cases.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, everything possible must be done to provide
more grain storage capacity and protect related facilities,
especially during the flood season.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was attended by leaders from major grain
production provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions,
officials in charge of grain production, and leading officials
from related central and provincial departments.

<HEADLINE> Banned Dufaux Confesses Taking Doping For Years </HEADLINE>

<P>
GENEVA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Swiss rider Laurent Dufaux, who was
banned from the Tour de France for doping, confessed on Monday
that he took performance-enhancing hormone EPO for three years.
</P>
<P>
"I took it for three years under strict medical supervision.
But I never abused it," Dufaux said in an interview with Swiss
daily Le Matin.
</P>
<P>
Dufaux, who was fourth in the 1996 Tour de France, and four of
his Festina teammates have admitted taking banned substances to
improve their performance, and the team director Bruno Roussel
confirmed they took part in an systematic doping.
</P>
<P>
The Tour de France then banned Festina riders to compete in
the race, including Alex Zulle, Armin Meier, Richard Virenque,
etc., though some of them denied taking dopes.
</P>
<P>
Dufaux said doping problem is much beyond people's thinkings,
but the cycling authority would make the confessed five scapegoats
rather than take more fierce measure to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
"I am afraid people will put a lid over the five who have
confessed, that they will be sanctioned and that nothing will
change," Dufaux said.

<HEADLINE> Child's Illustrations of Masterpiece Discovered in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Some 20 illustrations by a
12-year-old girl in 1933 on the masterpiece of French writer
Louis-Ferdinand Celine, "Trip to the End of the Night," have been
discovered, Le Figaro reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Eliane Bonabel told the daily she first saw Celine when she
went to have a medical consultation in the clinic of the writer,
who was also a famous doctor in Paris in the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
Bonabel said that Celine asked her to draw a picture for him,
and the doctor-writer was impressed by the talent of the young
girl and entrusted her with the work of illustrating his works
later.
</P>
<P>
Asked how she could do it when she was only 12, Bonabel said
she imagined New York, which was depicted by Celine in the novel
as Paris, where she grew up.
</P>
<P>
She said the part on the colonial life in Africa fascinated
her, because there had been one year earlier a World Exhibition in
 Paris which displayed colonial trophies of Europe from Africa and
 other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
As for the scenes of wars, she said her generation was fully
"nourished by the tales of war."
</P>
<P>
"Trip to the End of the Night" remains one of the most popular
novels in France, while the author, who died in 1961, is
considered the most controversial figure of 20th century French
literature.

CHANGSHA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The flood situation of the
Dongting Lake area in central China's Hunan Province is worsening,
as the water level at the lake's Chenglingji Hydrological Station
had surpassed the historical record of 35.31 meters to stand at
35.48 meters by 8:00 this morning.
</P>
<P>

meters in the past 24 hours, with a flow rate of 34,100
cu.m./second, according to the provincial flood control

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM Leaves for Colombo to Attend SAARC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala left here Monday for Colombo, capital of Sri Lanka,
to attend the 10th summit of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) starting there Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He told the press Monday morning before his departure that at
the three-day summit, Nepal will give priority to poverty
alleviation, environment conservation, control of girl trafficking
and development of communication.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that cooperation and understanding between India
and Pakistan is necessary to forward the SAARC activities.
</P>
<P>
Koirala said that if the two powers have the same attitude, the
SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) can be very
fruitful and beneficial to the smaller member countries.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of trade negotiations have been completed under
SAPTA operational since December 1995, offering over 2,000 items
of products for preferential treatment in the seven member states
-- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and
Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Exclusively special and more favorable treatment are offered to
Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives and Nepal, the four least
developed countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
But the third round of talks, which should have ended in
January this year, has been postponed four times.
</P>
<P>
Koirala said that though Bhutanese King Jigme Singye Wangchuck
will not attend the summit, he will discuss the refugee issue with
Jigme Thinley, chairman of the Bhutanese Council of Ministers who
will be present at the summit.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees are staying in eight U.N.-run
camps in eastern Nepal after being forced to flee Bhutan in 1989
and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Seven rounds of ministerial talks between the two Himalayan
kingdoms have failed to produce any result. India has refused to
get involved in the matter, saying it is a bilateral issue.
</P>
<P>
Koirala said that he will also have talks with his Indian
counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the sidelines of the summit
about the refugee issue, the Kalapani issue and other bilateral
issues.
</P>
<P>
"We have historical documents and maps which show that Kalapani
is Nepal's land," he said. "This problem should be resolved
through bilateral talks."
</P>
<P>
"Attitude of India is positive on Kalapani issue," he added.
Kalapani is in far-western Nepal which borders India.
</P>
<P>
He said that he will also meet his Bangladeshi counterpart
Sheikh Hasina over transit trade and economic cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
And his talks with Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga
will focus on the provision of scholarship to Nepalese students in
Ayurpedic, a traditional Nepalese medical treatment, the prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, bilateral talks will be held on starting air service
from Kathmandu to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the Maldives, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali Foreign Ministry said that the prime minister will
pay a short private visit to Singapore on way back to Kathmandu
after attending the summit.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to return home on August 3, the ministry said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China declared today the
establishment of two giant oil enterprise groups as part of the
reform of its petroleum industry by integrating upstream and
downstream production in the sector.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior oil official, the two extra-large
enterprise groups are based on the former China National Petroleum
Corp (CNPC) and China National Petrochemical Corp (Sinopec), with
their English names unchanged.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the reform plan, the newly-founded CNPC will
control all oil and gas fields, oil refineries and petrochemical
enterprises in 12 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities
mainly in north and west China, including the Inner Mongolia,
Tibet, Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regions,
Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu and Qinghai
provinces, and Chongqing municipality.

east and south, including Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin
municipalities, Hebei, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Guizhou
and Yunnan provinces, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

Petroleum and Chemicals Industry has been newly set up on the
basis of the former Ministry of the Chemicals Industry, CNPC and
Sinopec, and is directly under the jurisdiction of the State
Economic and Trade Commission.

CANBERRA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Asian economic crisis,
nuclear tests by Pakistan and India and political upheaval in
Indonesia would be top on the agenda of this week's
Australia-United States Ministerial (AUSMIN) talks in Sydney,
Australian officials said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
During a background briefing on July 31 talks, Australian
officials, who declined to be named, described the annual talks as
the most important meeting between Australia and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The United States will be represented by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary William Cohen, and
Australia's delegation will be led by Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer and Defense Minister Ian McLachlan.
</P>
<P>
The Australian officials said, "AUSMIN this year will take
place against a very different regional environment to that which
formed the context of our discussions last year."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously those changes - the Asian economic crisis and the
nuclear testing by India and Pakistan - bring a very changed
situation to our discussions," they noted.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be meeting against some fairly major dramatic events
that have taken place that would affect ... the security and the
economic stability of the (Asia-Pacific) region," they stressed.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the talks would have four key topics, such
as Asia-Pacific challenges and opportunities, global security and
political cooperation, defense cooperation and arrangements and
trade and economic arrangements and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Australia needs to work together with the United States and
the countries of the region, both bilaterally and in international
organizations, to help meet the challenges that have become
apparent in the region," the officials said.
</P>
<P>
A communique is expected to come out of the talks, which would
restate the commitment of both sides to a close defense and

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes US to Change MFN into NTR: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman Tang
Guoqiang said here today that China welcomes the United States'
recent decision to change the "Most Favored Nation" (MFN) trading
status into "Normal Trade Relations" (NTR).
</P>
<P>
Tang said: "we have noticed that President Clinton has recently
signed a bill in which MFN has been changed into NTR. It is a wise
and practical move.
</P>
<P>
"By MFN, it actually means a non-discriminatory trading status
mutually granted by the U.S. and other countries on a reciprocal
basis.
</P>
<P>
"It is normal trade relations in a real sense, and by no means
a preferential trading status granted by the U.S. to other
countries, still less a special favor unilaterally given by one
side. Therefore, this change has simply restored its true meaning,
which we welcome."
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, regretfully, the U.S. has not yet given up
its practice of annual review of the trade arrangement between
China and the U.S. This discriminatory practice has not only added
a destabilizing factor to the bilateral economic relations and
trade, but is also detrimental to the smooth development of
China-U.S. relations as a whole.
</P>
<P>
China hopes the U.S. side will proceed from the fundamental
interests and the common aspiration of the people in both China
and the U.S., and put an early end to its annual review of the
normal trade relations between the two countries, so as to
facilitate a sound, stable and sustained growth for the economic
cooperation and trade between China and the U.S. and their
bilateral relations, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> LRA Rejects UN Official's Peace Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Lord's Resistance Army
(LRA) rebels have rejected the involvement of United Nations'
Ambassador for Children in Conflict Olara Otunu to end the
12-year-long insurgency in norther part of the country.
</P>
<P>
In a strongly-worded press release issued Sunday, LRA spokesman
Ladit Balgara warned the U.N. official against ignoring the
political leadership of the LRA, the New Vision daily reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"As long as he ignores the political leadership of the LRA and
tries to approach the combatants to confuse and distract them
from normal duties, he will be met in heaven," the spokesman was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that no peace agreement will be signed "without
the freedom of our people from concentration camps and from
Article 269 of the Constitution of 1995."
</P>
<P>
This article in the Constitution is said to suspend political
party activities which may interfere with the Movement government
until Parliament enacts appropriate laws.
</P>
<P>
The rebels also accusing Otunu of having his position in the
1985 Nairobi peace talks between the Tito Okello regime and
Yoweri Museveni, which they claimed brought misery and anguish to
the Acholi.
</P>
<P>
The LRA is not a charity organization, but a political rebel
force ready to face Museveni who should openly declare that he
wants talks, the press release added.
</P>
<P>
Otunu recently met with some members of Parliament, civic and
opinion leaders who attended the London Kacoke Madit (grand
conference on Uganda) and promised to go to Sudan to meet
Sudanese government officials and LRA leaders to secure the
release of abducted children.
</P>
<P>
President Museveni recently wrote to LRA leaders for peace
negotiations so as "not to block the way to peace talks" as he
said at a press conference. But there has been no publicized
response to the letter from the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Adhere to Normalization of Ties With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordan will reject
calls to halt normalization of its ties with Israel, but will seek
a unified Arab stand on Jerusalem at an upcoming Islamic
conference, said the semi-official Jordan Times Monday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister for Development Affairs and Minister of
Foreign Affairs Jawad Anani will represent Jordan at the meeting
of the Jerusalem Committee under the Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC), which is scheduled for July 29 to 30 in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
"The relationship between Jordan and Israel is not the same as
the relationship between Syria and Israel," Anani told the paper,
referring to the 1994 Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty and the
continued state of enmity between Damascus and Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming conference should reflect the political realities
of each country, Anani added.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper report also said Syria will use the conference to
push for an end to the Arab normalization process with
Israel. Syrian officials have targeted Jordan over its ties with
the Jewish state, urging Amman to sever these links.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Anani told the newspaper that Jordan will seek a
unified Arab stand to safeguard the current status of the Holy
City of Jerusalem in the upcoming conference.
</P>
<P>
Jordan will play its role in preserving the Muslim holy sites
in Jerusalem, he added.
</P>
<P>
The conference in Morocco comes at a particularly crucial time
in the 16-month-old deadlock in the peace process. Israel has so
far refused to accept a U.S. peace proposal to revive the peace
process on the Israeli-Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Israel's announcement last month to extend the boundaries of
Jerusalem has also added to the troubles of the faltering peace
process. It is widely believed in the Arab and Muslim world that
Israel is trying to change the identity of the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is one of the two Arab countries that signed a peace
treaty with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Approves More Fund for Oil Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
approved an additional 300 million U.S. Dollars cash call budget
for its oil industry in 1998, bringing the total investment in
the oil sector by government to 2.8 billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
A report by "This Day" newspaper said the approval came after
a series of negotiations between the Nigerian government and
major oil operators in the country.
</P>
<P>
Oil production in Nigeria, a major world oil producer with a
daily production of over two million barrels, is done through
joint ventures between the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC) and foreign oil firms including Shell, Mobil,
Chevron, Elf, Agip and Texaco.
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, these joint ventures have been forced
to scale down their exploration and production plans due to the
inability of the Nigerian government to fund its 60 percent
ownership.
</P>
<P>
From 1995 to 1997, the government's annual budget for the oil
industry had been kept at 2.05 billion Dollars. This caused harsh
criticism from both the oil and public sectors, accusing the
government of neglecting the oil sector, which provides more than
70 percent of the government's revenue and over 90 percent of the
country's foreign currency income.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the government approved a budget of 2.5 billion
Dollars, compared with the 3.5 billion Dollars as proposed by the
oil firms.
</P>
<P>
Upon his succession to Abacha in June, General Abubakar has
promised to invest more in the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Only recently, he has ordered the immediate payment of 630
million Dollars to the oil firms as arrears owed to them by the
Abacha administration.
</P>
<P>
According to the report by "This Day", Abubakar has also
ordered the immediate payment of 175 million Dollars to oil firms
as the arrears in the first seven months of this year.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Says Joint Peace Initiative Gains Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said Monday that a joint Egyptian-French initiative on holding an
international conference on the Mideast peace is gaining wide
support.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remark before flying to Paris for two days of
talks with his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine and other
officials to propel the Egyptian-French proposal.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and French President Jacques
Chirac in May called for such a meeting to salvage the peace
process, which has been stalled on all tracks since the election
of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in May, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that there is an Arab and international
acceptance of the Egyptian-French overture as one of the available
options if the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
"Failure to achieve a concrete progress at the time being will
harm Arab interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators met last week for the first
time in months but were unable to reach an agreement on
outstanding issues, including a U.S. proposal of a further Israeli
withdrawal from 13.1 percent of the West Bank in return for the
Palestinian security guarantee.
</P>
<P>
These topics were discussed in the northern Egyptian city of
Alexandria Sunday by Mubarak and Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad
as well as the tripartite summit held recently in Cairo grouping
the Egyptian, Jordanian and Palestinian leaders, Moussa added.
</P>
<P>
Paris talks, he went on to say, will also touch on the impasse
in the Palestinian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
Those questions will also be discussed by Arab and Islamic
countries in the Al Quds (Jerusalem) Committee of the Organization
of the Islamic Conference in Casablanca, Morocco, said Moussa who
will be among the foreign ministers at the sessions on July
29-30.

<HEADLINE> Circular Calls for Relieving Burdens on Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A recent joint circular called for
effective efforts to relieve burdens on Chinese farmers in order
to ensure their enthusiasm for production and ensure this year's
output targets.
</P>
<P>
The joint circular issued by the General Office of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the General
Office of the State Council pointed to the difficult tasks facing
reform and development during 1998, and underlined the necessity
for ensure increased agricultural output, raising the income of
farmers and ensuring stability in rural areas in order to fulfil
tasks for this year.
</P>
<P>
The circular also noted that a number of factors contributed to
the slow rise in the income level of farmers during the first half
of the year, and led to increasing burdens on farmers in some
areas.
</P>
<P>
It warned that unfavorable factors pose a threat to the smooth
implementation of various reform measures and safeguarding social
stability.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee and State Council called on different
localities to reduce burdens on farmers by strictly controlling
reductions of overall fees on farmers, eliminating the collection
of random fees and related measures to designed raise funds,
strictly limiting fines on farmers and strengthening management
over voluntary labor.
</P>
<P>
All localities were urged to strictly implement agricultural
taxation policies, refrain from limiting rural income by using
grain purchase funds for other purposes and reduce tax burdens of
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the circular called on localities to reduce
nonproductive expenditures at the township and village levels,
strictly deal with violations of laws and regulations, and enhance
leadership over the work designed to reduce burdens on farmers.

<HEADLINE> Israel Softens Terms on Key Sticking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel has softened its terms on
a key sticking point of their talks with the Palestinians over
the second stage of Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank,
Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, while meeting
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Deputy Chairman Mahmoud Abbas
last Saturday night, proposed that part of the West Bank to be
handed over to the Palestinians will be contiguous areas located
in the Judean Desert, and the PNA will be responsible for public
order, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz quoted "sources close to the negotiations" as saying
that Mordechai did not specify the scope of the land in question
in the secret meeting, but it was widely believed to be 3 percent
from the 13.1 percent areas proposed to be handed over to the
Palestinians under an American initiative.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper described Mordechai's position as "significant,"
noting that it was the first time that Israel had indicated that
its withdrawal will include at least a slice of the Judean Desert.
</P>
<P>
Israeli National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon has
opposed yielding any territory in the Judean Desert, which was
near the Dead Sea, claiming that Israel needs the entire area for
security.
</P>
<P>
A second significance, Haaretz said, was that Israel accepted
Palestinian demands for the land to be contiguous. The third
Israeli concession was the agreement that the Palestinians be
responsible for public order in the area, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai also made clear at the meeting that he thought
Israel and the PNA "would not have difficulty in reaching a
compromise" on the other key sticking point -- finding the body
that would ratify the revision of the Palestinian Charter that
calls for the destruction of Israel, Haaretz said.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Plunge in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Share prices tumbled across the board in
Tokyo Monday with the key Nikkei index closing below 16,000 for the
first time since June 30.
</P>
<P>
A big fall in banking shares, predicated on investor worries about
who will become finance minister in the incoming government headed by
Keizo Obuchi, pulled stocks in other sectors down as well, traders
said.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange plummeted 417.53 points, or 2.55
percent, from last Friday's close to end at 15,944.36.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, lost 24.03 points or 1.91 percent to 1,233.98.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section fell to an estimated 360 million
shares from 401.44 million shares Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kawai Musical Instruments Mfg. was the day's most heavily traded
issue.
</P>
<P>
As expected by many traders, the Nikkei fell below 16,000 as market
players wait for Japan to take bold steps to cut income taxes and
rescue banks from the massive nonperforming loans they made.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, who won last Friday's Liberal Democratic Party presidential
election, is slated to replace Ryutaro Hashimoto as prime minister and
form a cabinet Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,332 issues listed on the First Section, losers outweighed
gainers 949 to 218, with 125 issues remaining unchanged.
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Foreign Exchange, the U.S. dollar climbed above 142
yen as the Japanese currency was weighed down by the country's
uncertain political situation.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was quoted at 142.33-36 yen at 5 p.m. (local time) after
hitting a high of 142.45 yen during the day, up from 141.61-63 yen at
9 a.m. in Tokyo and from 141.60-70 yen late Friday in New York.

<HEADLINE> Former French Coach Bans Himself From Seeing Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Aime Jacquet, the former national
coach who helped France win the soccer World Cup two weeks ago,
said on Sunday that he would see his beloved team no more.
</P>
<P>
"I ban myself from approaching the team of France and from
having contact with whoever he is. This is the law of our trade,"
Agence France-Presse quoted him as saying during a meeting with
the inhabitants of a village in Haute-Savoie at the Swiss border.
</P>
<P>
He said that he did so in order to help his successor, who he sa
id would have a difficult time in taking over and would guide the
team to defend the title in the 2002 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
France defeated Brazil to win the trophy for their first time
in history.
</P>
<P>
Roger Lemerre, 30, who is a friend of Jacquet's, is expected to
be proclaimed the new coach of the French team on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I think that he has a past, an experience, a real-life
experience. The experience he has with us can allow the French
team to continue this ascension," he said.

<HEADLINE> Restructuring Sparks University Reshuffling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- This year's reorganization or
elimination of a number of State Council commissions and
ministries will place a large number of colleges and universities
in the hands of local governments.
</P>
<P>
Addressing today's press conference, Vice-Minister of Education
Zhou Yuanqing said that more than 160 institutions of higher
learning are expected to be closed, merged or handed over to local
governments by September.
</P>
<P>
The institutions were formerly operated by nine ministries and
commissions, including the ministries of machine-building
industry, metallurgical industry and internal trade. The
ministries were on the State Council list of dozens of departments
eliminated earlier this year during institutional restructuring
designed to streamline and invigorate the government.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of ministries created their own systems based
on the Soviet Model beginning in the early 1950s, and ensuing
redundant operations created surplus construction and wasted
resources. Most ministries operated dozens of small universities
which could have easily been combined into a single comprehensive
institution like Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said the new move will further promote the ongoing reform
of higher education, and that the universities will be required
to readjust their goals and better serve the nation's economic and
social needs in order to survive.
</P>
<P>
A total of 26 provinces and cities will assume or "take over"
operational responsibilities for related institutions. The
reshuffling will involve a number of complex problems in areas
such as funding, transferrals of staff records and continuation of
teaching and research programs. Experts acknowledge that the
greater influence might emerge in the psychological sphere since
most teachers and students will feel somewhat uneasy when their
universities are degraded from the state to the local level.
</P>
<P>
However, Ji Baocheng, director of the Planning Department of
the Education Ministry, said that everything has proceeded
smoothly since the readjustment was properly designed and has been
carried out under the direction of top leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ministries and commissions have set up more than
300 universities and colleges over the years, with the future of a
number of institutions to be determined at a later date, according
to sources from the ministry.

<HEADLINE> Projections Indicate Drop in Automotive Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China's third quarter automotive
output is expected to slump by 16.7 percent on second quarter
levels.
</P>
<P>
The Automotive Industry Development Institute forecasts that the
total automobile output will reach 387,965 units during the
July-September period.
</P>
<P>
However, the output of sedans will remain at 143,502 units, or
slightly lower than the 145,919 units produced in the April-June
period.
</P>
<P>
Industrial experts note that the declining trend in automotive
output is the result of slack market demand and the rising
stockpiles for a number of manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
China produced 824,700 automobiles in the first half this year,
up a mere 0.6 percent on a year-by-year basis.
</P>
<P>
The total automobile output for the year is expected to end at
between 1.65-1.7 million units.

<HEADLINE> China Opposes Taiwan Resolution Passed by U.S. House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China today voiced strong
dissatisfaction and opposition to a concurrent resolution the
U.S. House of Representatives recently passed affirming the
so-called U.S. commitment to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Tang Guoqiang said the resolution
severely violated principles guiding Sino-US relations as
enshrined in the three Sino-US joint Communiques and the Sino-US
Joint Statement, as well as the U.S. government commitment to
pursue the "One China" policy.
</P>
<P>
"We hereby express our strong dissatisfaction and opposition to
the resolution which has seriously infringed on China's national
sovereignty and wantonly interfered in the nation's internal
affairs," said Tang.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. House of Representatives exhibited total
disregard for norms guiding international relations and the
principles set forth in the three Sino-US joint communiques when
it passed the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The resolution called for affirmation of the so-called
U.S. long-term commitment to Taiwan in accordance with the Taiwan
Relations Act. It also elaborated on what it referred to as the
undetermined status of Taiwan, advocated selling advanced military
equipment, including ballistic missile defense systems, to Taiwan
and supports Taiwan's entry into international financial
institutions and various other international organizations.
</P>
<P>
"We demand that members of the U.S. Congress strictly comply
with the 'One China' policy, cease all interference in China's
domestic affairs and refrain from hampering further improvements
in Sino-US relations by using the Taiwan issue, and exert greater
effort to stimulate bilateral ties," according to Tang.

<HEADLINE> Paralyzed Chinese Gymnast Shows Great Courage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Xinhua Sportswriter Yang Ming
</P>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 26 (Xinhua) -- She is smiling and consoling her
weeping mother, even though she cannot feel anything from
mid-chest down.
</P>
<P>
The braveness and courage shown by the 17-year-old Chinese
female gymnast Sang Lan moved everyone who went to see her after
Tuesday's tragic accident.
</P>
<P>
Sang Lan broke her neck in the warm-up for the women's vault
competition that night, and know she would probably be confined to
a wheelchair for the rest of her life.
</P>
<P>
"She is a very special young lady who has shown an incredible
amount of strength and courage," Thomas Gulotta, Nassau County
Executive, highly praised her Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"She only asked for one thing after the injury. She said,
'Would it be possible for me to watch the Goodwill Games tonight
from TV?'", Gulotta added.
</P>
<P>
Her wish was fulfilled. And she broke into a big smile seeing
teammates Huang Xu and Ling Jie won the mixed pair gold in the
gymnastics competition.
</P>
<P>
"We will send this gold medal to Sang Lan, because we have
drawn great courage from her," Huang said after the triumph.
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Huang and all the Chinese gymnastics team members went
to Nassau County Medical Center to say good-bye before flying
home, and all the gymnasts could not hold their tears back except
Sang.
</P>
<P>
Sang, who was watching "The Lion King" on TV after completing
an operation last night, told her teammates to stop crying.
</P>
<P>
"I am fine now, don't be sad. I really hope I could go home
with you. Please kiss me good-bye. I will miss you all and see you
soon," the delicate Chinese girl said.
</P>
<P>
Sang Lan's parents were driven directly to the hospital from
airport to visit their daughter. But the Sangs could not help
dropping to their knees when they saw Dr. Vincent Leone, director
of spine surgery at the center.
</P>
<P>
With tears trickling down their faces, the parents begged the
doctor to save their only daughter.
</P>
<P>
Leone also fell on his knees, saying they had tried their best
possible to improve Sang Lan's condition.
</P>
<P>
"We trust you American doctors, please create some miracle to
help Sang Lan stand up again," Sang's mother said.
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Sang's parents went to see her again with the Chinese
team. Huang Yubin, coach of the team, read Sang Lan several
letters from her friends back in China.
</P>
<P>
The tough man choked his voice several times and the reading
had to be relayed through many people.
</P>
<P>
Sang never complained about discomfort or pain. Gulotta told
the press today that when he asked her whether she remembered him,
Sang Lan joked with him by saying "To me, all Americans look
alike."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Vincent Leone, director of spine surgery at the medical
center, said: "We found severe damage to the C6 and C7 levels. We
also found the C5-6 interval was disrupted. That means it is a
complex spinal cord injury."
</P>
<P>
He said there was a serious amount of bone fragments. Sang Lan
underwent a difficult surgery but she pulled through it very well.
</P>
<P>
But the doctor said: "Her chances of walking again do not just
solely depend on surgery. They depend on a multifaceted approach
to her care."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Anthony Angelo, medical director of the medical center,
said: "Dr. Leone and his staff did an absolutely superb job. We
couldn't be more thrilled with the outcome of this surgery. The
surgery stabilized Sang Lan's neck. It was exceptionally delicate
and went exceptionally well.
</P>
<P>
"Sang Lan is sitting up in a chair, she is in wonderful spirits
this morning. She feels relieved. She ate, drank and she has a
world of strength emotionally and physically."
</P>
<P>
Angelo told the press that no surgery can undo the damage that
may have already been done to her spinal cord and they simply
don't know how severe that is yet. "Only time will tell us that."
</P>
<P>
Sang Lan has received countless cards and letters from all over
the world. One letter reads: "Dear Sang, I am very sorry about the
accident. You are a beautiful girl and life doesn't seem fair, but
God will give you strength to make the best of the situation. I
hope you recover soon and I will pray for you."
</P>
<P>
This is one sentiment of many sentiments that have been flowing
into the medical center. Sang Lan knows that, and she needs that.
</P>
<P>
But what she needs not is the tears and complaints. She told
her mother: "Mom, don't cry and don't be sad. I will be stand up
again. I know that."

Yeni Yuzyil (New Century):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz Sunday broke ground for
a 500-million-U.S.-dollar Ford plant in the northwestern Turkish
city of Kocaeli.
</P>
<P>
The plant, which is to begin production in the year 2000, will

The powerful radars of the commanding systems of the missiles
are able to monitor vast areas, including NATO's Incirlik Air Base

</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- In an interview with German newspaper Welt am Sonntag on

</P>
<P>
He said that Europe will no longer be the center of Turkey's
foreign policy and it will pay more attention to its ties with
Russia, Japan and the United States from now on.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges India, Pakistan to Sign Nuclear Treaties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Vice Chancellor Wolfgang
Schussel, on behalf of the European Union (EU), appealed anew
Tuesday India and Pakistan to refrain from any further nuclear
tests and to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
"I reiterate the appeal to India and to Pakistan to refrain
from any further nuclear tests, to sign and move to ratify the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as it stands and to accede to the
Non-Proliferation Treaty," Schussel told the 5th ASEAN Regional
Forum (ARF).
</P>
<P>
Schussel is attending the one-day ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) Regional Forum which opened here Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Schussel said the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan
"pose a grave threat to international peace and security, and
constitute a serious set-back to global efforts towards nuclear
non-proliferation and disarmament."
</P>
<P>
The EU urged India and Pakistan, the two rival countries, to
contribute actively to securing the opening of negotiations in the
Conference on Disarmament for a treaty banning the production of
fissile materials for nuclear weapons, he said.
</P>
<P>
Schussel also called on the two countries to engage in a
dialogue and to try to build confidence rather than to remain on
the mutually disastrous path of confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Schussel, whose country is currently the rotating chairman of
the EU, said the EU is concerned about the continued increase in
military expenditure in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Citing the rising economic difficulties of India and Pakistan
as a result of their costly nuclear and conventional military
expenditure, Schussel said the EU hopes that the overall military
spending in the region could be stabilized if not reduced in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
Schussel assured the other ARF participants that the EU is
ready to continue its substantial contribution to peace and
prevention of tension in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The ARF was attended by the foreign ministers from the 10 ASEAN
dialogue partners and the nine ASEAN member countries, and
representatives from the two ASEAN observer states Cambodia and
Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN dialogue partners are the United States, China,
Russia, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, India
and the EU. ASEAN groups the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore,
Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Brunei.

<HEADLINE> Price Issue Delays AIDS Drugs for Ugandans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- New AIDS drugs, which arrived in
Uganda a month ago, will be available in the market later than
expected because their price takes more time to be decided on.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS officials
revealed recently that Glaxo Wellcome, the British firm supplying
the new drugs, has not obtained enough information about the
Ugandan market and, therefore, the setting of the price is
delayed, the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The drugs, which arrived in the Uganda on July 7, are reported
to be able to suppress the replication of the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
</P>
<P>
The bulk of Ugandan AIDS patients are longing for the drugs
because other anti-AIDS drugs available in the market cost 12
million Uganda Shillings (10,000 U.S. Dollars) per year, well
beyond the means of the ordinary Ugandans.
</P>
<P>
The price of the new drugs will be settled through
negotiations between the supplier and the Ugandan government.
</P>
<P>
Uganda was listed as one of the pilot countries for the new
drugs at the newly-concluded World's AIDS Conference.
</P>
<P>
One-tenth of the 20 million Ugandans are estimated to be HIV
positive and some 500,000 people have died of the killing disease
since the first case of AIDS was reported in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Although Uganda is no longer one of the poorest countries in
the world, a New Vision newspaper report said in May that 86
percent of Ugandan families are still living below of poverty
line of 13,380 Shillings (11 U.S. Dollars) a month and some 60
percent of these families are struggling under the absolute
poverty line of 9,470 Shillings (eight U.S. Dollars) a month.
</P>
<P>
The price of the new AIDS drugs is said to reach 9,000 Dollars
a year. So it may still be too expensive for ordinary AIDS
patients in Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Money Transfer Service Expands in East Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A regional money transfer service
between the capital cities of Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya, has now
been extended to 119 towns within the three east African
countries.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of the Interstate Speed Cash service commenced
on July 13 to include all regional post offices and selected
district post offices, the East African weekly newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The service was launched last year within the framework of the
East African Cooperation but was restricted to general post
offices in Nairobi, Dar es Salaam and Kampala.
</P>
<P>
There are 42 post offices in Kenya, 39 in Tanzania and 38 in
Uganda will now offer the service.
</P>
<P>
The maximum period of money delivery posted from any point
within east Africa will be seven days to far flung district post
offices and three to four days to major cities, said Hugo Mvamba,
a senior official with the Tanzania Posts Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The maximum amount of money that can be sent from country to
country will be the local equivalent of 1,000 U.S. Dollars and
the minimum 10 Dollars. One person is allowed to send more than
two orders a day but the maximum should not exceed 1,000 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources hope the expanded service will boost internal
and cross-border trade by making money transfer easier and
faster.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Launches One-Year Fixed Rate Bearer Bond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya has
launched a one-year fixed rate bearer bond for investors with at
least 10,000 Shillings or 161 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to reduce interest rates on Treasury
Bills and compete with commercial banks for direct cheaper
deposits, the East African weekly newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bearer bond attracts a fixed interest rate of 16 percent
per annum and is payable quarterly.
</P>
<P>
It will take about 25 percent, or the 64 biLl=9L!llings
(1.03 billion U.S. Dollars) of the 267 billion Shillings (4.3
billion U.S. Dollars) currently invested in savings accounts of
commercial banks, which offer interest rates of less than 11
percent.
</P>
<P>
John Munge of Shah Munge &AMP; Partners Ltd. said the offer was
made through his firm and other members of the Nairobi Stock
Exchange last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Subsequent issues of the bond will be on sale at the beginning
of every month, he said.
</P>
<P>
The bond has a maturity period of one year. After that there
will be secondary trading in multiples of 10,000 Shillings at the
Nairobi Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Urges Africans to Learn From Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa
has urged African countries to consider engaging Asia's technical
advancement to develop in the coming millennium.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa made the remarks Sunday during a brief stopover at the
Lusaka International Airport on his way to Namibia's west coastal
city of Swakopmund for the second Southern African International
Dialog (the Smart Partnership round table discussion), Zambia
Daily Mail reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa also said it is time for Africa to learn to utilize the
legislative and regulative steps which have recorded numerous
successes in most Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian president, who was met at the airport by Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba, pointed out that deregulated labor
policies in most Asian countries have contributed to the success
of the continent.
</P>
<P>
He called on the African countries to reconsider their labor
laws, saying that these should be flexible to the changing
economies in the world.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to learn much from our Asian colleagues on their
labor regulations and legislature which we may find useful in our
governments at the Smart Partnership round table talks in
Namibia," said Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
The round-table's discussions are expected to engage some
African heads of state, entrepreneurs, academics and trade
unionists with their colleagues from other parts of the world
such as Asia and Europe.

<HEADLINE> Ranariddh Expects Cambodia to Join ASEAN After Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Prince Norodom Ranariddh voiced
hope Monday that Cambodia's bid to join the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and restore its seat at the United
Nations would be boosted by Sunday election.
</P>
<P>
The self-organized, multi-party election, if successful and
accepted, would pave the way for Cambodia to rejoin the
international community, Ranariddh said in an interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Cambodians went to the poll in the historic
election in the hope of giving the country a chance for peace,
stability and a legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh, who is also one of the leading candidate in the
election, said "the international community also wants to embrace
Cambodia again not only for Cambodian interests but also for
regional stability."
</P>
<P>
He said if Cambodia remained unstable, it would not only
affect the economic development of the country itself, but also
threaten long-term stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN refused to admit Cambodia as a new member after Ranariddh
was ousted as Cambodia's first-premier by forces loyal to
co-premier Hun Sen in July 1997. Cambodia has been absent from its
seat at the United Nations ever since.
</P>
<P>
"The Cambodian people want to see changes and have new leaders
to build a new image of Cambodia. That is why they showed great
enthusiasm for the election," Ranariddh said.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of the registered voters cast their votes
Sunday, a much higher percentage than previously expected,
according to the Cambodian National Election Committee (NEC).
</P>
<P>
Judging from the registration and balloting, Ranariddh said,
the election had been "relatively free and fair."
</P>
<P>
When asked about whether he was confident that his Funcinpec
Party would win the election, Ranariddh said he would wait and see
the final results.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec, the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and Sam
Rainsy Party were front runners in the election and hoped to
lead what most people expect will be another coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh said if Funcinpec failed in the election, it would
remain active in politics as an opposition in the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"As for myself, I would never work in the new government if
it was led by the CPP," Ranariddh said. The CPP fielded Hun Sen,
its vice-president, as candidate for premiership.
</P>
<P>
The prince said if the new government was led by his party,
priorities would be given to political stability and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Economic development should begin from the countryside where 90
percent of the Cambodians live, he said, "I would introduce
advanced technology and seek investment to develop Cambodia's
agriculture."
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec would adhere to the current foreign policy based on
independence, self-reliance and non-alignment, Ranariddh said.
</P>
<P>
"We will stick to the `one-China` policy and continue to
develop relations with China," he added.

<P>
NEW YORK, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China's gymnasts Huang Xu and
Ling Jie combined to win China's sixth gold medal here Sunday in
the mixed pairs competition, while the United States claimed the
wrestling team title at the 1998 Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
Brazilians Guiberme Marques and Para Ferreira captured the
men's beach volleyball gold by beating Adam Johnson and Karch
Kiraly of the United States 12-11, 12-4.
</P>
<P>
But the host pocketed a top honor in the women's platform
diving through Laura Wilkinson.
</P>
<P>
Huang, who capped the men's parallel bars gold in the
individual gymnastics, teamed up with Ling Jie to score a total of
39.000 points in the mixed pair competition, ahead of Russia's
Alexei Nemov and Svetlana Khorkina, 38.725, and another Russian
pair Alexei Bondarenko and Anna Kovaleva, 38.7000.
</P>
<P>
"We will send this gold to Sang Lan, who injured her neck on

from her and we knew that she was watching the competition
tonight," said Huang.
</P>
<P>
Sang Lan, 17, suffered an injury in the warm-up for the women's
vault competition on July 21, and she cannot feel anything from
mid-chest down after completing her operation yesterday.

Marques and Ferreira, who kept their matches with a record of
all wins before the final, displayed their strength by beating the
American tandem in straight sets.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The Brazilians, who downed Johanson and Kiraly 15-3 Thursday in
group A, won the 55 minute first set after the both sides tied at

<P>
In the match determining the bronze medal, Martin Conde and
Esteban Martinez of Argentina downed Julien Prosser and Leo Zahner

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi of the United
States captured his third title of the season when he defeated
Scott Draper of Australia in the final of an ATP Tour tournament
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Agassi took just 50 minutes to win his 37th title of his
career, ousting Draper 6-2, 6-0 to win the Legg Mason Classic
title.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Agassi, who was playing in his fifth final of
the season, lost just six games in his last three matches.
</P>
<P>
"My goals are to capitalise on each situation and to be
realistic about where I am," said Agassi.
</P>
<P>
"The past few months I worked back hard and gained a lot of
confidence. I felt I had to step up a little, raise my game and
stay solid," he added.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who has now won 35 of his 43 matches so far this year,
claimed the victory at the Sybase Open and Franklin Templeton
Tennis Classic earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Declines to Sign Military Accord With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has refused to sign the
Status of Forces Agreement with the United States (SOFA), The
Finance Express daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a front-paged report, the newspaper said, "The Foreign
Office in a letter on Sunday communicated to the U.S. embassy the
Bangladeshi government decision not to sign the agreement."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy sources confirmed the Foreign Office's
communication but declined to make any comment on Dhaka's refusal
to sign the accord, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the national news agency Bangladesh Sangbad
Sangstha (BSS) issued a report quoting a "competent source" at the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs as saying that Bangladesh was unlikely
to sign SOFA with the U.S. as "Bangladesh has nothing to gain by
signing the SOFA. Rather, it (SOFA) would be detrimental to the
national interest."
</P>
<P>
"National interest will be above everything" while entering
into any agreement with any country, big or small, on any issue,
be it on economic matters or military affairs, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Clauses providing visa-free entry for U.S. troops, unrestricted
movement for American troops in the country and the entry of
equipment and supplies carried by U.S. troops without undergoing
customs clearance were not acceptable to Bangladesh, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Besides, as a member of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Bangladesh had a responsibility for
the region as a whole and could not allow entry of foreign troops
into the region which might have "profound and far-reaching
consequences," it added.
</P>
<P>
Americans desirous of entering Bangladesh to carry out relief
operations, or for military exercises or for other legitimate
purposes could do so through a memorandum of understanding (MOU)
on a case-by-case basis. "We can have as many MOUs as required,"
the news agency quoted the source as saying.

<P>
HARARE, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will send officials in
the government and farmers' unions to Brazil and Colombia before
the end of the year to study how the two countries are
implementing their land redistribution program.
</P>
<P>
The tour is jointly sponsored by the British and Danish
governments through the World Bank, the daily Herald reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the tour comes at a time when the government has
announced that the resettlement of landless Zimbabweans has
started, making it unclear how lessons learned from the Latin
American countries would fit into an already running program.
</P>
<P>
Ruling ZANU (PF) National Chairman and National Land
Acquisition Committee Chairman Joseph Msika is expected to lead
the delegation scheduled to leave after the September Donor
Conference on Land to be held in Harare.
</P>
<P>
In an interview in Bulawayo, the country's second largest city
Sunday, Msika said the tour was proposed by the World Bank for
the ministries involved in the land redistribution program.
</P>
<P>
"It's part of an exercise to see how others have done it,"
Msika said. "There is absolutely nothing wrong with it coming at
a time when our resettlement program has started. We will simply
pick on ideas that apply to our system."

ZHENGZHOU, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province
will recover 7.02 billion yuan State Development Bank loan next
month for a project to develop low voltage power grids in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
The province will begin by improving power grids rated 10
kilovolts and below in 30 counties, and plans to upgrade obsolete
electric facilities in 115 counties over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Henan plans to install over 35 million meters of 10-kv and 50
million meters of 0.4-kv power lines.
</P>
<P>
Counties consume 45 percent of total power generated in the
province, with the per capita power consumption of rural residents
standing at only 53 percent of the national average due to
obsolete power generation equipment.
</P>
<P>
The improvements are expected to help meet the growing demand
for electricity in rural areas and promote further development of
rural economy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges India, Pakistan to Adhere to Nuke Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States Monday asked
India and Pakistan, whose nuclear tests in May touched off an
uproar across the world, to "adhere to the CTBT without
conditions."
</P>
<P>
"We ask that they not produce fissile material for nuclear
weapons pending conclusion of a treaty to halt such production
permanently," U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told the
ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) meeting which opened here Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
She also urged the two countries not to deploy nuclear weapons
or missiles capable of carrying them and commit themselves to
effective means of controlling exports of dangerous weapons,
materials and technologies.
</P>
<P>
India carried out five nuclear explosions in mid-May and
Pakistan responded by setting off six nuclear devices towards the
end of that month.
</P>
<P>
Albright called on India and Pakistan, two neighbors long at
odds, to resume high-level dialogue with each other to address the
full range of issues that divide them, including Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the hope that the prime ministers of the two
countries, who will be in Colombo, capital of Sri Lanka, to attend
a summit meeting of South Asian countries this week, "can get such
a dialogue on track."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state said the South Asian region had
been getting safer until India and Pakistan tested nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
"While both nations have legitimate security concerns, neither
faced an imminent threat that could justify the far greater danger
we all now face," she said.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for New Security Approach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China Monday called for a new
security approach and new ways to safeguard peace.
</P>
<P>
"In order to secure lasting peace and development in the
Asia-Pacific, it is necessary to nurture a new security approach
and seek new ways of safeguarding peace," Chinese Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan said in an address at the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)
meeting, which opened here Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Tang noted that the past year has been one of continued
significant and profound changes in the Asia-Pacific region: Major
powers have further readjusted and improved their relations,
countries have strengthened dialogue and cooperation and there
have been gradually deeper-going regional multilateral economic
and security dialogue and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Peace, development and cooperation remain the main trend in the
regional situation, he declared.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that destabilizing factors have
apparently increased in the Asia-Pacific region after India and
Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in May, "plunging South Asia into
a sudden wave of tension."
</P>
<P>
As implications of the financial crisis spread, new problems
have cropped up one after another in the process of regional
development, he said. "The Cold-War mentality still has its
influence in the region. Such acts as reinforcing military
alliance and interfering in other countries' internal affairs
continue to occur."
</P>
<P>
As it stands, he added, the issues of peace and development are
far from being settled and remain the two major themes confronting
us.
</P>
<P>
He said that to develop state-to-state ties on the basis of the
Five Principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial
integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's
internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit and peaceful
coexistence "constitutes the political foundation and prerequisite
of security at both regional and international levels."
</P>
<P>
Tang also described increasing mutual understanding and trust
through dialogue and cooperation and undertaking to settle
state-to-state disputes and conflicts through peaceful means as "a
practical way of ensuring peace and security."
</P>
<P>
"History has already proven that the security concept and
mechanism based on military alliance and achieved through the
build-up of military strength cannot make lasting peace," he said.
"In this diversified region of the Asia-Pacific, it is all the
more necessary to work to enhance mutual understanding and trust
through dialogue and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he stressed that economic growth and common
prosperity are the material basis for regional and global
security. "In today's world when the international situation moves
toward relaxation and economic development faces a rare
opportunity, to concentrate limited resources on economic and
social development is an easier way for a country to move into the
ranks of strong nations of the world and provides a positive
guarantee for national and regional security as well."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister pointed out that as the sole
governmental-level channel for security dialogue in the
Asia-Pacific region, the ARF is, under the new circumstances,
playing an ever-greater role in enhancing mutual confidence among
Asian-Pacific countries and promoting regional peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
The ARF, initiated in 1993 and first convened in the following
year, is a forum for Asian-Pacific countries to discuss political
and security cooperation and security matters such as
confidence-building measures and preventive diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Tang noted that as a permanent member of the U.N. Security
Council, China is committed to maintaining peace, stability,
development and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and has
fulfilled its share of responsibility and obligation both in
alleviating East Asia's financial crisis and in easing up the
tension in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"China will, as always, participate in the multi-tiered and
multi-channeled dialogues and cooperation in the security field of
the Asia-Pacific region," he declared. "China was, is and will be
a staunch force in maintaining regional and global peace and
stability and a positive factor promoting common development."

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan, in an address to the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) here
Monday, described economic security as part of national and
regional stability.
</P>
<P>
"The East Asian financial crisis fully indicates that economic
security has increasingly become an inseparable part of national
or regional stability," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that economic security is based first of all on
formulating the right strategy for economic growth and enhancing a
country's economic might and competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"It is based on political stability, the inviolability of
sovereignty and respect for its model of development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he added, "it is necessary for countries to take an
active part in and work to promote regional economic cooperation
and coordination, readjust and improve the existing international
economic and financial order and, in particular, to strengthen
supervision over and take strict precautions against excessive
speculation."
</P>
<P>
Tang stressed that economic security is mutual and "it is
inadvisable to try to shift one's troubles onto others."

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Leader Admits Asian Economic Crisis Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Leader Lieutenant General
Tin Oo has admitted the impact of the Asian economic crisis on his
country to some extent.
</P>
<P>
Tin Oo, second secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and
Development Council, made the admission at an annual meeting here
Sunday of the country's Edible Oil Dealers Association.
</P>
<P>
This is the second Myanmar leader to admit the impact after
Minister of Finance and Revenue U Khin Maung Thein.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Tin Oo urged the entrepreneurs to work harder,
be thrift and avoid too much reliance on foreign goods and
establish a healthy economy.
</P>
<P>
He called for the private sectors, especially the merchant
associations, to cooperate with the government in striving for the
national economic development and better food, clothing and
shelter of the people.
</P>
<P>
He asked them to strike a balance between self-interest and
common good and produce import-substitute commodities and boost
productivity.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis has affected the country's growth of
 gross domestic product in the 1997-98 fiscal year, which ended in
March, with only 4.6 percent achieved against the set growth of
6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year, the country's foreign trade totaled 3.24
billion U.S. dollars, of which exports amounted to only one
billion dollars, registering a deficit of 1.24 billion dollars in
its balance of trade in the period.
</P>
<P>
The increase in foreign investment in 1997 was less than that
in 1996, falling by one billion dollars despite reaching a total
of 6.6 billion dollars at the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Exports to EU Increase 19 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's exports to the European
Union (EU) increased by 19 percent in value in 1997 and its
imports from the trading block grew by 11 percent with the balance
in favor of the country, The Financial Express daily reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Michael Drury, head of a European
Commission (EC) delegation, while addressing a luncheon here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Exports of Bangladesh to the EU stood at 88 billion taka (1.87
billion U.S. dollars) while its imports from the EU were 33
billion taka (702 million dollars) in 1997 calendar year, Drury
stated.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that ready-made garments accounted for 84
percent of Bangladesh's exports to the EU in the year with a
growth of 26 percent over the previous year due to the use of the
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) under which Bangladesh
enjoyed duty-free access to European markets.
</P>
<P>
The duty was falling in Europe with the multifiber agreement,
under which Bangladesh enjoyed protected quota, to be phased out
by the year 2005, he warned.
</P>
<P>
He called for conscious efforts to identify and create other
growth possibilities in Bangladesh with a view to employing the
low-cost labor of the country in combination with technological
improvements that ultimately increase the value of workforce.

<HEADLINE> Philippines, U.S. Hold Bilateral Talks in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Foreign Secretary
Domingo Siazon met with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
here Sunday evening and discussed issues of importance to both
countries, said a press bulletin released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin said that among the highlights the two ministers
discussed was the status of the Visiting Forces Agreement which
will allow the resumption of joint military exercises between two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, currently pending in the Philippine Senate for
approval, will also state how to deal with U.S. soldiers who
commit crimes during their stay in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the agreement, Siazon and Albright also discussed
the ongoing Asian financial crisis, particularly the need for
Japan to expedite the implementation of its economic reform
measures, which, in the process, will improve the economy in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed the hope that the general elections held
Sunday in Cambodia would be fair, free and credible and exchanged
views on regional crisis including the controversial nuclear tests
conducted by India and Pakistan.
</P>

<P>
NANJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province has
introduced emergency measures to evacuate residents on Yangtze
River islands threatened by heavy flooding.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,700 people have already been evacuated, with
no reports of casualties in related operations. The province's
14 river islands have a total population of 370,000 people and
farmland covering cover 18,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu sections of the Yangtze recorded a water flow rate of
78,900 cu.m./second on Sunday, with flood levels rising to the
danger levels on some islands.
</P>
<P>
Xinji Island in Jiangning County, an area home to 4,100
residents and 400 ha of farmland, will be the first island to bear
the brunt of the new flood and the county government has organized
a 3,000-member task force to patrol on the 14-km embankment on a
24 hour basis.
</P>
<P>
Two separate breaches in embankments on Shiye Island in Dantu
County have seriously threatened 14,000 island residents. The

<HEADLINE> 9 Foreign Firms to Compete for Oil, Gas Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Nine foreign companies, with five of
them from the United States, will be invited for the final
negotiation for oil and gas exploration in Bangladesh, according
to Petrobangla, the state-owned agency in charge of gas and oil
exploration and production in the country.
</P>
<P>
The results of the Second Round Block Bidding for oil and gas
exploration in Bangladesh, which was announced Sunday, showed that
European companies Shell and Cairn would be invited for final
negotiation for Block-5, U.S. companies Triton and UNOCAL and
Malaysian company PTI Oil for Block-7, U.S. company Pangaea Energy
and its Austrian partner OMV for Block-8, and U.S. companies Enron
Oil and Okland International for Blocks-3 and 6.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the bidding results, which was originally
fixed on December 15 last year, was delayed by seven months, media
reports here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two foreign companies submitted 37 proposals for 12 out
of the 15 blocks opened in the Second Round Block Bidding in July
last year, and the government invited the bidders for negotiation
in October on a "one company, one block" basis.
</P>
<P>
The companies showed cold shoulders to the remaining three less
perspective blocks, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government had changed the bidding criterion
three times, which some bidders said was deliberately done to
favor certain bidders, hinting at U.S. monopoly in the gas sector
in the South Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
Irish company Tullow Oil and U.S. companies Chevron and Texaco
would be invited to finalize an "unresolved" negotiation for
partnership in Block-9, and a similar decision was taken to
finalize another "unresolved" negotiation for partnership in
Block-11 between Tullow and Malaysian company Petronas and U.S.
company Mobil.
</P>
<P>
In both "unresolved" blocks, Bangladesh's only exploration
unit, BAPEX, had been suggested a 25-percent share, the reports
quoted sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Blocks-19 and 20, the government would continue to negotiate
with European company Mearsk Olie before reaching any final
decision, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Blocks-4 and 21 were put out of the bidding as no company was
selected for them, and Block-10, which was earlier decided to be
allocated to Shell and Cairn, was also put out of the bidding. The
authorities had decided to award the block to UNOCAL, with which
the government had initiated a production-sharing contract for a
gas field in the block, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Some energy experts, however, termed the bidding results as
"disastrous." As by the government's experience with Cairn and
Occidental in the past, the production-sharing contracts were not
profitable for the country if they were not modified, they said.
</P>
<P>
The whole county has been divided into 23 blocks for
exploration of gas and oil, of which eight blocks were allotted to
bidders in the first round of bidding, with six awarded to four
U.S. companies and two to a British company.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, Bangladesh signed an agreement with the U.S. on
"Strategic Gas Utilization Study" to identify the uses of the
country's natural gas. The study was expected to be completed by
1999.
</P>
<P>
And U.S. company Mobil Oil and Jamuna Oil Company of Bangladesh
signed an agreement on the same day for setting up an import
terminal for liquefied petroleum gas and two lubricant oil
blending plants in the country's southeastern Chittagong Port.
</P>
<P>
The 25 million U.S.-dollar joint project, which was likely to
be completed by late next year, would initially produce 80,000
tons of liquefied petroleum gas against a current nationwide
demand of 500,000 tons, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia on Kosovo: Consensus First, Talks Later </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir
Bulatovich said Sunday his government will not enter into peace
talks before a consensus is reached on ending terrorism in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In addition to conditioning dialogues with ethnic Albanians,
Bulatovich said there would be no talks with the Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA) engaging "terrorist activities" in the past five months.
</P>
<P>
Serbian forces have been fighting against the KLA to crush the
latter's efforts seeking independence of the Yugoslav province,
where ethnic Albanians account for 90 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
As extremists among ethnic Albanians are dreaming about a
"Great Serbia," Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic should not
be blamed for the crisis, Bulatovich told the press in Nikssich.
</P>
<P>
If the Republic of Serbia's territorial integrity is observed,
the Kosovo issue should have been solved through dialogues by
granting some extent of autonomy to the province, he was quoted as
saying by the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Calls for Comprehensive Security in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Foreign Secretary
Domingo Siazon called here Monday for comprehensive and flexible
security in the face of new developments in the Asian-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
Siazon, chairman of the Fifth ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), said
in his opening statement of the one-day ARF that the concept of
regional security the ARF is adopting "should by no means be
limited to political-military security."
</P>
<P>
As the region faces challenges of diverse nature, such as
environmental degradation, natural disasters and economic
slowdown, ASEAN and its dialogue partners and observers must
continually renew their thinking about the nature of security,
Siazon said.
</P>
<P>
"Our paradigm should be flexible enough to allow us to be
responsive to the dynamic nature of the international environment,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
In the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting held here earlier, Thailand
and the Philippines raised the idea of changing ASEAN's
"non-intervention" policy to "flexible engagement" when the
domestic developments in a country have transboundary effects.
</P>
<P>
Most ASEAN countries were strongly opposed to the policy
change.
</P>
<P>
Siazon, however, said the comprehensive security does not mean
that ASEAN and its partners should shelve their traditional
security concerns.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, we should revitalize cooperation and dialogue
regarding these traditional concerns," he said.
</P>
<P>
There are many issues in the political-military sphere still
facing the region today, including the current Asian economic
slowdown, disarmament and landmines and nuclear weapons, Siazon
said.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
As a multilateral consultative forum aimed at promoting
preventive diplomacy and confidence building among the states in
the region, the ARF consists of the ASEAN member countries, the 10
ASEAN dialogue partners (Australia, Canada, China, the European
Union, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia and the
U.S.) and the two observers (Cambodia and Papua New Guinea).

<P>
DHAKA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- At least 14 people were killed and
more than 65 others injured on Sunday in three road accidents in
Bangladesh, press reports here said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In Manikganj, 50 kilometers northwest of here, at least seven

</P>
<P>
In the northwestern Thakurgaon district, a truck carrying
cattle traders skidded off the road killing five people and
injuring 30 others.
</P>
<P>
Police and survivors said the Panchagarh-bound truck from
Bogra, 170 kilometers northwest of Dhaka, plunged into a roadside
ditch. Villagers rushed to the scene, rescued the injured and sent
them to hospitals, they said.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Chinese FM's Address at ARF (part 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan made an address at the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) which
opened its annual ministerial meeting here Monday morning. The
following is the full text of the address:
Mr. Chairman,
</P>
<P>
It is a great pleasure for me to attend this ARF Ministerial
Meeting as China's new foreign minister. I wish to thank our host,
the government of the Philippines, for its warm hospitality and
thoughtful arrangements for the meeting. I would also like to take
this opportunity to offer, once again, my cordial congratulations
to the Philippines on the centennial of its independence which it
greeted not long ago. I believe that under Chairman Siazon's
outstanding presidency and with the concerted efforts of all ARF
participating countries, this meeting will be a success.
</P>
<P>
The past year has been one of continued significant and
profound changes in the Asia-Pacific region: Major powers have
further readjusted and improved their relations, countries have
strengthened dialogue and cooperation and there have been
gradually deeper-going regional multilateral economic and security
dialogue and cooperation. Peace, development and cooperation
remain the main trend in the regional situation.
</P>
<P>
However, destabilizing factors have apparently increase in the
Asia-Pacific: India and then Pakistan conducted nuclear tests,
plunging South Asia into a sudden wave of tension. As implications
of the financial crisis spread, new problems have cropped up one
after another in the process of regional development. The Cold-War
mentality still has its influence in the region. Such acts as
reinforcing military alliance and interfering in other countries'
internal affairs continue to occur.
</P>
<P>
As it stands, the issues of peace and development are far from
being settled and remain the two major themes confronting us.
</P>
<P>
The practice and experience of the ARF over nearly five years
have shown that in order to secure lasting peace and development
in the Asia-Pacific, it is necessary to nurture a new security
approach and seek new ways of safeguarding Peace:
</P>
<P>
1. To develop state-to-state relations on the basis of the Five

Principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial
integrity,
mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal
affairs,
equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence constitutes
the
political foundation and prerequisite of security at both regional
and
international levels. Healthy and stable relations among major
powers and
mutual trust and friendly cooperation among countries of different
types
form an important part of peace and security. In this sense,
improvement
and growth of China-U.S. relations conform to the trend of the
times and
to the fundamental interests of the two peoples and are also
conducive to
regional and world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
2. To increase mutual understanding and trust through dialogue
and
cooperation and undertake to settle state-to-state disputes and
conflicts
through peaceful means are a practical way of ensuring peace and
security.
Security is mutual. History has already proven that the security
concept
and mechanism based on military alliance and achieved through the
build-up of military strength cannot make lasting peace. In this
diversified
region of the Asia-Pacific, it is all the more necessary to work
to
enhance mutual understanding and trust through dialogue and
cooperation.
The act of creating imaginary enemies or fabricating sources of
threat
directed at a third country eventually can only harm others and
more so
oneself.
</P>
<P>
3. Economic growth and common prosperity are the material basis
for
regional and global security. In today's world when the
international
situation moves toward relaxation and economic development faces a
rare
opportunity, to concentrate limited resources on economic and
social
development is an easier way for a country to move into the ranks
of
strong nations of the world, and provides a positive guarantee for

national and regional security as well. If a contrary approach is
adopted,
i.e. insisting on arms expansion, that will not be in keeping with
the
progress of the times. Nor will it help a country to enhance its
national
strength and status. What is more, it may even have a negative
impact on
peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the East Asian financial crisis fully indicates
that
economic security has increasingly become an inseparable part of
national
or regional stability. The East Asian financial crisis broke out
ferociously and has caused such tremendous damage which is no less
than
that of a war. For this reason, the ARF should approach the
subject of
safeguarding economic security in an in-depth manner from the
perspective
of comprehensive security.

<HEADLINE> Exports Up, Trade Deficit Down in Czech Republic: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- With upsurges of 32.2 percent in
exports and 16.8 percent in imports, the Czech Republic recorded a
53.6 percent decline in trade deficit in the year's first half.
</P>
<P>
The export rise, over the same period last year, boosted the
volume to an equivalent of 14.06 billion U.S. dollars in the first
six months, said the Czech Statistical Office in a latest report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports totalled 15.14 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
As the result, the half-year deficit, once exceeding the
internationally recognized alarming benchmark proportional to the
gross domestic product (GDP), was down to 1.08 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the annual trade deficit in 1996 and 1997 stood
at 5.16 billion dollars and 4.52 billion dollars respectively,
posing as a big problem in the Czech Republic's economic health.
</P>
<P>
Facing the downturn in foreign trade starting from 1994, the
government has taken measures to curb imports and restructure
exports, with their effectiveness beginning to substantiate now.
</P>
<P>
Given the latest official trade statistics, observers here
described the first half of the year as the best in five years.
</P>
<P>
If the trend is to continue, deficit of the entire year is
expected to go down by half compared to that of last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
It is true that there are different views and perceptions with
regard to the concept and meaning of economic security. It is our
preliminary thought that the primary essence of economic security
is to safeguard the economic sovereignty of a state, of which
financial security stands at the core. Economic security is based,
first of all, on formulating the right strategy for economic
growth and enhancing a country's economic might and
competitiveness. It is based on political stability, the
inviolability of sovereignty, and respect for its model of
development. Meanwhile, it is necessary for countries to take an
active part in and work to promote regional economic cooperation
and coordination, readjust and improve the existing international
economic and financial order and, in particular, to strengthen
supervision over and take strict precautions against excessive
speculation. Economic security is mutual, and it is inadvisable to
try to shift one's troubles onto others.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Chairman,
</P>
<P>
As the sole government-level channel for security dialogue in
the Asia-Pacific region, the ARF is, under the new circumstances,
playing an ever-greater role in enhancing mutual confidence among
Asian-Pacific countries and promoting regional peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
For the past year, the ARF has made active exploration
centering on confidence-building and achieved remarkable and
concrete results. The ARF spirit and approach have fostered,
namely equal participation, consensus-making, seeking common
ground while shelving differences and incremental progress. This
is attributable to the political commitments and active
involvement of ARF participants and, more importantly, to the
leadership and organization of ASEAN. The Chinese side highly
appreciates it and supports ASEAN in continuing to be the driving
force.
</P>
<P>
At present, the ARF's future direction has drawn much
attention. For reasons both past and present, it is still an
arduous task to build confidence among Asia-Pacific nations. Over
the past five years, the ARF has accumulated some useful
experience and formulated certain principles in the process of
enhancing mutual understanding and confidence among its
participants. The Chinese Delegation holds that on the basis of
summarizing those experience and principles, it is necessary to
lay down the guiding principles for building confidence and
conducting security dialogue and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific
region. At the same time, the ARF should continue to make timely
exploration of the overlapping subject matters of
confidence-building measures and preventive diplomacy as well as
the ways and means of addressing them. When conditions are ripe,
we can probe the theories and approaches of preventive diplomacy
which are suited to regional features. We believe that under the
guidance of correct principles, ARF's dialogue and cooperation
will be more fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Chairman,
</P>
<P>
As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China is
committed to maintaining peace, stability, development and
cooperation in the Asia-Pacific. China has fulfilled its share of
responsibility and obligation both in alleviating East Asia's
financial crisis and in easing up the tension in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, China's relations with the U.S., Russia,
Japan, ASEAN and the European Union have all grown stronger. To
seek converging points of common interests and to strengthen
coordination and cooperation have become the main trend of various
partnerships.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and
Tajikistan met and issued a joint statement, in which they
undertake to adopt all necessary measures to ensure the strict
implementation of the Shanghai agreement and the Moscow agreement
reached by the five countries. That gives expression to the
development of a new type of security approach and is a fresh
contribution to consolidating regional and global security and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Following the publication of the white paper China: Arms
Control and Disarmament in 1995, China is going to issue a new
white paper on national defense, a testimony to its firm
commitment to maintaining regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Proceeding from the overall interests of safeguarding regional
peace and stability, China continues to persist in the settlement
of disputes with its neighboring countries through friendly
consultation and negotiation.
</P>
<P>
China will, as always, participate in the multi-tiered and
multi-channeled dialogues and cooperation in the security field of
the Asia-Pacific region. China was, is and will be a staunch force
in maintaining regional and global peace and stability and a
positive factor promoting common development.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Half-Year Coffee Exports Down 28 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Brazil exported 5.4 million
sacks of coffee, each weighing 60 kilograms, in the year's first
six months, down 28 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Federation of Coffee Exporters said coffee export
earnings in the first six months were 984 million U.S. dollars,
off from the 1.37 billion dollars in the 1997 January-June period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, earnings from the country's exports of instant
coffee decreased from last year's 153 million dollars to 134
million dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the drop of coffee exports to the weakening
coffee prices at the international market this year.
</P>
<P>
As the world's number one coffee producer and exporter,
Brazil's annual coffee output is 28 percent of the world's total
and exports are 21 percent of the global coffee trade.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's National Agriculture Confederation said the country's
coffee output this year is estimated to reach 30 million sacks, a
record high in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The trade association expected to see a turn for the better in
the second half of the year and the country's coffee exports in
the six-month period reach the total sum of last year's.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 alone, Brazil sold 14.6 million sacks out of a total of
22 million and pocketed 2.8 billion dollars. The exports and
revenues increased 13 percent and 65 percent respectively from the
previous year.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan Monday called for strengthened cooperation and expanded
consensus between China and the United States, saying the two
countries now have an important opportunity for improving and
promoting their ties.
</P>
<P>
"At present, the relations between our two countries are facing
a major opportunity for further improvement and development," Tang
said while meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
here.
</P>
<P>
He noted that to realize the strategic plan of the two
countries' heads of state concerning the Sino-U.S. ties, "we
should strengthen cooperation, expand consensus, handle
appropriately the differences and problems between the two
countries, remove existing and potential interfering factors and
continue to push forward the Sino-U.S. relationship" on the basis
of the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and the Sino-U.S. Joint
Statement.
</P>
<P>
Both Tang and Albright are here attending the annual ASEAN
Regional Forum meeting and Post-Ministerial Meeting between member
countries and dialogue partners of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Tang noted that it was the first meeting between the Chinese
foreign minister and U.S. secretary of state after President Bill
Clinton's state visit to China and he pledged to work together
with Secretary of State Albright in promoting further improvement
and development of the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He described as "very successful" President Clinton's visit,
which took place not long ago, saying it marked a new phase in the
Sino-U.S. ties.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that during the visit, the heads of state of the two
countries decided to step up their effort for building a
constructive partnership between China and the United States and
reached major consensus on the expansion of cooperation and
exchange in wide-ranging areas.
</P>
<P>
The visit achieved positive and constructive results and won
widespread welcome from the two peoples and the international
community, he declared.
</P>
<P>
Albright agreed to Foreign Minister Tang's views. She thanked
the Chinese government and people for the work they had done for
President Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
The hospitality of the Chinese people and the beautiful scenery
of China left deep impressions on President Clinton and his party,
she said.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the U.S.-Chinese relations are moving in a
positive direction.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state said the U.S. Congress has passed
legislation to change what used to be called Most Favored Nation
(MFN) status to "normal trade relations" (NTR) and vetoed a bill
calling for an end to China's MFN status.
</P>
<P>
This shows that economic cooperation and trade between the two
countries and their relationship as a whole are witnessing sound
development.
</P>
<P>
Tang and Albright also exchanged views on the latest
developments in the situation in South Asia following the nuclear
tests carried out by India and Pakistan in May.
</P>
<P>
They shared the view that the objectives set out in the joint
communique issued by the foreign ministers of the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council -- Britain, China, France,
Russia and the United States -- at their meeting in Geneva earlier
this year and U.N. Security Council Resolution 1172 denouncing the
tests should be maintained.
</P>
<P>
The two sides expressed readiness to work together with the
international community and urge India and Pakistan to implement
the demands raised by the two documents as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to keep in touch and exchange views concerning the
situation in South Asia.

Foreword
</P>
<P>
Mankind is about to enter the 21st century of its history. It
is the aspiration of the Chinese government and people to lead a
peaceful, stable and prosperous world into the new century.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, an important historical period,
China is devoting itself to its modernization drive. China needs
and cherishes dearly an environment of long-term international
peace, especially a favorable peripheral environment.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people are willing, together with the people of the
other countries in the world, to make unremitting efforts for the
lofty cause of promoting world peace and development, and for
initiating a glorious future for mankind.
</P>
<P>
Guided by its aspiration for peace and development, China
unswervingly pursues a national defense policy that is defensive
in nature, keeps national defense construction in a position
subordinate to and in the service of the nation's economic
construction, strengthens international and regional security
cooperation and actively participates in the international arms
control and disarmament process. Facts show that China is a
responsible big country and a firm force safeguarding world peace
and stability.
</P>
<P>
In 1995. China issued a white paper titled "China: Arms Control
and Disarmament," which mainly describes China's substantial
efforts and progress in the sphere of arms control and
disarmament. Here China wishes to present a further introduction
to and exposition of her work in defense.

I. The International Security Situation
</P>
<P>
Peace and development are the major themes of the present
era. The striving for peace and cooperation, and the promotion of
development have become irresistible historical trends.
</P>
<P>
In general, the present international security situation has
continued to tend toward relaxation. With the end of the cold war,
a tendency toward multipolarity has further developed both
globally or regionally in the political, economic and other fields
as various world forces are experiencing new splits and
realignments.
</P>
<P>
The relations among the major powers are undergoing significant
and profound readjustments; various kinds of partnerships are
gradually developing along the line of institutionalization; and
each country is enhancing its consciousness of independence, unity
for strength, and coordinated development.
</P>
<P>
The overall strength of the developing countries is growing,
and they are becoming an important force on the international
stage. The sustained development of the multipolarity tendency and
economic globalization has further deepened their mutual reliance
and mutual condition and helped toward world peace, stability and
prosperity. The factors for safeguarding world peace are growing
constantly.
</P>
<P>
The influence of armed conflicts and local wars on the overall
international situation has been remarkably weakened. In the past,
when the two major military blocs confronted each other, armed
conflicts and local wars in some regions seriously disturbed world
security and stability.
</P>
<P>
For a time in the post-cold war period, regional conflicts were
still frequent, even showing a trend of escalation. In the past
few years, however, some conflicts and wars that had lasted for
many years have been settled, and some are being put on the track
of political settlement, or are gradually being cooled down.
</P>
<P>
At present, armed conflicts and local wars touched off by
disputes about territory, natural resources, ethnicity or religion
are relatively limited in terms of scale, intensity and region,
and are under control to varying degrees. The international
community is making more and more efforts to mediate such
disputes, with its capability to do so improving constantly.

<P>
Military factors still occupy an important position in state
security. In the new international security environment, while
stressing the settlement of disputes through political, economic
and diplomatic means, most countries still regard military means
and the reinforcement of military strength as important ways to
safeguard their own security and national interests.
</P>
<P>
A profound reform in the military field led by the development
of high-tech weapons is taking place throughout the world. This
reform, which is developing rapidly, will exert an important and
profound influence on weaponry, military system and setup, combat
training and military theory.
</P>
<P>
To adapt to the new situation and strive for their own
advantages, many countries have readjusted their defense policies
and military strategies, reduced the scale of armaments and paid
more attention to improving the quality of their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Economic security is becoming daily more important for state
security. In international relations, geopolitical, military
security and ideological factors still play a role that cannot be
ignored, but the role of economic factors is becoming more
outstanding, along with growing economic contacts among nations.
</P>
<P>
The competition to excel in overall national strength, focused
on economy and science and technology, is being further
intensified; globewide struggles centered on markets, natural
resources and other economic rights and interests are daily
becoming sharper; and the quickening of economic globalization and
intensification of the formation of regional blocs render the
economic development of a country more vulnerable to outside
influences and impacts.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, more and more countries regard economic security as
an important aspect of state security. The financial crisis in
Asia has made the issue of economic security more prominent, and
has set out a new task for governments of all countries to
strengthen coordination and face challenges together in the course
of economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
The political security situation in the Asia-Pacific region is
relatively stable. The development of the trend toward
multipolarity in this region is being quickened, and the relations
among the big nations are being readjusted strategically and
gradually becoming stable.
</P>
<P>
Despite the emergence of a financial crisis in Asia, the
Asia-Pacific region remains one of the areas with the greatest
economic development vitality in the world, and developing the
economy is the most important task for each country.
</P>
<P>
The countries in the Asia-Pacific region rely more and more on
each other economically, and, to solve their disputes by peaceful
means, to stress the search for the meeting points of their common
interests and to strengthen cooperation and coordination are
becoming the main current of the relations among the countries of
the region.
</P>
<P>
Various forms of regional and sub-regional multilateral
cooperation are constantly being developed, and security dialogues
and cooperation are being carried out at many levels and through
many channels.

<P>
However, there still exist some factors of instability both
globally and regionally: hegemonism and power politics remain the
main source of threats to world peace and stability; cold war
mentality and its influence still have a certain currency, and the
enlargement of military blocs and the strengthening of military
alliances have added factors of instability to international
security; some countries, by relying on their military advantages,
pose military threats to other countries, even resorting to armed
intervention; the old unfair and irrational international economic
order still damages the interests of developing countries; local
conflicts caused by ethnic, religious, territorial, natural
resources and other factors arise now and then, and questions left
over by history among countries remain unsolved; terrorism, arms
proliferation, smuggling and trafficking in narcotics,
environmental pollution, waves of refugees, and other
transnational issues also pose new threats to international
security.
</P>
<P>
In May 1998, in defiance of strong opposition by the
international community India flagrantly carried out nuclear
tests, thus provoking a nuclear arms race in South Asia. Then
Pakistan followed suit, in response to India's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear tests successively conducted by India and Pakistan
have seriously impeded the international nuclear weapons
non-proliferation efforts and produced grave consequences on peace
and stability in the South Asian region and the rest of the
world. The task for the international community to strengthen
non-proliferation mechanisms has become even more pressing now.
</P>
<P>
History has proved that the concepts and systems of security
with military alliances as the basis and increasing military might
as the means could not be conducive to peace during the cold
war. Under the new situation, especially, enlarging military blocs
and strengthening military alliances run counter to the tide of
the times. Security cannot be guaranteed by an increase in arms,
nor by military alliances. Security should be based on mutual
trust and common interests.
</P>
<P>
We should promote trust through dialogue, seek security through
cooperation, respect each other's sovereignty, solve disputes
through peaceful means and strive for common development.

<TEXT>
<P>
To obtain lasting peace, it is imperative to abandon the cold
war mentality, cultivate a new concept of security and seek a new
way to safeguard peace. China believes that this new concept and
way should include the following:
</P>
<P>
-- The relations among nations should be established on the
basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence: mutual
respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual
non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs,
equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. These are
the political basis and premise of global and regional
security. Each country has the right to choose its own social
system, development strategy and way of life, and no country
should interfere in the internal affairs of any other country in
any way or under any pretext, much less resort to military threats
or aggression.
</P>
<P>
-- In the economic field, all countries should strengthen
mutually beneficial cooperation, open up to each other, eliminate
inequalities and discriminatory policies in economic and trade
relations, gradually reduce the development gaps between countries
and seek common prosperity. Such steps can form the economic basis
of global and regional security. Maintaining a normal and sound
economic, trade and financial order calls for not only a perfect
macro-economic management system as well as a sound system of
economic operations, it also calls for strengthening regional and
international economic contacts and cooperation, so as to jointly
create a stable and secure external economic environment.
</P>
<P>
-- All countries should promote mutual understanding and trust
through dialogue and cooperation, and seek the settlement of
divergences and disputes among nations through peaceful means.
These are the realistic ways to guarantee peace and
security. Security is mutual, and security dialogues and
cooperation should be aimed at promoting trust, not at creating
confrontations, still less at directing the spearhead against a
third country or infringing upon the security interests of any
other nation.

II. National Defense Policy
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government firmly pursues a national defense policy
that is defensive in nature. The Constitution of the People's
Republic of China (PRC) clearly specifies the tasks of the armed
forces of the PRC as being to consolidate national defense, resist
aggression, defend the motherland, safeguard the people's peaceful
labor, participate in national construction and strive to serve
the people.
</P>
<P>
China's state interests, social system, foreign policy and
historical and cultural traditions postulate that China will
inevitably adopt such a national defense policy.
</P>
<P>
China has always attached primary importance to safeguarding
the state's sovereignty, unity, territorial integrity and
security. Following the Opium War in 1840, China was gradually
reduced to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country, and the
Chinese nation was subject to the imperialist powers' invasion,
oppression, bullying and humiliation time and time again.
</P>
<P>
After a protracted, persistent and heroic struggle, the Chinese
people won the independence for their country and the emancipation
of the nation; therefore they hold dear their hard-earned right to
independence. Defending the motherland, resisting aggression,
safeguarding unity and opposing split are the starting point and
underpinning of China's defense policy.
</P>
<P>
China being at the primary stage of socialism, the fundamental
task of the state is to concentrate its strength on the socialist
modernization program. The situation in which China has a large
population, a poor foundation, uneven regional development and
underdeveloped productive forces will continue for a comparatively
long period of time to come.
</P>
<P>
China is now confronted with the extremely heavy task of
economic construction, so the work in defense must be subordinate
to and in the service of the nation's overall economic
construction. The social system, development strategy and way of
life that China has chosen conform to the actual conditions of the
country, and no factors prompting invasion of another country can
emerge.
</P>
<P>
The development of China requires an environment of long-term
international peace, especially a favorable peripheral
environment. China unswervingly pursues an independent foreign
policy of peace, advocates handling international affairs in light
of the fundamental interests of the Chinese and other peoples of
the world, and refrains from forming alliances with any big power
or any group of countries.
</P>
<P>
China holds that conflicts and disputes among countries should
be solved in a peaceful way through consultation, and opposes the
use or threat of use of force, hegemonism and power
politics. China advocates establishing a new fair and rational
international political and economic order, and developing
relations of friendship and cooperation with all countries on the
basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
China will always be an important force defending world peace
and regional stability. Even when China becomes strong and
powerful in the future, it will by no means take to the road of
foreign aggression and expansion.

<P>
As a country in the Asia-Pacific region, China places great
importance on the region's security, stability, peace and
development. China's Asia-Pacific security strategy has three
objectives, i.e., China's own stability and prosperity, peace and
stability in its surrounding regions, and conducting dialogue and
cooperation with all countries in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Hence China devotes its efforts to promoting equal treatment
and friendly cooperation with other countries, and attaches
importance to developing healthy and stable relations with all
countries and all major forces in the region; actively
participates in regional economic cooperation and promotes an open
type of regionalism; insists on handling and settling disputes
among countries through peaceful means; and takes an active part
in the dialogue and cooperation process aimed at regional security.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of equal consultation, mutual understanding and
mutual accommodation, China has solved in an appropriate manner
border issues with most of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
As for remaining disputes on territorial and marine rights and
interests between China and neighboring countries, China maintains
that they are to be solved through consultation by putting the
interests of the whole above everything else, so that the disputes
will not hamper the normal development of state relations or the
stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
China has clearly stated that relevant disputes should be
properly solved through peaceful negotiation and consultation, in
accordance with commonly accepted international laws and modern
maritime laws, including the basic principles and legal systems as
prescribed in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the
Sea.

Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory. It is a
lofty mission and a common aspiration of all Chinese people,
including the Taiwan compatriots, to put an end to the cleavage
between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits and realize the
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government adheres to its stand for solving the
issue of Taiwan according to the basic principle of "peaceful
reunification, and one country, two systems," and resolutely
opposes any attempt, by words or deeds, to split the country by
creating an "independent Taiwan," "two Chinas," or "one China, one
Taiwan." The issue of Taiwan is entirely an internal affair of
China. Directly or indirectly incorporating the Taiwan Straits
into the security and cooperation sphere of any country or any
military alliance is an infringement upon and interference in
China's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government seeks to achieve the reunification of
the country by peaceful means, but will not commit itself not to
resort to force. Every sovereign state has the right to use all
means it thinks necessary, including military means, to safeguard
its own sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
In deciding which way to deal with the issue of Taiwan, the
Chinese government has no obligation to make a commitment to any
country or any person attempting to split China. The Chinese
government opposes any country selling arms to Taiwan, which not
only violates the basic norms of international law but also
threatens China's security and regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government steadfastly follows an independent
foreign policy of peace, and stands for establishing and
developing relations of friendship and cooperation with all
countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence and other commonly recognized international
relationship norms. China is willing to make unswerving efforts to
safeguard world peace and promote international security together
with other countries.

<P>
The defensive nature of China's national defense policy also
springs from the country's historical and cultural traditions.
China is a country with 5,000 years of civilization, and a
peace-loving tradition. Ancient Chinese thinkers advocated
"associating with benevolent gentlemen and befriending good
neighbors," which shows that throughout history the Chinese people
have longed for peace in the world and for relations of friendship
with the people of other countries.
</P>
<P>
In military affairs, this maxim means solving disputes by
non-military means, being wary of war and strategically gaining
mastery by striking only after the enemy has struck. During the
course of several thousand years, loving peace, stressing defense,
seeking unification, promoting national unity, and jointly
resisting foreign aggression have always been the main ideas of
China's defense concept. The defense policy of New China has
carried forward and developed such excellent Chinese historical
and cultural traditions.
</P>
<P>
China's defense policy has mainly the following aspects:
</P>
<P>
-- Consolidating national defense, resisting aggression,
curbing armed subversion, and defending the state's sovereignty,
unity, territorial integrity and security. These are the basic
objectives of China's defense policy, as well as the main tasks
the Chinese Constitution has entrusted to China's armed forces.
China spares no effort to avoid and curb war, and to solve
international disputes and questions left over by history through
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
However, as long as hegemonism and power politics still exist,
a country must have the capability to defend its sovereignty,
unity, territorial integrity and security by military means. The
modernization program of China's national defense work is entirely
for self-defense, and arises from the need to safeguard the
country's modernization drive and security. The size of China's
armed forces is suited to the needs of defending the country's
security and interests. China builds and consolidates its national
defense independently and through self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
-- Subordinating national defense work to, and placing it in
the service of, the nation's overall economic construction, and
achieving the coordinated development of these two kinds of
work. This is China's long-term basic policy for its work in
defense. The modernization of the national defense of a country
requires the support of its economic and technological forces; and
the modernization level of national defense can only be improved
gradually along with the increase of the country's economic
strength.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government insists that economic construction be
taken as the center, that defense work be subordinate to and in
the service of the nation's overall economic construction and that
the armed forces actively participate in and support the nation's
economic construction. While concentrating its efforts on economic
construction, the state also endeavors to improve its national
defense work and to promote a coordinated development of the
two.

<TEXT>
<P>
-- Implementing the military strategy of active defense.
Strategically China pursues the defensive policy featuring
self-defense and gaining mastery by striking only after the enemy
has struck, and adheres to the principle: "We will not attack
unless we are attacked; if we are attacked, we will certainly
counter-attack."
</P>
<P>
China possesses a small number of nuclear weapons, entirely for
meeting the needs of self-defense. China upholds the principle of
self-defense by the whole people and the strategic concept of
people's war, and works hard to enhance the defense consciousness
of the whole people, perfect the defense mobilization system and
intensify the building of the reserve force for defense.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of its existing weaponry, China carries forward
and develops its fine traditions. It seeks to adapt to profound
changes in the world's military sphere, and makes proper
preparations for defensive combat in the situation where modern
technology, especially high technology, prevails.
</P>
<P>
-- Streamlining the army the Chinese way. During the new
historical period, the Chinese army is working hard to improve its
quality and endeavoring to streamline the army the Chinese way,
aiming to form a revolutionized, modernized and regularized
people's army with Chinese characteristics. Reducing quantity and
improving quality is a basic principle upon which the army is to
be modernized.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese army strengthens itself by relying on science and
technology, and strives to make the transition from a numerically
superior type to a qualitatively efficient type, and from a
manpower-intensive type to a technology-intensive type. In view of
the characteristics of modern wars, no effort will be spared to
improve the modernization level of weaponry, reform and perfect
the army system and setup, and improve the training of troops and
curricula and teaching methods of military academies.
</P>
<P>
-- Safeguarding world peace, and opposing aggression and
expansion. China upholds the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence, and handles foreign military relations and engages in
military exchanges and cooperation independently. China does not
seek hegemonism, nor does it seek military blocs or military
expansion. China does not station any troops or set up any
military bases in any foreign country.
</P>
<P>
China opposes the arms race, and maintains that effective arms
control and disarmament should be carried out in accordance with
the principles of fairness, rationality, comprehensiveness and
balance. China supports the international community in its
activities to promote world and regional peace, security and
stability, and also in its efforts to fairly and rationally solve
international disputes and to bring about arms control and
disarmament.

III. National Defense Construction
</P>
<P>
China's national defense construction is an important part of
its modernization program. Given the new historical conditions the
Chinese army upholds the absolute leadership of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), implements the strategic principle of active
defense, emphasizes quality in army building, administrates the
armed forces along legal lines, engages in army building through
diligence and thrift, and actively participates in and supports
national economic construction. As a result, it has made great
contributions to the country's security, stability and
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Defense System
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Constitution, the National Defense Law
and other relevant laws, China has established and improved its
national defense system. The state exercises unified leadership
over defense-related activities.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress (NPC) of the People's Republic
of China (PRC) is the highest organ of state power. It decides on
the questions of war and peace, and exercises other
defense-related functions and powers provided for in the
Constitution. The Standing Committee of the NPC is the NPC's
permanent body. It decides on the proclamation of a state of war,
decides on general or partial mobilization, and exercises other
defense-related functions and powers provided for in the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The president of the state, in accordance with decisions of the
NPC and its Standing Committee, proclaims a state of war, issues
mobilization orders and exercises other defense-related functions
and powers provided for in the Constitution. The State Council
directs and administrates national defense work, and the Central
Military Commission (CMC) directs and assumes unified command of
the nation's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) is organized in
accordance with a system whereby the General Staff Department, the
General Political Department, the General Logistics Department and
the General Armament Department are placed under the leadership of
the CMC. The General Staff Department organizes and leads the
building-up of the nation's armed forces, and organizes and
directs their military operations. The General Political
Department administrates the army's Party work and organizes and
conducts its political work. The General Logistics Department
organizes and leads the army's logistics work. The General
Armament Department organizes and leads the army's work in
military equipment.

<P>
The armed forces of the PRC are composed of the PLA, both the
active and reserve components, the Chinese People's Armed Police
Force and the militia.
</P>
<P>
The active components of the PLA comprise the state's standing
army, which mainly undertakes the task of defensive combat, and
helps to maintain social order, if necessary, according to law;
reservists undergo military training in peacetime according to
relevant regulations, and help to maintain social order, if
necessary, according to law, and in wartime they shall be
incorporated in the forces in active service in pursuance of the
state's mobilization order.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese People's Armed Police Force undertakes the tasks
for maintenance of security and social order entrusted by the
state. The militiamen, under the command of military organs,
perform combat service support and defensive operations, and help
to maintain social order. The PLA, comprised of the Army, the
Navy, the Air Force and the Second Artillery Force, is organized
in seven military area commands nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The state exercises unified leadership and planned control over
defense research and production. The State Council leads and
administrates defense research and production, as well as defense
expenditure and assets. The CMC approves the military equipment
system of the armed forces and military equipment development
plans and programs, leads and administrates defense research and
production in coordination with the State Council, and manages
defense outlays and assets jointly with the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The state practices a state military supplies order system to
guarantee the acquisition of weapons and other war materials. The
state practices a financial allocation system for defense
spending. It decides the size, structure and location of the
defense assets and the adjustment and disposal of these assets in
accordance with the needs of national defense and economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
The State Council and the CMC jointly lead mobilization
preparation and implementation work. In peacetime the state
conducts mobilization preparation and integrates armed
mobilization of the people, mobilization of the national economy,
civil air defense, national defense transportation and other
mobilization preparations into the state's overall development
plan and program. It improves the mobilization system step by
step, and establishes a strategic materials storage system. The
state attaches importance to national defense education and
conducts it in line with its plan for economic and social
development.

Military Legislative Work
</P>
<P>
China attaches importance to the building of a military legal
system, regarding the improvement of the work in this regard as a
basic approach and important guarantee for realizing defense
modernization and the regularization of the armed forces. In order
to meet the needs of defense and army building in the new
historical period, the state has laid down the principles for
administrating the armed forces along legal lines. It has improved
its military legislative work comprehensively to ensure that
China's defense and army building advance along a legal track and
to propel it in that direction.
</P>
<P>
Since 1982 the military legislation system has been further
fine-tuned as part of the state legislation system: The NPC and
its Standing Committee have formulated laws on defense and army
building; the CMC has formulated military laws and regulations, or
jointly worked out military administrative laws and regulations
with the State Council; all general departments, all services and
arms and all military area commands of the PLA have drawn up
military rules and regulations or jointly worked out military
administrative rules and regulations with the relevant departments
of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The Interim Regulations on Legislative Procedures of the PLA
promulgated by the CMC contains clear-cut provisions on
legislation programming and planning and the drafting,
examination, promulgation and enforcement of laws and regulations,
which embody the standardization and systemization of military
legislation.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten-odd years, remarkable achievements have been
made in military legislation. The NPC and its Standing Committee
have formulated 12 defense and army-building laws and
legality-related decisions, including the National Defense Law of
the PRC, Military Service Law of the PRC, Military Facilities
Protection Law of the PRC, Civil Air Defense Law of the PRC, Law
on the Reserve Officers of the PRC, the Garrison Law of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region of the PRC, Military Service
Regulations Pertaining to PLA Officers in Active Service, and
Regulations on the Military Ranks of PLA Officers.
</P>
<P>
The State Council and the CMC have worked out 40-odd military
administrative laws and regulations, such as the Regulations on
National Defense Transportation, Regulations on Conscription Work,
Regulations on Militia Work, and Military Service Regulations
Pertaining to PLA Soldiers in Active Service.
</P>
<P>
The CMC has formulated 70-odd military laws and regulations,
including the Regulations of the PLA Headquarters, Regulations on
Political Work in the PLA, Logistics Regulations of the PLA,
Routine Service Regulations of the PLA, Discipline Regulations of
the PLA, and Drill Regulations of the PLA.
</P>
<P>
The various general departments, services and arms and military
area commands have drawn up 1,000-some items of military rules and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Now, China has laws to go by basically in the principal aspects
of its defense and army building, as a military legal system with
Chinese characteristics now is initially in place. While adhering
to the principle of suiting military legislation to its national
and military conditions, China also lays stress on bringing it
into line with the international military-related treaties and
agreements that China has acceded to, so as to make China's
military laws consistent in content with international legal norms
and practices.

China attaches importance to promoting publicity and education
on the law in the armed forces, bringing it into the orbit of the
army's regular education and training. In order to equip officers
and men with knowledge of the law in accordance with the state's
unified plan on publicity and education on the law for all citizens,
the Chinese armed forces carried out two sessions of the Five-Year
Legal Education Program from 1986 to 1995. The Third Five-Year
Legal Education Program started early in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Defense Expenditure
</P>
<P>
China has always stressed a rational scale expenditure on
defense. The costs of defense are allocated based on the needs of
defense and the country's financial capacities and the principle
of overall balance. Since the introduction of the policies of
reform and opening to the outside world, the Chinese government
has strictly controlled its defense expenditure at a comparatively
low level so that it can concentrate on economic construction.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has consistently stuck to the principle
of strict control, strict management and strict supervision of
defense spending; it has established and perfected a complete
administrative and regulatory system. China's defense budget and
final accounts are examined and approved by the NPC, and the state
and army's auditing organs exercise strict audit and supervision
of the execution of the budget.
</P>
<P>
China's expenditure on national defense falls into the
following categories: personnel expenses, mainly including pay,
food and clothing of military and non-military personnel; costs
for maintenance of activities, mainly including military training,
construction and maintenance of facilities and running expenses;
and costs for equipment, including research and experimentation,
procurement, maintenance, transportation and storage.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the scope of logistic support, these expenditures
cover not only active service personnel, but also militia and
reserve requirements. In addition, a large amount of spending are
used to fund activities associated with social welfare, mainly
pensions for some retired officers, schools and kindergartens for
children of military personnel, training personnel competent for
both military and civilian services, supporting national economic
construction, and participation in emergency rescues and disaster
relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
Plain living and hard working is a fine tradition of the
Chinese armed forces. China's military personnel have launched a
sequence of mass movements for practicing economy, such as
conducting checkups of warehouses to make better use of the stored
goods and repairing or utilizing old or discarded things. They
have also done everything they can to join in agricultural and
sideline production or engage in business, mainly for the purpose
of providing employment for dependents of military personnel and
improving the material and cultural lives of officers and men in
grassroots units.

<P>
In the sphere of national defense construction, China has set
up and improved its defense leading system and operating mechanism
at both the central and local levels in accordance with the law,
together with basic national defense systems and institutions,
such as those of military service, mobilization, research and
production, assets management and military facilities protection,
as well as those of giving special care to the bereaved families
of servicemen.
</P>
<P>
In the area of army building, the principles defining the
nature, tasks and building of the armed forces have been
determined in accordance with the law, and a series of important
systems and institutions are in operation, such as those of
military ranks and insignia, military training, headquarters work,
political work, logistic support, garrison service, and military
discipline-related rewards and penalties, which ensure that
national defense activities and army building can be carried out
in an orderly manner, within a legal framework and along a
regulatory line.
</P>
<P>
In order to guarantee the unified implementation of the
nation's relevant laws and regulations in the armed forces, the
state has established mechanisms of military law enforcement and
military judicature, military legal institutions and legal service
organizations, forming a fairly complete military legal system in
the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The military-law enforcement system is mainly formed of
relevant leading organs and functional departments at various
levels. Besides, discipline inspection organs and financial
auditing organs have been set up units at and above the corps
level, which carry out supervision and inspection over law
enforcement, and garrison service organs in garrison units in
large and medium-sized cities, which check, inspect and handle
cases of infringements of military discipline by military
personnel as well as cases of violations of relevant rules by
military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The military judicial system is composed of military courts and
procuratorates established by the state at the three levels of the
PLA, the military area command and the corps, which, together with
the PLA's security departments at various levels, exercise their
respective functions and powers and handle criminal cases
involving military personnel in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
The military legal system is composed of the legal organs or
personnel authorized by the Bureau of Legislative Affairs of the
CMC, the various general departments, services and arms and
military areas commands, and are in charge of the legal work of
the entire PLA as well as the various army units.
</P>
<P>
The legal service organizations are composed of legal advice
offices and legal counseling stations of the army units at various
levels, which provide legal advice and services to help leading
military organs at various levels to make decisions as well as for
individual officers and men.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, over 240 legal advice offices with more
than 1,360 lawyers had been set up by the PLA units, in addition
to more than 4,250 legal counseling stations with 65,700-some
legal consultants at the grassroots level.

<P>
Since the introduction of the policies of reform and opening to
the outside world the Chinese government has placed the work in
national defense in a position subordinate to and in the service
of overall national economic construction and has made relatively
major reductions in defense inputs.
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to 1994 defense spending increased by 6.22 percent
annually in absolute terms, which represented in real terms a
negative growth of 1.08 percent compared to the 7.3 percent annual
increase of the country's general retail price index of
commodities in the same period.
</P>
<P>
China's annual defense outlay from 1995 to 1997 came to RMB
63.672, 72.006 and 81.257 billion yuan, respectively. The annual
increase in defense outlay went for the most part to ensure that
the living standards of military personnel keep up with the
nation's social and economic development and with the increase of
the per capita incomes of urban and rural residents, so as to
improve the living conditions of officers and men. Even so,
defense spending in the total state expenditure declined annually
in the same period, accounting for 9.3, 9.1 and 8.8 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The composition of China's defense expenditure in 1997 (Table
1) was as follows: 29.162 billion yuan for personnel expenses,
accounting for 35.89 percent; 26.536 billion yuan for maintenance
of activities, 32.66 percent; and 25.559 billion yuan for
equipment, 31.45 percent.
</P>
<P>
From the above, we can see that most of the defense outlay went
to the personnel's living costs and maintenance of normal
activities. In addition, more than four billion yuan, or about 5
percent, was spent to fund activities associated with social
welfare.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the defense expenditures of some other countries,
China has a fairly low level of defense spending (Table 2).

</P>
<P>
China's defense expenditure is low in relative terms, as well

has declined successively (Table 3).

Reducing Military Personnel
</P>
<P>
In September 1997 China solemnly announced that it would reduce
the number of its military personnel by 500,000 within the coming
three years on the basis of its disarmament move in the 1980s,
which had cut the number by one million. This important strategic
decision of unilateral disarmament once again fully expressed
China's genuine wish for peace. It was a new effort made by China
to further promote the lowering of the world's armament level,
increase mutual trust and advance the cause of peace for humanity.
</P>
<P>
Adhering to the defensive policy for national security, China
has always controlled the numbers and size of its armed forces
within the limit allowed by the national strength and necessary to
maintain state security.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of the PRC in 1949, China undertook two
disarmament steps -- one in 1955 and the other in 1958. In the
mid-1980s China's guideline for army building was strategically
shifted from all-time preparedness against a large-scale war of
aggression to peacetime construction, and the size and structure
of the armed forces were adjusted accordingly. In 1985 the
government decided unilaterally to cut its troops by one million
men in real terms. By 1990, the total reduction had reached 1.039
million men. Since 1990 the size of the PLA has further shrunk
through successive adjustments. When the drawdown of 500,000 has
been completed, the total size of the PLA will be 2.5 million men.
</P>
<P>
Different from many other countries, China includes all its
border and coastal defense forces, military service mobilization
organs, administration organs of military-run agricultural and
sideline productions, civil cadres and active service personnel in
the reserve service forces in the overall strength of the PLA.
</P>
<P>
China's latest disarmament move will be carried out actively
and steadily, and completed within the planned three years. The
reductions in the land, naval and air forces account for 19
percent, 11.6 percent and 11 percent respectively. While the
numbers of men are being reduced, steps are being taken in tandem
to optimize the structure, adjust the composition and
intra-relationship, and enhance the competence of the armed forces
by enhancing their scientific and technological knowledge, so as
to raise the modernization of the Chinese armed forces to a new
level.

Participating in and Supporting National Construction
</P>
<P>
Participating in and supporting the country's construction is
an important task entrusted by the Constitution to the Chinese
armed forces, and a reflection of the fundamental purpose of the
people's army -- to serve the people wholeheartedly. Since the
1980s, while fulfilling its education and training tasks, the
Chinese army has taken an active part in and fully supported the
nation's economic construction, and through this it has made
significant contributions to the country's prosperity and
development.
</P>
<P>
-- Turning military facilities over to the public or converting
them to civilian use. While cutting down large numbers of
personnel, the Chinese armed forces have transferred part of their
military facilities to local authorities or opened them to the
public to support the country's construction. Over the past 20
years China's armed forces have opened 101 airports to the public,
and opened or surrendered 29 harbors and docks, more than 300
special railway lines, 90 telecommunications lines, 1,000-some
warehouses and over three million square meters of land on former
military reserves and some barracks facilities.
</P>
<P>
-- Participating in emergency rescues and disaster relief
work. China has a vast territory, and local natural disasters are
frequent. Whenever a natural disaster occurs, the armed forces are
always in the forefront of efforts to protect the people's lives
and save the state and people's property. Over the past two
decades they have participated in emergency rescues and disaster
relieves on more than 100,000 occasions. They have mobilized more
than 23 million men, and organized more than one million vehicle
trips, and some 15,000 plane and ship journeys to save more than
10 million people and transport more than 200 million tons of
materials out of perilous conditions.
</P>
<P>
-- Participating in the construction of key national and local
projects. The armed forces have participated in the construction
of many key national and local projects and undertaken urgent,
difficult and dangerous tasks connected with them. In the past two
decades they have devoted more than 400 million work days and
organized 25 million vehicle trips to participate in and support
10,000-odd key projects, including 150 railway, expressway and
underground railway projects, 340 tunnels and culverts, 260
bridges, 4,100 kilometers of highways and railways, 50 docks, 40
civil and military-civil airports, 500 energy projects, 2,000
water conservancy projects, 20,000 kilometers of optical cable
telecommunication lines and 500 economic and technological
development and tourism development projects.
</P>
<P>
-- Bringing the superiority of talented personnel and
technology into full play and assisting people with the use of
science and technology. Military academies, scientific research
and medical units, as well as special technological units actively
support national construction by transferring scientific and
technological findings to the civilian sector or by offering it
assistance in tackling key technical problems and personnel
training. In the last ten years China's armed forces have
supported more than 1,000 national economic construction projects
with their advanced scientific and technological achievements,
solved urgent and key problems for more than 150 scientific
research projects, transferred 10,000-some scientific and
technological findings to the civilian sector, trained nearly one
million scientific and technological personnel, and helped
civilian enterprises complete 900-odd technical transformation
projects which enabled 320 enterprises to get out of the red and
become profitable.

-- Supporting agriculture and assisting in poverty-relief and
development efforts. China is a large agricultural country, so
agriculture has always been the foundation of China's national
economy. In the past decade, to support agricultural development
China's armed forces have dredged more than 500 rivers, built
200,000-odd kilometers of irrigation channels and dams and dikes,
dug more than 1,000 reservoirs, and reclaimed wasteland and
leveled land of over two million hectares, thus laying a
foundation for bumper harvests. Army units stationed in
poverty-stricken areas have made great efforts to assist the local
people to develop production, up to now helping nearly one million
people in 23,000 poor areas get rid of poverty and live more
comfortable lives. Especially, they have concentrated on helping
the poor in 20 key areas in the Yimeng and Taihang mountains and
other regions, assisting them to run 3,500-some village and
township enterprises. Moreover, they have carried out 12,000
scientific and technological projects aimed at helping the poor to
get rid of poverty, and offered agro-technique training courses to
some 4.5 million people. Military medical organizations at various
levels and army hospitals have sent medical teams to poor areas on
860 occasions, which have supported more than 8,100 township
hospitals with medical equipment worth upwards of 20 million yuan,
and given free training to more than 20,000 medical personnel.
</P>
<P>
-- Participating in work for the public good. In the past
decade the PLA has devoted more than 100 million work days to the
repair of bridges and roads, the tidying up and beautifying of the
environment, and the repair and construction of water, gas and
power supply projects. Altogether, it has completed over 100,000
projects for the public good and planted more than 400 million
trees. Besides, it has contributed 41.5755 million yuan to the
"Hope Project," together with various kinds of goods and materials
worth some 11 million yuan, and helped to build 697 "Hope" primary
schools, which have enabled more than 115,000 dropouts to return
to school.
</P>
<P>
-- Training personnel competent both for military and civilian
services. The Chinese armed forces pay great attention to training
qualified personnel for the country's economic construction. To
meet the needs of national economic construction and the wishes of
both officers and men, the Routine Service Regulations of the PLA
stipulate that every Saturday may be reserved for training
personnel competent for both military and civilian
services. Saturdays are also when military personnel are organized
to study scientific and cultural subjects. Since the early 1980s,
when the PLA started to organize these special training courses,
through on-the-job training nearly one million officers have
received academic certificates at or above the junior college
level; more than 85 percent of the ordinary soldiers have received
in-service technical training, and nearly half of them have been
awarded technician's certificates of various grades. When they
leave active service they have become or will become an important
force promoting the country's economic construction and the
overall progress of Chinese society.

China has always placed the development of military contacts
with adjacent countries in a prominent position. Following the
principles of good-neighborliness and friendliness, mutual benefit
and cooperation and long-term stability, it has developed
extensive and beneficial contacts with the armed forces of those
countries, especially contacts on the senior level.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 and 1997 alone, China sent more than 100 military
delegations to most of its adjacent countries, and hosted over 130
military delegations from such countries.
</P>
<P>
China has placed special stress on friendly military exchanges
and cooperation with developing countries, and has offered
assistance in personnel training, equipment and health care to
over 70 countries.
</P>
<P>
Since 1973, China has trained nearly 10,000 officers at all
levels as well as military technicians for developing countries,
and sent over 8,000 experts to those countries.
</P>
<P>
China is enthusiastic for expanding military relations with the
United States and other Western countries in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Proceeding from the objective of safeguarding world peace and
the fundamental interests of the people all over the world,
Chinese armed forces have successively resumed and improved their
relations with the armed forces of those countries on the
principle of increasing dialogue and narrowing differences,
resulting in the deepening of mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s China's naval vessels have
visited nearly a score of countries. From March to May 1997, two
formations of Chinese naval vessels made friendly visits to the

Stationing a Garrison in Hong Kong
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government resumed exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, and stationed a garrison of the PLA in
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to take charge
of its defense affairs. The stationing of the PLA troops in the
Region is an important symbol of the Chinese government's
resumption of exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. It is also
an important guarantee for the preservation of state sovereignty
and security and the maintenance of the Region's long-term
prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
The PLA troops entered Hong Kong strictly in accordance with
provisions of the law. The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of the PRC, passed at the Third Session of
the Seventh NPC in April, 1990, clearly stipulated that the
Central People's Government shall be responsible for
administrating the defense affairs of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The Garrison Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
of the PRC was approved at the 23rd meeting of the Standing
Committee of the Eighth NPC in December 1996, and came into effect
on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Garrison Law stipulates that the Hong Kong Garrison shall
not interfere in the local affairs of the HKSAR; that its duties
are to perform routine defense service, administrate military
facilities, handle relevant foreign-related military affairs, and
ensure the security and stability of Hong Kong; that its
expenditures shall be borne by the Central People's Government;
and that the garrison troops shall be rotated.
</P>
<P>
The law contains specific provisions on the duties and rules of
discipline of the garrison personnel, the judicature and other
questions, fundamentally guaranteeing that the Hong Kong Garrison
fulfills its defense functions along legal lines.
</P>
<P>
The PLA Hong Kong Garrison, composed of ground, naval and air
forces, is under the direction of the Central Military Commission
of the PRC. While performing its defense duties, the Hong Kong
Garrison must abide by both national and HKSAR laws, as well as
the current rules and regulations of the PLA.
</P>
<P>
After its entry into Hong Kong, the PLA Hong Kong Garrison
abided strictly by the Basic Law and the Garrison Law, fulfilled
its defense duties within legal framework, actively organized
military training, strengthened army-building along regularization
lines, studied Hong Kong's related laws, and acquainted the rank
and file with the social conditions in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to the Garrison Law, the Garrison established working
contacts with the HKSAR government, and opened the barracks on the
Stonecutters Island and Chek Chu to the public to promote Hong
Kong compatriots' understanding of and trust in the garrison
troops.
</P>
<P>
It is a long-term task for the PLA Hong Kong Garrison to
fulfill its responsibility for Hong Kong's defense affairs. The
garrison troops will consistently adhere to the principle of "one
country, two systems," strictly abide by the Basic Law and the
Garrison Law, and contribute to the preservation of the long-term
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of White Paper on China's National Defense (24) Promoting Confidence-Building Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China places great stress on and actively promotes cooperation
in confidence-building measures (CBM), considering the
establishment of mutual trust between nations as an effective way
to maintain security.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has reached agreements with some
neighboring countries on confidence-building measures and
reduction of military forces in border areas, which is an
important step China has taken to develop relations with other
countries and promote regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
These agreements reflect a new kind of security concept
vigorously advocated by China and embody some principles and
spirit of universal significance for Asian-Pacific security
dialogues and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
These include mutual and equal security, seeking security by
establishing mutual trust, dialogue and cooperation without
interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and without
aiming at a third party, preventing military forces from
threatening or harming other countries' security and stability,
implementing and sticking to a national defense policy that is
defensive in nature, adopting suitable confidence-building
measures in border and disputed areas on a bilateral basis and
engaging in friendly contacts between military forces.
</P>
<P>
In April 1996, China and Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and
Tajikistan signed the Agreement on Confidence-Building in the
Military Field Along the Border Areas, which stipulates that
military forces deployed in the border areas shall not be used to
attack each other, each party shall refrain from staging military
exercises directing against the other, there shall be restrictions
on the military exercises in terms of scale, area and the number
of such exercises, all the important military activities of one
party in the areas between the border and 100 kilometers from the
border line shall be notified to the other which shall be invited
to observe the troop exercises; measures shall be taken to prevent
dangerous military activities and enhance friendly exchanges of
their armed forces in the border areas.

In November 1996, China and India signed the Agreement on
Confidence-Building Measures in the Military Field Along the Line
of Actual Control in the China-India Border Areas.
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides that each side should not engage in
military activities that threaten the other side or undermines
peace, tranquility and stability in the border areas, that they
should strictly respect and observe the line of actual control in
the border areas and neither side should overstep the line of
actual control in their activities pending ultimate resolution of
the boundary question, that they should reduce or limit the size
of field army, border defense forces, para-military forces and any
other mutually agreed category of armed forces and armaments
deployed in the mutually agreed geographical zones along the line
of actual control to the mutually agreed ceilings, that each side
shall refrain from staging military exercises directing against
the other in the close proximity of the line of actual control in
the border areas and restrict the scale of military exercises and
provide prior notification to the other with regard to military
exercises of certain scale in the close proximity of the line of
actual control in the border areas, that they should prevent air
intrusions by military aircraft across the line of actual control
and dangerous military activities in the areas along the line of
actual control, that both sides should strengthen exchanges and
cooperation between their military personnel and establishments in
the border areas along the line of actual control.
</P>
<P>
In addition, in 1994, China and Russia signed the Agreement on
Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities and the Joint
Statement by the President of the People's Republic of China and
the President of the Russian Federation on Non-First-Use of
Nuclear Weapons and Detargeting of Strategic Nuclear Weapons
Against Each Other.
</P>
<P>
In January 1998, China and the United States signed the
Agreement Between the Ministry of National Defense of the PRC and
the Department of Defense of the USA on Establishing a
Consultation Mechanism to Strengthen Military Maritime Safety.
</P>
<P>
In June of the same year, President Jiang Zemin of China and
President Clinton of the United States announced that the two
sides had decided not to target each other with the strategic
nuclear weapons under their respective control.
</P>
<P>
In addition, confidential direct redline telephone
communication links have been established between the head of
state of China and the heads of state of Russia and the United

China advocates regional-security dialogue and cooperation at
different levels, through various channels and in different
forms. Such dialogue and cooperation should follow these
principles: participation on an equal footing, reaching unanimity
through consultation, seeking common ground while reserving
differences, and proceeding in an orderly way and step by step.
</P>
<P>
China has participated in the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF),
Conference on Interaction and Confidence- Building Measures in
Asia (CICA), Council on Security Cooperation in Asia and Pacific
Region (CSCAP), Northeast Asia Cooperation Dialogue (NEACD) and
other activities, holding that all countries should further mutual
understanding and trust by discussions on security issues through
these important governmental and non-governmental channels, so as
to promote regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
China has attended all the ARF foreign minister meetings and
ARF senior official meetings. Chinese representatives of foreign
and defense affairs have attended official and unofficial meetings
within the framework of the forum, their topics of discussion
including promotion of confidence-building measures, peace
keeping, maritime search and rescue, the handling of emergencies
and disaster relief, preventative diplomacy, non-proliferation,
and guiding principles.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 China and the Philippines jointly sponsored the
Conference on Confidence-Building Measures in Beijing. Between
sessions of the conference, which was crowned with success,
foreign representatives were invited to visit Chinese military
units and observe military exercises.
</P>
<P>
China supports the ARF's creative explorations for the
promotion of confidence-building measures and has made a series of
constructive suggestions and opinions in this regard. For example,
China advocates development of military medicine, science of
military law and multilateral cooperation on conversion of
military technologies and facilities for civilian use.
</P>
<P>
It encourages the exchange of high-level visits by senior
military officers, and port calls by naval vessels, as well as
exchanges of military personnel between different countries, and
supports cooperation in emergency rescue and disaster relief,
maritime navigation safety, and marine environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
In addition, every year China submits to the forum a statement
on national defense policy and other related documents.
</P>
<P>
China has always been an active participant in the process of
the CICA initiated by Kazakhstan, regarding the purpose of the
conference as basically suiting China's security goal in Asia.
</P>
<P>
It suggests that the conference develop steadily with full
consideration of Asia's regional peculiarities and diversities. In
1996 China formally joined the CSCAP, and in 1997 established the
CSCAP China Committee, which has always conscientiously
participated in the council's activities.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, when the NEACD was founded, China has attended all
NEACD meetings and, in 1996, hosted its fourth conference in
Beijing. Along with other member states, China has also helped the
NEACD to achieve unanimity on the guiding principle of cooperation
between Northeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
China has held consultations in different forms with the
United States, Russia, Japan, France, Canada and Australia on
issues of common interest in the areas of security and
defense.
</P>
<P>
Officials and scholars of China's Ministry of National Defense
and other related departments have participated, in increasing
breadth and depth, in various discussions and other activities on
Asian-Pacific security, which has promoted understanding and trust
between China and the countries concerned, and shown China's
positive intentions and efforts to maintain lasting peace in the
Asia-Pacific region.

China has steadfastly attended multilateral negotiations on
arms control and disarmament, and some related international
conferences. In April 1997, China and Russia, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan signed the Agreement on Mutual Reduction
of Military Forces in the Border Areas. It stipulates that the
five countries shall reduce their military forces in the border
areas to the minimum level compatible with their friendly and
good-neighborly relations, a level that shall not go beyond their
defense needs; none of the parties shall use or threaten to use
force against the other party or parties, neither shall they seek
unilateral military superiority; they shall reduce and limit the
size of their ground force, air force, air aviation and border
guard units as well as the quantity of main categories of their
armaments and military equipment deployed in the border areas as
deep as 100 kilometers from their border; they shall determine the
ceilings for the reduced size, modality and the time limit for the
reduction of military forces; combat vessels shall not be deployed
in rivers in the above-mentioned areas; they shall exchange
relevant information and data on the military forces in the border
areas; and they shall monitor and verify the implementation of the
Agreement. China has also set up bilateral arms control
consultation mechanisms with many other countries. China has
signed or ratified almost all the multilateral arms control
treaties, and faithfully fulfilled its obligations under those
treaties, making a positive contribution to the progress of
international arms control and disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The Issue of Nuclear Weapons
</P>
<P>
As a nuclear-weapon state, China vigorously supports and
participates in the international non-nuclear proliferation
efforts, promotes the process of nuclear disarmament and works
hard for the realization of the final goal of the complete
prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons worldwide.
</P>
<P>
China has consistently advocated the complete prohibition and
thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. At the 51st Session of
the UN General Assembly in 1996 China clearly put forward a
five-point proposal on nuclear disarmament: 1. The major nuclear
powers should abandon the nuclear deterrence policy, and the
states having the largest nuclear arsenals should continue to
drastically reduce their nuclear weapons stockpiles; 2. all
nuclear-weapon states should commit themselves not to be the first
to use nuclear weapons at any time and in any circumstances,
undertake unconditionally not to use or threaten to use nuclear
weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free
zones, and conclude a legally binding international document as
soon as possible; 3. all states which have deployed nuclear
weapons outside their borders should withdraw all these weapons
home, and all nuclear-weapon states should pledge to support the
proposal on establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones, respect the
status of such zones and undertake corresponding obligations;
4. no state should develop or deploy outer space weapons or
missile defense systems, which harm strategic security and
stability; 5. all states should negotiate and conclude an
international convention on the complete prohibition and thorough
destruction of nuclear weapons.

Since the end of the cold war the international security
situation has tended to relax, and great advances have been made
in international arms control and disarmament. The Convention on
the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and
Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction (CWC) was
concluded in January 1993, and came into effect in April 1997. The
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) was
indefinitely extended in May, 1995. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT) was opened for signature in the New York UN
headquarters in September 1996. Nuclear-weapon-free zones continue
to expand. The Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons and the Amended
Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines,
Booby-Traps and Other Devices attached to the Convention on
Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional
Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have
Indiscriminate Effects (Convention on Certain Conventional
Weapons) were adopted in October 1995 and May 1996,
respectively. And in June 1997, the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) passed a protocol for the purpose of increasing the
effectiveness of safeguards.
</P>
<P>
But in spite of such progress, there are still some problems
crying out for solutions in the sphere of disarmament. The United
States and Russia still keep their large nuclear arsenals. In
addition, a few military powers continue to stick to their cold
war mentality and nuclear deterrence policy, strenuously
developing highly advanced and sophisticated weapons, especially
advanced missile defense systems. The nuclear tests conducted by
India, and then by Pakistan, in May 1998 have not only seriously
impeded international non-proliferation efforts, but have produced
a grave impact on regional and world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government highly stresses the importance of arms
control and disarmament work, and takes it as an important
component of its overall diplomacy and defense policy. The Chinese
government holds that the international community should promote
fair, rational, comprehensive and balanced arms control and
disarmament; the purpose of disarmament should be to reinforce,
not weaken or undermine, the security of all countries; the
universality of the international arms control treaties should be
enhanced; new treaties should be concluded through a broadly
representative multilateral negotiations mechanism; those
countries having the largest and most sophisticated conventional
and nuclear arsenals should continue to fulfill their special
responsibilities for disarmament; efforts should be made to
prevent a few countries directing the target of disarmament at a
broad spectrum of developing countries in order to deprive them of
their legitimate right and means for self-defense, at the same
time taking advantage of their own advanced military technology
and superior economic strength to seek absolute security and
military superiority; the existing discriminatory and exclusive
export control mechanisms and arrangements should be overhauled
and rectified comprehensively, and a fair and rational
international non-proliferation system should be set up through
negotiations on the basis of universal participation.

keeping international peace and security under the guidance of the
principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In order to help UN peace-keeping operations achieve success
and develop in a healthy way, China holds that the following
guiding principles should be stipulated and followed:
</P>
<P>
-- The aims and principles of the Charter of the United Nations
must be adhered to, especially the principles of respecting the
sovereignty of all countries and non-interference in other
countries' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
-- Disputes must be settled using peaceful means, such as
mediation, good office and negotiation. Compulsory means should
not be adopted indiscreetly, nor should military means be resorted
to even for humanitarian ends.
</P>
<P>
-- Double standards should be opposed. The policies and views
of any one country or a few countries should not be imposed on the
UN Security Council, and military interference by a small number
of countries under the guise of the UN should not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
-- In peace-keeping operations, the following principles, which
have proved to be effective in the past, should be adhered
to: obtaining agreement from the country concerned beforehand,
strictly observing neutrality and prohibiting the use of force
except for self-defense.
</P>
<P>
-- Be practical and realistic. A peace-keeping operation should
not be undertaken when conditions are not yet ripe, nor should a
peace-keeping force become a party to a conflict, which would be a
deviation from the fundamental purpose of peace-keeping operations.
</P>
<P>
Adhering to the above principles, China has participated in UN
peace-keeping operations. In 1990, China began to assign military
observers to UN peace-keeping operations.
</P>
<P>
Since then it has sent 437 military observers in 32 groups to
join six UN peace-keeping operations, viz, the United Nations
Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) in the Middle East, United
Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM), United Nations
Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC), United Nations Mission
for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), United Nations
Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) and United Nations Observer
Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL).
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the Chinese government dispatched an engineer unit to
support the UNTAC peace-keeping operations. A total of 800 men
were sent in two batches, who, in 18 months, repaired or extended
four airports, repaired four highways totaling 640 kilometers,
built or rebuilt 47 bridges and completed many other service
projects, making useful contributions to the successful operations
of the United Nations peace-keeping forces in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
China still has 32 military observers serving with the UNTSO,
UNIKOM and MINURSO. In May 1997, the Chinese government decided
that in principle China would take part in the UN's stand-by
arrangements and would provide military observers, civilian
policemen, and engineering, medical, transportation and other
logistic service teams in due time for UN peace-keeping operations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese personnel assisting UN peace-keeping operations have
conscientiously fulfilled their responsibilities and made great
contributions to world peace. Some of them have even sacrificed
their lives.
</P>
<P>
In the years to come, China will continue to participate in UN
peace-keeping operations in a positive and down-to-earth manner.

The Issue of Keeping Outer Space Weapon-Free
</P>
<P>
Outer space belongs to all mankind, and should be used
exclusively for peaceful purposes to benefit mankind. To this end,
China stands for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction
of weapons deployed in outer space. It opposes the development of
anti-satellite weapons. China maintains that the international
community, the big powers with the capacity to utilize outer space
in particular, should take the following realistic steps to
prevent a weaponized outer space: A complete ban on weapons of any
kind in outer space, including anti-missile and anti-satellite
weapons, so as to keep outer space free of weapons; a ban on the
use of force or conduct of hostilities in, from or to outer space;
and all countries should undertake neither to experiment with,
produce or deploy outer space weapons nor, to utilize outer space
to seek strategic advantages on the ground, for example, using
disposition of the important parts of ground anti-missile systems
in outer space for the purpose of developing strategic defensive
weapons. In addition, negotiations should be held as soon as
possible for the conclusion of a legally-binding international
agreement with the above-mentioned contents.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1980s, as one of the co-sponsors of
the UN General Assembly resolutions on keeping outer space
weapon-free, China has promoted negotiations on this problem at
the Geneva Conference on Disarmament and through other
multilateral mechanisms. As early as at the founding of the Ad Hoc
Committee of the Conference on Disarmament on the Prevention of an
Arms Race in Outer Space, China submitted to it a paper on China's
Position on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space
(CD/579). Many countries have supported China's position.
</P>
<P>
The Issue of Anti-Personnel Landmines
</P>
<P>
China has all along attached great importance to the problem of
threat to innocent people caused by the indiscriminate use of
anti-personnel landmines (APLs). It is in favor of imposing proper
and rational restrictions on the use and transfer of APLs in a bid
to achieve the ultimate objective of comprehensive prohibition of
such landmines through a phased approach. In the meantime, the
Chinese government maintains that, in addressing the problem of
APLs, consideration should be given to both humanitarian concern
and the legitimate defense requirements of sovereign states. To
safeguard the safety of their people by sovereign states through
legitimate military means, including the use of APLs in accordance
with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United
Nations itself is part and parcel of humanitarianism.
</P>
<P>
As a country with long land borders, China has to reserve the
right to use APLs on its territory pending an alternative solution
is found and its requirements in security and defense capability
are catered for. China's use of APLs under legitimate
circumstances is entirely aimed at preventing foreign military
interference and aggression so as to maintain national unity and
territorial integrity and safeguard its people's well-being. This
not only represents China's legitimate national security and
defense requirements, but also accords with the relevant
provisions of the Charter of the United Nations on the right to
self-defense.

The Issue of Chemical and Biological Weapons
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always stood for the complete
prohibition and thorough destruction of chemical weapons. China
signed the CWC in January 1993, ratified the convention in
December 1996 and deposited the instruments of ratification on
April 25, 1997, thus becoming an original signatory state to the
CWC. China supports the purpose and goals of the CWC, and
advocates that chemical weapons and facilities for their
production should be destroyed as soon as possible, in accordance
with the related provisions in the CWC. Meanwhile, China holds
that the convention should promote international economic, trade,
and scientific and technological exchanges in the field of
chemical industry, ensuring that chemical industry technology
truly benefits mankind.
</P>
<P>
China has been active and conscientious in fulfilling the
obligations stipulated in the CWC. It delivered the initial
declaration and annual declaration in time and in their entirety
and has accepted inspections by the convention. It has also
participated in every one of the convention's executive council
meetings and the two conferences of states parties.
</P>
<P>
China has been a victim of chemical weapons. Large quantities
of chemical weapons abandoned by Japanese aggressor troops are
found in China to this day, which still threaten the lives and
property of the local people and the environment in which they
live. In view of this, China demands that, in keeping with the
stipulations of the convention, any country that has left chemical
weapons in another country destroy, as soon as possible, such
weapons wholly and thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
China advocates the complete prohibition and thorough
destruction of biological weapons. It opposes the production,
development and stockpiling of biological weapons by any country,
and the proliferation of such weapons and related technology in
any form by any country. In November 1984 China acceded to the
Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and
Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and
on Their Destruction (BWC). As a state party to the BWC, China
has fully and conscientiously fulfilled its obligations under the
convention. Since 1987 China has, year after year, reported to the
United Nations on convention-related information and data
concerning confidence-building measures, in accordance with the
decisions of the Review Conferences of the BWC.
</P>
<P>
Having suffered grievously from biological weapons attacks in
the past, China supports work that helps comprehensively to
strengthen the effectiveness of the convention. It has actively
participated in the work of drawing up a Protocol of the Ad Hoc
Group of States Parties to the BWC established in 1994, and has
made contributions to the progress of the negotiations on the
Protocol. China holds, in view of the complexity of the problems
relating to the verification mechanism, that every country should,
in a down-to-earth way, seek effective and feasible verification
measures, and formulate concrete steps to prevent abuse of
verification, and to protect the rightful commercial and security
secrets of states parties. China considers that, while improving
the convention's verification mechanism, international cooperation
and exchanges among states parties in the sphere of bio-technology
for peaceful purposes should also be strengthened.

From the first day it possessed nuclear weapons, China has
solemnly declared its determination not to be the first to use
such weapons at any time and in any circumstances, and later
undertook unconditionally not to use or threaten to use nuclear
weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free
zones. China vigorously supports the efforts of the relevant
countries to establish nuclear-free zones on a voluntary basis,
and has signed and approved the relevant protocols of the Treaty
for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the
Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco), the South Pacific Nuclear-Free
Zone Treaty (Treaty of Rarotonga) and the African
Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (Treaty of Pelindaba). In April
1995 China issued an official statement, reiterating its
commitment to unconditionally provide non-nuclear-weapon states
and nuclear-weapon-free zones with negative security assurance,
and for the first time promised to provide them with positive
security assurance.
</P>
<P>
In March 1992 China acceded to the NPT and has faithfully
fulfilled its international obligations to prevent the
proliferation of nuclear weapons and made contributions to the
indefinite extension of the treaty. China was represented at the
negotiations on the CTBT from beginning to end, and signed it on
September 24, 1996, the first day the treaty was opened for
signature. China supports the early conclusion of the Convention
on Banning the Production of Fissile Materials for Nuclear Weapons
or Other Nuclear Explosive Devices (FMCT). For this purpose, the
foreign ministers of China and the United States issued a joint
statement in October 1994, saying that the two countries would
make joint efforts to promote an early conclusion of a
multilateral, non-discriminatory and effectively verifiable
FMCT. In April 1997, China and four other nuclear-weapon states --
the United States, Russia, Britain and France -- issued a
statement, reiterating their stand for concluding, through
negotiation, a FMCT as soon as possible on the basis of the
mandate contained in the Shannon Report. China supports the IAEA's
Program for Strengthening the Effectiveness and Promoting the
Efficiency of the Safeguard System (93 + 2 Program), and promises
that, on the basis of voluntary safeguard, China will negotiate
and conclude with the IAEA a legally binding document at a proper
time, and will adopt measures corresponding to the obligations
China undertakes in accordance with the first article of the NPT.
</P>
<P>
As the international situation is tending to relax and
relations between the major powers continue to improve, China
believes that the conditions are now ripe for nuclear-weapon
states to undertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons
against each other. So, in January 1994, China formally presented
a draft for the Treaty on the Non-First-Use of Nuclear Weapons to
the United States, Russia, Britain and France, proposing that the
five nuclear-weapon states hold discussions on the treaty as soon
as possible. China holds that such a treaty will help to promote
mutual trust among nuclear-weapon states and further reduce the
danger of nuclear war. While energetically promoting negotiations
for conclusion of a multilateral treaty, China also actively
seeks, together with other nuclear-weapon states, to undertake, on
a bilateral basis, not to be the first to use nuclear weapons
against each other. So far, China and Russia have already made
such a promise to each other.

The PLA has always exercised strict control over the use of
APLs and prohibited the indiscriminate use and laying of such
landmines while actively studying the possible alternatives to
APLs. China has also actively participated in the revision of the
Landmine Protocol (Protocol II) to the Convention on Certain
Conventional Weapons (CCW) and the discussions on the question of
APLs at the UN Conference on Disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has all along adopted a very prudent and
responsible attitude toward landmine export. In December 1994,
China joined in the UN General Assembly's consultation on its
resolution concerning the moratorium on the export of APLs. In
April 1996, the Chinese government solemnly declared its
suspension of export of APLs that are not compatible with those
APLs provided for in the Amended Landmine Protocol to the CCW.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is of the view that the clearance of
APLs is part and parcel of the overall efforts in eliminating the
threat to innocent civilians resulting from the indiscriminate use
of such landmines. It has consistently adopted a responsible
attitude toward post-war demining question and has done
considerable fruitful work in this regard. From the beginning of
1992 to the end of 1994, the PLA conducted its first large-scale
demining operation in the border areas of Yunnan Province and the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, cleared a total of over one
million landmines and explosive devices and destroyed nearly 200
tons of disused or de-activated ammunitions and explosive devices,
covering an area of 108 square kilometers with over 170 border
trade passes and ports re-opened, and over 30,000 hectares of
farmland, pasture and mountain forests restored. At the end of
1997, the Chinese government decided to conduct its second
large-scale demining operation in the above areas starting from
November 1997 up to December 1999.

The Chinese government has always done its utmost to assist
APL-affected countries. It furnished Cambodia and some other
mine-affected countries with mine-detection/clearance equipment,
and also helped train demining personnel for these countries, thus
contributing to their smooth post-war rehabilitation. In November
1997, the Chinese President Jiang Zemin declared that China would
continue to actively support international demining efforts and
cooperation, including donation and provision of assistance in the
fields of demining training, technology and equipment through the
relevant international demining funds. The Chinese government also
sent observers to participate in the Signing Ceremony of the
Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production
and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction and
the international demining roundtable (Mine Action Forum) held
from 2 to 4 December 1997 in Ottawa.

Control of the Export of Sensitive Materials and Military
</P>
<P>
Equipment
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government agrees that necessary measures should be
adopted to apply effective international control to the transfer
of sensitive materials and technologies in order to prevent the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their carriers.
However, at the same time, China holds that international efforts
to prevent such proliferation should follow the principle of
fairness and rationality, and opposes a double standard whereby
anti-proliferation is used as a pretext to infringe upon the
sovereignty of other countries and harm normal international
cooperation and exchanges in the fields of economy, trade and
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to control over the export of
sensitive materials, and has implemented a series of
administration measures regarding the transfer of sensitive
materials on the basis of international practice.
</P>
<P>
Regarding nuclear exports, China, a signatory to the NPT, has
pursued a policy of not supporting, encouraging or engaging in the
proliferation of nuclear weapons and not assisting any other
country to develop such weapons. It has laid down three principles
regarding nuclear exports: They should serve peaceful purposes
only; they should accept the safeguards of the IAEA; and they
should not be retransferred to a third country without China's
consent.

In November 1991 the Chinese government declared that it would
report on a continuing basis to the IAEA any export to or import
from non-nuclear-weapon states of nuclear materials of one
effective kilogram or above. In July 1993 China officially
promised that it would voluntarily report to the IAEA any imports
or exports of nuclear materials, nuclear equipment and related
non-nuclear materials. In May 1996 China promised that it would
not offer help to nuclear facilities which had not accepted the
IAEA's safeguards, including bans on exports of nuclear materials
and personnel or technology exchanges and cooperation. In May
1997, the Chinese government published the Circular on Questions
Pertaining to the Strict Implementation of China's Nuclear Exports
Policy, which explicitly stipulates that no nuclear materials,
facilities or related technologies exported by China may be
supplied to or used by nuclear facilities which have not accepted
the IAEA's safeguards. The circular also has strict provisions
regarding exports of dual-use nuclear-related materials. In May
1997, China sent observers to attend a meeting of the Zangger
Committee, one of the mechanisms of international nuclear export
control, and formally joined the committee in October of that
year. In September 1997, the Chinese government issued the
Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Nuclear Export
Control, banning any kind of assistance to nuclear facilities
which have not accepted the IAEA's safeguards. In addition,
nuclear exports are monopolized by the units designated by the
State Council and can not be operated by any other units or
individuals. The state practices a licensing system for nuclear
exports, and has drawn up the Detailed List of Nuclear Export
Control in light of the commonly accepted listings of this kind in
the international sphere. On June 10, 1998, China promulgated the
Regulations on the Control of the Export of Dual-Use Nuclear
Materials and Related Technology, imposing strict control on the
export of nuclear-related dual-use materials and related
technology.
</P>
<P>
China has always been cautious and responsible regarding the
exports administration of chemicals. It does not export chemicals
that can be used to manufacture chemical weapons, nor does it
export related technologies and equipment. It supports normal
international cooperation in chemical industry and exchanges of
related scientific and technological materials in accordance with
the CWC, and opposes any export control mechanism conflicting with
the purpose of the convention.

In September 1990, the Chinese government drafted measures for
strict control of the export of chemicals and their production
technologies and equipment. In December 1995, it issued the
Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Supervision
and Control of Chemicals, and, in accordance with these
regulations, issued the List of Chemicals Subject to Supervision
and Control and the Bylaws for the Implementation of the
Regulations in June 1996, stipulating that import and export of
related chemicals are under the centralized management of the
competent departments of the chemical industry under the State
Council and operated by special companies designated by such
departments.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the transfer of military equipment and related
technology, China respects the right of every country to
independent or collective self-defense and to acquisition of
weapons for this purpose in accordance with the principles
contained in the Charter of the United Nations, but at the same
time it is concerned about the adverse effects on world security
and regional stability arising from excessive accumulations of
weaponry.
</P>
<P>
For many years until the early 1980s, China did not engage in
weapons exports, and since then the volume of such exports has
been limited. Beginning in the mid-1980s, China's export of
military products has been on the decrease: The volume of
contracted business was just over two billion US dollars worth in
1987, dropped to 600 million US dollars worth in 1991, and did not
exceed one billion US dollars worth in the following years. The
1993-97 records of the UN register of conventional arms exports
and imports of various countries show that China's exports of
conventional weapons are small compared to those of some other
countries.
</P>
<P>
China practices strict control of the transfer of conventional
military equipment and related technologies, and observes the
following principles: The export of weapons must help the
recipient nation enhance its capability for legitimate
self-defense; it must not impair peace, security and stability of
the relevant region and the world as a whole; and it must not be
used to interfere in the recipient state's internal affairs. Since
1992 China has participated in the United Nations' register of
conventional arms transfers (Tables 5 and 6).

In October 1997, the Chinese government published the
Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Control of
Military Products Export, stipulating that a licensing system
shall be practiced for China's weapons exports, and all external
transfers of domestic military products shall be carried out by
the departments authorized by the government and companies
approved and registered by the government. The Regulations state
that the business activities of such departments and companies
must remain strictly within the projects approved by the
government, that contracts of military products transfers must
require approval from the relevant competent government
departments before taking effect, and that important items of arms
exports must be submitted to the State Council and the Central
Military Commission for approval.
</P>
<P>
China has been consistently cautious and responsible regarding
the transfer of missiles. China is not a member state of the
Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) and has not joined its
formulation and revision, but, in accordance with China's
consistent position on non-proliferation and its principles
concerning arms exports, the Chinese government promised to
observe the then guidelines and parameters of the MTCR in February
1992. In October 1994, China reaffirmed its promise and undertook
the obligation of not exporting ground-to-ground missiles
inherently capable of reaching a range of at least 300 kilometers
with a payload of at least 500 kilograms. In line with the above
policy, China has exercised strict and effective control over the
export of missiles and related materials and has never done
anything in violation of its commitments.
</P>
<P>
The principles and measures to prevent the proliferation of
weaponry and unwarranted transfers of military equipment that
China has consistently upheld have helped to promote the
development of international arms control and disarmament in a
wholesome way, and to maintain world peace and regional
stability.

<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Comprehensive farming has helped
over 800,000 farmers and herdsmen in the under-developed Qinghai
Province on the tough Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The province has a large number of people living below the
poverty line because of relatively backward farming and animal
husbandry methods.
</P>
<P>
The province has had 4 massive comprehensive agricultural
development programs since 1989 to help the poverty relief
program, and 734 million yuan in special funds has been used for
102 comprehensive farming projects that have benefited 825,100
people from the Mongolian, Tibetan, Hui, and Sala ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
They have also helped add 21,500 hectares of arable land,
transform 60,000 hectares of medium and low-yield fields, and
increase irrigated areas by 55,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
The program has also added 9,700 hectares of forest, 13
reservoirs, and 4,000 kilometers of irrigation canals.
</P>
<P>
Last year, per capita net incomes of 825,100 people in
comprehensive farming development areas were from 1,200 to 2,000
yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Work Committee of the Heads of
Investment Agencies (HIA) of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) will meet here in August to make preliminary
discussions on drafting of an agreement for the grouping's
Investment Area, the official New Light of Myanmar newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 7th meeting of the ASEAN HIA work committee will be a
follow-up of the 4th ASEAN HIA meeting held last Friday in
Singapore, attended by Myanmar Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman
of the Myanmar Investment Commission Vice-Admiral Maung Maung Khin
among others.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN HIA meeting reportedly discussed the impact of the
regional financial crisis on direct foreign investment of ASEAN,
drafting of agreement on ASEAN Investment Area, promotion of
foreign investment within and outside the region, cooperation
among ASEAN nations, fixing order, investment issues under
discussion at the Organizations for Economic Cooperation and
Development and the World Trade Organization, and preparations for
the ASEAN Summit.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar was admitted into the ASEAN in July last year, before
which some of the ASEAN countries had made investments in Myanmar
since the country opened its door to the outside world in late
1988, adopting the market-oriented economic system.
</P>
<P>
Up to the end of March this year, other five ASEAN fellow
member countries -- Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia,
Singapore and Thailand -- injected in Myanmar a total of more than
3.3 billion U.S. dollars in 140 projects, accounting for 45
percent of the 7-billion-dollar total foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Fallen Officers to be Honored in Capitol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Two Capitol officers cut down
in a burst of gunfire Friday will be honored Tuesday at a special
ceremony at the Capitol where they worked and died.
</P>
<P>
Their remains will lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda, where
the coffins of presidents and commanding generals have rested.
</P>
<P>
Capitol Police Chief Gary Abrecht announced plans to
memorialize the two "fallen heroes" as the suspect in the
shooting, Russell E. Weston Jr., lay in a hospital bed in serious
condition.
</P>
<P>
Coffins bearing the bodies of officers Jacob J. Chestnut and
John Gibson will be in the Rotunda early Tuesday and remain there
all day.
</P>
<P>
"Those wishing to pay their respects may file past the
remains," Abrecht said. An afternoon service is planned, with
members of Congress, other officers and families of the slain men
in attendance, he said.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, House Speaker
Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott all are
scheduled to attend the event, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Abrecht said Gibson, 42, will be buried Thursday at a location
to be announced. Chestnut, 58 and an Air Force veteran, will be
interred the following day at Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
The two Capitol police officers died of the wounds when the
gunman, a loner with a history of mental illness, burst into the
Capitol Friday afternoon and opened fire with a handgun.
</P>
<P>
The condition of Weston, 41, from Riming, Montana, was upgraded
from critical to serious during the day.
</P>
<P>
Authorities arranged a hearing in absentia for Weston on Monday
in federal court a few blocks from the Capitol. Papers filed in
court in the District of Columbia on Saturday charged him with
killing the two officers. The purpose of Monday's hearing is to
bring the case into federal court.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tourists roamed the Capitol by the hundreds on
Sunday, some pausing before a pile of flowers that has grown on
the steps outside in tribute to Gibson and Chestnut.

<HEADLINE> Decision on Clinton Testimony Might Come Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The White House said Sunday
that President Bill Clinton's lawyers are working with Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr to avert Clinton's direct testimony to a
grand jury probing the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and
a Republican, said outright refusal by Clinton to cooperate might
be reason enough for Congress to open impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Clinton aides would not confirm Sunday that the president has
been called to testify. "I am not going to be able to comment,"
said White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff.
</P>
<P>
But an official close to Clinton said the subpoena was served
last week on the president's attorney, David Kendall, and that it
requires the president to appear at the grand jury as early as
Tuesday, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
Kendall was traveling Sunday and was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
Hatch, a Republican, told CBS' "Face the Nation" that Clinton
has little choice but to cooperate. "The fact that he would ignore
and violate a subpoena would certainly be grounds to file articles
of impeachment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator Arlen Specter, a member of Hatch's
committee, told CNN's "Late Edition" that he doubts a standoff
over the subpoena would lead to impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
"I rechecked the Constitution. I do not believe that ignoring a
subpoena would be grounds for impeachment," Specter said. He said
the time had come for Starr to share information he had gathered
with Congress.
</P>
<P>
Starr's office says it is within Starr's authority to issue the
subpoena. Some Clinton defenders say only the House of
Representatives has that power.
</P>
<P>
Former White House Counsel Jack Quinn also said he did not
think Starr could enforce a subpoena against a sitting president.
</P>
<P>
"A president is not above the law, but he's treated differently
in that system because if a prosecutor could use the power of the
judicial branch to sanction a president to get his testimony, to
imprison a president, then one branch could utterly disable... the
executive branch, and we can't have that," Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
Calls went out on all sides Sunday for Clinton and Starr to
avoid a standoff over whether the subpoena is proper, because the
political stakes are too great.
</P>
<P>
Rahm Emanuel, a senior adviser to Clinton, indicated Sunday
that the president plans to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
"The president wants to get the information that the grand jury
needs and has instructed Mr. Kendall to talk to Mr. Starr to do
exactly that," Emanuel said on NBC's "Meet the Press."
</P>
<P>
Starr is investigating whether Clinton and former White House
intern Lewinsky lied under oath about the nature of their
relationship and then sought to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
In seeking compromise with Starr, Clinton's attorneys are
hoping to avoid having Clinton personally appear before the grand
jury and instead provide information in a less-sensational format,
such as a videotaped deposition.
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can avoid a constitutional crisis here," former
White House chief of staff Leon Panetta told NBC. "As long as
they're getting the testimony, as long as they're getting the
evidence, I think they should be able to work out the format."

today urging all government departments to carry out President
Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji's directions on anti-flood work.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Say High Pressure Can Preserve Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 26 (Xinhua) -- After about nine years of
research and two years of testing, U.S. scientists have developed
technology to preserve perishable foods with hydrostatic pressure.
</P>
<P>
The process is able to kill disease-causing microbes such as
E. coli and salmonella, said Sam Huttenbauer Jr., chief executive
officer of High Pressure Research Inc. in Cincinnati on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, "the beauty of this process is that ... it does not
require the preservatives or heat used in more traditional
preservation methods like freezing and canning," Huttenbauer said.
</P>
<P>
Huttenbauer's company is set to commercially produce and market
high-pressure foods in grocery stores later this summer.
</P>
<P>
The technology, as explained by Daniel Farkas, head of the food
science and technology department at the state of Oregon, calls
for placing fresh, packaged food in a water-filled chamber.
</P>
<P>
There in the chamber, he said, the food would be subject to
hydrostatic pressure of 50,000 and 100,000 pounds per square inch,
or 3,518 to 7,036 kilograms per square centimeter.
</P>
<P>
The pressure kills the microbes that spoil food but "does not
alter the food's flavor, appearance, consistency or nutritional
value," said Farkas, a consultant to Huttenbauer's company.
</P>
<P>
The process also reportedly interests the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
"We need foods that can be stored up to three years at 80
degrees Fahrenheit (26.7 degrees centigrade)," Patrick Dunne, an
Army chemist in Natick, Massachusetts, told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
"We are especially interested in a yogurt drink and other dairy
products that could be stored unrefrigerated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Initially, high-pressure processed foods will cost 25 to 35
cents more per pound (55 to 77 cents per kilogram) than canned or
frozen foods, but the cost should go down as production goes up,
Huttenbauer said.

<P>
SHENYANG, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China's Liaoning Province is
paying more attention to the marine environment as part of its
marine economy strategy.
</P>
<P>
The maritime industry has become a new growth point of local
economic development and has grown 20 percent annually since 1985
and is expected to bring in 40 billion yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
But it is serverly affected by declining offshore fishery
resources and a deteriorating environment.
</P>
<P>
The province has increased no-fishing periods to two months and
expanded areas covered by them to protect fish resources.
</P>
<P>
The damage caused by the excessive offshore fishing is being
reversed and the flow of pollutants from local industrial
production has decreased with the growing use of

<HEADLINE> China Pursues Defensive National Defense Policy-5A </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China pursues a national defense
policy that is defensive in nature, and holds that in military
affairs, disputes should be solved by non-military means, be wary
of war and strategically gain mastery by striking only after the
enemy has struck, according to a white paper on its national
defense issued today.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper entitled "China's National Defense", which was
issued by the Information Office of the State Council, points out,
ancient Chinese thinkers advocated "associating with benevolent
gentlemen and befriending good neighbors." In military affairs,
this maxim means solving disputes by non-military means, being
wary of war and strategically gaining mastery by striking only
after the enemy has struck.
</P>
<P>
During the course of several thousand years, loving peace,
stressing defense, seeking unification, promoting national unity,
and jointly resisting foreign aggression have always been the main
ideas of China's defense concept, it says, adding that the defense
policy of New China has carried forward and developed such
excellent Chinese historical and cultural traditions.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that China's defense policy has the
following main aspects:
</P>
<P>
-- Consolidating national defense, resisting aggression,
curbing armed subversion, and defending the state's sovereignty,
unity, territorial integrity and security. These are the basic
objectives of China's defense policy, as well as the main tasks
the Chinese Constitution has entrusted to China's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
China spares no effort to avoid and curb war, and to solve
international disputes and questions left over from history
through peaceful means. However, as long as hegemonism and power
politics still exist, a country must have the capability to defend
its sovereignty, unity, territorial integrity and security by
military means.
</P>
<P>
The modernization program of China's national defense work is
entirely for self-defense, and arises from the need to safeguard
the country's modernization drive and security. The size of
China's armed forces is suited to the needs of defending the
country's security and interests. China builds and consolidates
its national defense independently and through self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
-- Subordinating national defense work to, and placing it in
the service of, the nation's overall economic construction, and
achieving the coordinated development of these two kinds of
work. This is China's long-term basic policy for its defense
work.
</P>
<P>
The modernization of the national defense of a country requires
the support of its economic and technological forces; and the
modernization level of national defense can only be improved
gradually along with the increase of the country's economic
strength.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese government insists that economic construction be
taken as the center, that defense work be subordinate to and in
the service of the nation's overall economic construction and that
the armed forces actively participate in and support the nation's
economic construction. While concentrating its efforts on economic
construction, the state also endeavors to improve its national
defense work and to promote a coordinated development of the two.
</P>
<P>
-- Implementing the military strategy of active defense.
Strategically, China pursues the defensive policy featuring
self-defense and gaining mastery by striking only after the enemy
has struck, and adheres to the principle: "We will not attack
unless we are attacked; if we are attacked, we will certainly
counter-attack."
</P>
<P>
China possesses a small number of nuclear weapons, entirely for
meeting the needs of self-defense. China upholds the principle of
self-defense by the whole people and the strategic concept of
people's war, and works hard to enhance the defense consciousness
of the whole people, perfect the defense mobilization system and
intensify the building of the reserve force for defense.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of its existing weaponry, China carries forward
and develops its fine traditions. It seeks to adapt to profound
changes in the world's military sphere, and makes proper
preparations for defensive combat in the situation where modern
technology, especially high technology, prevails.
</P>
<P>
-- Streamlining the army in the Chinese way. During the new
historical period, the Chinese army is working hard to improve its
quality and endeavoring to streamline the army in the Chinese way,
aiming to form a revolutionized, modernized and regularized
people's army with Chinese characteristics. Reducing quantity and
improving quality is a basic principle upon which the army is to
be modernized.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese army strengthens itself by relying on science and
technology, and strives to make the transition from a numerically
superior type to a qualitatively efficient type, and from a
manpower-intensive type to a technology-intensive type. In view of
the characteristics of modern wars, no effort will be spared to
improve the modernization level of weaponry, reform and perfect
the army system and setup, and improve the training of troops and
curricula and teaching methods of military academies.
</P>
<P>
-- Safeguarding world peace, and opposing aggression and
expansion. China upholds the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence, and handles foreign military relations and engages in
military exchanges and cooperation independently. China does not
seek hegemonism, nor does it seek military blocs or military
expansion.
</P>
<P>
China does not station any troops or set up any military bases
in any foreign country. China opposes the arms race, and maintains
that effective arms control and disarmament should be carried out
in accordance with the principles of fairness, rationality,
comprehensiveness and balance.
</P>
<P>
China supports the international community in its activities to
promote world and regional peace, security and stability, and also
in its efforts to fairly and rationally solve international
disputes and to bring about arms control and disarmament.

<HEADLINE> China's Defense Expenditure Is 3.67 Percent of USA's-7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China's defense expenditure in
1997 was 3.67 percent of the USA's, 22.79 percent of Japan's, said
a white paper on China's national defense, which was issued here
today by the Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
According to the white paper, China's defense expenditure in
1997 was 9.80 billion US dollars, which was 3.67 percent of the
USA's, 61.25 percent of Russia's, 27.53 percent of Britain's, 26.7
percent of France's, 22.79 percent of Japan's, and 56.98 percent
of the Republic of Korea's (ROK).
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that since the introduction of the
policies of reform and opening up to the outside world, the
Chinese government has strictly controlled its defense expenditure
at a comparatively low level so that it can concentrate on
economic construction.
</P>
<P>
China's expenditure on national defense falls into the
following categories: personnel expenses, including mainly wages,
food and clothing of military and non-military personnel; costs
for maintenance of activities, including mainly military training,
construction and maintenance of facilities and running expenses;
and costs for equipment, including research and experiments,
procurement, maintenance, transportation and storage, the white
paper says.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the scope of logistic support, it continues, these
expenditures cover not only active service personnel, but also
militia and reserve requirements. In addition, a large amount of
spending is used to fund activities associated with social
welfare, mainly pensions for some of the retired officers, schools
and kindergartens for children of military personnel, training
personnel competent for both military and civilian services,
supporting national economic construction, and participation in
emergency rescues and disaster relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that since the introduction of the
policies of reform and opening up to the outside world the Chinese
government has placed work in national defense in a position
subordinate to and in the service of overall national economic
construction and has made relatively major reductions in defense
inputs.
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to 1994 defense spending increased by 6.22 percent
annually in absolute terms, which represents in real terms a
negative growth of 1.08 percent compared to the 7.3 percent annual
increase of the general retail price index of commodities in the
same period, the white paper explains.
</P>
<P>
The white paper discloses that China's annual defense outlay
from 1995 to 1997 came to 63.672 billion yuan, 72.006 billion yuan
and 81.257 billion yuan, respectively. The annual increase in
defense outlay went for the most part to ensure that the living
standards of military personnel keep up with the nation's social
and economic development and with the increase of the per capita
incomes of urban and rural residents, so as to improve the living
conditions of officers and men.
</P>
<P>
Even so, the white paper says, defense spending in the total
state expenditure declined annually in the same period, accounting
for 9.3 percent, 9.1 percent and 8.8 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The composition of China's defense expenditure in 1997 was as
follows: 29.162 billion yuan for personnel expenses, accounting
for 35.89 percent; 26.536 billion yuan for maintenance of
activities, 32.66 percent; and 25.559 billion yuan for equipment,
31.45 percent, the white paper says, adding that from the above,
we can see that most of the defense outlay went to the personnel's
living costs and maintenance of normal activities. In addition,
more than four billion yuan, or about 5 percent, was spent to fund
activities associated with social welfare.
</P>
<P>
The white paper emphasizes that compared with the defense
expenditures of some other countries, China has a fairly low level
of defense spending.

<HEADLINE> Total Size of PLA Will Be 2.5 million Men-8 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Within the coming three years,
China would reduce the number of its military personnel by
500,000, with the total size of the PLA approaching 2.5 million
men, according to a white paper on China's national defense issued
here today.
</P>
<P>
The white paper entitled "China's National Defense", which was
issued today by the Information Office of the State Council, says
that since 1990 the size of the PLA has further shrunk through
successive adjustments.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that China's latest disarmament move will
be carried out actively and steadily, and completed within the
planned three years. The reductions in the land, naval and air
forces account for 19 percent, 11.6 percent and 11 percent,
respectively, it adds.
</P>
<P>
According to the white paper, in September 1997, China solemnly
announced that it would reduce the number of its military
personnel by 500,000 within the coming three years on the basis of
its disarmament move in the 1980s, which had cut the number by one
million.
</P>
<P>
This important strategic decision of unilateral disarmament
once again fully expressed China's genuine wish for peace. It was
a new effort made by China to further promote the lowering of the
world's armament level, increase mutual trust and advance the
cause of peace for humanity.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that in the mid-1980s China's guideline
for army building was strategically shifted from all-time
preparedness against a large-scale war of aggression to peacetime
construction, and the size and structure of the armed forces were
adjusted accordingly.
</P>
<P>
In 1985 the Chinese government decided unilaterally to cut its
troops by one million men in real terms. By 1990, the total
reduction had reached 1.039 million men, it says.
</P>
<P>
The white paper points out that different from many other
countries, China includes all its border and coastal defense
forces, military service mobilization organs, administration
organs of military-run agricultural and sideline productions,
civil cadres and active service personnel in the reserve service
forces in the overall strength of the PLA.

<HEADLINE> China's Stand on Participating in UN Peace-Keeping Operations-9 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China makes clear the guiding
principles that should be followed in participation of UN
peace-keeping operations according to a white paper on China's
national defence which was issued here today by the Information
Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
These principles include:
</P>
<P>
-- The aims and principles of the Charter of the United Nations
must be adhered to, especially the principles of respecting the
sovereignty of all countries and non-interference in other
countries' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
-- Disputes must be settled using peaceful means, such as
mediation, good offices and negotiation. Compulsory means should
not be adopted indiscreetly, nor should military means be resorted
to even for humanitarian ends.
</P>
<P>
-- Double standards should be opposed. The policies and views
of any one country or a few countries should not be imposed on
the UN Security Council, and military interference by a small number
of countries under the guise of the UN should not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
-- In peace-keeping operations, the following principles, which
have proved to be effective in the past, should be adhered
to: obtaining agreement from the country concerned beforehand,
strictly observing neutrality and prohibiting the use of force
except for self-defense.
</P>
<P>
-- Be practical and realistic. A peace-keeping operation should
not be undertaken when conditions are not yet ripe, nor should a
peace-keeping force become a party to a conflict, which would be a
deviation from the fundamental purpose of peace-keeping operations.
</P>
<P>
Adhering to the above principles, China has participated in UN
peace-keeping operations. In 1990, China began to assign military
observers to UN peace-keeping operations; since then it has sent
437 military observers in 32 groups to join six UN peace-keeping
operations, viz, the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization
(UNTSO) in the Middle East, United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation
Mission (UNIKOM), United Nations Transitional Authority in
Cambodia (UNTAC), United Nations Mission for the Referendum in
Western Sahara (MINURSO), United Nations Operation in Mozambique
(ONUMOZ) and United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL).
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that in 1992, the Chinese government
dispatched an engineer unit to support the UNTAC peace-keeping
operations. A total of 800 men were sent in two batches, who, in
18 months, repaired or extended four airports, repaired four
highways totaling 640 kilometers, built or rebuilt 47 bridges and
completed many other service projects, making useful contributions
to the successful operations of the United Nations peace-keeping
forces in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
China still has 32 military observers serving with the UNTSO,
UNIKOM and MINURSO. In May 1997, the Chinese government decided
that in principle China would take part in the UN's stand-by
arrangements and would provide military observers, civilian
policemen, and engineering, medical, transportation and other
logistic service teams in due time for UN peace-keeping operations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese personnel assisting UN peace-keeping operations have
conscientiously fulfilled their responsibilities and made great
contributions to world peace. Some of them have even sacrificed
their lives. In the years to come, China will continue to
participate in UN peace-keeping operations in a positive and
down-to-earth manner.

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Importance of Arms Control, Disarmament-10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government stresses
the importance of arms control and disarmament, and takes it as an
important component of its overall diplomacy and defense policy,
says a white paper on China's national defense, which was issued
here today.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that the international community should
promote fair, rational, comprehensive and balanced arms control
and disarmament, the purpose of disarmament should be to
reinforce, not weaken or undermine, the security of all countries.
</P>
<P>
"The universality of the international arms control treaties
should be enhanced, new treaties should be concluded through a
broadly representative multilateral negotiations mechanism," the
white paper says.
</P>
<P>
The white paper points out that those countries having the
largest and most sophisticated conventional and nuclear arsenals
should continue to fulfill their special responsibilities for
disarmament, and efforts should be made to prevent a few countries
directing the target of disarmament at a broad spectrum of
developing countries in order to deprive them of their legitimate
right and means for self-defense, at the same time taking
advantage of their own advanced military technology and superior
economic strength to seek absolute security and military
superiority.
</P>
<P>
"The existing discriminatory and exclusive export control
mechanisms and arrangements should be overhauled and rectified
comprehensively, and a fair and rational international
non-proliferation system should be set up through negotiations on
the basis of universal participation," the white paper says.
</P>
<P>
According to the white paper, China has steadfastly attended
multilateral negotiations on arms control and has set up bilateral
arms control consultation mechanisms with many other countries.
</P>
<P>
"China has signed or ratified almost all the multilateral arms
control treaties, and faithfully fulfilled its obligations under
those treaties, making a positive contribution to the progress of
international arms control and disarmament," the white paper
says.

<HEADLINE> China Urges To Destroy Left Chemical Weapons-11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China says today in a white paper
on national defense that countries having left chemical weapons in
other countries should destroy such weapons as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
To this day, the white paper says, large quantities of chemical
weapons abandoned by Japanese aggressors are still found and
threaten the lives and property of the local people and the
environment in which they live.
</P>
<P>
"In view of this, China demands that, in keeping with the
stipulations of the related international convention, any country
that has left chemical weapons in another country destroy, as soon
as possible, such weapons wholly and thoroughly," says the white
paper entitled "China's National Defense" which was issued by the
Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
According to the white paper, the Chinese government has always
stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of
chemical weapons. China signed the CWC in January 1993, ratified
the convention in December 1996 and deposited the instruments of
ratification on April 25, 1997, thus becoming an original
signatory state to the CWC.
</P>
<P>
"China supports the purpose and goals of the CWC, and advocates
that chemical weapons and facilities for their production should
be destroyed as soon as possible, in accordance with the related
provisions in the CWC. Meanwhile, China holds that the convention
should promote international economic, trade, and scientific and
technological exchanges in the field of chemical industry,
ensuring that chemical industry technology truly benefits
mankind," the white paper says.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that China has been active and
conscientious in fulfilling the obligations stipulated in the
CWC. China delivered the initial declaration and annual
declaration in time and in their entirety and has accepted
inspections by the convention. China has also participated in
every one of the convention's executive council meetings and the
two conferences of signatory states.
</P>
<P>
China advocates the complete prohibition and thorough
destruction of biological weapons, the white paper says, adding
that China opposes the production, development and stockpiling of
biological weapons by any country, and the proliferation of such
weapons and related technology in any form by any country.
</P>
<P>
In November 1984 China acceded to the Convention on the
Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of
Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their
Destruction (BWC).
</P>
<P>
As a signatory state to the BWC, China has fully and
conscientiously fulfilled its obligations under the convention,
the white paper says, "since 1987 China has, year after year,
reported to the United Nations on convention-related information
and data concerning confidence-building measures, in accordance
with the decisions of the Review Conferences of the BWC."
</P>
<P>
"Having suffered grievously from biological weapons attacks
in the past, China supports work that helps comprehensively to
strengthen the effectiveness of the convention. It has actively
participated in the work of drawing up a Protocol of the Ad Hoc
Group of States Parties to the BWC established in 1994, and has
made contributions to the progress of the negotiations on the
Protocol", the white paper says.
</P>
<P>
The white paper also points out that, in view of the
complexity of the problems relating to the verification mechanism,
that every country should, in a down-to-earth way, seek effective
and feasible verification measures, and formulate concrete steps
to prevent abuse of verification, and to protect the rightful
commercial and security secrets of states parties.
</P>
<P>
"While improving the convention's verification mechanism,
international cooperation and exchanges among states parties in
the sphere of bio-technology for peaceful purposes should also be
strengthened," the white paper says.

<HEADLINE> China Stands for Complete Prohibition of All Outer Space Weapons-12 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China Stands for the complete
prohibition and thorough destruction of all weapons deployed in
outer space, says a white paper issued by the Information Office
of the State Council of China today.
</P>
<P>
The white paper "China's National Defense" says that outer
space belongs to all mankind, and should be used exclusively for
peaceful purposes to benefit mankind. China opposes the
development of anti-satellite weapons.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that the international community, the big
powers with the capacity to utilize outer space in particular,
should take realistic steps to prevent a weaponized outer space.
</P>
<P>
The white paper urges the international community to work
together to achieve a complete ban on weapons of any kind in outer
space, including anti-missile and anti-satellite weapons, so as to
keep outer space free of weapons.
</P>
<P>
The international community should also ban the use of force or
conduct of hostilities in, from or to outer space, all countries
should undertake neither to experiment with, produce or deploy
outer space weapons nor to utilize outer space to seek strategic
advantages on the ground, for example, using disposition of the
important parts of ground anti-missile systems in outer space for
the purpose of developing strategic defensive weapons, the white
paper says.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the white paper says, negotiations should be held
as soon as possible for the conclusion of a legally-binding
international agreement with the above-mentioned contents.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that since the beginning of the 1980s, as
one of the co-sponsors of the UN General Assembly resolutions on
keeping outer space weapon-free, China has promoted negotiations
on this problem at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament and
through other multilateral mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
"As early as at the founding of the Ad Hoc Committee of the
Conference on Disarmament on the Prevention of an Arms Race in
Outer Space, China submitted to it a paper on China's Position on
the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space (CD/579). Many
countries have supported China's position," the white paper says.

<P>
TOKYO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading Japanese newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
Asahi, Yomiuri, Mainichi, Nihon Keizai:
</P>
<P>
-- Four people died and 62 were poisoned at a summer festival
in the western Japan city of Wakayama on Saturday night after
eating food police suspect was deliberately laced with cyanide.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Issues White Paper on National Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A white paper has said that the
social system, development strategy and way of life that China has
chosen conform to the actual conditions of the country, and no
factors prompting invasion of another country can emerge.
</P>
<P>
The 30,000-character white paper, titled "China's National
Defense," was issued by the Information Office of the State
Council of China today.
</P>
<P>
It contains six parts: Foreword, the International Security
Situation, National Defense Policy, National Defense Construction,
International Security Cooperation, and Arms Control and
Disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that guided by its aspiration for peace
and development, China unswervingly pursues a national defense
policy that is defensive in nature, keeps national defense
construction in a position subordinate to and in the service of
the nation's economic construction, strengthens international and
regional security cooperation and actively participates in the
international arms control and disarmament process.
</P>
<P>
"Facts show that China is a responsible big country
and a firm force safeguarding world peace and stability," the
paper points out.
</P>
<P>
It notes that the development of China requires an environment
of long-term international peace, especially a favorable
peripheral environment. China holds that conflicts and disputes
among countries should be solved in a peaceful way through
consultation, and opposes the use or threat of use of force.
</P>
<P>
"Even when China becomes strong and powerful in the future, it
will by no means take to the road of foreign aggression and
expansion," according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that as a country in the Asia-Pacific region,
China places great importance on the region's security, stability,
peace and development. China's Asia-Pacific security strategy has
three objectives: China's own stability and prosperity, peace and
stability in its surrounding regions, and conducting dialogue and
cooperation with all countries in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Hence China devotes its efforts to promoting equal treatment
and friendly cooperation with other countries, and attaches
importance to developing healthy and stable relations with all
countries and all major forces in the region, according to the
paper. It adds that China insists on handling and settling
disputes among countries through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 China issued a white paper titled "China: Arms Control
and Disarmament," which mainly describes China's substantial
efforts and progress in the sphere of arms control and
disarmament. The new white paper gives a further exposition of
the country's defense work.

the country's defense work.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that peace and development are the major themes
of the present era. In general, the present international security
situation has continued to tend toward relaxation. However,
hegemonism and power politics remain the main source of threats
to world peace and stability. To obtain lasting peace, it is
imperative to abandon the cold war mentality, cultivate a new
concept of security and seek a new way to safeguard peace.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The paper points out that Taiwan is an inalienable part of
Chinese territory. In deciding which way to deal with the issue of
Taiwan, the Chinese government has no obligation to make a
commitment to any country or any person attempting to split
China. The Chinese government opposes any country selling arms to
Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Prices In Southern Chinese Province Continue To Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province in southern
China has seen retail prices keep on dropping for ten consecutive
months, since September of last year.
</P>
<P>
The province has also seen consumer prices (the cost of goods
and services to a typical consumer) in the first half of 1998 drop
0.8 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to recent statistics, Guangdong's food price index
has fallen 2.4 percent, and that of grain, eggs, and aquatic
products more than 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The prices of home appliances and electronics and machinery
products have also dropped by 5.9 percent and 6.3 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the continued price reductions to an
increase in market supply and more intense competition.

<TEXT>
<P>
The paper says that the Chinese government firmly pursues a
national defense policy that is defensive in nature. China has
always attached primary importance to safeguarding the state's
sovereignty, unity, territorial integrity and security. The
fundamental task of the state is to concentrate its strength on
the socialist modernization program. The work in defense must be
subordinate to and in the service of the nation's overall economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
"The social system, development strategy and way of life that
China has chosen conform to the actual conditions of the country,
and no factors prompting invasion of another country can emerge,"
the paper stresses.
</P>
<P>
It notes that the development of China requires an environment
of long-term international peace, especially a favorable
peripheral environment. China holds that conflicts and disputes
among countries should be solved in a peaceful way through
consultation, and opposes the use or threat of use of force.
</P>
<P>
"Even when China becomes strong and powerful in the future, it
will by no means take to the road of foreign aggression and
expansion," according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that under the new historical conditions the
Chinese army upholds the absolute leadership of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), implements the strategic principle of active
defense, emphasizes quality in army building, administrates the
armed forces along legal lines, engages in army building through
diligence and thrift, and actively participates in and supports
national economic construction. As a result, it has made great
contributions to the country's security, stability and
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
It notes that participating in and supporting the country's
construction is an important task entrusted by the Constitution to
the Chinese armed forces, and a reflection of the fundamental
purpose of the people's army -- to serve the people wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that in accordance with the Constitution, the
National Defense Law and other relevant laws, China has
established and improved its national defense system. The state
exercises unified leadership over defense-related activities.
</P>
<P>
It says that the National People's Congress (NPC) of the
People's Republic of China (PRC), the highest organ of state
power, decides on the questions of war and peace. The Chinese
People's Liberation Army (PLA) is organized in accordance with a
system whereby the General Staff Department, the General Political
Department, the General Logistics Department and the General
Armament Department are placed under the leadership of the Central
Military Commission (CMC).
</P>
<P>
It says that The armed forces of the PRC are composed of the
PLA, both the active and reserve components, the Chinese People's
Armed Police Force and the militia.
</P>
<P>
The state exercises unified leadership and planned control over
defense research and production. The State Council and the CMC
jointly lead mobilization preparation and implementation work,
according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> White Paper on China's National Defense (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The paper says that China attaches importance to the building
of a military legal system. Over the past ten-odd years, the NPC
and its Standing Committee have formulated 12 defense and
army-building laws and legality-related decisions, including the
National Defense Law of the PRC. The State Council and the CMC
have worked out 40-odd military administrative laws and
regulations, such as the Regulations on National Defense
Transportation. The CMC has formulated 70-odd military laws and
regulations, including the Regulations of the PLA
Headquarters. The various general departments, services and arms
and military area commands have drawn up 1,000-some items of
military rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
In the sphere of national defense construction, China has set
up and improved its defense leading system and operating mechanism
at both the central and local levels in accordance with the
law. China has also made remarkable achievements in army
construction, the paper adds.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that China has always stressed rationally scaled
expenditure on defense. The costs of defense are allocated in
accordance with the needs of defense and the country's financial
capacities and the principle of overall balance. Since the
introduction of the policies of reform and opening to the outside
world, the Chinese government has strictly controlled its defense
expenditure at a comparatively low level so that it can
concentrate on economic construction.
</P>
<P>
China has made relatively major reductions in defense
inputs. And its defense spending in the total state expenditure
has declined annually, the paper says, adding that China's defense
expenditure in 1997 was 9.80 billion U.S. dollars, which was only
3.67 percent of the USA's.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that China has always controlled the numbers and
size of its armed forces within the limit allowed by the national
strength and necessary to maintain state security.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of the PRC in 1949, China undertook two
disarmament steps -- one in 1955 and the other in 1958. In 1985
the government decided unilaterally to cut its troops by one
million men in real terms. In September 1997 China solemnly
announced that it would reduce the number of its military
personnel by 500,000 within the coming three years. When the
drawdown has been completed the total size of the PLA will be 2.5
million men.
</P>
<P>
It says that the stationing of the PLA troops in Hong Kong is
an important symbol of the Chinese government's resumption of
exercise of sovereignty over the region. It is also an important
guarantee for the preservation of state sovereignty and security
and the maintenance of the region's long-term prosperity and
security. It is a long-term task for the PLA Hong Kong Garrison to
fulfill its responsibility for Hong Kong's defense affairs, the
paper adds.

The paper says that China insists on dealing with its foreign
military relations independently and engaging in military
exchanges and cooperation based on the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence. So far, Chinese armed forces have established
relations with the armed forces of more than 100 other countries.
</P>
<P>
China has always placed the development of military contacts
with adjacent countries in a prominent position. Following the
principles of good-neighborliness and friendliness, mutual benefit
and cooperation and long-term stability, it has developed
extensive and beneficial contacts with the armed forces of those
countries, especially contacts on the senior level.
</P>
<P>
China places great stress on and actively promotes cooperation
in confidence-building measures (CBM), considering the
establishment of mutual trust between nations as an effective way
to maintain security. In recent years, China has reached
agreements with some neighboring countries on confidence-building
measures and reduction of military forces in border areas, which
is an important step China has taken to develop relations with
other countries and promote regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
China advocates regional-security dialogue and cooperation at
different levels, through various channels and in different
forms. Such dialogue and cooperation should follow these
principles: participation on an equal footing, reaching unanimity
through consultation, seeking common ground while reserving
differences, and proceeding in an orderly way and step by step.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that as a permanent member of the UN Security
Council, China will continue to participate in UN peace-keeping
operations in a positive and down-to-earth manner.

The paper says that the Chinese government highly stresses the
importance of arms control and disarmament work. The Chinese
government holds that the international community should promote
fair, rational, comprehensive and balanced arms control and
disarmament. China has steadfastly attended multilateral
negotiations on arms control and disarmament, and some related
international conferences.
</P>
<P>
It says that as a nuclear-weapon state, China vigorously
supports and participates in the international nuclear weapons
non-proliferation efforts, promotes the process of nuclear
disarmament and works hard for the realization of the final goal
of the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear
weapons worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"China has solemnly declared its determination not to be the
first to use such weapons at any time and in any circumstances,
and later undertook unconditionally not to use or threaten to use
nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or
nuclear-weapon-free zones," the paper stresses, adding that China
is a signatory state to the Complete Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always stood for the complete
prohibition and thorough destruction of chemical and biological
weapons. China has signed the CWC and BWC. China has been active
and conscientious in fulfilling the obligations stipulated in the
CWC and BWC.
</P>
<P>
China stands for the complete prohibition and thorough
destruction of weapons deployed in outer space, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The paper continues to says that China is in favor of imposing
proper and rational restrictions on the use and transfer of
anti-personnel mines (APLs) in a bid to achieve the ultimate
objective of comprehensive prohibition of such landmines through a
phased approach. At the same time, the Chinese government
maintains that, in addressing the problem of APLs, consideration
should be given to both humanitarian concern and the legitimate
defense requirements of sovereign states.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government agrees that necessary measures should be
adopted to apply effective international control to the transfer
of sensitive materials and technologies in order to prevent the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their
carriers. However, at the same time, China holds that
international efforts to prevent such proliferation should follow
the principle of fairness and rationality, and opposes a double
standard whereby anti-proliferation is used as a pretext to
infringe upon the sovereignty of other countries and harm normal
international cooperation and exchanges in the economy, trade,
science and technology. China practices strict control over the
transfer of conventional military equipment and related
technologies, the white paper says.

<HEADLINE> Private Economy Sound In Eastern Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- An average of 3,000 private firms
are born in Jiangsu Province in eastern China each month, which
has put the province in the lead in its private economy.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show 1.4 million private enterprises in the
province by the end of June. It has been looking for ways to
support private firms in recent years, a provincial official says,
pointing to the loosening of restrictions on loans and encouraging
them to participate in restructuring state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He explains that the rapidly-developing private economy also
feeds back into society, for example, paying 2.28 billion yuan in
taxes in the first half of 1998 and providing some 108,000 jobs
for unemployed people during the six-month period.

<HEADLINE> Hegemonism Remains Main Source of Threats to World Peace-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Hegemonism and power politics
remains the main source of threats to world peace and stability,
China says today in a white paper on its national defense.
</P>
<P>
The white paper, entitled "China's National Defense," was
issued today by the Information Office of the State Council, the
country's highest governing body.
</P>
<P>
The white paper points out that there still exist some factors
of instability both globally and regionally. Hegemonism and power
politics remain the main source of threats to world peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
It says that the cold war mentality and its influence still
have a certain currency, and the enlargement of military blocs
and the strengthening of military alliances have added factors of
instability to international security.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says some countries, by relying on their
military advantages, pose military threats to other countries,
even resorting to armed intervention. The old unfair and
irrational international economic order still damages the
interests of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
It says, history has proved that the concepts and systems of
security with military alliances as the basis and increasing
military might as the means could not be conducive to peace
during the cold war.
</P>
<P>
The white paper adds that under the new situation, especially,
enlarging military blocs and strengthening military alliances run
counter to the tide of the times. Security cannot be guaranteed
by an increase in arms, nor by military alliances, it says.
</P>
<P>
It stresses that security should be based on mutual trust and
common interests. All the countries should promote trust through
dialogue, seek security through cooperation, respect each other's
sovereignty, solve disputes through peaceful means and strive for
common development.
</P>
<P>
It says, to obtain lasting peace, it is imperative to abandon
the cold war mentality, cultivate a new concept of security and
seek a new way to safeguard peace.

BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China puts forward in a white
paper on national defense a new concept of international security,
which stresses the imperativeness of abandoning the cold war
mentality in seeking lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
The white paper, entitled "China's National Defense", was

</P>
<P>
The white paper says, to obtain lasting peace, it is imperative
to abandon the cold war mentality, cultivate a new concept of
security and seek a new way to safeguard peace.
</P>
<P>
China believes that this new concept and way should include
the following:
</P>
<P>
-- The relations among nations should be established on the
basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence: mutual
respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual
non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs,
equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. These are
the political basis and premise of global and regional security.
</P>
<P>
Each country has the right to choose its own social system,
development strategy and way of life, and no country should
interfere in the internal affairs of any other country in any way
or under any pretext, much less resort to military threats or
aggression.
</P>
<P>
-- In the economic field, all countries should strengthen
mutually beneficial cooperation, open up to each other, eliminate
inequalities and discriminatory policies in economic and trade
relations, gradually reduce the development gaps between countries
and seek common prosperity. Such steps can form the economic
basis of global and regional security.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining a normal and sound economic, trade and financial
order calls for not only a perfect macro-economic management
system as well as a sound system of economic operations, it also
calls for strengthening regional and international economic
contacts and cooperation, so as to jointly create a stable and
secure external economic environment.
</P>
<P>
-- All countries should promote mutual understanding and
trust through dialogue and cooperation, and seek the settlement
of divergences and disputes among nations through peaceful means.
These are the realistic ways to guarantee peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Security is mutual, and security dialogues and cooperation
should be aimed at promoting trust, not at creating
confrontations, still less at directing the spearhead against a
third country or infringing upon the security interests of any
other nation.

<HEADLINE> China Expounds Objectives of Asia-Pacific Security Strategy-3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China puts forward today three
objectives with regard to the Asia-Pacific region's security,
stability, peace and development in a white paper on national
defense.
</P>
<P>
The white paper, entitled "China's National Defense", was
issued here today by the Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
It says as a country in the Asia-Pacific region, China places
great importance on the region's security, stability, peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
The paper points out that China's Asia-Pacific security
strategy has three objectives: China's own stability and
prosperity, peace and stability in its surrounding regions, and
conducting dialogue and cooperation with all countries in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
It stresses that China devotes its efforts to promoting equal
treatment and friendly cooperation with other countries, and
attaches importance to developing healthy and stable relations
with all countries and all major forces in the region, actively
participates in regional economic cooperation and promotes an
open type of regionalism.
</P>
<P>
China also insists on handling and settling disputes among
countries through peaceful means and takes an active part in the
dialogue and cooperation process aimed at regional security, the
white paper adds.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says, on the basis of equal consultation,
mutual understanding and mutual accommodation, China has solved in
an appropriate manner border issues with most of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
It says as for remaining disputes on territorial and marine
rights and interests between China and neighboring countries,
China maintains that they are to be solved through consultations
by putting the interests of the whole above everything else, so
that the disputes will not hamper the normal development of state
relations or the stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
China has clearly stated that relevant disputes should be
properly solved through peaceful negotiation and consultation, in
accordance with commonly accepted international laws and modern
maritime laws, including the basic principles and legal systems
as prescribed in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the
Sea.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan, An Inalienable Part of Chinese Territory-4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China says today in a white paper
on its national defense that directly or indirectly incorporating
the Taiwan Straits into the security and cooperation sphere of any
country or any military alliance is an infringement upon and
interference in China's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The white paper entitled "China's National Defense", which was
issued by the Information Office of the State Council, points out,
Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory. It is a lofty
mission and a common aspiration of all Chinese people, including
the Taiwan compatriots, to put an end to the cleavage between the
two sides of the Taiwan Straits and realize the reunification of
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
It says that the Chinese government adheres to its stand for
solving the issue of Taiwan according to the basic principle of
"peaceful reunification, and one country, two systems," and
resolutely opposes any attempt, by words or deeds, to split the
country by creating an "independent Taiwan," "two Chinas," or
"one China, one Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The white paper says, the issue of Taiwan is entirely the
internal affairs of China. Directly or indirectly incorporating
the Taiwan Straits into the security and cooperation sphere of
any country or any military alliance is an infringement upon and
interference in China's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says, the Chinese government seeks to achieve
the reunification of the country by peaceful means, but will not
commit itself not to resort to force. Every sovereign state has
the right to use all means it thinks necessary, including military
means, to safeguard its own sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The white paper stresses, in deciding which way to deal with the
issue of Taiwan, the Chinese government has no obligation to make
a commitment to any country or any person attempting to split
China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government opposes any country selling arms to
Taiwan, which not only violates the basic norms of international
law but also threatens China's security and regional peace and
stability, the white paper says.

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Even Sets Record During Cool of the Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Texas, of the
southern United States, can't even get relief from the heat wave
during what normally would be the cool of the night.
</P>
<P>
The temperature barely cooled to an overnight low of 28 degrees
centigrade early Sunday, giving the state a record run of 24
consecutive days when it hasn't dropped below 26.6 degrees.
</P>
<P>
The daytime temperature hit 38 degrees centigrade by
midafternoon, the 21st consecutive day of highs above 37.7 degrees
centigrade.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the heat had been blamed for 141 deaths, including
at least 93 in Texas, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to contributing to deaths, the heat is blamed for
1.5 billion dollars in agricultural damage and more than 6,765
wildfires in Texas.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman on Sunday issued a federal
disaster declaration for 66 counties in southern and central
Oklahoma. The declaration makes low-interest federal loans
available to farmers who suffered a loss of 30 percent or more on
any single crop.
</P>
<P>
Last week, President Bill Clinton declared all Texas counties
eligible for disaster assistance.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists forecast little if any chance of cooling rain in
the coming week because of a large area of high pressure covering
the South.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Win Gymnastics Mixed Pairs at Goodwill Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China's Huang Xu and Ling Jie won the mixed
pairs in the gymnastics competitions at the Goodwill Games in Long Island, New
York on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese pair scored a total of 39.00 points, with Ling winning 19.675
points in uneven bars and balance beam and Huang, 19.325 in parallel bars and
in the pommel horse.
</P>
<P>
Russia's pair Alexei Nemov and Svetlana Khorkina finished second with a
total of 38.725 points. The bronze medal went to Russia's Alexei Bondarenko and
Anna Kovaleva, who gained a collective score of 38.700.
</P>
<P>
It was China's second gold medal in the gymnastics competition following
Huang's victory in the men's individual event of parallel bars on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese pair, who had been fifth after Saturday night's preliminaries,
performed well in both rounds Sunday, finishing second in the first round.
</P>
<P>
"We felt confident going into the second round," Huang told reporters. "We
felt that if we gave our best performances, we would win the gold medal."
</P>
<P>
Parallel bars is Huang's strongest event. Going into the second round with
the event he said he felt very conformable that he could get a high score and
he did it successfully with a high mark of 9.750.
</P>
<P>
Also Ling Jie, whose strongest events are the uneven bars and the balance
beam, beautifully performed in the two events in the last-day competition after
several failures since the start of the Games.
</P>
<P>
She fell from the uneven bars in the preliminaries Saturday night. But her
performance Sunday excited the audience.
</P>
<P>
"I just had to forget about yesterday and think only about today's
competition," Ling said. "I knew if we gave our normal performance, we would
have a good chance at a medal."
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Chinese girl said she felt "very happy" as it was her first
gold medal in international competition.
</P>
<P>
The Russian pair, Nemov and Khorkina, also had their successful performances
in their strongest events, but the weak ones discounted their scores. Though
Nemov got the men's highest 9.800 points in the high bar, he only gained 9.400
in the floor exercise.
</P>
<P>
The Russian girl scored the women's highest mark, 9.825, in uneven bars, but
her 9.700 points in the balance beam seemed not to her expectation.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- British Telecommunications Sunday
unveiled a global joint venture with AT&AMP;T, America's largest
long-distance operator.
</P>
<P>
The newly-allied company, with turnover expected to amount to
10 billion U.S. dollars by 2000, will pool both groups'
international networks, traffic and products to offer a wide range
of telecom and information services to multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
"By positioning ourselves at the forefront of the global
information age, we will maximize opportunities to grow revenues
and enhance profits for shareholders." said Sir Iain Vallance,
BT's chairman, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
BT chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield said services offered by
the new company will include global electronic commerce,
multimedia conferencing and public access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"We share the conviction that AT&AMP;T and BT can do more together
in the 21st century than either could do on their own.... The
world is too big to do it alone." AT&AMP;T President John Zeglis told
a news conference in London.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T is bringing to the new business the world's largest
telecoms customer base, while BT had become a pioneer in taking
telecoms global and "understands the way the world does business",
Zeglis said.

<P>
From a base in the United States, the new 50:50 joint venture
will employ 5,000 people by the year 2000, many of them in Europe.

The venture, which has yet to be named, will be chaired for the
first two years by BT Chairman Sir Iain Vallance, who will then
hand over to an AT&AMP;T executive.
