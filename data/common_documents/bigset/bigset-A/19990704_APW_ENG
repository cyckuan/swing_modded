<HEADLINE> Graf Ends Wimbledon Run on Sad Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- It was a tough final two days at  
Wimbledon for Steffi Graf. 
</P>
<P>
	She missed a chance for an eighth singles title by losing to  
Lindsay Davenport in straight sets in the final. Then she walked 
away from her favorite tournament, saying this would be her final 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	The toughest thing might have been telling playing partner John  
McEnroe she was pulling out of the mixed doubles, after they had 
reached the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very calm but he wasn't happy,'' said Graf, who  
withdrew Saturday with a slight thigh injury and didn't want to 
hamper her singles chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt terrible. It was a very difficult decision. I had a lot  
of fun, and then, when I talked to him, it wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Come on, we could win this.' And I was trying to  
tell him it would be a little difficult for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe, who worked Wimbledon as a television commentator for  
NBC, was philosophical about missing a shot at the mixed doubles 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like we were going to win it,'' McEnroe said. ``To be  
so close. It shows you have to appreciate the moments you get 
because they can slip away from you fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ANDRE AND BROOKE:* Recently divorced from actress Brooke  
Shields, Andre Agassi said during his French Open triumph that he 
spoke to her nearly every day. 
</P>
<P>
	So he was asked after his loss to Pete Sampras in Sunday's  
Wimbledon final whether he had seen Shields while they were both in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I've seen her,'' Agassi said, adding, ``and she's on an  
airplane right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked which was more satisfying, being in love and married but  
not winning matches, or the opposite, Agassi said, ``I'm sure you'd 
love an answer,'' then left the interview room. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *JUNIOR CHAMPIONS:* Austria's Jurgen Melzer beat top-seeded  
Kristian Pless of Denmark 7-6 (9-7), 6-3 to win the Wimbledon boys' 
singles title. 
</P>
<P>
	Iroda Tulyaganova of Uzbekistan scored a 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 victory  
over Russian Lina Krasnoroutskai to win the girls' singles title. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------.	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ODDS AND ENDS:* Pete Sampras served 17 aces in beating Andre  
Agassi in the men's final. That gave him 108 aces for the 
championship, only four behind his quarterfinal opponent, Mark 
Philippoussis, who withdrew from their match with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Maine senator George Mitchell, chairman of the Northern  
Ireland Peace Committee, was in the Royal Box watching Sunday's 
Wimbledon finals. So was Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the 
International Olympic Committee. Mitchell was the author of a 
report highly critical of the IOC for its role in the Salt Lake 
City bribery scandal.

<HEADLINE> Bush Defends Vietnam-Era Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MERRIMACK, N.H. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush defended his  
Vietnam-era stint as a National Guard pilot and maintains he 
received no special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked to become a pilot. I met the qualifications, and I  
ended up becoming an F-102 pilot,'' Bush said Sunday as he prepared 
to march in a Fourth of July parade. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP front-runner declared ``I served my country'' after the  
Los Angeles Times and The Dallas Morning News published details of 
his stateside duty during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said Bush, as a young recruit in the late 1960s,  
became a second lieutenant just out of basic training, jumping into 
the officer ranks without credentials that many other officer 
candidates possessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said the Texas Air National Guard  
was short of pilots, and a candidate had to be a commissioned 
officer to go to flight school. 
</P>
<P>
	``The military found him absolutely qualified to be  
commissioned,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said it was informed by Tom Hail, a historian for the  
Texas Air National Guard, that Bush's unit had 27 pilots at the 
time he began applying, two short of its authorized strength. But 
he said the unit, the 147th Fighter Interceptor Group in Houston, 
had two other pilots in training and another awaiting a transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper reported that Bush was allowed to transfer to the  
Alabama National Guard for three months in 1972 to work on the 
Senate campaign of a politician there, and at one point he was 
suspended from flying for failing to ``accomplish'' the annual 
physical. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes said Bush missed the physical because he was in Alabama,  
and there were only a few special doctors who could do physicals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas newspaper said records from Bush's military file  
showed that after inquiring about National Guard admission, Bush 
went to an Air Force recruiting office and scored in the 25th 
percentile on the pilot aptitude section of a test. That was the 
lowest score allowed for prospective pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	He scored better than 95 percent of those taking the ``officer  
quality section'' of the test, dealing with leadership and other 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush told the Dallas paper that he sought the Guard position on  
his own, before graduating from Yale University in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential hopeful Steve Forbes, who served six  
years in the National Guard, said Bush ``has got to answer the 
questions'' on his military service ``if anything illegal was 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But another GOP hopeful, Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, said, ``Why  
don't we stop all this nonsense of people digging things up? I hope 
this isn't the beginning of `gotcha' politics in the presidential 
campaign.'' Kasich appeared on ABC's ``This Week.''

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Legal Cases Reap Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The law firm that helped the state reach a  
$6.6 billion settlement with the tobacco industry was the most 
profitable law firm in the United States last year, according to a 
survey compiled by American Lawyer magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Robins, Kaplan, Miller &AMP; Ciresi's partners earned an average of  
$3.57 million, according to the magazine's calculations. 
</P>
<P>
	The law firms' bottom line was boosted by the $550 million in  
attorneys' fees, paid over three years, that the company earned for 
its tobacco work. 
</P>
<P>
	Managing partner Steve Schumeister said the law firm did not  
participate in the magazine's survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the top 100 U.S. law firms, the average partner's profit  
in 1998 rose to $622,000, an 11 percent increase over the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase was attributed to increased mergers and  
acquisitions, intellectual-property work and big-money 
acquisitions.

<HEADLINE> Blood Disorder Conference Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand has a lot in common with  
Mediterranean countries -- sunny beaches, easygoing lifestyle ... 
and large numbers of people who carry the gene for a 
life-threatening disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of experts from Thailand, the Mediterranean and other  
affected areas gathered in Bangkok last month for a conference on 
thalassemia, a genetic blood disorder that is expensive to treat 
and risky to cure. 
</P>
<P>
	``With 4 percent of the population on earth being thalassemia  
carriers and approximately 300,000 new thalassemics every year, the 
problem is very big,'' said Panos Englezos, chairman of the 
Cyprus-based Thalassemia International Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientific progress in recent years has improved the quality of  
life for patients. Previously, most victims of the severest form of 
the disease, thalassemia major, died as toddlers. Only a few would 
make it into their 20s, their growth often severely stunted. 
</P>
<P>
	But the promise of indefinite survival also holds the prospect  
of endless costs. Though many countries subsidize health care for 
their citizens, the price of treatment is staggering -- as much as 
$50,000 per year for drugs, blood transfusions and lab work. 
</P>
<P>
	Thalassemia produces, among other symptoms, chronic anemia -- a  
shortage of hemoglobin, the red blood cells which carry oxygen and 
nutrients throughout the body. 
</P>
<P>
	Without treatment, victims of thalassemia major usually die  
before the age of five. Traditional therapy -- frequent blood 
transfusions -- could extend their lifespan to the early 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicines developed two decades ago now allow victims to lead  
relatively normal lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The only cure, a bone marrow transplant, is risky. Molecular  
biologists are doing promising work in the field of gene therapy, 
but a breakthrough remains distant. 
</P>
<P>
	The main variants of thalassemia affect mostly people of  
Mediterranean and South and Southeast Asian descent. Elsewhere, 
there is little public awareness, even though thalassemia is the 
most common inherited single-gene disorder in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Partly because of immigration patterns of the past few decades,  
more than 2 million Americans carry the gene for the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans are generally more familiar with a related ailment,  
sickle cell anemia, which affects black people almost exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
	To replace their hemoglobin shortfall, people with thalassemia  
major need to be treated with blood transfusions every three or 
four weeks. Chronic transfusions cause excess iron to accumulate in 
various organs and disrupt their functions. In the long run, the 
iron overdose causes fatal cardiac and liver complications. 
</P>
<P>
	A medicine developed in the mid-1970s, desferroxamine, can  
remove the excess iron and extend the lives of thalassemics. 
</P>
<P>
	The high expense of the complete treatment, however, makes it  
economically impractical, especially in developing countries such 
as Thailand where the percentages of thalassemics are the highest. 
</P>
<P>
	General improvements in nutrition and health care due to  
economic development have nonetheless incrementally extended the 
live of thalassemics. 
</P>
<P>
	That will place a major burden on health care programs, warned  
Prof. David Weatherall, director of Oxford's Institute of Molecular 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	To cope, the number of thalassemics needs to remain under  
control through screening programs, marital advice and prenatal 
diagnosis, Wetherall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people with the disease are simply carriers of the  
thalassemia trait, meaning they suffer few or no symptoms but carry 
the gene. It can be passed benignly for generations. 
</P>
<P>
	The chances of developing the full-blown disease increase if  
both parents are carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy, Greece and Cyprus are curbing new cases through medical  
screening for the gene and counseling and educational efforts to 
dissuade high-risk parents from having children. 
</P>
<P>
	For scientific, social and economic reasons, countries like  
Thailand lag. 
</P>
<P>
	While the affected Mediterranean countries host relativeley  
homogeneous societies, the populations in Thailand and other 
tropical countries are more heterogeneous. 
</P>
<P>
	That means that the genetic structures are more complicated and  
allow for more numerous manifestations of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past few years, Thailand, where at least a quarter of the  
61 million population carry the thalassemia trait and there are 
more than 500,000 severely affected patients, has begun systematic, 
though limited, screening and educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, it's a rather well-known disease for Thailand,''  
said Dr. Boonchian Pansatiankul, who worked on the pilot program. 
``But we still have a lot of people who don't understand much.''

<HEADLINE> Unwanted Workers Now Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Pedro Gonzalez has an unenviable resume: 10th-grade dropout,  
ex-gang member, convicted felon. Just two months after leaving 
jail, however, he's making $12 an hour on a tree-trimming crew. 
</P>
<P>
	Desperate for workers, The Energy Group recently hired Gonzalez  
-- a man his bosses say wouldn't have gotten an interview a few 
years back. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Detroit-based company, which erects utility lines and  
keeps them free of debris, hopes to hire 10 more workers from 
Gonzalez's reform program, called GRACE for Gang Retirement and 
Continued Education/Employment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dropouts, unskilled minorities, people with disabilities,  
seniors: The unwanted workers, those who traditionally get the 
worst jobs, or no jobs at all, are suddenly wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	With unemployment at 4.3 percent in June, only slightly up from  
May's 29-year low of 4.2 percent, Gonzalez gets work that feeds his 
family. A disabled man leaves a dead-end restaurant job. 
Ex-soldiers are courted by telecommunications executives once 
uneasy about veterans' inflexibility. 
</P>
<P>
	As an inner-city employer, The Energy Group was having trouble  
keeping workers who lived in Detroit's outlying suburbs. ``We can't 
keep relying on workers who have to drive an hour and a half each 
way,'' says Dan Francis, a company vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need people so bad,'' Gonzalez agrees, borrowing his  
boss's cell phone on his lunch break to talk to a reporter. ``If 
they didn't, they could take their pick and choose. They're not 
going to choose an ex-felon before someone with no record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's hard to guess if the open doors will close again when the  
job market cools. Certainly, some people will be let go, and 
companies won't dig hard for workers like Pedro Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the gains made by historically marginalized workers are  
enormous, in some cases the biggest in decades. Jobless rates for 
high school dropouts have fallen from 9.7 percent in June 1994 to 
6.7 percent in June 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment among black workers was a record low of 7.3 percent  
in June. As recently as June 1994, it was 11.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Black men aged 16 to 24 are not only getting jobs, they're  
getting paid more -- gains they couldn't make in the prosperous 
1980s, according to a recent study by the National Bureau of 
Economic Research. 
</P>
<P>
	The progress is evident at the Ella J. Baker House, a community  
group for inner-city youths in Dorchester, one of Boston's toughest 
neighborhoods. Five years ago, ``you couldn't even get somebody 
from the electric company to visit,'' says Teny Gross, senior House 
counselor. These days, several recruiters or employers fax job 
offers or visit the House each week. 
</P>
<P>
	The hunger for workers is felt, too, at the President's  
Committee on Employment of People With Disabilities, whose database 
of disabled college students is being snapped up by employers. Last 
year, project director Paul Meyer sent out 130 copies of the 
database on CD-ROM at companies' request. Only halfway through this 
year, he's already sent 350. 
</P>
<P>
	One employee of the president's committee, Rachel Dorman, a  
junior at George Washington University in Washington, is legally 
blind. She got six offers for summer jobs, including three without 
interviews. ``I thought that was aggressive,'' she says with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	The market for ``non-traditional'' workers is so hot that  
recruiters, temp agencies and training companies are specializing 
in the very kinds of worker they used to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers, for one. Big companies have always been attracted to  
younger ex-officers' discipline and toughness, but older officers 
and low-ranking soldiers were sometimes regarded as too rigid and 
unimaginative, says Michael Devereaux, head of the military 
recruitment division of Lucas Group, a Dallas-based recruiter. 
</P>
<P>
	No more. Devereaux now has little trouble placing all ranks of  
former soldiers and finds companies such as Net2000 Communications, 
a Herndon, Va., telecommunications company, reconsidering their 
qualms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Net2000 is all about change,'' explains human resources  
executive Kathy Dickerson. ``When you think about the military, you 
think more about conservative, unwavering individuals, not someone 
in a constant change mode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pleased with the new labor pool, Net2000 is working with  
Devereaux to hire a number of ex-military engineers. 
</P>
<P>
	In Minneapolis, Robert Velasco, owner of a training firm that  
introduces computer skills to mostly female or minority students, 
can't produce job candidates fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies are making job offers to his students halfway through  
the 12-week program. In the last six months, he says, major 
companies that once declined to help finance his program now 
readily buy ``Corporate Partnerships'' that win them first crack at 
graduates. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, caution still tempers many employers' enthusiasm,  
one reason most of them turn to middlemen to hire such workers who 
are commonly unskilled or poorly educated. Stereotypes and 
discrimination still come into play as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Agencies and community groups such as GRACE screen workers and  
increasingly give them remedial training and crucial support. The 
temp agency Manpower offers an eight-part training program for 
people who've never held a job before; it includes a section on 
body odor. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, placements do fail. Desperate employers hire poor  
candidates more often. Inexperienced workers fold under the 
pressure of holding down jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	One woman sailed through Velasco's training and took a job as a  
computer technician, only to resume frequenting night clubs with 
friends. The day Velasco paid a surprise visit to see how she was 
doing, she had skipped work to go to a party, he recounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, amid the labor shortage, chances are being given and  
minds are being opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Haley, a Lenexa, Kan., computer technician, had never  
hired a disabled person before giving a computer job to Randy 
Hariton, a man with severely limited sight who'd been stuck working 
as a prep chef in restaurants for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he might have some problems ... but I have no  
complaints whatsoever,'' says Haley, a manager at a computer 
leasing company. ``It's told me on a personal level not to judge 
the book by the cover.''

<HEADLINE> M's Owners Said To Threaten Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Owners of the Seattle Mariners have said  
privately they might have to trade Ken Griffey Jr. or Alex 
Rodriguez if their demand for more money for a new ballpark is 
refused, The Seattle Times reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariners owners began saying as early as February it would be  
difficult to keep the team's top-paid players on the roster if the 
Mariners had to pay $100 million in cost overruns on the stadium 
that is set to open July 15. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 19, club chairman John Ellis wrote in a letter to the  
Washington State Public Facilities District board, ``If the owners 
had to bear the entirety of the enormous increased costs ... it 
would have an obvious impact on the club's flexibility in 
struggling to field a highly competitive team in the difficult 
baseball environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, Mariners lawyer Bart Waldman wrote the board  
that the cost of the project ``now exceeds the entire purchase 
price of the club (and) threatens to undermine the very purpose for 
which the new ballpark was conceived -- ensuring the success and 
competitiveness of baseball in Seattle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letters were provided to the newspaper by the stadium  
authority in response to a public-records request. 
</P>
<P>
	On numerous occasions, Mariners officials have denied publicly  
that they would play ``the Griffey card.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium board and the County Council have rejected the  
Mariners' bid for more money, saying club owners repeatedly 
promised to cover all costs over the $417 million that was budgeted 
and signed off on each additional expense along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 22, Ellis said the owners would do ``everything in our  
power'' to sign star players. Griffey and Rodriguez are both 
eligible for free agency after the 2000 season.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In a flash of camera bulbs, a century's  
worth of American faces were captured on film Sunday -- those of 112 
people born on Independence Days since 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Photo of the Century'' was taken at 7:04 a.m. in front of  
Independence Hall in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Twins, triplets and quadruplets, a man and his dog, a mother and  
daughter smiled while sporting red, white or blue shirts, throwing 
confetti and waving miniature American flags and fake sparklers. 
</P>
<P>
	The photographer, Paul Hosefros, represented 1947 and used a  
remote control to snap the photo while standing on the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
	The youngest face was that of Sarah Elizabeth Kitz, who had been  
born three hours earlier, weighing in at 7 pounds, 4 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
	The oldest was 99-year-old Betty Marx, whose caretaker helped  
apply her lipstick before the picture. One boy carried videotaped

	``You see, we've all grown up thinking the fireworks and  
America's birthday were for us, and here we are again with another 
big birthday party,'' said David Betz, 40, of Hopkinsville, Ky.

	In Arlington, Va., 52 people from 49 countries became citizens

	``I have lived in the United States for 19 years and I took time  
to decide to be a U.S. citizen,'' said Carmen Aguilar, a native of 
Venezuela. ``This is the very best decision of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humid and hazy weather didn't deter thousands from attending  
Boston's famous Fourth of July Boston Pops concert and fireworks 
display over the Charles River.

dream by being there.

	``I always watched this on TV,'' said the 61-year-old retiree,

	In the New York City borough of Brooklyn, 134-pound Hirofumi  
Nakajima, ``The Tokyo Terror,'' had to relinquish his 3-year-old 
title as the world champion hot dog eater.

<P>
	Steve Keiner, 50, of Egg Harbor Township, N.J., became top dog  
Sunday at Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest on Coney Island 
after eating 20 and one-quarter hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took the Zen approach,'' the 317-pound Keiner said,  
acknowledging the cultural influence of his Japanese competitor. 
``I went down a path that the hot dog was one with me, and I was 
one with the universe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nakajima, who had been champion three years in a row, came in  
third, downing just 19 franks. ``Hungry'' Charles Hardy, a 
320-pound corrections officer from Brooklyn, came within a mouthful 
of winning, with 20 dogs.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Severe thunderstorms rolled across North Dakota and northern  
Minnesota on Sunday, ripping roofs off buildings, and storms also 
were thickly scattered along much of the Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures were in the upper 80s and 90s from the central  
Plains as far north as the lower Great Lakes and the Northeast. The 
temperatures combined with high humidity to create heat indexes of 
100 to 110 from Nebraska and Minnesota across the Great Lakes and 
Ohio Valley to Pennsylvania, the Virginias, New Jersey and 
southeastern New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The temperature hit 100 at Fort Belvoir, Va.  
</P>
<P>
	The Pacific Northwest had much cooler weather, with Klamath  
Falls, Ore., chilling to a record morning low of 34, and Spokane, 
Wash., tying its record low at 42. 
</P>
<P>
	A pocket of storms with torrential rain moved across  
east-central North Dakota during the morning, and continued across 
Minnesota during the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	As the storms crossed the area of Fargo, N.D., on the  
Minnesota-North Dakota state line, wind gusting to more than 90 mph 
tore roofs from buildings, flipped small airplanes parked at an 
airport and knocked out electrical service to thousands of 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no immediate reports of injuries.  
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service said the storm was caused by hot,  
humid air moving along a warm front that had been stalled over the 
Dakotas and had created severe weather over the region for several 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Saturday, severe thunderstorms hit north-central Iowa,  
damaging farm buildings around the town of Parkersburg and pouring 
up to 6.5 inches of rain on some areas. Water stood up to 4 feet 
deep after the storms in New Hartford, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the thunderstorms, a few light showers were scattered  
westward across Montana, northern Idaho and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Thunderstorms also were possible in eastern Montana and Wyoming.  
</P>
<P>
	In the South, thunderstorms and showers were scattered across  
much of southern Texas and along the Gulf of Mexico coastlines of 
Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama into much of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy rain was possible in southern Florida.  
</P>
<P>
	And in the Northeast, an area of rapidly weakening storms rolled  
southeastward across eastern New York state, New Jersey and New 
England, and passed out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, a few widely scattered showers and thunderstorms  
developed during the afternoon over parts of eastern Arizona, New 
Mexico and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's temperatures around the Lower 48 states ranged from a  
morning low of 31 at Stanley, Idaho, to an early afternoon reading 
of 100 at Fort Belvoir, Va. The lowest wind chill was 29 at Klamath 
Falls, Ore., and the highest heat index was 119 at Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> United States 2, Brazil 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- There were few Fourth of July fireworks  
by the U.S. team as it qualified for the Women's World Cup final 
Sunday. Thanks to goalkeeper Briana Scurry, there didn't need to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans beat Brazil 2-0 to advance, with Cindy Parlow and  
Michelle Akers finding the net. But it wasn't a sharp offensive 
performance by the hosts, who were bailed out time and again by 
Scurry. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team celebrated its second trip to the World Cup final  
in the three times the event has been held -- the Americans won in 
1991 -- by sprinting to the far end of the field to congratulate 
Scurry. She then left the field pumping her arms above her head and 
saluting the crowd of 73,123. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday night's other semifinal featured China against defending  
champion Norway at Foxboro, Mass. The championship game will be 
played Saturday at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry made several strong saves in the first half, then was  
spectacular in the second period. With the Americans protecting a 
one-goal lead on Parlow's early score. Scurry tipped a 35-yard shot 
by Nene over the net. She also barely got a hand on Nene's kick in 
56th minute and made a sprawling two-handed stop on Pretinha in the 
83rd. 
</P>
<P>
	That, plus Parlow's goal in the fifth minute and Akers' penalty  
kick in the 80th, was enough to ensure some raucous celebrating 
after the match. Five years ago to the day, Brazil beat the United 
States 1-0 in the men's World Cup. It was the most significant 
soccer game Americans had played -- until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	During their customary victory lap in a 5-0 run during the  
tournament, the players did more hugging and clapping than usual. 
They even gathered on the track surrounding the field for one more 
chance to soak up the cheers before heading to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in the tournament, the Americans did not have  
an early gaffe. Instead, it was Brazil's goalkeeper who made the 
goof, and it cost her team a goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Foudy's long cross from the right wing went directly to  
keeper Maravilha. But as she leaped for it, the ball went off her 
hands into the air and Parlow headed it home in the fifth minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team pressed for a while, but then the visitors began  
to click with their passes. Scurry had to be quick to make a diving 
hand save on Pretinha in the 30th minute, and Akers made a superb 
clear near the goal line on Pretinha's cross moments later. 
</P>
<P>
	Akers was knocked around a few times in the opening half, once  
needing to leave the game after being kicked in the head by Sissi, 
who drew a yellow card. But it was a controversial foul on Mia Hamm 
that brought the penalty kick with 10 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
	Carla Overbeck's goal kick was headed downfield by Akers to  
Hamm, who broke into the penalty area. She was nudged by Brazil 
captain Elane and went down. Referee Katriina Elovirta signaled the 
penalty kick, and Elane grabbed the ball, holding it above her head 
and sarcastically summoning the crowd to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the fans held their breath until Akers put the shot  
into the right side of the net. Then they roared their approval as 
Akers, the team's oldest player at 33, jumped up and down like a 
schoolgirl.

	Russia Delays Peacekeepers' Airlift  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Russia postponed its planned airlift  
of peackeepers to Kosovo today after NATO officials said the 
alliance would block the flights until disagreements over Russia's 
role in the peacekeeping force are resolved. Russia needs 
permission from several east European countries to fly the 
peacekeepers over their territory. NATO member Hungary as well as 
Romania and Bulgaria, both of which want to join the alliance, have 
rejected the requests. NATO officials say Russia wants to send 
troops into sectors of Kosovo controlled by other NATO countries 
and to water down NATO's command of Russian forces.

	Clinton To Tour Areas of U.S. Poverty  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will embark this week on an  
``opportunity tour'' exploring patches of stubborn and desperate 
poverty from Appalachia to Watts. The president aims to ``shine the 
light on opportunity'' on the potential profits he says such places 
can offer investors while at the same time unshackling millions 
from poverty. Clinton's trek will take him to Pine Ridge, S.D., the 
Ogala Sioux reservation, Clarksdale, Miss., East St. Louis, Ill., 
South Phoenix, Ariz., and Anaheim, Calif., for a conference on 
hiring disadvantaged young people. Clinton will be the first 
president since Calvin Coolidge to visit an Indian reservation.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Shaken residents of a small enclave of Orthodox  
Jews on Chicago's far North Side expressed fear and confusion today 
after a gunman targeted minorities in a deadly shooting spree. The 
gunman had a ``predator look to him,'' one of his victims said as 
he recovered from a gunshot wound. ``I got the sense he was 
enjoying himself,'' the man told the Chicago Sun-Times from his 
hospital bed. A black man was killed, six Orthodox Jews were 
wounded and shots also were fired at an Asian-American couple, who 
were unhurt.

	DRAS, India (AP) -- After a 10-hour battle in rain and fog,  
Indian soldiers captured a strategic Himalayan peak held by 
Pakistan-based fighters today, marking a major turning point in 
fighting in the divided Kashmir region, military officials said. 
India made its claim as Pakistan's prime minister met with 
President Clinton in Washington in a U.S. attempt to defuse 
tensions over Kashmir. India's leader declined an invitation for 
separate talks with Clinton. Washington fears the fighting in 
Kashmir could turn into a wider conflict between the rival South 
Asia neighbors.

from a Singapore prison today, divorced, unemployed and under court 
order to account for every penny he spends. ``I know I did wrong,'' 
Leeson, 32, told reporters in a brief statement at London's 
Heathrow Airport. Leeson, working in the Singapore office of 
Britain's oldest commercial bank in the heady days of the 1990s 
Asian financial boom, made unauthorized futures trades that lost 
$1.38 billion and led to the bank's collapse in 1995.

sixth inning of a 9-5 win in the second game of a doubleheader. 
Fryman is batting .259 with eight homers and 42 RBIs in 62 games.

<HEADLINE> GM Considers New Line of Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) -- General Motors Corp. is considering  
building some components for its next generation of compact and 
midsize cars at the company's Fairfax plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The company would likely move its Pontiac Grand Prix assembly  
from Kansas City, Kan., to a Canadian plant to make room. 
</P>
<P>
	If the deal comes about, the plant would make chassis, drive  
train and engine components as part of the still-secret new cars, 
which have a code name of Epsilon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oldsmobile Intrigue assembly line at Fairfax would remain  
for the time being and even could overlap production for the new 
Epsilon line. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers at Fairfax, which employs about 3,500 people, were  
advised of the possible change Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But company spokesman Kyle Johnson said, ``a lot of things have  
to happen,'' before the company officially makes the change. He 
declined to answer questions about project costs or employment 
needs for a retooled plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the factors that have to be decided is a new labor  
agreement with local Auto Workers and negotiation of infrastructure 
and tax incentive deals with state and local officials, Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Russell, president of United Auto Workers Local 31, said the  
company's plan would ensure the long-term viability of the Fairfax 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a car GM plans to market worldwide, and we've been  
chosen to build it,'' Russell said. ``I feel like it's going to 
give job security to our people, particularly the younger 
employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Russell said some workers are anxious about the  
departure of the Grand Prix, which has been a popular Pontiac model 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have some concern, because the Grand Prix has given us job  
security since 1994,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Local TV-Satellite Deal Reached </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hughes Electronics Corp.'s DirecTV and  
broadcasters have agreed on general guidelines for transmitting 
local programs via satellite in an attempt to influence the final 
form of a new satellite TV law pending in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Copies of the agreement were sent this week to members of  
Congress trying to iron out the differences between House and 
Senate bills to permit satellite vendors such as DirecTV to carry 
the signals of local stations. 
</P>
<P>
	DirecTV, EchoStar Technologies Corp. and other satellite  
companies are blocked under existing federal law from carrying the 
local signals -- a handicap that has limited their appeal to many 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	In deciding to work together El Segundo, Calif.-based DirecTV  
and the National Association of Broadcasters hope to avoid what 
they consider to be excessive regulations in the House and Senate 
bills, an analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of the problem is it has been difficult to get the law  
hammered out. There seem to be a lot of hairy issues and different 
ideas how to do things. This is slowing things down,'' said Josh 
Bernoff, an analyst with Forrester Research in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``The objective here is to sort of get Congress off its butt and  
moving to an agreement that's as fair as can be for the satellite 
and terrestrial broadcasters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One key aspect of the agreement would prohibit DirecTV and other  
satellite companies from offering programs from several network 
affiliates in a single market. Los Angeles viewers, for example, 
would only see Los Angeles stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides fear that Congress will require expensive testing to  
determine who receives which signals from satellite operators, 
Bernoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also would require satellite companies to get a  
local station's permission to use its signal. 
</P>
<P>
	EchoStar, which did not take part in talks between DirecTV and  
NAB, has been pushing Congress to require local stations to provide 
their signals for satellite uplink. EchoStar has argued that 
stations could charge exorbitant rates if permission is required. 
</P>
<P>
	In a prepared release, EchoStar criticized the agreement between  
DirecTV and the association, saying it could undermine 
competitiveness. DirecTV is the nation's largest satellite TV 
system, with 7 million subscribers. EchoStar has 2.1 million 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If satellite has to pay more than cable for the same  
programming, consumers won't have a real alternative to rising 
cable rates,'' the statement said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Targets Poverty With Tax Breaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans on Sunday revealed a program  
of tax breaks and incentives to fight poverty in inner cities and 
poor rural areas, reviving elements of a plan that failed in the 
last Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaker Dennis Hastert asked President Clinton to endorse the  
``American Community Renewal Act'' before Clinton leaves Monday on 
a tour of poor areas to pitch his ``New Market Initiative'' 
recovery scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	In an Independence Day letter, Hastert told Clinton the  
community recovery proposal is bipartisan, ``the product of a 
concerted, four-year effort to construct a new model of 
revitalization after extensive tours through the nation's most 
poverty-stricken areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Moreover, it is based on the advice, ideas and experiences of  
hundreds of dedicated individuals involved in local community 
renewal work,'' Hastert, R-Ill., wrote. ``This legislation develops 
a public-private partnership to give people in currently low-income 
areas new hope and opportunity as we enter the 21st century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the Office of  
Management and Budget, said the Clinton administration was 
reviewing the GOP plan Hastert described. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Clinton's project ``features serious involvement with  
the private sector. If in fact the speaker is moving in this 
direction, we applaud his effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., sponsor of the original American  
Community Renewal bill four years ago, said his bill has more than 
100 co-sponsors. It is being made a part of the Republicans' 
``taxpayer relief package.'' His original bill passed the House, 
but did not make it through the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	It would create 100 renewal communities ``through targeted,  
pro-growth tax initiatives to create jobs, encourage personal 
savings, foster home ownership and clean up neighborhoods on former 
industrial sites,'' Hastert said in his letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Setting strict criteria for communities to be helped, the  
legislation emphasizes cooperation with community groups, small 
businesses and religious organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The religious connection might draw fire from many Democrats,  
although Vice President Al Gore has suggested that religious groups 
become more active in attacking the nation's social ills. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would involve them in drug counseling and  
rehabilitation, using government money. But it says no beneficiary 
can be required to participate in a religion-based program but 
rules out discrimination for religious reasons against 
organizations seeking money to provide services under the program. 
</P>
<P>
	An analysis of Clinton's ``New Market Initiative'' circulated  
with Hastert's letter called it a ``big government proposal'' that 
won't work. 
</P>
<P>
	It derided the administration's arguments that the initiative is  
needed because of ``small-business financing needs that are going 
unmet despite the current prosperity.'' The analysis said the 
Clinton Small Business Administration is to blame, because the 
numbers of minority loans have been dwindling for six years despite 
a succession of pilot SBA programs.

<HEADLINE> Mets place Bonilla on 15-Day DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets can't even put Bobby Bonilla  
on the disabled list without a little bit of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonilla was placed on the 15-day DL before Sunday night's game  
against Atlanta with tendinitis in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was retroactive to Saturday. The Mets recalled  
right-hander Jason Isringhausen from Triple-A Norfolk to take his 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little agreement between Bonilla and Mets management,  
however, about who made the decision to sit the outfielder for two 
weeks and whether he would agree to a minor league rehabilitation 
assignment when he was healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets manager Bobby Valentine, who rarely talks to Bonilla, said  
he heard that Bonilla requested to be put on the DL. That seemed to 
amuse Bonilla. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's hearing things again,'' Bonilla said. ``I didn't suggest  
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Steve Phillips, who talked to Bonilla about his  
knee Saturday, said he made the decision with consultation from 
Valentine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bobby Bo told me what he was feeling and left it up to me to  
make a decision about the DL,'' Phillips said. ``He said he wanted 
to get the knee better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sat down with Bobby V. and decided on the timing of the  
move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other conflict regarding the Bonilla situation was whether  
or not he would accept a rehab assignment. He refused to go on one 
when he came off the DL in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did I do it the first time?'' Bonilla asked. ``I'll just leave  
it at that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said Bonilla told him he wanted to get some at-bats at  
Triple-A before returning to the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said his preference would be not to travel around with the  
team,'' Phillips said. ``He wants to get some at-bats at Norfolk to 
get his timing back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonilla's return to New York has been a tumultuous one. He  
injured his right knee during spring training and was limited by a 
heavy brace. He had difficulty running in the outfield and 
generating power with his swing, drawing boos from the New York 
fans every time he stepped on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The brace affected his left knee and he was put on the DL in May  
after being hit by a pitch there. He is hitting .159 in 104 at-bats 
and the Mets have been trying to unload his $6 million salary. 
</P>
<P>
	They have offered to pay most of his salary to any team willing  
to take him in a trade and placed him on unconditional waivers last 
month. But no team has shown interest in an injured 36-year-old 
outfielder who can't hit, field or run. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonilla feuded with Valentine last month after the waiver report  
was made public. Bonilla has been relegated to pinch-hitting duty 
since, a task made more difficult by his knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is extremely difficult to get going if I can't get loose,''  
said Bonilla, who had a cortisone injection in his knee about two 
weeks ago. ``It is hard to go in and play without being able to get 
the knee loose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Isringhausen was 1-2 with a 7.30 ERA in five starts for the Mets  
before being sent back down to the minors June 23 to pitch out of 
the bullpen. In four relief appearances with Norfolk, Isringhausen 
allowed one hit and five walks in 4 2-3 scoreless innings. He 
struck out five. 
</P>
<P>
	Isringhausen is attempting to come back from reconstructive  
surgery on his right shoulder and elbow and both he and the Mets 
think a bullpen role will put less strain on his arm.

<HEADLINE> Revolution 3, MetroStars 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Joe-Max Moore scored twice to lead New  
England to a 3-2 victory over New York-New Jersey on Sunday at 
Foxboro Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore capitalized on some shoddy defense as he struck in the  
22nd and 53rd minutes. New England then survived a late scare as 
the MetroStars pulled within a goal in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really starting to come together for us,'' Moore said.  
``We've been able to put more players into the offensive third of 
the field and because of that, we're making more chances. 
</P>
<P>
	New England improved to 8-8 with the victory, while the  
MetroStars, languishing in fifth place in the Eastern Conference, 
fell to 5-11. 
</P>
<P>
	The game preceded the 1999 Women's World Cup semifinal match  
between defending champions Norway and China. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 22nd minute, New York defender Mike Petke failed to  
control a loose ball which was stolen by Ted Chronopoulos. 
Chronopoulos pushed a quick pass to Moore who finished from 12 
yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Revolution increased its lead only three minutes later. A  
rebound from a Jair shot off the right post came back to Giovanni 
Savarese, who finished from 8 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars made it 2-1 at 30 minutes when Tab Ramos passed  
to Mark Chung who beat goalkeeper Walter Zenga from 8 yards to the 
right side. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars nearly tied the game six minutes later, but Zenga  
foiled the attempt, making a sprawling save on a Chung shot from 16 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore took a cross from Mike Burns on the right side and knocked  
the ball into the net from seven yards at 53 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Villegas scored from 10 yards out with six minutes  
remaining to make it 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had some chances to get goals,'' MetroStars coach Bora  
Milutinovic said. ``But it was just too late for us. Today, Zenga 
was their best player. We worked hard, but it is hard when you are 
down by two goals to come back. We got one, but could not get 
another.''

<HEADLINE>  Serb Opposition Leader Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Braving a military court  
investigation, a top Serb opposition leader returned to Serbia on 
Sunday to face accusations of draft-dodging and to campaign for the 
ouster of President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoran Djindjic, head of the Democratic Party, landed at Belgrade  
airport and immediately dismissed the accusations against him, seen 
by many as Milosevic's attempt to crack down on forces demanding 
democratic reforms in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is utterly cynical and ironic that they are after  
me because of the war that they organized, caused and led without 
themselves fighting it,'' Djindjic said at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The war was the 78-day NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia  
triggered by the Kosovo crisis, which ended with government troops 
withdrawing from the province in Serbia, the larger of two Yugoslav 
republics. During the bombing, thousands of Yugoslav reservists 
were called up. 
</P>
<P>
	After the bombing started March 24, Djindjic went to Montenegro,  
Yugoslavia's other republic, mainly in fear of Milosevic's 
crackdown against opponents. Djindjic later traveled to western 
Europe while the army tried to serve him with a draft notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``My stay in Montenegro and abroad enabled for re-establishing  
the credibility of a democratic Serbia in the world,'' Djindjic 
said. ``I think I was of more use to Serbia (there) than if I 
stayed ... just watching the NATO planes unable to do anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Djindjic and his party have spearheaded protests against  
Milosevic, rallying support from increasingly dissatisfied and 
impoverished Serbs. Already in international isolation and 
struggling economically by previous wars in the region, Yugoslavia 
was badly damaged in the NATO raids. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our first task is removal of Milosevic and his regime ...  
Changes must come very soon so that people can survive the next 
winter,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the most important task the opposition faces is to  
avoid civil unrest while ensuring a change in government. 
</P>
<P>
	Djindjic said once Milosevic is no longer in power, the country  
should establish a transitional government to end the country's 
pariah status and then hold elections. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear when he would testify in the draft-dodging  
investigation. Under Serbian law, a court investigation is 
necessary to determine if there is enough evidence to indict. A 
conviction on the charge can carry a prison sentence of 20 years.

<HEADLINE>  Pigtailed Army Cheers the U.S. Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- They came with their hair in pigtails  
and their faces painted a blur of red, white and blue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're declaring our independence today with a big win,'' said  
Laura Rombach, a 14-year-old fan from Pleasanton who convinced her 
orthodontist to color her braces blue and red for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The dental work was in tribute to the U.S. team, which will  
advance to the final of the Women's World Cup after its 2-0 victory 
over Brazil on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really going to get into this,'' added 10-year-old  
sister Kate as her mother painted ``USA'' on her forehead. ``With 
fans like us, they can't lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry, who recorded her third shutout of  
the tournament on Sunday, said the fans definitely made a 
difference for her. 
</P>
<P>
	``Especially two in particular -- my parents finally got to a  
game,'' she said. ``It's the first game of the World Cup they've 
been able to see, so I've very happy that I was able to do them 
proud. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it was excellent to have the stadium filled. It's great to  
see the outpouring of people supporting us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 85,429-seat stadium was filled with 73,123 fans -- many of  
them young girls screaming for the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of Brazilian fans just aren't interested in the women  
players,'' said Fio Maravila, a Brazilian pizza maker from San 
Francisco. ``Last time this place was a Brazilian party. This time 
I feel pretty lonely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. players basked in the attention, jumping and clapping  
as they marched into Stanford Stadium. The United States scored 
four minutes into the game, with Cindy Parlow heading in a ball 
that Brazilian goalie Maravilha failed to catch. 
</P>
<P>
	Above the Rombach sisters, fans walked past two school bus-sized  
flags (United States and Brazil) sewn into one long banner. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose police officer Toni Mayo took her day off to cheer the  
American women. She was decked in red, white and blue from head 
(cardboard Uncle Sam hat) to toe (blue and white running shoes.) 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. players are simply the best,'' she said. ``They've  
got the momentum to go all the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the United States played Brazil in a World Cup  
game at Stanford University -- July 4, 1994 -- the players were men. 
The prospects were grim and the United States lost but played well. 
Brazil went on to win the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time we expect to win. Last time we expected to lose,''  
said Bob Kraiss of Palo Alto, who rode to the stadium with his wife 
on bikes. They took the same route five years ago for the men's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's very different than that men's game,'' said Carol  
Kraiss, a teacher. ``There's a lot more cheering going on. We're 
really excited about this team.''

<HEADLINE> John Daly Will Skip British Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- A frustrated John Daly will skip the  
British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired, I have no confidence and I just don't feel it's  
fair to take the spot of somebody who may be playing real good,'' 
Daly said Sunday. ``I played pretty good this week, but I just 
can't score. It's been like that all year. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 3-over 74 in the final round of the Irish Open, in which  
he finished next-to-last at 12-over 296, the 1995 British Open 
champion said he was flying home to Memphis, Tenn., and wouldn't be 
playing in next week's Open warmup at Loch Lomond. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, who threatened never again to play in the U.S. Open after  
finishing last two weeks ago, hasn't won a tournament since his 
triumph at St. Andrews in '95. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just so frustrated with my game,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Investment Firms Examine E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- In the financial services world, Fidelity  
Investments is a brash newcomer that became the world's largest 
mutual fund company by catering to the crowd, peddling investments 
with commercials featuring Lily Tomlin. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other end of the spectrum is the old-line firm Lehman  
Bros., which has served institutional investors since it first 
raised money for the state of Alabama in 1867. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the two firms are joining forces in an alliance that shows  
how eCommerce is democratizing the investment world and forcing 
tradition-bound financial services firms to get nimble, fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman will offer Fidelity's customers its research, some  
initial public offerings and complex financial instruments. 
Fidelity will give Lehman access to its 5.7 million Internet 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	In June alone, New York-based Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. shocked the  
securities industry by announcing it will let customers trade stock 
over the Internet, depriving some of its brokers of a chunk of 
money as customers bypass their advice and trade on-line instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Boston-based Scudder Kemper Co. announced it will shut its  
five retail offices and aggressively promote Internet trading 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just facing reality,'' said William Dougherty, president  
of Kanon Bloch Carre, a consulting firm. ``Complete computer 
illiterates are finding they can trade for $12 when it used to cost 
$70.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scudder says 34 percent of its transactions are conducted over  
the Internet now. The firm thinks that number could go as high as 
100 percent, said Mark Casady, Scudder's managing director. 
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe it won't. ``None of us knows how to predict the  
future,'' Casady said. 
</P>
<P>
	But at a time when competition has never been so fierce and  
change has never come so quickly, financial services firms can't 
afford to miss a trend. 
</P>
<P>
	One way to try out a new direction without making a huge  
financial commitment is to create a partnership, like the one 
Fidelity announced with Lehman Bros. last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fidelity-Lehman Bros. alliance allows each company to offer  
a product it has no intention of specializing in, said Robert 
Mazzarella, president of Fidelity Brokerage Services, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fidelity -- like Scudder, Merrill Lynch and others -- is also  
waking up to a promising new eCommerce reality: the Internet, which 
was originally designed for information exchange rather than 
business, allows financial services companies to bring investment 
advice to the do-it-yourself investor. 
</P>
<P>
	The same way banks replaced tellers with ATMs, financial  
services companies are now looking to replace financial planners 
with Web sites. If all goes well, those sites will become financial 
products shopping malls, able to calculate customers' net worth, 
advise them on a variety of financial products, or sell them 
everything from car insurance to unit investment trusts. 
</P>
<P>
	Fidelity's alliance with Lehman gives its customers access to  
Lehman's research on the Web and some more sophisticated products 
than the mutual fund firm offers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really looking at ourselves as a financial portal,''  
said Mazzarella of Fidelity. ``We want to provide our consumers 
with everything they need to handle their financial affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	No one says it's going to be easy.  
</P>
<P>
	Scudder is trying to do the same -- and, like Fidelity, plans to  
get into joint ventures to understand what capabilities it will 
need in the on-line world. 
</P>
<P>
	On-line broker Ameritrade Holding is also planning to launch an  
on-line financial services mall that will calculate customers' net 
worth with a click or two of the mouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things change so rapidly now, new products come out at an  
incredible rate,'' Mazzarella said. ``A lot of creative people are 
fighting for the same customers.''

<HEADLINE>  S.Korea President Honored in Philly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, who  
once faced the death penalty in a military prison, was awarded the 
1999 Philadelphia Liberty Medal on Sunday and promised to ``spread 
the spirit of liberty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, 77, was honored for more than four decades of efforts to  
secure democracy and human rights in South Korea. His December 1997 
election marked the first peaceful transfer of power to an 
opposition party in South Korea's 50 years of independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Under previous governments, Kim was sentenced to death in a  
military camp in 1980. But after pressure from Washington, the 
sentence was commuted and he was released two years later. He also 
has survived five assassination attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still remember the experience in 1980,'' Kim said of his  
death sentence. ``I was waiting for execution day in the army 
prison. My wife and children came to visit me. We all prayed to God 
in tears, we cried together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Freedom is like air, difficult to appreciate when you are  
living in it,'' Kim told several thousand people at Independence 
Hall. ``I am one of those people who well appreciates the value of 
freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, who has been criticized for seeking greater economic and  
political contact with North Korea, said he will continue to engage 
with the communist government. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would ``strive to spread the spirit of liberty to our  
brethren in the North and to all dark corners of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The medal was established in 1988 to honor individuals or  
organizations whose actions represent the founding principles of 
the United States. Past recipients include former President Jimmy 
Carter, former Polish President Lech Walesa, former Israeli Prime 
Minister Shimon Peres and the late King Hussein of Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said he was giving the $100,000 prize to his Kim Dae-jung  
Peace Foundation to support human rights around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Alongside Independence Hall, about two dozen Korean protesters  
held signs calling for the repeal of the South Korean national 
security law, which makes it illegal for South Koreans to cooperate 
with North Korean officials without permission. Kim said the 
government was working to change the law. 
</P>
<P>
	A block away, more than 100 supporters of convicted Philadelphia  
cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal held their own demonstration, and their 
chanting and shouting could be heard throughout Kim's speech.

<HEADLINE> Limp Bizkit Singer Wants It All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Limp Bizkit lead singer Fred Durst did a lot  
before he hit the big time. Now he wants to do it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dude, I want to be massive,'' Durst says in the August issue  
of Spin magazine. ``And I think I can do it. I've got crazy 
vision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Jacksonville, Fla., Durst grew up in Gastonia, N.C.,  
where his love of hip-hop music and break dancing made him an 
outcast. After high school, he served briefly in the Navy, got 
married, had a child, and divorced. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 20 he moved back to Jacksonville, where he worked as a  
tattoo artist before forming Limp Bizkit. They made a demo and sent 
it to a member of the band Korn, who had gotten a tattoo from Durst 
while touring in Florida. That led to a record deal.

<HEADLINE>  S.Korea President Honored in Philly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, who  
once faced the death penalty in a military prison, was awarded the 
1999 Philadelphia Liberty Medal on Sunday and promised to ``spread 
the spirit of liberty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, 77, was honored for more than four decades of efforts to  
secure democracy and human rights in South Korea. His December 1997 
election marked the first peaceful transfer of power to an 
opposition party in South Korea's 50 years of independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Under previous governments, Kim was sentenced to death in a  
military camp in 1980. But after pressure from Washington, the 
sentence was commuted and he was released two years later. He also 
has survived five assassination attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still remember the experience in 1980,'' Kim said of his  
death sentence. ``I was waiting for execution day in the army 
prison. My wife and children came to visit me. We all prayed to God 
in tears, we cried together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Freedom is like air, difficult to appreciate when you are  
living in it,'' Kim told several thousand people at Independence 
Hall. ``I am one of those people who well appreciates the value of 
freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, who has been criticized for seeking greater economic and  
political contact with North Korea, said he will continue to engage 
with the communist government. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would ``strive to spread the spirit of liberty to our  
brethren in the North and to all dark corners of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The medal was established in 1988 to honor individuals or  
organizations whose actions represent the founding principles of 
the United States. Past recipients include former President Jimmy 
Carter, former Polish President Lech Walesa, former Israeli Prime 
Minister Shimon Peres and the late King Hussein of Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said he was giving the $100,000 prize to his Kim Dae-jung  
Peace Foundation to support human rights around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Alongside Independence Hall, about two dozen Korean protesters  
held signs calling for the repeal of the South Korean national 
security law, which makes it illegal for South Koreans to cooperate 
with North Korean officials without permission. Kim said the 
government was working to change the law. 
</P>
<P>
	A block away, more than 100 supporters of convicted Philadelphia  
cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal held their own demonstration, and their 
chanting and shouting could be heard throughout Kim's speech.

<HEADLINE> Jeff Krogh in Stable Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Race driver Jeff Krogh was listed in critical  
condition Sunday, a day after a crash during practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Krogh, a third-year NASCAR Busch Series driver,  
was taken unconscious to Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital 
following the crash Saturday at the state fairgrounds in West Allis 
where he was preparing for Sunday's DieHard 250. 
</P>
<P>
	He was placed on a ventilator to help his breathing but had no  
fractures or visible signs of injury, the hospital said. 
</P>
<P>
	His condition Sunday remained virtually unchanged.  
</P>
<P>
	Krogh was injured when his Chevrolet hit the wall in the first  
turn. He also crashed earlier in the day on the fourth turn of the 
second lap of his qualifying run. 
</P>
<P>
	He failed to qualify in trials. At 36th in points, however, he  
had provisional eligibility to start 42nd. 
</P>
<P>
	Krogh is a native of Kamiah, Idaho, living in Ronda, N.C.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Linked to Anti-Minority Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The man being sought in connection with  
shootings of minorities in the Midwest was a member of a group 
called World Church of the Creator, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Web site that says it belongs to the church says the group  
``neither condones violence or unlawful activities, nor do we 
promote or incite them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Web site says the objective of the church is ``the  
survival, expansion and advancement of the white race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The church, based in East Peoria, Ill., is led by the Rev. Matt  
Hale. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale told CNN that the suspect, Benjamin Daniel Smith, was a  
member of the church from June 1998 until May. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a thoughtful, dedicated person who believed essentially  
in our creed, our religion,'' Hale said. ``I never had any 
information or inkling he would do anything illegal or violent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bloomington Police Chief Jim Kennedy said the church was  
involved in the distribution of anti-minority and anti-Semitic 
literature there last year when Smith was a student at Indiana 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy said the literature ``represents extreme right-wing  
views. It's very anti-minority, very anti-Semitic and it certainly 
alarmed the people in this community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hale did not return a call for comment Sunday from The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	An Illinois state hearing board rejected Hale's appeal for a law  
license last week, saying his beliefs and character make him 
ill-suited to practice law, and unable to follow the state's rules 
of conduct for lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale said Friday he planned to appeal his case to the state  
Supreme Court and file a federal civil rights lawsuit. He said he 
believes many practicing lawyers share his racist beliefs but keep 
them hidden. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are a racist, as am I, then they're saying you don't  
have the right to say what you believe and be a lawyer,'' Hale 
said. ``That's a denial of free speech.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wins Five Swimming Medals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) -- Mark Warkentin trains  
for swimming's equivalent of the marathon. On Sunday, he did a fair 
impression of a sprinter. 
</P>
<P>
	Competing in the 200-meter freestyle at an international event  
for the first time, the native of Santa Barbara, Calif., won a gold 
medal at the University Games, one of five medals the United States 
picked up on the first day of swimming competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Warkentin will swim the 400, 800 and 1,500 freestyle races as  
well as two relay events later in the week at the biannual 
Olympics-style event, and said winning five golds at the colorful 
new Son Hugo swimming and diving complex is ``realistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was told only last week he would race the 200, after Trevor  
Runberg withdrew from the U.S. team for personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came as a shock I was swimming, and then I won,'' said  
Warkentin, who was timed at 1 minute, 51.30 seconds in becoming the 
first U.S. swimmer since Matt Biondi in 1985 to win the 200 
freestyle at the University Games. ``They raised the flag. That's 
never happened to me before. I've only seen that on TV. You dream 
about moments like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Southern California sophomore beat France's Lionel Poirot by  
.08 of a second, with Russia's Dmitri Tchernychev placing third in 
1:51.83. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. quartet of Rada Owen, Kimberly Black, Caroline Kilian  
and Kathryn Zambone took gold in the 4x200 freestyle relay with a 
time of 8:13.41. Italy claimed the silver after Japan lost its 
second-place finish because a swimmer left her mark early, and 
Britain took the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	Other U.S. swimmers to medal were Cara Lane, with an  
800-freestyle victory, while Julie Varozza finished with a bronze 
in the same race, and Corrie Murphy, who earned a bronze in the 
women's 400-meter individual medley. 
</P>
<P>
	Hana Cerna of the Czech Republic, who was third at the 1997  
European Championships, won the medley in 4:46.03, followed by 
Romania's Catalina Casaru. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Tomoko Hagiwara was the surprise winner of the women's  
100-meter butterfly, finishing in 1:00.47. Hagiwara's specialty is 
backstroke, but she volunteered for the 100 fly during Japan's team 
trials in April after no one had been chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We asked if anyone wanted to do it and Tomoko put her hand up  
to volunteer,'' team official Shigeo Ogata said. ``This was a big 
surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russians Roman Makarov and Andrei Perminov were first and third,  
respectively, in the men's 200 breaststroke. Japan's Yoshiako Okita 
won the silver. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. men's basketball team, owner of five straight gold  
medals, stretched its winning streak to 34 games at the University 
Games with a straightforward 97-58 defeat of Nigeria. Texas center 
Chris Mihm led the way with 19 points, including a record 13 free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Michael Redd, who helped lead Ohio State to the NCAA Final  
Four this year, chipped in with 17 points on 7-of-8 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. continues preliminary round play Monday against the  
Czech Republic, while the women open their tournament against 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan edged Russia to take the gold in the team competition for  
men's gymnastics, finishing with a total of 170.750 points to 
Russia's 170.075. The United States finished 13th with 162.125 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy claimed its first gold of the games in fencing, as David  
Burroni upset defending champion Oleksandr Gorbachuk of Ukraine 
15-12 in the men's epee final. 
</P>
<P>
	In preliminary soccer games, Britain held traditional power  
Brazil to a surprising 0-0 draw. Italy, gold medalist two years 
ago, edged Ireland 1-0, Iran and the Czech Republic drew 0-0, 
Nigeria tied Ukraine 2-2, Mexico beat Japan 2-0, and Australia and 
Uruguay drew 0-0, as did Morocco and host Spain.

<HEADLINE> Graf: I've Played My Last Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Steffi Graf played her last Wimbledon,  
walking off Centre Court without so much as a wave. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't be back,'' she said. ``I won't be here as a player  
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-time champion spoke after losing 6-4, 7-5 to Lindsay  
Davenport in the final Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning the French Open last month, Graf said she would no  
longer play at Roland Garros. The 30-year-old German, beset by 
injuries, would not say Sunday if she is retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not comment on anything other than that,'' she said.  
``I have not had enough time to think about those things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf's announcement leaves Wimbledon without two of its great  
champions. Compatriot Boris Becker said after his fourth-round loss 
that he had played his last Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf said she decided before the tournament this would be her  
last Wimbledon, even if she won. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a decision and, you know, I've been pretty sure about it  
for a long time,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm a little sad about everything, which is normal  
for the moment,'' she added. ``But I still think that I feel ... a 
winner getting out of this tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf played her first Wimbledon in 1984, reaching the fourth  
round. She won the championship in 1988, '89, '91, '92, '93, '95 
and '96. She was runner-up in '86. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Martina Navratilova has won Wimbledon more times, with nine  
titles. Graf's 22 Grand Slam championships are two short of 
Margaret Court's record. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a lot of fun but, I guess, yes, there's going to be  
a certain time when I've got to move on with something else in my 
life,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the last few weeks have been pretty amazing. ``Who  
would have thought I would be doing so well? It's obvious that I'm 
disappointed about losing the finals but I do have to say ... it 
been tough getting there but it's also been ... great here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf was handed the runner-up plate by the Duchess of Kent. She  
said the duchess told her she was ``getting used to giving me the 
winner's plate'' and hesitated to hand over the second-place award. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf, deferring to Davenport, left Centre Court without waving  
goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt it was her day and I wanted to keep it that way,'' Graf  
said.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In a flash of camera bulbs, a century's  
worth of American faces were captured on film Sunday -- those of 112 
people born on Independence Days since 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Photo of the Century'' was taken at 7:04 a.m. in front of  
Independence Hall in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Twins, triplets and quadruplets, a man and his dog, a mother and  
daughter smiled while sporting red, white or blue shirts, throwing 
confetti and waving miniature American flags and fake sparklers. 
</P>
<P>
	The photographer, Paul Hosefros, represented 1947 and used a  
remote control to snap the photo while standing on the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
	The youngest face was that of Sarah Elizabeth Kitz, who had been  
born three hours earlier, weighing in at 7 pounds, 4 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
	The oldest was 99-year-old Betty Marx, whose caretaker helped  
apply her lipstick before the picture. One boy carried videotaped 
the event for his memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see, we've all grown up thinking the fireworks and  
America's birthday were for us, and here we are again with another 
big birthday party,'' said David Betz, 40, of Hopkinsville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	The photo was just one of the many ways Americans celebrated the  
nation's 223rd birthday on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Arlington, Va., 52 people from 49 countries became citizens  
at a ceremony in Freedom Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have lived in the United States for 19 years and I took time  
to decide to be a U.S. citizen,'' said Carmen Aguilar, a native of 
Venezuela. ``This is the very best decision of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humid and hazy weather didn't deter thousands from attending  
Boston's famous Fourth of July Boston Pops concert and fireworks 
display over the Charles River. 
</P>
<P>
	Emil Kannengieszer of Abington, Pa., was fulfilling his lifelong  
dream by being there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always watched this on TV,'' said the 61-year-old retiree,  
who arrived at 6 a.m. to get prime seats for the show. ``I told my 
wife, `Someday before I die, I want to see this.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In the New York City borough of Brooklyn, 134-pound Hirofumi  
Nakajima, ``The Tokyo Terror,'' had to relinquish his 3-year-old 
title as the world champion hot dog eater. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Keiner, 50, of Egg Harbor Township, N.J., became top dog  
Sunday at Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest on Coney Island 
after eating 20 and one-quarter hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took the Zen approach,'' the 317-pound Keiner said,  
acknowledging the cultural influence of his Japanese competitor. 
``I went down a path that the hot dog was one with me, and I was 
one with the universe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nakajima, who had been champion three years in a row, came in  
third, downing just 19 franks. ``Hungry'' Charles Hardy, a 
320-pound corrections officer from Brooklyn, came within a mouthful 
of winning, with 20 dogs.

<HEADLINE> 1 Dies As Family Boat Goes Into Dam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A man on a nighttime fishing outing  
with his son and brother died after their small boat ran into a dam 
on the Arkansas River. 
</P>
<P>
	George Freas, 52, and his son Matthew, 16, were sucked through  
the dam's gates Saturday night. They emerged safely on the other 
side, but George Freas lost consciousness while he and his son 
floated down the river for a half-mile. He was pronounced dead from 
drowning. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew was rescued early Sunday, as was his uncle, Keith Freas,  
61, who clung to a log against the dam for five hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The three men had been in a 14-foot aluminum boat when the  
engine stalled and a swift current carried them into Murray Lock 
and Dam. None was wearing a life jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	``They totally had no control of the boat whatsoever,'' said  
Ross Spurlock, a wildlife officer with the Arkansas Game and Fish 
Commission. ``They hit the dam and they bounced two or three times 
against the dam until the boat finally capsized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Freas was treated in a hospital and released. Matthew was  
in fair condition Sunday.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, who  
once faced the death penalty in a military prison, was awarded the 
1999 Philadelphia Liberty Medal on Sunday and promised to ``spread

	Kashmir Control Line May Be Restored  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After meeting with President Clinton today,  
Pakistan's prime minister agreed ``that concrete steps will be 
taken'' to restore the ``Line of Control'' separating Pakistani and 
Indian forces near Kashmir. The statement, issued by Clinton and 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, said that the two agreed that an 
Indian-Pakistani dialogue begun last February in Lahore ``provides 
the best forum for resolving all issues dividing India and 
Pakistan, including Kashmir.'' ``Our understanding is that there 
will be a withdrawal of the (Pakistani) forces now,'' said a U.S. 
official.

	Cops: Chicago Shooter Kills Again  
</P>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- A gunman who targeted minorities in a  
deadly drive-by shooting spree in the Chicago area struck again 
today, killing a Korean man outside a church, police said. The 
shooter, believed to be a white supremacist, had also fired at 
Asians and blacks in two Illinois cities yesterday, police said. 
``This man is on a spree,'' Chicago Police Cmdr. William Hayes 
said. Police issued an arrest warrant for the owner of the light 
blue Ford Taurus reported at each of the shootings -- Benjamin 
Nathaniel Smith, 21. 

</P>
<P>
	Suspect Linked to Anti-Minority Group  
</P>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- The man suspected of targeting minorities in  
a Midwest shooting spree once belonged to a white supremacist group 
called the World Church of the Creator, police said today. The 
leader of the group, Matt Hale, tried to distance himself from 
Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, saying that to blame the shootings on the 
church was ``the same as people accusing the Pope of being behind 
all those abortion clinic bombings.'' The shootings came on the 
heels of a decision by an Illinois state hearing board to reject 
Hale's appeal for a law license. The board said Hale's beliefs and 
character make him ill-suited to practice law, and unable to follow 
the state's rules of conduct for lawyers.

	Bin Laden May Have New Afghan Base

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Osama bin Laden, the Saudi dissident who  
disappeared in February after being accused in the U.S. Embassy 
bombings in Africa, has moved into a new base in Afghanistan, The 
Observer newspaper reported today. Bin Laden reportedly left his 
first base in Afghanistan after a falling-out with his hosts, the 
Taliban religious militia that rules most of the country. Bin Laden 
was accused in a trial in New York of planning the Aug. 7 attacks 
on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people.

	NATO Blocks Russian Troops  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- In the latest sign of frayed relations between  
Russia and the West, Russian troops were forced to delay their 
departure for Kosovo today after NATO blocked air corridors on 
their route. Infuriated Russian defense officials said the 
reasoning behind the move amounted to a U.S. ``provocation.'' 
According to the ITAR-Tass news agency, two Ilyushin-76 military 
cargo plans were scheduled to fly about 100 paratroopers to Kosovo 
on Sunday, but the flights were put on standby when they couldn't 
get permission to fly over Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania.

simultaneously unshackling millions from poverty. Clinton's will 
visit Pine Ridge, S.D., the Ogala Sioux reservation, Clarksdale, 
Miss., East St. Louis, Ill., South Phoenix, Ariz., and Anaheim, 
Calif. He will be the first president since Calvin Coolidge to

<HEADLINE> New Birth Control Choices in Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The nation's most popular birth control  
pill just got a new look -- a more ``discreet'' case resembling a 
makeup compact -- and other packaging changes to make it easier to 
use. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with cosmetic changes to the Ortho Dialpak dispenser  
holding Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical's nine oral contraceptive 
brands, women will have additional birth control choices in the 
near future. 
</P>
<P>
	Those include the return of the Today Sponge, which startup drug  
company Allendale Pharmaceuticals bought from the previous maker 
and plans to begin selling by mid-fall. A monthly contraceptive 
injection called Lunelle, made by Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, could hit the 
market by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	And Allendale, located in the northern New Jersey town of the  
same name, hopes by early next year to begin selling a 
contraceptive film that dissolves inside the vagina. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet more revolutionary methods remain far off -- something family  
planning experts say is a serious problem in a country where half 
of the 6.3 million pregnancies each year are unplanned and the last 
new method, the female condom, was introduced six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States has gone from being the undisputed world  
leader in contraceptive development to being in the backwaters,'' 
with women in Europe, Canada and elsewhere having more 
contraceptive choices, said Dr. David Grimes of the nonprofit 
research organization Family Health International. 
</P>
<P>
	Grimes and other experts say that's largely because of  
``skittish drug companies and a very hostile legal climate'' 
inflating liability costs with class action lawsuits over such 
products as the Dalkon Shield IUD. The device was blamed for 
painful infections and even deaths before sales were banned in 
1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Other roadblocks cited are limited federal funding, politics and  
public opinion, with conservative groups opposing methods that work 
after fertilization. That's why RU-486, the pill that induces 
abortion up to seven weeks into pregnancy, is available in Europe 
and China but not here. 
</P>
<P>
	Some contraception researchers, though, are hopeful that  
changing public attitudes will spur more drug companies to develop 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in the U.S. we're entering a spurt of new interest and  
acceptance of contraception,'' said Dr. Kirtly Parker Jones, a 
reproductive endocrinologist at the University of Utah. ``For the 
first time we actually have oral contraception advertised on TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those ads are for Ortho Tri-Cyclen, which with sister brand  
Ortho-Cyclen went on sale June 1 in a sleek, beige compact far less 
obtrusive than the widely recognized blue case bearing the Ortho 
logo. 
</P>
<P>
	The line's first packaging overhaul in 20 years includes changes  
to limit mistakes: The dial only turns in one direction, each pill 
is numbered, and the medication can be started any day, rather than 
just Sunday. The other seven Ortho brands will switch to the new 
Dialpak over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, some contraceptives still in testing may be crowding  
pharmacy shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the first should be Lunelle, a monthly injection of low  
doses of the same hormones in the pill. In a 60-week test, none of 
the 782 women taking it became pregnant. Some researchers expect it 
will eventually be available in a form women can inject themselves 
just under the skin, eliminating monthly doctor visits. 
</P>
<P>
	A contraceptive ring that slowly releases hormones just finished  
testing and manufacturer Organon plans to seek federal approval at 
the year's end. Women insert the flexible device, remove it after 
three weeks to allow menstruation and then discard it. 
</P>
<P>
	While safe IUDs have been on the market for years, a seven-year  
one that prevents uterine fibroids and limits cramps, sold in 
Europe as ``Mirena,'' could be marketed in 18 months by Berlex 
Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the horizon are a hormone patch, a disposable diaphragm,  
oral contraceptives taken continuously so menstruation -- and cramps 
-- are eliminated, and an improved Norplant that has fewer rods and 
is easier to remove from the arm. 
</P>
<P>
	However, manufacturer Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, a division of  
American Home Products, hasn't announced plans to sell its Norplant 
2, apparently stung by lawsuits by some women who had painful 
removals of the original version. 
</P>
<P>
	There is far less in the pipeline for male-controlled methods.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are no hormonal methods that will be available for men  
in the next 10 years in the United States,'' said Dr. Robert A. 
Hatcher, professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory University 
School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	He believes vasectomy and condoms, though, remain great methods.  
Vasectomy is a safe, cheap operation with a failure rate of only 
0.1 percent, compared to 3-5 percent for female sterilization, and 
condoms are ``reasonably effective'' and the only good protection 
from sexually transmitted diseases, Hatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	He expects several brands of polyurethane condoms to be sold in  
the next two years. They don't cause allergic reactions, as latex 
condoms sometimes do, will have a longer shelf life, don't 
deteriorate when used with lubricants and transmit heat better, 
enhancing sensation.

<HEADLINE> Fire Crews Try To Protect Utah Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUREKA, Utah (AP) -- Erratic wind gusting to 30 mph hampered the  
efforts of firefighters battling a wildfire threatening two small 
communities Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze, first reported Friday, had consumed an estimated  
61,400 acres near Eureka and Mammoth, both about 55 miles south of 
Salt Lake City, said Susan Haywood, spokeswoman for the Interagency 
Fire Center in Richfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 430 firefighters continued to fight the fire Sunday  
evening and the blaze was 70 percent contained. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60 residents of Mammoth and the residents of Eureka, who  
were evacuated Saturday, were allowed to return home Sunday. They 
were advised to stay away from a recreation area nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the fire had not been determined, although it is  
believed to have been sparked by a spark from a passing train. 
</P>
<P>
	Separate fires in Utah and Colorado connected Sunday and were  
burning 8,000 acres of forest, grass and sage. People were warned 
to stay away from a popular rafting area on the Colorado River 
called Ruby Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	No damage or injuries have been reported.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in northern California, firefighters gained the upper  
hand on a fire that began as a controlled burn to thin brush in 
Lewiston and swept out of control, scorching 2,000 acres. The blaze 
was about 70 percent contained on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	County official Chris Erikson said an investigation into how the  
controlled burn got out of hand ``should include the chance that 
this is criminal misbehavior ... considering the weather conditions 
and the wind conditions at the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California forestry officials said the federal officials had  
taken responsibility for the fire and that the burn was done with 
good intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, just west of Redding, Calif., a 125-acre fire flamed by  
dry winds forced the evacuations of 30 homes. No one was hurt and 
no structures were damaged. The fire was 50 percent contained by 
early afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Indians Lose Fryman for Two Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Indians third baseman Travis Fryman is expected  
to be sidelined two months after injuring his knee in a collision 
at first base. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury, a partially torn ligament in the right knee,  
happened Saturday against the Kansas City Royals. The Indians 
placed Fryman on the 15-day disabled list Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not that frustrated,'' Fryman said. ``I'm more aggravated.  
It is just the result of playing and it's a tough break. Nobody's 
to blame. It was just one of those strange plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman became entangled with first baseman Jeremy Giambi during  
the sixth inning of a 9-5 win in the second game of a doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman grounded out to third baseman Joe Randa, whose throw  
caused Giambi to reach to his right. Fryman ran into Giambi and 
straddled the first baseman for an instant. He twisted his knee 
when he landed. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman was sidelined June 16-25 with lower back spasms. He is  
batting .259 with eight homers and 42 RBIs in 62 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Infielder John McDonald was recalled from Triple A Buffalo to  
replace Fryman. McDonald was hitting .366 in 24 games with the 
Bisons.

<HEADLINE> Cops, Crooks Capitalize on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The latest in computer technology is being used  
by criminals and law enforcers alike. 
</P>
<P>
	In Detroit early Saturday, undercover police stings nabbed 34  
alleged prostitutes who carry laptop computers and depend on the 
Internet to make dates. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were not your garden-variety prostitutes who are  
crack-addicted with shabby, soiled clothing and pockmarks on their 
face,'' said Detroit Police Inspector Clinton Kirkwood, who led the 
raid dubbed Operation LUST -- Lewd Undercover Strike Team. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the suspects arrested Saturday hailed from out of state,  
such as Texas, California and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	For months, police have suspected the prostitutes were using  
their laptop computers to line up customers, The Detroit News 
reported Sunday. Last week, investigators learned from a tip that 
they were using an Internet Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked on the Web site and found out where they were  
going,'' Kirkwood said. ``That's how we got so many of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police seized four vehicles, numerous cellular telephones and  
pagers, and hundreds of dollars during the stings. Kirkwood said 
the computers apparently were left in the motel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides helping to catch prostitutes, police across Michigan are  
turning more and more to computers to help them snag suspected 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oakland County, the county Board of Commissioners recently  
approved funding for a special computer crimes division in the 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
	That's good news for Detective Sgt. Joe Duke -- the Oakland  
County Sheriff Department's computer wizard and a man of many 
electronic disguises. 
</P>
<P>
	Busting Internet sex offenders will comprise about half of the  
new unit's chores, but computers have opened a world of crime that 
extends through corporate extortion to counterfeiting and on-line 
con games to telecommunications fraud, Duke told the News. 
</P>
<P>
	``Computers can do everything that paper documents can do,  
except that they do it faster and more efficiently,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke received some of his computer training from the U.S.  
Customs Service, plus the International Association of Computer 
Investigators, a group of federal, state and local police who 
investigate computer crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``The use of personal computers and the Internet increases  
exponentially every year and the same holds true for the criminal 
element,'' Duke said. ``What bookkeepers, accountants and bankers 
have been doing legitimately for years is now being done to further 
criminal enterprises.''

<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Stern John scored two goals for the second  
straight game to lead the Columbus Crew to a 3-0 shutout over the 
Colorado Rapids in Major League Soccer Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crew (11-5) extended its winning streak to four games.  
</P>
<P>
	Crew defender Mike Lapper opened scoring in the eighth minute  
with his first goal of the season, a 30-yard shot. Brian McBride 
got the assist. 
</P>
<P>
	John scored his first goal in the 60th minute from six yards out  
against Rapids goalie Ian Feuer. John's second goal, his eighth of 
the season, was scored in the 80th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Crew leading 1-0, Colorado's Paul Bravo missed two  
shots. The first in the 60th minute was from seven yards out. Crew 
goalie Mark Dougherty forced it wide right. Two minutes later, 
Bravo's left-foot shot glanced off the inside of the left post and 
traveled across the face of the goal but failed to cross the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado (10-4) had won 10 of 11 games going into the contest  
and won eight of nine of its last meetings with the Crew. It was 
the Rapids first home loss of the season.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Chicago Shooter Kills Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- A gunman who targeted minorities in a  
deadly drive-by shooting spree in the Chicago area struck again 
Sunday, killing a Korean man outside a church, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooter, believed to be a white supremacist, had also fired  
at Asians and blacks in two Illinois cities on Saturday, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This man is on a spree,'' Chicago Police Cmdr. William Hayes  
said. ``He's just shooting people all over this state and out of 
state now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police issued an arrest warrant for the owner of the light blue  
Ford Taurus reported at each of the shootings -- Benjamin Nathaniel 
Smith, 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The car sped away from the Korean United Methodist Church on  
Sunday morning after its driver fired four shots into a crowd of 
worshippers, police said. A 26-year-old Indiana University student 
was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was a member of the World Church of the Creator, an  
organization that distributed anti-minority and anti-Semitic 
literature in Bloomington last year, when Smith was a student at 
Indiana University. 
</P>
<P>
	The church, based in East Peoria, Ill., is led by the Rev. Matt  
Hale, who said Smith was a member from June 1998 until May and 
never showed any predilection for violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I spoke to him he never gave any inkling of being able to  
do this,'' Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harlan Loeb, Midwest counsel for the Anti-Defamation League,  
said his organization has had Smith ``on our radar screen for quite 
some time, which is particularly tragic for someone so young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Smith matched the descriptions of the gunman  
sought in connection with several attacks in Illinois on Friday 
night and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes said Smith is believed to be about 6 feet tall and 135  
pounds with a tattoo on his chest that reads ``Sabbath Breaker.'' 
His Taurus, which has a blown-out passenger-side window, has 
Indiana plates and is registered in Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a gunman wounded six Orthodox Jews leaving synagogue  
on the Jewish Sabbath in Chicago. The same shooter is believed to 
have killed Ricky Byrdsong, the black former basketball coach at 
Northwestern University, as he walked with his children in nearby 
Skokie, Ill., and fired at an Asian-American couple in the suburb 
of Northbrook. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on Saturday, police said, the same blue Taurus was seen at  
shootings in Springfield and Champaign-Urbana. In the first attack, 
the gunman fired on two black men, but no one was hit, Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 12 hours later, six men of Asian descent were standing on  
a corner near the University of Illinois when three or four shots 
were fired, Hayes said. A 22-year-old graduate student was hit in 
the leg and was in serious condition, Urbana police spokesman 
Michael Metzler said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's attack, Won-Joon Yoon was hit twice in the back and  
killed outside the church. Witnesses told police that after firing 
into the crowd, the shooter sped off, running several lights. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was apparently parked at the corner and waited for these  
people to come out of church and then fired,'' Bloomington Police 
Chief Jim Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes said .380-caliber shell casings -- the same kind found in  
some of the Chicago shootings -- were also found at the scene of the 
Indiana church attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year on the Fourth of July, Smith tucked white supremacist  
fliers under windshields around Bloomington. Asked whether the 
shootings this weekend were related to Independence Day, Capt. 
William Parker said, ``It raises questions in our minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parker said Smith passed out similar hate literature when  
enrolled at the University of Illinois. Smith is believed to have 
moved to Chicago in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``The towns he's hit, he's either lived there or been enrolled  
in college at each of the towns,'' Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the men wounded in Friday night's shootings, who asked  
that his name not be used for fear of retribution, said he looked 
into the gunman's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got the sense he was enjoying himself,'' the man told the  
Chicago Sun-Times from his hospital bed. ``He had this predator 
look to him.''

	Police said the shooter still had done nothing to indicate his  
motive, and authorities stayed away from labeling the attacks hate 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Religious and community leaders who gathered Sunday at a  
synagogue in Chicago's Rogers Park area were less reticent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may not fit the technical definition of a hate crime but it  
is apparent that he was targeting people who are clearly 
identifiable as being a minority,'' Rabbi Baruch Epstein said.

<HEADLINE> 52 Become Citizens on 4th of July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- In a morning ceremony drenched with sun  
and patriotism, 52 men and women from 49 nations around the globe 
became citizens of the United States on Sunday, the 223rd 
anniversary of the first Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Monument, rising from just beyond the Potomac,  
was a silent but eloquent witness as the potential citizens fanned 
off the humidity and heat with their paper programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have lived in the United States for 19 years and I took time  
to decide to be a U.S. citizen and this is the very best decision 
of my life,'' said Carmen Aguilar, a native of Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	The Freedom Forum, an international nonpartisan and  
international press freedom and free-speech institution, was the 
host of the ceremony in Freedom park, a skybridge above the streets 
of Arlington with views of the Potomac and the Washington skyline. 
</P>
<P>
	The symbols and words of American citizenship paraded by: a  
color guard, the flag with ``broad stripes and bright stars.'' 
Strings of colored balloons. The invocations of the names of 
Washington, Jefferson, Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We celebrate the long journey you have made and will continue  
to make as U.S. citizens,'' said Freedom Forum president Peter 
Pritchard. 
</P>
<P>
	The names of the nations being left behind by the new citizens  
were read, beginning with Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Bulgaria, 
continuing through Guatemala, Guyana and India and ending with 
Ukraine, Venezuela and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the oath, forswearing allegiance to all others, vowing to  
``support and defend the Constitution of the United States against 
all enemies, foreign and domestic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big, big day for me,'' said Diana Leckie of the  
Philippines, who heads the Freedom Forum's international division 
and who celebrate her new citizenship with a sparkly flag pin 
pinned to her cream-colored coat. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the Immigration and Naturalization Service reported  
that nearly 46 percent of the 350,000 immigrants who were admitted 
to the United States in 1977 had become citizens.

<HEADLINE> Algerian Issues Terror Amnesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Algeria's president issued an amnesty  
Sunday for thousands of people implicated in financing and 
providing support to terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	An official communique announced the amnesty ahead of Monday's  
festivities for Algeria's independence day celebrating 37 years 
since the former colony won its freedom from France. 
</P>
<P>
	The amnesty does not apply to violent crimes or rapes and the  
conditions will be outlined in proposed laws for civil pact that 
were presented to the Algerian parliament Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The amnesty is part of a policy of reconciliation that President  
Abdelaziz Bouteflika began following his election as president in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	The communique did not specify how many people would benefit  
from the amnesty and officials refused to say whether it would 
cover imprisoned leaders of the banned Islamic Salvation Front. 
</P>
<P>
	It was believed that the amnesty probably would cover those  
people who were involved in financing and providing support to 
terrorists, not to those individuals who had carried out attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Algeria has been engulfed in an Islamic insurgency that began in  
1992 after the military-backed government canceled elections that 
the Islamic Salvation Front was set to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence continues in Algeria. On Saturday, three people,  
including two small girls, were killed on a beach near Tipaza, 60 
miles west of Algiers. 
</P>
<P>
	No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but radical  
Islamic militants frequently have targeted beaches because they 
consider that bathers are not sufficiently covered according to the 
morale code of the Koran. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the parliament is to debate the plan for ``civil  
accord'' on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, which includes 42 different articles, will be put  
then to a referendum for which no date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouteflika has said he would resign if his peace plan is  
rejected. The president has estimated 100,000 people have been 
killed since the start of the Islamic insurgency in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The peace plan calls for a staggered amnesty for Islamic  
insurgents, divided into three categories based on their 
implication in attacks and massacres. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would provide a basis to revoke the ban on the Islamic  
Salvation Army. The insurgency group called a truce in 1997 after 
negotiations with military authorities and said earlier this month 
it was ready to lay down its arms. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is the armed wing of the Islamic Salvation Front.  
</P>
<P>
	The radical Armed Islamic Group has called the rival insurgency  
group's actions ``treason'' and continues attacks.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Keeps No. 1 Despite Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Andre Agassi's astounding revival  
during the past month included winning the French Open, regaining 
the No. 1 ranking and surging to the Wimbledon final. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he ran into Pete Sampras.  
</P>
<P>
	Agassi's bid to become the first player since Bjorn Borg in 1980  
to win the French Open and Wimbledon back to back crumbled Sunday 
under a grass-court onslaught from his greatest rival. 
</P>
<P>
	The best returner in tennis, Agassi failed to break serve once  
as Sampras overwhelmed him 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 for his sixth Wimbledon 
title and 12th Grand Slam championship. 
</P>
<P>
	His brilliant counter-punching style, which earned him the 1992  
Wimbledon title and was so effective in his six previous matches, 
was powerless against Sampras' flawless serve-and-volley game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He played some impeccable tennis at the most important  
times,'' Agassi said, ``and I didn't come up with better stuff than 
he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi virtually lost the match in the seventh game of the first  
set, when he was unable to convert after earning three break points 
on Sampras' serve at love-40. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't that Agassi squandered his chance; Sampras simply  
responded with some of the biggest serves of the match. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came out with four big bombs and basically an unreturnable  
second serve,'' Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi didn't see a break point the rest of the match.  
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, meanwhile, broke for the first time in the next game  
and never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next thing you know,'' Agassi said, ``I'm down a break and  
the set is over, and six minutes later, I was down 6-3, 1-0 with a 
break. That's how Pete plays. You've got to weather his storm, and 
when you weather his storm, that's when he's vulnerable. But his 
storm was too strong today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi took Sampras to 30-all on his serve several times, but  
that was about as close as he could get to a break. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he didn't hit an ace on the first serve, he was hitting his  
second serve 109, 111, sometimes 119 or 122 mph,'' Agassi said. ``I 
mean, he hit one serve the whole match that was 100 mph. He's 
taking chances out there, and people think he's walking on water 
until he starts missing a few of those. But he didn't. So he walked 
on water today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Men's tennis needs the rivalry between Sampras and Agassi, polar  
opposites in lifestyles and playing styles. 
</P>
<P>
	The two hadn't played much in recent years as Agassi, lacking  
motivation and perhaps distracted by his marriage to Brooke 
Shields, tumbled all the way down to No. 141 in the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	But Agassi, who split from Shields in April, has made a  
remarkable comeback. By winning the French Open, he became only the 
fifth man in history to win all four Grand Slams. And by reaching 
the Wimbledon final, he supplanted Sampras as No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi has almost single-handedly revived interest in men's  
tennis, which has suffered from a shortage of compelling 
personalities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact I have accomplished what I've accomplished up until  
this day makes me feel better,'' he said. ``Every time you're on 
the court, you've got to prove that you're No. 1, and today on 
Centre Court at Wimbledon, I was not No. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Agassi has tended to fade from view after a big  
loss. But this time, he said he's ready to challenge Sampras again 
for supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now is a great time,'' he said. ``Certainly, all the  
anticipation is built, including mine. I want another shot at him. 
And I want another shot at him this summer. I want another shot at 
him in the finals of the U.S. Open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi suggested that Sampras will be under more pressure the  
next time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's interesting how he's going to respond,'' Agassi said.  
``He hasn't played that great all year and then he comes back to 
Wimbledon and wins it. Every player knew that he was capable of it, 
and many of us were actually expecting it. 
</P>
<P>
	``But how he responds from here will be a question. ... I plan  
on doing my part. I have no anticipation of slowing down on any 
level. This has motivated me to get better.''

<HEADLINE> Graf Ends Wimbledon Run on Sad Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- It was a tough final two days at  
Wimbledon for Steffi Graf. 
</P>
<P>
	She missed a chance for an eighth singles title by losing to  
Lindsay Davenport in straight sets in the final. Then she walked 
away from her favorite tournament, saying this would be her final 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	The toughest thing might have been telling playing partner John  
McEnroe she was pulling out of the mixed doubles, after they had 
reached the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very calm but he wasn't happy,'' said Graf, who  
withdrew Saturday with a slight thigh injury and didn't want to 
hamper her singles chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt terrible. It was a very difficult decision. I had a lot  
of fun, and then, when I talked to him, it wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Come on, we could win this.' And I was trying to  
tell him it would be a little difficult for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe, who worked Wimbledon as a television commentator for  
NBC, was philosophical about missing a shot at the mixed doubles 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like we were going to win it,'' McEnroe said. ``To be  
so close. It shows you have to appreciate the moments you get 
because they can slip away from you fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ANDRE AND BROOKE:* Recently divorced from actress Brooke  
Shields, Andre Agassi said during his French Open triumph that he 
spoke to her nearly every day. 
</P>
<P>
	So he was asked after his loss to Pete Sampras in Sunday's  
Wimbledon final whether he had seen Shields while they were both in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I've seen her,'' Agassi said, adding, ``and she's on an  
airplane right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked which was more satisfying, being in love and married but  
not winning matches, or the opposite, Agassi said, ``I'm sure you'd 
love an answer,'' then left the interview room. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *JUNIOR CHAMPIONS:* Austria's Jurgen Melzer beat top-seeded  
Kristian Pless of Denmark 7-6 (9-7), 6-3 to win the Wimbledon boys' 
singles title. 
</P>
<P>
	Iroda Tulyaganova of Uzbekistan scored a 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 victory  
over Russian Lina Krasnoroutskai to win the girls' singles title. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------.	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ODDS AND ENDS:* Pete Sampras served 17 aces in beating Andre  
Agassi in the men's final. That gave him 108 aces for the 
championship, only four behind his quarterfinal opponent, Mark 
Philippoussis, who withdrew from their match with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Maine senator George Mitchell, chairman of the Northern  
Ireland Peace Committee, was in the Royal Box watching Sunday's 
Wimbledon finals. So was Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the 
International Olympic Committee. Mitchell was the author of a 
report highly critical of the IOC for its role in the Salt Lake 
City bribery scandal.

<HEADLINE>  Rogue Trader Returns to Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Nick Leeson, the young British trader whose  
financial gambles brought down Britain's oldest commercial bank, 
returned Sunday from a Singapore prison, saying he regretted what 
he had done. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I did wrong,'' Leeson said at London's Heathrow Airport  
after a 13-hour flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not proud of my activities as a trader with Barings Bank  
in Singapore. I was foolish and I very much regret what happened,'' 
said the 32-year-old Briton, who served three and half years in 
prison for fraudulently hiding $1.4 billion in losses at Barings. 
</P>
<P>
	He had made unauthorized futures trades that ended in financial  
disaster and led to the collapse of Barings in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have done my time,'' he told reporters Sunday. ``I have  
taken my punishment and now I want to get on with the job of 
rebuilding my life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leeson looked pale but fit despite the rigors of treatment for  
colon cancer that was diagnosed while he was in Tanah Merah prison. 
</P>
<P>
	He was freed Saturday, an early release from his six and a  
half-year sentence for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Leeson had fled Singapore as Barings collapsed and was caught in  
Frankfurt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	While in prison, he underwent cancer surgery and was divorced by  
his wife, Lisa. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday he praised the Singapore doctors who had treated him  
and said they had referred him to a specialist in Britain for 
further treatment, which he must undergo every three months. 
</P>
<P>
	His medical and legal expenses will be dealt with in a strictly  
supervised financial regime -- the result of a High Court order 
freezing his assets at the request of the liquidators of the former 
Barings group. 
</P>
<P>
	Leeson will be allowed to spend up to $7,900 per month for  
living costs, legal fees and health care but must give the 
liquidators two days' advance notice in writing of where the cash 
came from and exactly how it is being spent. 
</P>
<P>
	The judgment specifically prevents him from profiting from the  
film adaptation of his autobiography ``Rogue Trader,'' or from 
selling his story to the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	A Singapore law firm representing liquidators for the  
now-defunct Barings Futures Singapore said it plans to keep 
investigating whether Leeson has any money hidden away from his 
Barings days.

<HEADLINE> GOP Targets Poverty With Tax Breaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Dennis Hastert is asking  
President Clinton to support a Republican-led program of tax breaks 
and incentives to fight poverty in inner cities and poor rural 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Elements of the program, the ``American Community Renewal Act,''  
revives a plan that failed in the last Congress, passing the House 
but failing to clear the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, R-Ill., asked for Clinton's endorsement in a letter  
Sunday as Clinton prepared to embark on a tour of poor areas to 
pitch his own ``New Market Initiative'' recovery program. 
</P>
<P>
	The community recovery proposal is bipartisan, Hastert told  
Clinton, ``the product of a concerted, four-year effort ... after 
extensive tours through the nation's most poverty-stricken areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Moreover, it is based on the advice, ideas and experiences of  
hundreds of dedicated individuals involved in local community 
renewal work,'' Hastert wrote. ``This legislation develops a 
public-private partnership to give people in currently low-income 
areas new hope and opportunity as we enter the 21st century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the Office of  
Management and Budget, said the administration was reviewing the 
GOP plan. She said Clinton's initiative ``features serious 
involvement with the private sector. If, in fact, the speaker is 
moving in this direction we applaud his effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., sponsor of the original American  
Community Renewal bill four years ago, said the current legislation 
has more than 100 House co-sponsors. It is being made a part of the 
Republicans' ``taxpayer relief package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would create 100 renewal communities ``through targeted,  
pro-growth tax initiatives to create jobs, encourage personal 
savings, foster home ownership and clean up neighborhoods on former 
industrial sites,'' Hastert said in his letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Setting strict criteria for communities to be helped, the  
legislation emphasizes cooperation with community groups, small 
businesses and religious organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The religious connection could draw fire from some Democrats,  
although Vice President Al Gore has suggested that religious groups 
become more active in attacking the nation's social ills. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would involve religious institutions in drug counseling  
and rehabilitation, using government money. It says no beneficiary 
would be required to participate in a religion-based program, but 
it also rules out discrimination for religious reasons against 
organizations seeking money to provide services under the program. 
</P>
<P>
	An analysis of Clinton's ``New Market Initiative'' circulated  
with Hastert's letter called it a ``big-government proposal'' that 
won't work. 
</P>
<P>
	It derided the administration's arguments that the initiative is  
needed because of ``small-business financing needs that are going 
unmet despite the current prosperity.'' The Republican analysis 
said the Small Business Administration under Clinton is to blame 
because the numbers of minority loans have been dwindling for six 
years despite a succession of pilot programs.

<HEADLINE>  S.Korea President Honored in Philly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, who  
once faced the death penalty in a military prison, was awarded the 
1999 Philadelphia Liberty Medal on Sunday and promised to ``spread 
the spirit of liberty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, 77, was honored for more than four decades of efforts to  
secure democracy and human rights in South Korea. His December 1997 
election marked the first peaceful transfer of power to an 
opposition party in South Korea's 50 years of independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Under previous governments, Kim was sentenced to death in a  
military camp in 1980. But after pressure from Washington, the 
sentence was commuted and he was released two years later. He also 
has survived five assassination attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still remember the experience in 1980,'' Kim said of his  
death sentence. ``I was waiting for execution day in the army 
prison. My wife and children came to visit me. We all prayed to God 
in tears, we cried together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Freedom is like air, difficult to appreciate when you are  
living in it,'' Kim told several thousand people at Independence 
Hall. ``I am one of those people who well appreciates the value of 
freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, who has been criticized for seeking greater economic and  
political contact with North Korea, said he will continue to engage 
with the communist government. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would ``strive to spread the spirit of liberty to our  
brethren in the North and to all dark corners of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The medal was established in 1988 to honor individuals or  
organizations whose actions represent the founding principles of 
the United States. Past recipients include former President Jimmy 
Carter, former Polish President Lech Walesa, former Israeli Prime 
Minister Shimon Peres and the late King Hussein of Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said he was giving the $100,000 prize to his Kim Dae-jung  
Peace Foundation to support human rights around the world.

<HEADLINE>  S.Korea President Honored in Philly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, who  
once faced the death penalty in a military prison, was awarded the 
1999 Philadelphia Liberty Medal on Sunday and promised to ``spread 
the spirit of liberty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, 77, was honored for more than four decades of efforts to  
secure democracy and human rights in South Korea. His December 1997 
election marked the first peaceful transfer of power to an 
opposition party in South Korea's 50 years of independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Under previous governments, Kim was sentenced to death in a  
military camp in 1980. But after pressure from Washington, the 
sentence was commuted and he was released two years later. He also 
has survived five assassination attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still remember the experience in 1980,'' Kim said of his  
death sentence. ``I was waiting for execution day in the army 
prison. My wife and children came to visit me. We all prayed to God 
in tears, we cried together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Freedom is like air, difficult to appreciate when you are  
living in it,'' Kim told several thousand people at Independence 
Hall. ``I am one of those people who well appreciates the value of 
freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, who has been criticized for seeking greater economic and  
political contact with North Korea, said he will continue to engage 
with the communist government. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would ``strive to spread the spirit of liberty to our  
brethren in the North and to all dark corners of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The medal was established in 1988 to honor individuals or  
organizations whose actions represent the founding principles of 
the United States. Past recipients include former President Jimmy 
Carter, former Polish President Lech Walesa, former Israeli Prime 
Minister Shimon Peres and the late King Hussein of Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said he was giving the $100,000 prize to his Kim Dae-jung  
Peace Foundation to support human rights around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Alongside Independence Hall, about two dozen Korean protesters  
held signs calling for the repeal of the South Korean national 
security law, which makes it illegal for South Koreans to cooperate 
with North Korean officials without permission. Kim said the 
government was working to change the law.

<HEADLINE>  Budget Projections Could Wither </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There are plenty of reasons to think the huge  
budget surpluses President Clinton and Congress forecast last week 
are wishful thinking and will fall victim to recession or 
politicians' penchant for spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The projections -- with both sides envisioning about $2.9  
trillion in surpluses over the next decade -- also could turn out 
too conservative. Economists for the most part say even if the 
economy stumbles, the federal budget still would avoid the annual 
deficits that until last year were a budgetary mainstay for three 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably too optimistic, and I wouldn't spend all the  
money yet,'' said Bill Dudley, chief U.S. economist at Goldman 
Sachs &AMP; Co., the investment banking firm. ``But I think the budget 
is in pretty good shape through 2010,'' when retiring baby boomers 
start driving up the costs of Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	In predicting surpluses, the White House Office of Management  
and Budget and its rival, the Congressional Budget Office, are 
relying on similar spending assumptions that worry Dudley and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Both offices assumed that for the next three years, Washington  
will obey steadily declining spending limits required by the 1997 
budget-balancing agreement. Almost nobody thinks that will happen 
because of spending demands for defense, schools, agriculture and 
other programs by Clinton and lawmakers from both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have these wonderful surplus numbers floating around,  
and, unfortunately, most of those surplus projections are based on 
sand,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis. He spent last week insisting 
that actual spending would be higher -- and surpluses lower -- than 
the analysts predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending limits govern the one-third of the $1.8 trillion  
budget that covers everything except automatically paid benefits 
like Social Security and interest payments on Treasury bills. Those 
caps decline gradually through 2002, then vanish. 
</P>
<P>
	But if it assumed instead that spending will rise annually to  
stay even with inflation, things are different. Then the $1 
trillion part of the 10-year surplus that comes from everything but 
Social Security would shrink to below $500 billion, the 
Congressional Budget Office has calculated. 
</P>
<P>
	That is crucial because the non-Social Security part of the  
surplus is what both parties want to use for their proposed tax 
cuts and increases for Medicare and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans, through Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz., demanded  
in the party's Fourth of July weekend radio address that the $1 
trillion surplus be used as tax cuts to declare ``financial 
independence'' for American families. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, 
R-Ill., tempered that a bit Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' 
prescribing a cut of around $800 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing later on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' White House budget  
director Jack Lew said spending the $1 trillion on tax cuts would 
put the nation back into deficit by 2015 rather than paying off 
publicly held debt as Clinton insists can be done. His spokeswoman, 
Linda Ricci, said that's because interest payments, projected at 
zero, still would have to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Members of Congress thinking they really have $1 trillion to  
play with will find out they don't,'' said Robert Greenstein, 
executive director of the liberal leaning Center on Budget and 
Policy Priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there is the economy itself, which has been steadily  
expanding for eight years, a near record. The government has seen 
its revenues grow at a healthy 8 percent annually or more, thanks 
to swelling corporate and personal incomes and capital gains taxes 
paid by investors in the booming stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House and congressional projections assume continued  
modest but uninterrupted economic growth. A recession would 
substantially reduce government revenues as corporate profits and 
personal earnings drop and federal spending for the poor grows. 
</P>
<P>
	But even that could be short-lived, because economic growth  
usually accelerates as the country digs itself out of a recession. 
Also, analysts from both budget offices say their calculations take 
into account a possible recession by slightly lowering their 
projections for each year's economic performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a typical recession, I could see a year of the surplus  
dropping, but not going away,'' said Greg Valliere, managing 
director of the Charles Schwab Washington Research Group. ``But it 
still doesn't change the basic view that we've got a lot of surplus 
money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A severe and prolonged stock market plunge could have the  
opposite effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal surplus probably would rise at first as people sell  
stock and pay taxes on their profits. But in the longer term, the 
government would be hurt by lower corporate taxes and payroll 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, some analysts say the surplus forecasts could  
be too low because the White House and CBO both assume that 
economic growth -- a key influence on federal revenue -- will be 2.5 
percent or less for years. The economy grew at 3.9 percent last 
year and is close to 4 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The premises in these projections are if anything on the  
conservative side,'' said Valliere.

<HEADLINE>  Orange Order Avoids Confrontation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The Protestant Orange Order,  
often blamed for stirring up sectarian hatred, backed off Sunday 
from confronting British security forces over their hopes of 
marching past Catholic homes in Northern Ireland's most divisive, 
disputed parade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Protestant brotherhood's surprise gesture took immediate  
emotional heat out of a confrontation that has triggered violence 
across Northern Ireland for the past three summers -- and this year 
threatened to break the already strained peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
	The gesture coincided with renewed pressure from the Ulster  
Unionists, Northern Ireland's main Protestant party, on British 
Prime Minister Tony Blair to revise his latest plans for a 
political breakthrough. The plans require the party to form a 
Protestant-Catholic government on July 15 in partnership with the 
Irish Republican Army-linked Sinn Fein party -- without any 
guarantee from the IRA that it will disarm. 
</P>
<P>
	Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, who would lead the  
government, appealed to the outlawed IRA to confirm whether it 
really would start disarming after the government's formation. 
Blair has pledged to abolish the government if the IRA does not 
act. 
</P>
<P>
	An IRA statement confirming disarmament plans, Trimble said,  
``would be a significant thing. For some people it might be 
enough.'' But he said he wasn't expecting such a statement, because 
most Ulster Unionists were sure that Blair had been deceived by a 
Sinn Fein ``con job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Against this backdrop of rising Protestant anxiety and anger,  
Sunday's gesture by the Orange Order, Northern Ireland's major 
Protestant organization, was particularly unexpected. Most 
Orangemen are opposed to last year's peace accord and highly 
critical of Trimble's support for it; many also believe the 
Catholic protests against their parade are IRA-inspired and must be 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite this, Sunday's decision not to confront British forces  
also illustrated that these hard-line Protestants don't want to 
bear blame for the collapse of Northern Ireland's fragile peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by a group representing IRA victims, more than 3,000  
Orangemen and their supporters paraded as usual from downtown 
Portadown to the rural Drumcree Anglican church, where they held a 
service commemorating the thousands of Ulstermen killed in World 
War I's Battle of the Somme. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, British soldiers built an imposing barricade, using  
barbed wire, intentionally muddied fields and a deep, dammed-up 
stream. Beyond stood some of the approximately 2,000 police and 
soldiers deployed around Portadown, about 25 miles southwest of 
Belfast, to prevent the march from reaching the town's hostile 
Catholic section, Garvaghy Road. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike last year -- when the Orangemen massed near the barricades  
-- their leaders ordered them to walk away from the front line and 
up the hill for tea and sandwiches at the local minister's house. 
The atmosphere was unusually pleasant, and the Orange leaders' 
determination to keep it that way was unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
	``Keep it peaceful. I am warning you I will walk away from this  
if you don't keep it peaceful,'' the stern-faced leader of 
Portadown's Orangemen, Harold Gracey, said through a loudspeaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Gracey has camped out virtually year-round at the church in  
protest at the identical restrictions on last year's march. His 
campaign has helped turn him into a Protestant folk hero and 
Catholic hate figure. 
</P>
<P>
	He invited the crowd to stay with him this week for what he  
billed as an indefinite standoff. But he warned, too, that he 
wouldn't tolerate a repeat of last July's mayhem, when extremists 
at night attacked the joint police-army lines with gunfire, 
homemade grenades, gasoline bombs and darts. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are not welcome, if all you've come to do is spread  
trouble and violence,'' Gracey said. ``I don't want you and the 
Orange Order don't want you -- you are not members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As darkness fell, however, not everyone heeded Gracey's warning.  
</P>
<P>
	About 100 unarmed Protestants, mostly teen-age boys, tried to  
outflank the barbed-wire lines but were easily driven back by riot 
police, who fired a single plastic bullet to frighten them off. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, about 30 older Protestants probed further, reaching the  
graveyard adjoining Garvaghy Road's Catholic church before police 
forced them to retreat too. The skirmishes produced no injuries or 
arrests, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such trouble was minor compared to previous standoffs, when much  
bigger crowds turned drunken and violent after dark. Police 
remained fearful that sporadic street violence could mount each 
night leading up to July 12, when Orangemen parade across Northern 
Ireland in commemoration of a 1690 Protestant victory over 
Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, arsonists burned to death three young sons of a  
Catholic woman in another town when the Portadown standoff fueled 
widespread Protestant rioting. The Orange Order denied 
responsibility, but immediately scaled down its protests.

that no other information be released. 
</P>
<P>
	It's still not clear why Dempsey, John Maginnes' longtime  
caddie, collapsed as he walked off the 15th tee, though he had been 
taking medication for pancreatitis. The temperature Saturday also 
was in the 90s, with the humidity making it feel over 100 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know his heart stopped, I know he stopped breathing. But I  
honestly don't know what happened,'' Maginnes said after he 
finished his round Sunday. ``This was a shock. This was not an 
expected thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maginnes said he and Dempsey were laughing as they walked off  
the 15th tee. Maginnes got a few yards ahead and then heard Dempsey 
make a noise and the bag drop. He turned around to see Dempsey on 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Moore, an ABC spotter, performed CPR until paramedics  
arrived. Paramedics used a defibrillator to get a pulse before 
putting him in an ambulance and taking him to the hospital, said 
Rich Stech, assistant chief of the Lemont Fire Protection District. 
</P>
<P>
	Maginnes said he considered quitting the tournament, but he knew  
Dempsey would be mad if he did. He played the rest of Saturday's 
round looking dazed and shaken, and left for the hospital shortly 
after he finished. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Fitzgerald, a caddie who was working for ABC as a  
spotter, took Maginnes' bag for the rest of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even remember the last four holes yesterday,''  
Maginnes said. ``I felt really guilty not going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey carried Maginnes' bag from 1992-94 on the Nike Tour, and  
stayed with him on that tour last year despite having opportunities 
to caddy on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Maginnes stopped to see Dempsey before coming to the Cog Hill  
Golf and Country Club on Sunday morning, but wasn't able to talk 
with him because Dempsey was still heavily sedated and on a 
ventilator. Afterward, Maginnes shot a 2-under 70 that left him in 
sixth place, eight shots behind winner Tiger Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I played well today because I didn't care how I  
played,'' Maginnes said. ``As far as composure, I didn't have any. 
I really just didn't care. I really just wanted it over with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second year in a row a caddie has collapsed during  
the Western Open. Last year, Greg Kraft's caddie collapsed with 
heat stroke during the third round at Cog Hill Golf and Country 
Club, but recovered after being given IV fluids. 
</P>
<P>
	With temperatures again in the 90s and high humidity Sunday,  
caddies were given the option of not wearing bibs.

<HEADLINE>  Pirates' Kendall Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jason Kendall should be packing his bags for  
the All-Star game. Instead, he probably won't put on a uniform 
again until spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pittsburgh Pirates' selection for the All-Star game will be  
announced Wednesday, and it seemed likely that Kendall would again 
be the choice. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was until Kendall shattered his right ankle in a  
horrifying accident at first base Sunday against Milwaukee that 
will sideline him for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the injury, Kendall seemed destined to become the first  
player in Pirates history to make the All-Star game in three of his 
first four seasons in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop Arky Vaughan came close, debuting in 1932 -- the year  
before the first All-Star game -- before making eight consecutive 
appearances from 1934-1941. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just Kendall's numbers -- .332, 8 homers, 41 RBIs and 22  
steals -- or his improvement behind the plate with each passing 
season. He also has stepped forward to become a leader on a team 
that previously was deficient in leadership and clearly is the most 
respected Pirate among opposing NL players. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Mets catcher Mike Piazza leads in the fan voting for  
the game July 13 at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	With Kendall out, it appears third baseman Ed Sprague (.302, 15  
homers, 49 RBIs) or outfielder Brian Giles (.298, 16 homers, 52 
RBIs) -- will represent the Pirates at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, the Pirates probably will send only one player to  
the All-Star game. They have not had two players selected since 
shortstop Jay Bell and center fielder Andy Van Slyke went in 1993. 
Bell, whose 22 homers lead all major league second basemen, could 
make it again this season for Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Pre-Schoolers Pre-Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If the groups in the aerobics studio look  
young, it could be because they are. Exercise leaders are trying to 
reach children who took their first steps a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are the children whom Karen B. Wells specializes in. The  
Atlanta-based fitness professional works with preschoolers. What 
she teaches them, she says, is pre-exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to call it aerobics -- but if you think of kids,  
they like to move,'' Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells and others, from class leaders in health clubs to  
child-centered corporations like Gymboree, are developing a market 
in active preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
	The alternative is to let small children pick up the sedentary  
habits that leave even older ones too fat, too weak and too prone 
to develop ailments from heart disease to osteoporosis as adults, 
the fitness advocates say. These kids must be taken to classes 
because they'd otherwise spend time watching TV, the experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Exercise should become a habitual part of a child's life at a  
very young age,'' said Avery Faigenbaum, a professor of exercise 
physiology at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Faigenbaum runs a research lab and children's exercise program  
at the South Shore YMCA in Quincy, Mass. And, although children are 
naturally active, they live with rushed parents in a comfort-driven 
world which leaves them little opportunity to try physical 
activity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where are kids going to be active?'' Faigenbaum said.  
</P>
<P>
	Parental worries have a part in the trend.  
</P>
<P>
	``They don't let the kids go out and play,'' said Julie McNeney,  
vice president for marketing at The Fitness Group, a health club in 
Vancouver, British Columbia. ``Parents want to take their children 
into an environment where it's safe, and where they are going to 
benefit from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The result is a growth market for children's movement classes,  
said McNeney, who chairs an exercise program committee for IDEA, a 
professional organization for group exercise leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	What these children need is not very complicated, but provides  
the basis for any future athletics, Wells said. It's stuff like 
jumping, skipping, running, and hopping -- but at this young age, 
there's no guarantee children can do it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, moving side-to-side is invaluable in sports such  
as basketball and tennis. ``Kids don't move sideways until they are 
5 to 6,'' Wells said. ``Just to get them to move sideways is a huge 
accomplishment.'' Wells helps them to learn by having them watch 
themselves in a mirror. 
</P>
<P>
	However, although the programs can be precursors to exercise,  
they can't be branded as exercise, Wells said. For one thing, 
parents like to think their children get exercise already, and for 
another, children in this age range can't sustain anything long 
enough to get an exercise benefit, she said. So the programs have 
to be whatever a kid considers fun -- too easy, and the kid gets 
bored; too hard, and the kid gets frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is fun? That's the hardest question of all,'' Faigenbaum  
said. ``Fun seems to be something between skill and challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly how much activity is needed has not been determined,  
Faigenbaum wrote in the Health and Fitness Journal of the American 
College of Sports Medicine. However, one model for the minimum a 
child should do is a scaled-down version of current federal 
recommendations for adults. 
</P>
<P>
	The adult recommendations call for at least 30 minutes of  
moderate activity a day, broken into no more than three 10-minute 
segments, on most days. Children should engage in active play 3 
times a day or more for a total of at least 30 minutes minutes a 
day, Faigenbaum's article said. 
</P>
<P>
	The optimal exercise program is more active than this,  
Faigenbaum said. And Wells, in an article in the group exercise 
publication IDEA Health and Fitness Source, has one possible class 
breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
	It starts with a five-minute roll-call. After that, there are 12  
minutes of warmup and stretching, and eight minutes of skill 
development. This is followed by 15 minutes of aerobic activity, 
conditioning and flexibility. The program ends with five minutes of 
cooldown and praise for the young class members. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents who are looking for a class for their children should  
watch the classes and ask other parents for recommendations, Wells 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Can parents tell whether the class is doing the job? Children  
this young can't verbalize feelings well, so the parent has to 
watch the child's reaction. If the child comes home happy, the 
program is working. If the child hates going, it's not, Wells said.

<HEADLINE> German Gov't To Begin Move to Berlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- After a weekend of packing up files and furniture,  
the first freight train chartered to help move the German 
parliament from Bonn to Berlin pulls out of the railroad station 
Monday for the 375-mile eastward trek. 
</P>
<P>
	The first commuter planes for 1,200 government workers reluctant  
to give up their homes in quaint little Bonn also take off Monday -- 
from the airport the sleepy town shares with its big city neighbor, 
Cologne. 
</P>
<P>
	The German government's long-planned return to its historic  
capital is in full gear this summer, almost 10 years after the fall 
of the Berlin Wall. Over the next two months, 669 parliament 
members, their 3,400 staff members and 6,000 other government 
officials will make the move. 
</P>
<P>
	Parliament, which began its summer break last week, plans to  
reconvene Sept. 7 in the newly renovated, glass-topped Reichstag in 
Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	But first, their stuff has to get there.  
</P>
<P>
	The parliamentary vice president, Anke Fuchs, was to see off the  
first of 24 trains to carry parliament's 24 miles of file-filled 
filing cabinets, 28,000 cartons of books, 30,000 piece of furniture 
and 1,300 computers in overnight runs during July. The trains are 
to leave from the shipping yard in Cologne, 12 miles up the Rhine 
River from Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
	The first train is scheduled to pull into Berlin early Tuesday  
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The goods from 81 buildings being vacated in Bonn will then be  
delivered to the 18 buildings being used in Berlin -- a logistical 
and tracking challenge sure to test the famed German efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	Parliament's administrative staff is to begin working in Berlin  
Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet many of the new arrivals might be well-advised not to unpack  
everything: Because of construction delays, some of the buildings 
intended to house parliament members and government ministries 
still aren't ready, meaning they'll have to move again from 
provisional quarters to their permanent homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, Berlin's biggest booster, may have  
the longest wait in temporary quarters: His new chancellery isn't 
expected to be ready until 2001.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Kendall Breaks Right Ankle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Pirates catcher Jason Kendall was  
carried off the field on a stretcher Sunday with a fractured right 
ankle after stumbling over first base unsuccessfully trying to beat 
out a bunt. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates had been held hitless for 4 1-3 innings by  
Milwaukee's Steve Woodard when Kendall put down a bunt along the 
third-base line. 
</P>
<P>
	As he neared first base, Kendall's right foot awkwardly struck  
the right side of the bag. He took five or six more strides before 
collapsing several feet behind the bag. 
</P>
<P>
	As Kendall was carried off on a stretcher, obviously in pain,  
Pirates trainer Kent Biggerstaff carefully supported his right 
ankle. A few minutes later, the Pirates described the injury as 
both a fractured and dislocated ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	A serious injury to their most productive everyday player is a  
significant loss to the surprising Pirates, who began the day in 
third place in the NL Central with a 40-39 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall is batting .332 with eight homers and 41 RBIs and seemed  
to be a lock for his third All-Star game appearance in his four 
major league seasons. The NL All-Star team will be announced 
Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall has started 74 of the Pirates' 80 games and his backup,  
Keith Osik, has only 38 at-bats all season. 
</P>
<P>
	After Kendall left the field, Warren Morris broke up Woodard's  
no-hit bid with a double.

<HEADLINE> Some Past Budget Projections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Besides uncertainty over the economy and politicians' willpower,  
past history is another reason to wonder whether last week's 
projections of large federal surpluses by the White House and 
Congress will hold. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, both the White House's Office of Management and  
Budget and the Congressional Budget Office have missed the mark in 
their projections of federal deficits and surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few years ago, neither foresaw the long line of annual  
surpluses that now dominate the budget horizon. This was 
particularly true in 1997, when White and congressional budget 
negotiators in the middle of bargaining over budget-balancing deal 
were surprised by 11th-hour revenue estimates they received that 
made their job a lot easier. 
</P>
<P>
	Here is the recent history of federal deficits and surpluses,  
and what forecasters had predicted. All years are federal fiscal 
years. A minus sign (-) means a deficit.

<HEADLINE>  U.S.: Pakistan Will Withdraw Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pakistan's prime minister met with President  
Clinton for more than three hours Sunday and agreed ``that concrete 
steps will be taken'' to restore the ``Line of Control'' separating 
Pakistani and Indian forces near Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our understanding is that there will be a withdrawal of the  
(Pakistani) forces now,'' said a U.S. official who briefed 
reporters on the meeting under condition of anonymity. ``Both have 
a great sense of urgency. We want to see steps taken very 
quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officials declined to elaborate on exactly what ``concrete  
steps'' Pakistan might take. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our position has been that the forces across the Line of  
Control need to be returned to the Pakistani side,'' the U.S. 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another said, ``The prime minister will have to make those  
decisions himself on how he will undertake to implement the 
decisions contained in this document.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The president urged an immediate cessation of the hostilities  
once these steps are taken,'' a joint statement issued by the two 
leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement, issued by Clinton and Prime Minister Nawaz  
Sharif, said that the two agreed that an Indian-Pakistani dialog 
begun last February in Lahore ``provides the best forum for 
resolving all issues dividing India and Pakistan, including 
Kashmir.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The president said he would take a personal interest in  
encouraging an expeditious resumption and intensification of those 
bilateral efforts, once the sanctity of the Line of Control has 
been fully restored,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two leaders called the current fighting in Kashmir dangerous  
and said it ``contains the seeds of a wider conflict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement did not spell out what specific steps Pakistan  
might take, nor was there any indication of what India's response 
might be. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also repeated his intention to visit South Asia in the  
relatively near future. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharif requested the meeting and flew from Islamabad, the  
Pakistani capital, to attend. The president agreed to meet with the 
Pakistani leader after conferring by telephone Saturday with Sharif 
and Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said that Clinton again called Vajpayee during a break  
in the meeting to keep him informed of the course of the 
conversation and that National Security Adviser Sandy Berger called 
his counterpart in India when the meeting had concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said Clinton would not attempt to mediate  
the dispute. They said he continues to believe that the Kashmir 
problem must be resolved by direct dialogue between India and 
Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	But White House officials said Saturday that Clinton, Sharif and  
Vajpayee all agree ``the situation is dangerous and could escalate 
if not resolved quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meetings between Clinton and Sharif occurred at Blair House,  
the official government guest house that is across Pennsylvania 
Avenue from the White House.

	``Our understanding is that there will be a withdrawal of the  
(Pakistani) forces now,'' said a U.S. official who briefed 
reporters on the meeting under condition of anonymity. ``Both have 
a great sense of urgency. We want to see steps taken very 
quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officials declined to elaborate on exactly what ``concrete  
steps'' Pakistan might take. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our position has been that the forces across the Line of  
Control need to be returned to the Pakistani side,'' the U.S. 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another said, ``The prime minister will have to make those  
decisions himself on how he will undertake to implement the 
decisions contained in this document.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The president urged an immediate cessation of the hostilities  
once these steps are taken,'' a joint statement issued by the two 
leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement, issued by Clinton and Prime Minister Nawaz  
Sharif, said that the two agreed that an Indian-Pakistani dialog 
begun last February in Lahore ``provides the best forum for 
resolving all issues dividing India and Pakistan, including 
Kashmir.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The president said he would take a personal interest in  
encouraging an expeditious resumption and intensification of those 
bilateral efforts, once the sanctity of the Line of Control has 
been fully restored,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two leaders called the current fighting in Kashmir dangerous  
and said it ``contains the seeds of a wider conflict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement did not spell out what specific steps Pakistan  
might take, nor was there any indication of what India's response 
might be. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also repeated his intention to visit South Asia in the  
relatively near future. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharif requested the meeting and flew from Islamabad, the  
Pakistani capital, to attend. The president agreed to meet with the 
Pakistani leader after conferring by telephone Saturday with Sharif 
and Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said that Clinton again called Vajpayee during a break  
in the meeting to keep him informed of the course of the 
conversation and that National Security Adviser Sandy Berger called 
his counterpart in India when the meeting had concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said Clinton would not attempt to mediate  
the dispute. They said he continues to believe that the Kashmir 
problem must be resolved by direct dialogue between India and 
Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	But White House officials said Saturday that Clinton, Sharif and  
Vajpayee all agree ``the situation is dangerous and could escalate 
if not resolved quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meetings between Clinton and Sharif occurred at Blair House,  
the official government guest house that is across Pennsylvania 
Avenue from the White House.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Wins Five Swimming Medals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) -- Mark Warkentin trains  
for swimming's equivalent of the marathon. On Sunday, he did a fair 
impression of a sprinter. 
</P>
<P>
	Competing in the 200-meter freestyle at an international event  
for the first time, the native of Santa Barbara, Calif., won a gold 
medal at the University Games, one of five medals the United States 
picked up on the first day of swimming competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Warkentin will swim the 400, 800 and 1,500 freestyle races as  
well as two relay events later in the week at the biannual 
Olympics-style event, and said winning five golds at the colorful 
new Son Hugo swimming and diving complex is ``realistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was told only last week he would race the 200, after Trevor  
Runberg withdrew from the U.S. team for personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came as a shock I was swimming, and then I won,'' said  
Warkentin, who was timed at 1 minute, 51.30 seconds in becoming the 
first U.S. swimmer since Matt Biondi in 1985 to win the 200 
freestyle at the University Games. ``They raised the flag. That's 
never happened to me before. I've only seen that on TV. You dream 
about moments like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Southern California sophomore beat France's Lionel Poirot by  
.08 of a second, with Russia's Dmitri Tchernychev placing third in 
1:51.83. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. quartet of Rada Owen, Kimberly Black, Caroline Kilian  
and Kathryn Zambone took gold in the 4x200 freestyle relay with a 
time of 8:13.41. Italy claimed the silver after Japan lost its 
second-place finish because a swimmer left her mark early, and 
Britain took the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	Other U.S. swimmers to medal were Cara Lane, with an  
800-freestyle victory, while Julie Varozza finished with a bronze 
in the same race, and Corrie Murphy, who earned a bronze in the 
women's 400-meter individual medley. 
</P>
<P>
	Hana Cerna of the Czech Republic, who was third at the 1997  
European Championships, won the medley in 4:46.03, followed by 
Romania's Catalina Casaru. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Tomoko Hagiwara was the surprise winner of the women's  
100-meter butterfly, finishing in 1:00.47. Hagiwara's specialty is 
backstroke, but she volunteered for the 100 fly during Japan's team 
trials in April after no one had been chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We asked if anyone wanted to do it and Tomoko put her hand up  
to volunteer,'' team official Shigeo Ogata said. ``This was a big 
surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russians Roman Makarov and Andrei Perminov were first and third,  
respectively, in the men's 200 breaststroke. Japan's Yoshiako Okita 
won the silver. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. men's basketball team, owner of five straight gold  
medals, stretched its winning streak to 34 games at the University 
Games with a straightforward 97-58 defeat of Nigeria. Texas center 
Chris Mihm led the way with 19 points, including a record 13 free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Michael Redd, who helped lead Ohio State to the NCAA Final  
Four this year, chipped in with 17 points on 7-of-8 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. continues preliminary round play Monday against the  
Czech Republic, while the women open their tournament against 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan edged Russia to take the gold in the team competition for  
men's gymnastics, finishing with a total of 170.750 points to 
Russia's 170.075. The United States finished 13th with 162.125 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy claimed its first gold of the games in fencing, as David  
Burroni upset defending champion Oleksandr Gorbachuk of Ukraine 
15-12 in the men's epee final. 
</P>
<P>
	In preliminary soccer games, Britain held traditional power  
Brazil to a surprising 0-0 draw. Italy, gold medalist two years 
ago, edged Ireland 1-0, Iran and the Czech Republic drew 0-0, 
Nigeria tied Ukraine 2-2, Mexico beat Japan 2-0, and Australia and 
Uruguay drew 0-0, as did Morocco and host Spain.

	CHALLANS, France (AP) -- Jaan Kirsipuu of Estonia won Sunday's  
rainy first stage of the Tour de France, beating Tom Steels of 
Belgium and Erik Zabel of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall leader remained Lance Armstrong, who won Saturday's

<P>
	The 128.4-mile stage began under pouring rain in Montaigu in

<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- In his first match against his former  
team, Welton scored in the 64th minute as the Miami Fusion defeated 
the Los Angeles Galaxy, 2-1, in Major League Soccer Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Welton took Diego Serna's pass just inside the penalty area,  
moved in alone against onrushing goalkeeper Kevin Hartman, and 
rolled a shot under him. 
</P>
<P>
	Serna opened the scoring in the 13th minute as Miami (5-13)  
ended an eight-match road losing streak, and won for just the 
second time in its last 11 matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Myers scored in the 38th minute for Los Angeles ( 9-7),  
whose four-match winning streak ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Fusion goalkeeper Garth Lagerwey made six saves as the Galaxy  
out-shot Miami, 15-5 and led 7-3 in shots on goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Pablo Mastroeni opened the scoring sequence on Serna's goal with  
a pass to Tyrone Marshall, who was unable to control the ball. 
Galaxy defender Robin Fraser attempted to clear the ball out, but 
it went to Serna, who rocketed a shot from the semicircle atop the 
penalty area past Hartman for his team-leading ninth goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers took a short pass from Danny Pena, sprinted past defender  
Arley Palacios and put a shot inside the near post for his first 
goal of the season.

<HEADLINE> Houston Was Destined To Be a Diva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Born into a musical family, Whitney Houston just  
knew she was destined to be a diva. 
</P>
<P>
	Her pedigree includes being the daughter of gospel singer Cissy  
Houston and a cousin of Dionne Warwick. The 35-year-old singer's 
accomplishments include 11 No. 1 singles and a slew of Grammy 
Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew when I started I wasn't like anyone else -- not my  
mother, my cousin, or anyone else,'' Houston says in Sunday's Daily 
News. ``I walked into the business with faith. I didn't walk into 
it trying to believe. I did believe. Somehow I knew this is what I 
would do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Married to singer Bobby Brown, Houston relishes her role as wife  
and mother to their 6-year-old daughter. What she doesn't like 
about her life is what she reads. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of things surprised me,'' she said. ``That the tabloids  
would think people are more interested in my life than my music, 
that all they seem to want to know is what's going on in my bedroom 
-- or any of my rooms.''

<HEADLINE> Special Olympics End With a Bang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- The final Special Olympics Games of the 20th  
century ended Sunday with an emotional sendoff as 7,000 athletes 
from around the world were treated to an All-American fireworks 
display. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletes and coaches placed blankets on the turf at Duke  
University's Wallace Wade Stadium, stretching out and relaxing 
during the hot and humid two-hour ceremony closing the 1999 Special 
Olympics World Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The closing ceremony didn't rival the opening ceremony of the  
Games nine days earlier at Carter-Finley Stadium in Raleigh, where 
thousands of spectators watched celebrities greet delegations of 
athletes. But Sunday's ceremony may have been more emotional, with 
competitors saying their final goodbyes to new friends and clicking 
photos that will be lasting memories. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since I was here last Friday I was told to make new friends. I  
have made 304 new friends,'' said a sobbing Joseph ``Papa Joe'' 
Garceau, a 64-year-old softball player from Massachusetts. ``I had 
a lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was a moment of silence early in the program for three  
people who were involved with the Games but died within the last 
nine days. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes after the opening ceremonies ended last Saturday,  
volunteer Neale Orrok, 62, of Hendersonville collapsed and died of 
heart problems while walking to a bus. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Mohamed Abdul Baset Barin, a 14-year-old volleyball  
player from Egypt, died in his sleep, apparently from an epileptic 
seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	And University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill chancellor  
Michael Hooker died of cancer last week. Hooker, 53, was on the 
Special Olympics board of directors and was instrumental in 
bringing the games to the Research Triangle area. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the start of the ceremonies, the delegation from  
Wisconsin entered the stadium wearing ``cheeseheads'' to help 
shield the heat, while others took refuge from the 95-degree 
temperature by wearing bathing suits, dousing themselves with water 
from squirt guns or wearing wet towels over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, more than a dozen were overcome by the heat and had to be  
treated by Red Cross personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	But the hot conditions didn't slow everyone down. Many of the  
athletes danced with one another as the nine-day international 
event came to a close. One athlete drew a crowd as he pretended to 
play an inflatable toy guitar to background music, dropping to his 
knees. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's event featured competitors from 150 countries. There  
were about 2,000 coaches, 15,000 friends and relatives and 45,000 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers called it the most successful Special Olympics,  
saying the event drew 400,000 people. ``We set unprecedented crowds 
for Special Olympics,'' said Joe Freddoso, chief executive officer 
of the World Games Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Freddoso thanked the many volunteers for  
making the Games a success. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have been flexible, you have been smiling all week, you  
have been hospitable, you have shown the best of what North 
Carolina has to offer,'' Freddoso said of the volunteers. ``You 
have made your home state and home region look fantastic in the 
eyes of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Special Olympics, held for individuals with mental  
retardation, was founded in 1963 by Eunice Kennedy Shriver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to believe the Shrivers, who have seen it for 30 years,  
that this was the best ever,'' said LeRoy Walker, president of the 
Games and former president of the United States Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The next world Special Olympics competition will be held in 2001  
at the Winter Games in Alaska. The symbolic flag was lowered and 
handed to the Alaskan delegation, and moments later the Olympic 
flame was extinguished by athlete Monte' Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lose the flame but not the hopes,'' said Walker.

<HEADLINE>  Budget Projections Could Wither </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There are plenty of reasons to think the huge  
budget surpluses President Clinton and Congress forecast last week 
are wishful thinking and will fall victim to recession or 
politicians' penchant for spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The projections -- with both sides envisioning about $2.9  
trillion in surpluses over the next decade -- also could turn out 
too conservative. Economists for the most part say even if the 
economy stumbles, the federal budget still would avoid the annual 
deficits that until last year were a budgetary mainstay for three 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably too optimistic, and I wouldn't spend all the  
money yet,'' said Bill Dudley, chief U.S. economist at Goldman 
Sachs &AMP; Co., the investment banking firm. ``But I think the budget 
is in pretty good shape through 2010,'' when retiring baby boomers 
start driving up the costs of Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	In predicting surpluses, the White House Office of Management  
and Budget and its rival, the Congressional Budget Office, are 
relying on similar spending assumptions that worry Dudley and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Both offices assumed that for the next three years, Washington  
will obey steadily declining spending limits required by the 1997 
budget-balancing agreement. Almost nobody thinks that will happen 
because of spending demands for defense, schools, agriculture and 
other programs by Clinton and lawmakers from both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have these wonderful surplus numbers floating around,  
and, unfortunately, most of those surplus projections are based on 
sand,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis. He spent last week insisting 
that actual spending would be higher -- and surpluses lower -- than 
the analysts predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending limits govern the one-third of the $1.8 trillion  
budget that covers everything except automatically paid benefits 
like Social Security and interest payments on Treasury bills. Those 
caps decline gradually through 2002, then vanish. 
</P>
<P>
	But if it assumed instead that spending will rise annually to  
stay even with inflation, things are different. Then the $1 
trillion part of the 10-year surplus that comes from everything but 
Social Security would shrink to below $500 billion, the 
Congressional Budget Office has calculated. 
</P>
<P>
	That is crucial because the non-Social Security part of the  
surplus is what both parties want to use for their proposed tax 
cuts and increases for Medicare and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans, through Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz., demanded  
in the party's Fourth of July weekend radio address that the $1 
trillion surplus be used as tax cuts to declare ``financial 
independence'' for American families. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, 
R-Ill., tempered that a bit Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' 
prescribing a cut of around $800 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing later on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' White House budget  
director Jack Lew said spending the $1 trillion on tax cuts would 
put the nation back into deficit by 2015 rather than paying off 
publicly held debt as Clinton insists can be done. His spokeswoman, 
Linda Ricci, said that's because interest payments, projected at 
zero, still would have to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Members of Congress thinking they really have $1 trillion to  
play with will find out they don't,'' said Robert Greenstein, 
executive director of the liberal leaning Center on Budget and 
Policy Priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there is the economy itself, which has been steadily  
expanding for eight years, a near record. The government has seen 
its revenues grow at a healthy 8 percent annually or more, thanks 
to swelling corporate and personal incomes and capital gains taxes 
paid by investors in the booming stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House and congressional projections assume continued  
modest but uninterrupted economic growth. A recession would 
substantially reduce government revenues as corporate profits and 
personal earnings drop and federal spending for the poor grows. 
</P>
<P>
	But even that could be short-lived, because economic growth  
usually accelerates as the country digs itself out of a recession. 
Also, analysts from both budget offices say their calculations take 
into account a possible recession by slightly lowering their 
projections for each year's economic performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a typical recession, I could see a year of the surplus  
dropping, but not going away,'' said Greg Valliere, managing 
director of the Charles Schwab Washington Research Group. ``But it 
still doesn't change the basic view that we've got a lot of surplus 
money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A severe and prolonged stock market plunge could have the  
opposite effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal surplus probably would rise at first as people sell  
stock and pay taxes on their profits. But in the longer term, the 
government would be hurt by lower corporate taxes and payroll 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, some analysts say the surplus forecasts could  
be too low because the White House and CBO both assume that 
economic growth -- a key influence on federal revenue -- will be 2.5 
percent or less for years. The economy grew at 3.9 percent last 
year and is close to 4 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The premises in these projections are if anything on the  
conservative side,'' said Valliere.

<HEADLINE>  Budget Projections Could Wither </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There are plenty of reasons to think the huge  
budget surpluses President Clinton and Congress forecast last week 
are wishful thinking and will fall victim to recession or 
politicians' penchant for spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The projections -- with both sides envisioning about $2.9  
trillion in surpluses over the next decade -- also could turn out 
too conservative. Economists for the most part say even if the 
economy stumbles, the federal budget still would avoid the annual 
deficits that until last year were a budgetary mainstay for three 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably too optimistic, and I wouldn't spend all the  
money yet,'' said Bill Dudley, chief U.S. economist at Goldman 
Sachs &AMP; Co., the investment banking firm. ``But I think the budget 
is in pretty good shape through 2010,'' when retiring baby boomers 
start driving up the costs of Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	In predicting surpluses, the White House Office of Management  
and Budget and its rival, the Congressional Budget Office, are 
relying on similar spending assumptions that worry Dudley and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Both offices assumed that for the next three years, Washington  
will obey steadily declining spending limits required by the 1997 
budget-balancing agreement. Almost nobody thinks that will happen 
because of spending demands for defense, schools, agriculture and 
other programs by Clinton and lawmakers from both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have these wonderful surplus numbers floating around,  
and, unfortunately, most of those surplus projections are based on 
sand,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis. He spent last week insisting 
that actual spending would be higher -- and surpluses lower -- than 
the analysts predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending limits govern the one-third of the $1.8 trillion  
budget that covers everything except automatically paid benefits 
like Social Security and interest payments on Treasury bills. Those 
caps decline gradually through 2002, then vanish. 
</P>
<P>
	But if it assumed instead that spending will rise annually to  
stay even with inflation, things are different. Then the $1 
trillion part of the 10-year surplus that comes from everything but 
Social Security would shrink to below $500 billion, the 
Congressional Budget Office has calculated. 
</P>
<P>
	That is crucial because the non-Social Security part of the  
surplus is what both parties want to use for their proposed tax 
cuts and increases for Medicare and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans, through Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz., demanded  
in the party's Fourth of July weekend radio address that the $1 
trillion surplus be used as tax cuts to declare ``financial 
independence'' for American families. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, 
R-Ill., tempered that a bit Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' 
prescribing a cut of around $800 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing later on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' White House budget  
director Jack Lew said spending the $1 trillion on tax cuts would 
put the nation back into deficit by 2015 rather than paying off 
publicly held debt as Clinton insists can be done. His spokeswoman, 
Linda Ricci, said that's because interest payments, projected at 
zero, still would have to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Members of Congress thinking they really have $1 trillion to  
play with will find out they don't,'' said Robert Greenstein, 
executive director of the liberal leaning Center on Budget and 
Policy Priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there is the economy itself, which has been steadily  
expanding for eight years, a near record. The government has seen 
its revenues grow at a healthy 8 percent annually or more, thanks 
to swelling corporate and personal incomes and capital gains taxes 
paid by investors in the booming stock market.

modest but uninterrupted economic growth. A recession would 
substantially reduce government revenues as corporate profits and 
personal earnings drop and federal spending for the poor grows.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Grabbed in Sendoff Spoof </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Late in his tenure as Treasury secretary,  
Robert Rubin often had occasion to tear into the way Japan handled 
its reeling economy. The Japanese probably didn't like it, but 
enough to kidnap him? 
</P>
<P>
	Yep, said a videotape spoof shown in the White House's state  
dining room to President Clinton, along with the first lady and 
other Rubin friends and colleagues attending a retirement party 
thrown by the president Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The premise was that retired Japanese bureaucrats took Rubin  
hostage in Tokyo and refused to let him go unless he would say 
something -- ANYTHING -- positive about the Japanese economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA reports to Clinton that, aware of the U.S. military's  
``name, rank, serial number'' limits to cooperation with captors, 
Rubin held out against his. He gave them nothing more than a lesson 
in basic capitalism: ``My name is Bob Rubin. I am a U.S. citizen. 
Markets go up and markets go down. I have nothing more to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse Jackson, whose real-life hostage-retrieving skills were  
honed in Iraq and Yugoslavia, finally is called on to find ``common 
ground between the yen and the yang.'' Successful, Jackson 
declares: ``Free at last, free at last. Thank God almighty, Bob's 
free at last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Sperling, Clinton's chief economic adviser, conceived,  
produced, directed, wrote the screenplay of (what there was of it), 
acted in and was cinematographer for the production. 
</P>
<P>
	Sperling's handiwork producing ``Free Bob: A Documentary'' did  
not go unnoticed. His spokesman, Jake Siewert, introduced his boss 
Friday at a White House briefing as ``chairman of the National 
Economic Council and a documentary filmmaker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sperling reportedly worked on the movie, off and on, over a  
24-hour period, then got editing help from a friend who's an 
experienced editor. 
</P>
<P>
	The concept probably came easily to Sperling: Japanese officials  
were known to resent Rubin's outspokenness about economic 
mismanagement in their country. Tokyo quickly congratulated his 
successor, Rubin's longtime deputy Lawrence Summers, after his 
swearing-in Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Jackson and Sperling, the videotape featured some  
of Washington's most powerful people. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, argues with  
Sperling about whose name goes atop the memo to Clinton outlining 
rescue options. Japan is a foreign country, but the demands are 
economic. 
</P>
<P>
	--Clinton tries to keep himself above the fray by working on a  
crossword puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
	--Defense Secretary William Cohen reports in the Pentagon press  
room that he's offering the Navy's entire $82 billion budget to pay 
for Rubin's hotel room in outrageously expensive Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan gives his report.  
``Greenspan's comments were straight up,'' an official who saw the 
film said, ``but in the context, you had to laugh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday night's showing was supposed to be the last, and as of  
Saturday nobody had reported that a copy had been leaked. But in 
Washington, just wait.

<HEADLINE>  Police Block Orange Order March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) -- British soldiers and police  
blocked Northern Ireland's major Protestant organization from 
marching Sunday through this town's hostile Catholic district, an 
annual confrontation that has triggered widespread violence for the 
past three summers. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike previous years, leaders of Portadown's Orange Order  
brotherhood took precautions to ensure that their thousands of 
followers behaved peacefully outside the rural Anglican church that 
is the parade's focal point. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange officials directed the crowd to back away from the barbed  
wire-strewn front-line zone before senior Orangemen marched forward 
to hand in a letter to senior policeman protesting the blockade. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,000 Orange Order members and their supporters, led by  
victims of Irish Republican Army violence, marched earlier from 
downtown Portadown to the church via a predominantly Protestant 
route. 
</P>
<P>
	At their service, the Rev. John Pickering led the congregation  
in a prayer for peace -- and for the Orangemen's eventual agreed 
passage down the disputed Garvaghy Road a quarter-mile away. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rolls of razor wire I see stretched along the fields  
across from the church, and the metal barrier on the road, is again 
this year a symbol of the sad divisions in Northern Ireland,'' 
Pickering said in a sermon relayed to the crowd outside by 
loudspeaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we look ahead to the coming days, give us a lasting peace  
in this area, in Garvaghy Road, in Portadown, in this country and 
the whole world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His prayer followed a frustrating week of negotiations to save  
the Good Friday peace plan for a Protestant-Catholic government in 
Norther Ireland, and production of a take-it-or-leave-it package 
that angered the Protestant majority party. 
</P>
<P>
	British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister  
Bertie Ahern has challenged the Ulster Unionists to accept the Sinn 
Fein, the party allied to the Irish Republican Army, as government 
partners July 15 -- without the guarantee that the IRA would disarm. 
</P>
<P>
	The attempt to push the major Protestant party towards a  
deal-clinching compromise came at a time when Northern Ireland's 
sectarian passions often boil over into bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orangemen's parade through Portadown -- one of thousands  
staged each July by the conservative fraternal group -- took on 
province-wide significance in 1995, when Catholic residents along 
Garvaghy Road first tried to block it. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then the dispute has thrown Northern Ireland into an  
annual crisis, with both sides claiming their rights were being 
infringed. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, army engineers erected daunting barbed-wire  
fortifications in front of the Anglican church. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight, beneath the beams of army helicopter searchlights,  
young Protestant men hurled stones and firecrackers across the 
barricade at police and soldiers, but nobody was reported injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, suspected Catholic arsonists damaged an Orange hall  
and a Free Presbyterian Church, the hard-line denomination founded 
by the Rev. Ian Paisley, Northern Ireland's most unyielding 
Protestant politician. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides of the community consider the annual confrontation --  
and how British authorities manage it -- a test of the two 
communities' relative political influence and strength.

<HEADLINE> Singer Davis Looks Back on Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- The 20th century hasn't been all  
sunshine for Jimmie Davis, but as the singer, songwriter and former 
segregationist governor approaches his 100th birthday, sunshine is 
what he's best known for. 
</P>
<P>
	After a lifetime of hit tunes, movies and politics, the simple  
song ``You Are My Sunshine'' is Davis' best known legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot worse things to leave behind,'' says Davis,  
due to celebrate his 100th birthday Sept. 11. ``I'm glad to claim 
it as mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 60 years since Davis first recorded the song, people send  
it to him in music boxes, he hears it on answering machines and he 
can find it in more than 300 versions and 50 languages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Along with 'Happy Birthday,' it's the most valuable music  
copyright ever,'' says Kevin Fontenot, a doctoral candidate at 
Tulane University, who is writing a book about Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	For a man who left so many marks on the century, the century has  
left relatively little mark on Davis. He uses a walker now but 
every morning still dons a freshly starched dress shirt and tie. He 
performs several times a year, works in his home office daily and 
monitors his royalties. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came up expecting to work hard for everything I got, and I  
never saw anything that persuaded me that wasn't true,'' Davis 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of a sharecropper, Davis was the oldest of 11 children  
raised in a two-room house. By age 7, he was plowing behind the 
family mule and picking cotton. The hard work and lean living 
taught values Davis says he still has. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first Christmas present I ever got was a dried hog's  
bladder and a plucked blackbird,'' he says. ``We ate the blackbird 
and played ball with the bladder, and I thought we were pretty well 
off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis began his professional singing career at Louisiana College  
-- crooning on street corners. After graduation, the money he earned 
singing, even when added to his teacher's pay, wasn't enough to pay 
off school debts. For a steady salary, he entered politics -- first 
as clerk of court in Shreveport, then the state Public Service 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time he was elected governor in 1943, Davis was already  
becoming famous in music and films, playing the singing cowboy in a 
number of horse operas. But politics did not flow as sweetly 
through Davis' life as his music. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis served two terms as Louisiana governor -- 1944-48 and  
1960-64. In his first term, he set a record for absenteeism, 
traveling frequently to Hollywood to further his movie career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have done more movies,'' Davis says with an air of  
defiance. ``I turned down a chance to make millions to take a job 
that paid $1,000 a month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1959, Davis ran on a ``Peace and Harmony'' platform but was  
unable to deliver either in those turbulent times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am unqualifiedly in favor of segregation,'' Davis wrote in a  
campaign pamphlet. ``The best way to maintain our historic way of 
life, as well as harmonious relations between the races, is to 
provide separate and equal facilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As governor, Davis called five straight special legislative  
sessions to resist federal desegregation orders and, when the 
courts prevailed, set up grants to aid private school pupils. 
</P>
<P>
	His views reflected those of most whites at the time, says  
historian Michael Kurtz, dean of the graduate school at 
Southeastern Louisiana: ``On the whole, he was a middle-of-the-road 
individual who supported keeping the status quo. He didn't want to 
rock the boat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when things changed, Kurtz adds, so did Davis. Under Davis,  
Louisiana strengthened its schools, instituted teacher pensions, 
invested idle state funds and took early environmental action. 
</P>
<P>
	He made a halfhearted bid for a third term in 1971. One of 19  
candidates, he lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the best thing that ever happened to me,'' Davis  
insists. ``It was after that I got to do what I really wanted -- 
sing, perform, live my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel  
Music Hall of Fame and the Louisiana Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	He started off singing blues. Early on, he worked with two black  
sidemen. In the 1930s, he had an integrated band, practically 
unheard of then. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was really ahead of his time in appreciating the blues,''  
Fontenot says. ``And when you listen to those records, he's one of 
the blackest-sounding white men I've ever heard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the sad, nostalgic songs, first called hillbilly,  
later country-western, that Davis became known for. His rich voice 
spun out ballads about lost love, lost times and unforgotten 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1929 Davis was recording for RCA Victor and singing at any  
juke joint that would pay. He says his parents ``worried because I 
wasn't making steady money. I had a song I really liked, and I 
promised them that if it didn't make it, I'd give it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's Darling But Mine'' was his first big hit. Since then,  
by his own count, Davis has written better than 400 tunes and 
recorded more than 60 albums. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis first recorded ``You Are My Sunshine'' in 1931 but was so  
unhappy with the studio band that he refused to release it. Eight 
years passed before he recorded it again. It became a smash hit 
that eventually sold millions. 
</P>
<P>
	Recorded by dozens of artists from Bing Crosby to Gene Autry,  
``You Are My Sunshine'' was a favorite of King George VI. It was 
played on Armed Forces Radio during World War II, and GIs landing 
in Japan found it already a favorite there. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis says he has recorded ``Sunshine'' dozens of times, just  
last year with a children's choir. Others have tried to lay claim 
to the song. There's no question he wrote the lyrics, but Fontenot 
says there's some debate whether he was solely responsible for the 
tune. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's still the million-dollar question,'' Fontenot says.  
``The tune may have had its roots in traditional folk songs, but 
there's no question now that it's Jimmie Davis' song. He owns the 
copyright.''

<HEADLINE> PC Club Sticks Close to Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDUSTRY, Calif. (AP) -- Computer retailer Jackson Lan didn't  
just keep his eye on the competition. He moved in next door. 
</P>
<P>
	Lan opened his first PC Club store 50 yards from competitor  
CompUSA in Industry. Seven years and 18 stores later, PC Club 
stores are usually within walking distance of CompUSA, Best Buy or 
Fry's Electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	By putting his stores near big retailers, Lan picks up extra  
foot traffic and avoids spending much money for market research on 
location sites thanks to his rivals' advertising campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We trust their analysis,'' the 49-year-old Taiwan native said.  
</P>
<P>
	In the past 18 months, Lan opened his first stores outside of  
Southern California -- in Las Vegas and Mesa, Ariz., both near 
CompUSA stores.

<HEADLINE> National Zoo Proposes Panda Lease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Officials at the National Zoo have made a  
10-year, $2.5 million offer to lease a pair of giant pandas from 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of three zoo officials and researchers have been in China  
for a week to discuss a possible panda rental -- China no longer 
sells or gives away the endangered species -- and were scheduled to 
return to Washington Saturday night, said Robert Hoage, the zoo's 
chief of public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The team, led by Benjamin Beck, the zoo's associate director for  
biological programs, is scheduled to meet with top zoo officials 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The zoo's one remaining panda, Hsing Hsing (pronounced Shing  
Shing), is 28 and suffers from an irreversible kidney condition. He 
and another panda, Ling Ling, were diplomatic gifts from China in 
1972 after President Nixon's historic visit. Ling Ling died seven 
years ago, and none of the pair's five cubs survived. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other two pandas in the United States are at the San  
Diego Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 1,000 giant pandas live in the wild in China, their  
only native habitat, and 100 live in Chinese zoos. Since they are 
endangered, China no longer gives pandas as gifts and does not sell 
pandas overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoo Atlanta, however, recently reached an agreement to lease a  
pair of 2-year-old pandas as part of a 10-year study on why pandas 
are not interested in mating while in captivity, said Georgia Tech 
scientist Rebecca Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	In return for the loan, Zoo Atlanta has agreed to raise $11  
million for panda research and education programs in China and 
Atlanta by 2007, zoo officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Zoo, one of the few U.S. zoos that charge no  
admission, cannot afford $11 million for two pandas and instead 
hopes China will accept its offer of limited funding along with 
proposals for extensive, collaborative educational and research 
projects, Hoage said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those include the development of a national census of giant  
pandas in the wild; development of a radio tracking and satellite 
monitoring system of pandas and research and training projects in 
veterinary, nutritional, behavioral and ecological studies on 
pandas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been doing these studies and working with them off and  
on now for years,'' Hoage said of the collaborative research with 
China. ``There's more of an emphasis now, but it's not something 
brand new.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other costs associated with two new pandas include the $400,000  
a year to maintain them and a proposed $3.5 million plan to 
refurbish the giant panda house, Hoage said. 
</P>
<P>
	The zoo anticipates some financial return -- possibly as much as  
$1 million a year in increased concession sales -- if China does 
accept its offer, he said.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Chicago Shooter Kills Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- A gunman who targeted minorities in a  
deadly drive-by shooting spree in the Chicago area struck again 
Sunday, killing a Korean man outside a church, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooter, believed to be a white supremacist with ``Sabbath  
Breaker'' tattooed on his chest, fired at Asians and blacks in two 
Illinois cities on Saturday, and fatally shot a black man and 
wounded six Orthodox Jews on Friday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This man is on a spree,'' Chicago Police Cmdr. William Hayes  
said. ``He's just shooting people all over this state and out of 
state now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police issued an arrest warrant for the owner of the light blue  
Ford Taurus reported at each of the shootings -- Benjamin Nathaniel 
Smith, 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The car sped away from the Korean United Methodist Church on  
Sunday morning after its driver fired four shots into a crowd of 
worshippers, police said. A 26-year-old Indiana University student 
was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Smith's ex-girlfriends told the Daily Illini, the student  
newspaper at the University of Illinois, that the timing of the 
shootings was not a coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is his Independence Day from the government, from  
everything,'' said Elizabeth Sahr, who said she had a one-year 
relationship with Smith. ``He is not going to stop until he's shot 
dead. He's not going to surrender. He's not going to give up until 
he leaves this world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was a member of the World Church of the Creator, a white  
supremacist organization, and often distributed anti-minority and 
anti-Semitic literature while a student in Bloomington at Indiana 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	The church, based in East Peoria, Ill., is led by Matt Hale, who  
said Smith was a member from June 1998 until May and never showed 
any predilection for violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I spoke to him he never gave any inkling of being able to  
do this,'' Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Harlan Loeb, Midwest counsel for the Anti-Defamation  
League, said his organization has had Smith ``on our radar screen 
for quite some time, which is particularly tragic for someone so 
young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Smith matched the descriptions of the gunman  
sought in connection with several attacks in Illinois on Friday 
night and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes said Smith is believed to be about 6 feet tall and 135  
pounds. His Taurus, which has a blown-out passenger-side window, 
has Indiana plates and is registered in Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a gunman wounded six Orthodox Jews leaving synagogue  
on the Jewish Sabbath in Chicago. The same shooter is believed to 
have killed Ricky Byrdsong, the black former basketball coach at 
Northwestern University, as he walked with his children in nearby 
Skokie, Ill., and fired at an Asian-American couple in the suburb 
of Northbrook. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on Saturday, police said, the same blue Taurus was seen at  
shootings in Springfield and Champaign-Urbana. In the first attack, 
the gunman fired on two black men, but no one was hit, Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 12 hours later, six men of Asian descent were standing on  
a corner near the University of Illinois when three or four shots 
were fired, Hayes said. A 22-year-old graduate student was hit in 
the leg and was in serious condition Sunday, Urbana police 
spokesman Michael Metzler said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's attack, Won-Joon Yoon was hit twice in the back and  
killed outside the church. Witnesses told police that after firing 
into the crowd, the shooter sped off, running several lights. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was apparently parked at the corner and waited for these  
people to come out of church and then fired,'' Bloomington Police 
Chief Jim Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes said .380-caliber shell casings -- the same kind found in  
some of the Chicago shootings -- were also found at the scene of the 
Indiana church attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year on the Fourth of July, Smith tucked white supremacist  
fliers under windshields around Bloomington. Asked whether the 
shootings this weekend were related to Independence Day, Capt. 
William Parker said, ``It raises questions in our minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parker said Smith passed out similar hate literature when  
enrolled at the University of Illinois. The Daily Illini reported 
that Smith attended the school from 1996 through 1998 before being 
expelled. Urbana police said he had been in trouble with campus 
police, including for drug possession. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith attended Indiana University from the summer of 1998  
through the spring of 1999, and he is believed to have moved to the 
Chicago are in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``The towns he's hit, he's either lived there or been enrolled  
in college at each of the towns,'' Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the men wounded in Friday night's shootings, who asked  
that his name not be used for fear of retribution, said he looked 
into the gunman's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got the sense he was enjoying himself,'' the man told the  
Chicago Sun-Times from his hospital bed. ``He had this predator 
look to him.''

<HEADLINE> GM Considers New Line of Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) -- General Motors Corp. is considering  
building some components for its next generation of compact and 
midsize cars at the company's Fairfax plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The company would likely move its Pontiac Grand Prix assembly  
from Kansas City, Kan., to a Canadian plant to make room. 
</P>
<P>
	If the deal comes about, the plant would make chassis, drive  
train and engine components as part of the still-secret new cars, 
which have a code name of Epsilon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oldsmobile Intrigue assembly line at Fairfax would remain  
for the time being and even could overlap production for the new 
Epsilon line. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers at Fairfax, which employs about 3,500 people, were  
advised of the possible change Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But company spokesman Kyle Johnson said, ``a lot of things have  
to happen,'' before the company officially makes the change. He 
declined to answer questions about project costs or employment 
needs for a retooled plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the factors that have to be decided is a new labor  
agreement with local Auto Workers and negotiation of infrastructure 
and tax incentive deals with state and local officials, Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Russell, president of United Auto Workers Local 31, said the  
company's plan would ensure the long-term viability of the Fairfax 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a car GM plans to market worldwide, and we've been  
chosen to build it,'' Russell said. ``I feel like it's going to 
give job security to our people, particularly the younger 
employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Russell said some workers are anxious about the  
departure of the Grand Prix, which has been a popular Pontiac model 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have some concern, because the Grand Prix has given us job  
security since 1994,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Singer Davis Looks Back on Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- The 20th century hasn't been all  
sunshine for Jimmie Davis, but as the singer, songwriter and former 
segregationist governor approaches his 100th birthday, sunshine is 
what he's best known for. 
</P>
<P>
	After a lifetime of hit tunes, movies and politics, the simple  
song ``You Are My Sunshine'' is Davis' best known legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot worse things to leave behind,'' says Davis,  
due to celebrate his 100th birthday Sept. 11. ``I'm glad to claim 
it as mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 60 years since Davis first recorded the song, people send  
it to him in music boxes, he hears it on answering machines and he 
can find it in more than 300 versions and 50 languages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Along with 'Happy Birthday,' it's the most valuable music  
copyright ever,'' says Kevin Fontenot, a doctoral candidate at 
Tulane University, who is writing a book about Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	For a man who left so many marks on the century, the century has  
left relatively little mark on Davis. He uses a walker now but 
every morning still dons a freshly starched dress shirt and tie. He 
performs several times a year, works in his home office daily and 
monitors his royalties. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came up expecting to work hard for everything I got, and I  
never saw anything that persuaded me that wasn't true,'' Davis 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of a sharecropper, Davis was the oldest of 11 children  
raised in a two-room house. By age 7, he was plowing behind the 
family mule and picking cotton. The hard work and lean living 
taught values Davis says he still has. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first Christmas present I ever got was a dried hog's  
bladder and a plucked blackbird,'' he says. ``We ate the blackbird 
and played ball with the bladder, and I thought we were pretty well 
off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis began his professional singing career at Louisiana College  
-- crooning on street corners. After graduation, the money he earned 
singing, even when added to his teacher's pay, wasn't enough to pay 
off school debts. For a steady salary, he entered politics -- first 
as clerk of court in Shreveport, then the state Public Service 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time he was elected governor in 1943, Davis was already  
becoming famous in music and films, playing the singing cowboy in a 
number of horse operas. But politics did not flow as sweetly 
through Davis' life as his music. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis served two terms as Louisiana governor -- 1944-48 and  
1960-64. In his first term, he set a record for absenteeism, 
traveling frequently to Hollywood to further his movie career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have done more movies,'' Davis says with an air of  
defiance. ``I turned down a chance to make millions to take a job 
that paid $1,000 a month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1959, Davis ran on a ``Peace and Harmony'' platform but was  
unable to deliver either in those turbulent times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am unqualifiedly in favor of segregation,'' Davis wrote in a  
campaign pamphlet. ``The best way to maintain our historic way of 
life, as well as harmonious relations between the races, is to 
provide separate and equal facilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As governor, Davis called five straight special legislative  
sessions to resist federal desegregation orders and, when the 
courts prevailed, set up grants to aid private school pupils. 
</P>
<P>
	His views reflected those of most whites at the time, says  
historian Michael Kurtz, dean of the graduate school at 
Southeastern Louisiana: ``On the whole, he was a middle-of-the-road 
individual who supported keeping the status quo. He didn't want to 
rock the boat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when things changed, Kurtz adds, so did Davis. Under Davis,  
Louisiana strengthened its schools, instituted teacher pensions, 
invested idle state funds and took early environmental action. 
</P>
<P>
	He made a halfhearted bid for a third term in 1971. One of 19  
candidates, he lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the best thing that ever happened to me,'' Davis  
insists. ``It was after that I got to do what I really wanted -- 
sing, perform, live my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel  
Music Hall of Fame and the Louisiana Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	He started off singing blues. Early on, he worked with two black  
sidemen. In the 1930s, he had an integrated band, practically 
unheard of then. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was really ahead of his time in appreciating the blues,''  
Fontenot says. ``And when you listen to those records, he's one of 
the blackest-sounding white men I've ever heard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the sad, nostalgic songs, first called hillbilly,  
later country-western, that Davis became known for. His rich voice 
spun out ballads about lost love, lost times and unforgotten 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1929 Davis was recording for RCA Victor and singing at any  
juke joint that would pay. He says his parents ``worried because I 
wasn't making steady money. I had a song I really liked, and I 
promised them that if it didn't make it, I'd give it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's Darling But Mine'' was his first big hit. Since then,  
by his own count, Davis has written better than 400 tunes and 
recorded more than 60 albums. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis first recorded ``You Are My Sunshine'' in 1931 but was so  
unhappy with the studio band that he refused to release it. Eight 
years passed before he recorded it again. It became a smash hit 
that eventually sold millions. 
</P>
<P>
	Recorded by dozens of artists from Bing Crosby to Gene Autry,  
``You Are My Sunshine'' was a favorite of King George VI. It was 
played on Armed Forces Radio during World War II, and GIs landing 
in Japan found it already a favorite there. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis says he has recorded ``Sunshine'' dozens of times, just  
last year with a children's choir. Others have tried to lay claim 
to the song. There's no question he wrote the lyrics, but Fontenot 
says there's some debate whether he was solely responsible for the 
tune. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's still the million-dollar question,'' Fontenot says.  
``The tune may have had its roots in traditional folk songs, but 
there's no question now that it's Jimmie Davis' song. He owns the 
copyright.''

<HEADLINE> Unwanted Workers Now Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Pedro Gonzalez has an unenviable resume: 10th-grade dropout,  
ex-gang member, convicted felon. Just two months after leaving 
jail, however, he's making $12 an hour on a tree-trimming crew. 
</P>
<P>
	Desperate for workers, The Energy Group recently hired Gonzalez  
-- a man his bosses say wouldn't have gotten an interview a few 
years back. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Detroit-based company, which erects utility lines and  
keeps them free of debris, hopes to hire 10 more workers from 
Gonzalez's reform program, called GRACE for Gang Retirement and 
Continued Education/Employment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dropouts, unskilled minorities, people with disabilities,  
seniors: The unwanted workers, those who traditionally get the 
worst jobs, or no jobs at all, are suddenly wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	With unemployment at 4.3 percent in June, only slightly up from  
May's 29-year low of 4.2 percent, Gonzalez gets work that feeds his 
family. A disabled man leaves a dead-end restaurant job. 
Ex-soldiers are courted by telecommunications executives once 
uneasy about veterans' inflexibility. 
</P>
<P>
	As an inner-city employer, The Energy Group was having trouble  
keeping workers who lived in Detroit's outlying suburbs. ``We can't 
keep relying on workers who have to drive an hour and a half each 
way,'' says Dan Francis, a company vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need people so bad,'' Gonzalez agrees, borrowing his  
boss's cell phone on his lunch break to talk to a reporter. ``If 
they didn't, they could take their pick and choose. They're not 
going to choose an ex-felon before someone with no record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's hard to guess if the open doors will close again when the  
job market cools. Certainly, some people will be let go, and 
companies won't dig hard for workers like Pedro Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the gains made by historically marginalized workers are  
enormous, in some cases the biggest in decades. Jobless rates for 
high school dropouts have fallen from 9.7 percent in June 1994 to 
6.7 percent in June 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment among black workers was a record low of 7.3 percent  
in June. As recently as June 1994, it was 11.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Black men aged 16 to 24 are not only getting jobs, they're  
getting paid more -- gains they couldn't make in the prosperous 
1980s, according to a recent study by the National Bureau of 
Economic Research. 
</P>
<P>
	The progress is evident at the Ella J. Baker House, a community  
group for inner-city youths in Dorchester, one of Boston's toughest 
neighborhoods. Five years ago, ``you couldn't even get somebody 
from the electric company to visit,'' says Teny Gross, senior House 
counselor. These days, several recruiters or employers fax job 
offers or visit the House each week. 
</P>
<P>
	The hunger for workers is felt, too, at the President's  
Committee on Employment of People With Disabilities, whose database 
of disabled college students is being snapped up by employers. Last 
year, project director Paul Meyer sent out 130 copies of the 
database on CD-ROM at companies' request. Only halfway through this 
year, he's already sent 350. 
</P>
<P>
	One employee of the president's committee, Rachel Dorman, a  
junior at George Washington University in Washington, is legally 
blind. She got six offers for summer jobs, including three without 
interviews. ``I thought that was aggressive,'' she says with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	The market for ``non-traditional'' workers is so hot that  
recruiters, temp agencies and training companies are specializing 
in the very kinds of worker they used to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers, for one. Big companies have always been attracted to  
younger ex-officers' discipline and toughness, but older officers 
and low-ranking soldiers were sometimes regarded as too rigid and 
unimaginative, says Michael Devereaux, head of the military 
recruitment division of Lucas Group, a Dallas-based recruiter. 
</P>
<P>
	No more. Devereaux now has little trouble placing all ranks of  
former soldiers and finds companies such as Net2000 Communications, 
a Herndon, Va., telecommunications company, reconsidering their 
qualms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Net2000 is all about change,'' explains human resources  
executive Kathy Dickerson. ``When you think about the military, you 
think more about conservative, unwavering individuals, not someone 
in a constant change mode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pleased with the new labor pool, Net2000 is working with  
Devereaux to hire a number of ex-military engineers. 
</P>
<P>
	In Minneapolis, Robert Velasco, owner of a training firm that  
introduces computer skills to mostly female or minority students, 
can't produce job candidates fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies are making job offers to his students halfway through  
the 12-week program. In the last six months, he says, major 
companies that once declined to help finance his program now 
readily buy ``Corporate Partnerships'' that win them first crack at 
graduates. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, caution still tempers many employers' enthusiasm,  
one reason most of them turn to middlemen to hire such workers who 
are commonly unskilled or poorly educated. Stereotypes and 
discrimination still come into play as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Agencies and community groups such as GRACE screen workers and  
increasingly give them remedial training and crucial support. The 
temp agency Manpower offers an eight-part training program for 
people who've never held a job before; it includes a section on 
body odor. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, placements do fail. Desperate employers hire poor  
candidates more often. Inexperienced workers fold under the 
pressure of holding down jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	One woman sailed through Velasco's training and took a job as a  
computer technician, only to resume frequenting night clubs with 
friends. The day Velasco paid a surprise visit to see how she was 
doing, she had skipped work to go to a party, he recounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, amid the labor shortage, chances are being given and  
minds are being opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Haley, a Lenexa, Kan., computer technician, had never  
hired a disabled person before giving a computer job to Randy 
Hariton, a man with severely limited sight who'd been stuck working 
as a prep chef in restaurants for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he might have some problems ... but I have no  
complaints whatsoever,'' says Haley, a manager at a computer 
leasing company. ``It's told me on a personal level not to judge 
the book by the cover.''

<HEADLINE> San Jose 2, D.C. United 1 (SO) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Jeff Baicher scored in the fifth round  
of a shootout to give San Jose a 2-1 victory over D.C. United for 
its eighth extra-time win of the year, setting a Major Soccer 
League record for shootout wins in a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Baicher gave the Clash (10-7) a 3-2 edge after goalkeeper Joe  
Cannon stopped three United attempts. Ronald Cerritos and Dario 
Brose also scored for San Jose in the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Cerritos tallied the lone regulation goal for San Jose as Wade  
Barrett sent a long ball to Cerritos who carried it to the top of 
the box before striking from 15 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C. United (11-6) held the edge in all offensive categories  
during regulation, outshooting San Jose 16-7 and posting a 10-1 
edge in corner kicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Cannon kept the Clash in the game with a rejection of a Ray  
Lassiter penalty kick attempt in the 52nd minute. D.C was awarded 
the spot kick after striker A.J. Wood was pulled down in the box by 
Clash defender Jamie Clark.

<HEADLINE> Kids Charged in Starting Sex Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YORK HAVEN, Pa. (AP) -- A ring of children as young as 7 in a  
small Pennsylvania community taught each other to have sex, and a 
half-dozen of them have been charged in juvenile court. 
</P>
<P>
	The children, all students at Northeastern Middle School or York  
Haven Elementary School, hid their activities from adults but 
readily answered questions asked by police. Their candor was all 
the more troubling, said Newberry Township Police Chief Bill Myers. 
</P>
<P>
	``These kids knew that what they were doing wasn't right, but  
they didn't know it was as bad as it was,'' Myers said. ``There was 
a naivete about the legal and moral consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six children have been charged in juvenile court on charges  
including rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and indecent 
assault, Myers said Sunday. At least one or two have been convicted 
and sent to juvenile detention facilities, he said; their sentences 
are sealed by juvenile court. 
</P>
<P>
	Incidents of incest were discovered but not pursued criminally,  
Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
	No adults were charged. The case has now been closed.  
</P>
<P>
	The activity started 2 1/2 years ago with just a few children, and  
by the time authorities learned of it in December it involved 17 
youngsters aged 7 to 16, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the children first became involved as victims, then they  
repeated what they learned with other children, said York County 
Detective William ``Skip'' Clancy Jr., who helped investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	The assaults occurred in homes and elsewhere, such as in wooded  
areas, in the small borough of York Haven, population 758, along 
the Susquehanna River south of Harrisburg. 
</P>
<P>
	More children would have been charged but they were younger than  
the 10-year minimum for criminal charges, authorities said. 
Investigators interviewed about 25 children. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate detail on punishment the convicted  
youngsters faced. The prosecutor in the case, Assistant District 
Attorney Mary Lou Erb, did not return telephone messages during the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Police learned of the ring after a sleepover 16th birthday party  
for one girl that was attended by another 16-year-old girl, two 
11-year-old boys and a 13-year-old boy, Myers said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Supposedly what happened was they were playing spin the bottle  
and things got beyond that,'' he said. ``The story was the bottle 
pointed toward one of the males and he had to have intercourse with 
one of the girls. Well, I guess this turned out to be just the tip 
of the iceberg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the birthday party, one of the 16-year-olds learned that  
one of the 11-year-old boys had been molesting a 7-year-old 
neighbor, and told the victim's mother about it. 
</P>
<P>
	When that woman went to police, the girl, now 17, admitted that  
she had been having sex with an 11-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl who made the revelation was convicted of rape, because  
the difference in ages between her and the boy was more than four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think (she) realized just how much trouble she was  
going to be in,'' said the girl's mother, Cyndi A. Lyon of York 
Haven. ``I don't know how it could involve so many kids.''

<HEADLINE> 'NYPD' Star Never Gave Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- All grown up and still a TV star, Rick Schroder  
has done what he set out to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to be one of the kid actors that went away,''  
Schroder, 29, says in the July 9 USA Weekend magazine. ``I never 
gave up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This season's new addition to ``NYPD Blue,'' Schroder plays a  
young cop trying to fit in after replacing the veteran detective 
played by Jimmy Smits. He first gained fame as a boy, then known as 
Ricky Schroder, costarring in the sitcom ``Silver Spoons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now a father of three children, Schroder lives in Colorado on a  
45,000-acre ranch, where he raises cattle, fishes with his two sons 
and goes hunting. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was first cast on ``NYPD Blue,'' some critics and  
commentators wondered if the former child star was formidable 
enough to be believable as a hard-nosed New York City detective. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shocked me because I've done four miniseries, including  
``Lonesome Dove,'' and I don't know how many TV movies,'' Schroder 
said. ``Yet it seemed like everybody forgot I wasn't 12 anymore.''

<HEADLINE>  India Grabs Strategic Kashmir Peak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DRAS, India (AP) -- After a 15-hour battle in rain and fog,  
Indian soldiers on Sunday captured a strategic Himalayan peak held 
by Pakistan-based fighters, marking a major turning point in 
fighting in the divided Kashmir region, military officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	India made its claim before Pakistan's prime minister met Sunday  
in Washington with President Clinton and attempted to defuse 
tensions over Kashmir. India's leader declined an invitation for 
separate talks with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting for more than three hours, Pakistani Prime  
Minister Nawaz Sharif and Clinton issued a statement pledging to 
take ``concrete steps'' to restore the so-called line of control, 
which was set up in 1972 under a cease-fire agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials declined to elaborate on exactly what ``concrete  
steps'' Pakistan might take. However, a U.S. official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said the Clinton administration believes 
``there will be a withdrawal of the (Pakistani) forces now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Both have a great sense of urgency,'' the official said. ``We  
want to see steps taken very quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement also said the two leaders believe that an  
Indian-Pakistani dialogue begun last February in Lahore ``provides 
the best forum for resolving all issues dividing India and 
Pakistan, including Kashmir.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington and other world powers fear the fighting in Kashmir  
could expand into a wider conflict between the rival South Asia 
neighbors, who last year became the world's newest nuclear powers 
and have already fought two wars over the mountain territory, which 
both countries claim in its entirety. 
</P>
<P>
	India accuses Pakistan of sending hundreds of fighters -- among  
them Pakistani troops -- across the cease-fire line to seize 
mountain positions on the Indian side in early May, an allegation 
Pakistan denies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will win this war,'' Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari  
Vajpayee told a gathering of party workers Sunday, using that term 
for the first time to describe what the military has called a 
``localized conflict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fighting late Saturday and early Sunday, troops seized a  
major guerrilla position on the top of 16,500-foot Tiger Hill after 
days of surrounding the peak, Indian officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-hour battle was punctuated by the roar of multiple-rocket  
launchers and artillery shells bursting in the cloudy night sky. 
Only a half-dozen rebels remained, firing automatic rifles from 
behind boulders, when Indian troops scrambled over the last rock 
outcropping and overran the fortress, local commanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian flag is ``absolutely right on top'' of Tiger Hill,  
military spokesman Col. Bikram Singh told journalists in New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
	The position on the peak allowed the entrenched fighters to  
oversee the only highway through Indian-controlled Kashmir, and its 
capture ``is a turning point,'' Singh said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will facilitate the eviction of the enemy from other  
positions in the Dras sector,'' he said, referring to the town 
closest to the heart of the front. 
</P>
<P>
	Pockets of guerrilla fighters still held lower outcroppings of  
the mountain, he said. Fierce fighting was continuing elsewhere 
along the 85-mile battlefront, particularly in the Batalik sector 
to the east, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerrillas were still holding a few scattered areas overlooking  
the highway -- which is the main route for civilian and military 
traffic in the region -- but they will ``be cleared soon,'' Singh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to fight a long and hard battle for this. It is an  
important win for the Indian army,'' Defense Minister George 
Fernandes told soldiers in the northern city of Amritsar. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pakistan, Sayed Salauddin, head of the United Jehad Council --  
an alliance of 14 Muslim guerrilla groups, including some that are 
involved in the Kashmir fighting -- denied Indian soldiers had 
captured Tiger Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indians are resorting to heavy artillery fire and air strikes  
on our fighters, but they are holding on to their positions,'' 
Salauddin said in a telephone interview from Muzaffarabad, the 
capital of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	Singh said 251 Indian soldiers have been killed and 420 wounded  
in more than seven weeks of fighting. He also has said 467 
Pakistani soldiers and more than 120 guerrillas have been killed. 
The casualty figures could not be independently verified. 
</P>
<P>
	Vajpayee has rejected any dialogue with Pakistan over the  
fighting or the wider issue of Kashmir's status until the fighters 
are ejected from the Indian-controlled zone. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 10-minute conversation late Saturday with Clinton, the  
Indian prime minister turned down the invitation from the president 
for talks in Washington, Foreign Ministry spokesman Raminder Singh 
Jassal told reporters. The time was ``not convenient'' for a visit, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, Russia, Japan, Britain, Germany, France and  
other Western nations have dismissed Pakistan's denials that it is 
involved with the fighters and urged it to withdraw the forces. 
</P>
<P>
	India says the fighters consist of Pakistani troops leading  
guerrillas from Islamic groups that have been fighting for 
Kashmir's independence from majority Hindu India.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In a flash of camera bulbs, a century's  
worth of American faces were captured on film Sunday -- those of 112 
people born on Independence Days since 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Photo of the Century'' was taken at 7:04 a.m. in front of  
Independence Hall in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Twins, triplets and quadruplets, a man and his dog, a mother and  
daughter smiled while sporting red, white or blue shirts, throwing 
confetti and waving miniature American flags and fake sparklers. 
</P>
<P>
	The photographer, Paul Hosefros, represented 1947 and used a  
remote control to snap the photo while standing on the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
	The youngest face was that of Sarah Elizabeth Kitz, who had been  
born three hours earlier, weighing in at 7 pounds, 4 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
	The oldest was 99-year-old Betty Marx, whose caretaker helped  
apply her lipstick before the picture. One boy carried videotaped 
the event for his memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see, we've all grown up thinking the fireworks and  
America's birthday were for us, and here we are again with another 
big birthday party,'' said David Betz, 40, of Hopkinsville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	The photo was just one of the many ways Americans celebrated the  
nation's 223rd birthday on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Arlington, Va., 52 people from 49 countries became citizens  
at a ceremony in Freedom Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have lived in the United States for 19 years and I took time  
to decide to be a U.S. citizen,'' said Carmen Aguilar, a native of 
Venezuela. ``This is the very best decision of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humid and hazy weather didn't deter thousands from attending  
Boston's famous Fourth of July Boston Pops concert and fireworks 
display over the Charles River. 
</P>
<P>
	Emil Kannengieszer of Abington, Pa., was fulfilling his lifelong  
dream by being there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always watched this on TV,'' said the 61-year-old retiree,  
who arrived at 6 a.m. to get prime seats for the show. ``I told my 
wife, `Someday before I die, I want to see this.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In the New York City borough of Brooklyn, 134-pound Hirofumi  
Nakajima, ``The Tokyo Terror,'' had to relinquish his 3-year-old 
title as the world champion hot dog eater. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Keiner, 50, of Egg Harbor Township, N.J., became top dog  
Sunday at Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest on Coney Island 
after eating 20 and one-quarter hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took the Zen approach,'' the 317-pound Keiner said,  
acknowledging the cultural influence of his Japanese competitor. 
``I went down a path that the hot dog was one with me, and I was 
one with the universe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nakajima, who had been champion three years in a row, came in  
third, downing just 19 franks. ``Hungry'' Charles Hardy, a 
320-pound corrections officer from Brooklyn, came within a mouthful 
of winning, with 20 dogs.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- The lead singer of the Boston rock band Morphine,  
Mark Sandman, collapsed on stage and died of a heart attack at a 
concert outside Rome, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're devastated,'' said band manager Deborah Klein, hours  
after Sandman collapsed just before midnight Saturday in front of 
several thousand spectators at a music festival. ``We don't even 
know what to say. We're all in shock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A doctor tried to revive the 47-year-old Sandman but failed, and  
he was pronounced dead in an ambulance en route to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandman played bass, sang and wrote all of Morphine's songs.  
</P>
<P>
	``His music was completely special and unique,'' Klein said in a  
telephone interview from Boston. ``People loved him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morphine is a guitar-less trio that includes Dana Colley on  
saxophone and Billy Conway on drums. It started out playing at 
parties and bars around Boston and Cambridge in the early 1990s and 
built a solid cult following. Morphine has released five albums, 
including ``Good,'' ``Cure for Pain,'' ``Yes,'' ``Like Swimming'' 
and ``B-Side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sandman died on the second day of the three-day music festival  
at the Giardini del Principe in Palestrina, 30 miles east of Rome. 
Festival promoter Flavio Maniri said Sunday's performances would be 
dedicated to Sandman. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestrina was the second stop on a two-week European tour.  
Klein said the band was supposed to start two-week West Coast tour 
on July 19 after returning home. 
</P>
<P>
	She said funeral arrangements for Sandman, who is survived by  
his parents, were pending.

<HEADLINE> Oregon Facing School Funding Crunch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Oregon, with the nation's fastest-growing  
economy and highest SAT scores, is hardly a place where you would 
expect a school funding crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet many schools have overflowing classes, outdated textbooks,  
insufficient supplies and cuts in arts and sports. The Lebanon 
School District has boarded up one school because there's no money 
for repairs, and classes are held in trailers, said Superintendent 
Jim Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who doubts that there is a problem should go spend a  
day in a classroom,'' said Gov. John Kitzhaber, who has been 
pushing for a major boost in school funding. ``You've got kids 
trying to learn algebra in classes of 40 students. This isn't the 
kind of system we want our kids to learn in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem evolved over the past decade as voters slashed  
property taxes at the same time academic standards were being 
toughened. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln High School, on the edge of Portland's downtown, has cut  
all music programs. Cellos and basses gather dust in a corner of a 
music room that is now a humanities classroom, with two teachers 
for 86 students. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many students that the teachers discourage people  
from writing papers,'' said graduating senior Paul Susi. ``They 
don't have time to read 86 papers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Economically this country is at the peak of its game,'' Susi  
said. ``How is it that when we are the most prosperous and 
successful that we can't find out how to adequately fund our own 
schools?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Property tax limits passed by voters during the 1990s largely  
left the state in charge of funding schools. The state now pays 
about 80 percent of local schools' costs, compared with 30 percent 
before the tax limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Per-student spending has increased, but hasn't kept up with  
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	And with statewide enrollment climbing 15 percent during that  
time -- 542,000 children now attend public schools -- classrooms are 
becoming more crowded. The state school boards association says 
class sizes have increased from about 23 students to the 25- to 
27-student range. 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Johnson, who has three boys attending Astor Elementary  
in Astoria, said her son Max struggled through first grade because 
there were 31 children in his class. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was just too much distraction in that classroom to allow  
him to focus all day,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief sponsor of one property tax limit measure passed in  
1990, activist Don McIntire, said school administrators who 
complain about tough times are crying wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eighty-five percent of the cost of schools is pay, perks and  
pensions,'' he said. ``The squeeze isn't coming from 
belt-tightening. School budgets are getting fatter faster than we 
can punch new holes in the belt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McIntire said raises have boosted the average Oregon teacher's  
salary to $42,300. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, all teachers averaged $39,347 in the 1997-98 school  
year, according to a study released earlier this month by the 
American Federation of Teachers. Oregon was 13th on that list, with 
an average of $42,301 that year; Connecticut ranked first, at 
$51,727. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to large class sizes, there is a lack of up-to-date  
teaching materials, said Bonnie Elliott, who has taught for 30 
years in the Bend-LaPine School District. 
</P>
<P>
	``Walk into the average classroom, and you'll see a MacIntosh  
computer that's 12 years old,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	And teachers say Oregon's cumulative average SAT score of 1,056  
is deceptive because it reflects what today's older students 
learned years ago, not what younger kids are learning now. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcy Matsuo said she spends $1,000 a year of her own money to  
buy books and other supplies for her elementary classes at 
Portland's Smith School. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like to constantly be begging parents for money,''  
Matsuo said. ``We have the `Run for the Arts,' scrip sales, coupon 
books, a hoop shoot, gift wrap for sale, a school auction, a 
carnival, painted clay pots for sale. ... I think parents have 
reached their limit.''

<HEADLINE> Czech Sets Decathlon World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Tomas Dvorak of the Czech Republic  
broke Dan O'Brien's world decathlon record by 103 points Sunday, 
with 8,994 points in a European Cup event. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien set the previous record of 8,891 in 1992 at Talence,  
France, after failing to qualify for the U.S. team for the 
Barcelona Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Dvorak, 27, the 1997 world champion and 1996 Olympic bronze  
medalist, had a previous best of 8,837 points in the 1997 World 
Championships at Athens, Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	Dvorak, competing in 90-degree weather at Strahov stadium, ran  
the final 1,500-meter event in 4 minutes, 37.20 seconds, to break 
the record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only a couple of points and I would have had 9,000, but at  
least I'll have some motivation for next time,'' Dvorak said. 
</P>
<P>
	To tie O'Brien's record, Dvorak needed to run a comfortable  
4:53.87, much slower than his best of 4:29.69. He needed to run 
4:36.34 to break the 9,000 barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conditions were exceptionally good,'' Dvorak said.  
</P>
<P>
	He had a good chance to surpass the 9,000 point barrier, but  
made a mistake in the second lap of the 1,500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We slowed down a bit and we got punished,'' Dvorak said. ``I  
had enough power in the last lap, but it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had performed beyond 9,000 points, I would have had a  
message for O'Brien, but now it's better to shut up,'' Dvorak 
added, sipping champagne. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will take a week off now and then prepare for the World  
Championships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dvorak was 75 points behind O'Brien's record pace after the  
first five events Saturday. The Czech star set three personal bests 
Saturday, with a time of 10.54 seconds in the 100 meters; 25 feet, 
11 inches, in the long jump, and 55-0 in the shot put. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Dvorak won the 110-meter hurdles in 13.73 and had  
personal bests in the discus with a throw of 158-6 and in the 
javelin at 237-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Dvorak set four personal bests en route to the Olympic bronze  
and six bests when he won the world title. He also won the 1995 
European Cup and the Czech 110 hurdles titles in 1994-96 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The record performance makes Dvorak the favorite for the World  
Championships at Seville, Spain, in August. O'Brien was injured for 
the U.S. Championships, and did not qualify for the team. He has 
asked the world governing body to compete as a wild-card entry. 
</P>
<P>
	After clearing 16-0 3/4 in the pole vault, Dvorak still was 76  
points behind O'Brien. He had broken a pole attempting 15-1 and 
scratched a hand, so decided to pass at 16-2 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saved my energy for the javelin,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dvorak then had his big throw in the javelin and moved 72 points  
ahead of O'Brien's record pace going into the 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Dvorak had long been in the shadow of another Czech decathlete,  
Robert Zmelik, the 1992 Olympic gold medalist, before winning the 
world title. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czech Republic won the men's European Cup combined event  
with 25,375 points, ahead of Germany and Spain. Russia won the 
women's title with 18,625 points, ahead of France and Poland.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Spend Holiday on Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOPKINTON, N.H. (AP) -- Despite being opponents in the political  
ring, Republican presidential hopefuls Pat Buchanan, Gary Bauer and 
Sen. Bob Smith appear united. 
</P>
<P>
	They all oppose abortion and gun control, and want to narrow the  
gap between church and state. And, of course, they don't mind 
taking shots at the GOP front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire's Smith said the United States has a history of  
overthrowing people named George, namely King George III of Britain 
during the Revolutionary War. 
</P>
<P>
	``And now there's another guy named George, and we're going to  
overthrow him, too,'' Smith said to wild applause at a Fourth of 
July picnic for several conservative groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Sunday, Bauer accused Bush of bailing out on the  
conservative cause by doing fund-raising in Hollywood last week, 
supporting open trade with China and by giving speeches in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm troubled by the playing into the idea that English is not  
our language. English should be the language of our country,'' 
Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who leads the GOP hopefuls in most polls and has raised  
$36 million, didn't attend the late-afternoon picnic. Last week, 
his campaign said Bush didn't want his supporters to have to pay 
the $25 fee to attend the event, organized by the Coalition of New 
Hampshire Taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush instead headed to Merrimack, where he scooped ice cream for  
supporters. That decision was reflected in the results of a straw 
poll conducted at the picnic. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan swept the contest with 646 votes, or 58 percent. Bush  
got only 15 votes. Bauer placed second with 235, and Smith was 
third with 104. 
</P>
<P>
	Each candidate was allowed to buy up to 75 tickets for  
supporters to attend to the event. The only other candidates who 
got at least 1 percent were Alan Keyes and Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, a crowd of Republican presidential hopefuls descended  
upon Independence Day parades in Amherst and Merrimack. 
</P>
<P>
	In Amherst, Elizabeth Dole launched into a description of the  
horrors she witnessed as president of the American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, a late arrival to the Amherst parade, hopped over a  
fence to reach the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he drew inspiration from Thomas Jefferson and John  
Adams, both of whom died on July 4, 1826. ``Let's say a toast to 
America this July Fourth,'' he said, then quoted Adams: 
``Independence forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of the campaigners were drenched in perspiration by  
mid-morning as the temperature soared close to 100 degrees, but 
Mrs. Dole appeared the coolest in her short-sleeved blouse, skirt 
and white tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Everywhere the candidates turned, they found babies to kiss,  
dogs to pat, hands to shake. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Amherst parade started, Mrs. Dole made her way  
through the crowd to Bush, who later said it was the first time 
they had seen each other since he began campaigning. The two hugged 
and kissed each other on the cheek. 
</P>
<P>
	``She looks great,'' Bush said. ``She looks like she's holding  
up well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Marr, 35, visiting Amherst from Yardley, Pa., was wearing  
a Bill Bradley sticker but said she hasn't decided who will get her 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she enjoyed seeing so many candidates in New Hampshire  
but questioned whether the state with the first primary should get 
so much attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's neat how they meet the people, but there should be more  
emphasis on other states,'' she said. ``It gives one small state 
too much of the spotlight.''

<HEADLINE> Navajo Doc. Draws on Tribal Beliefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- She's a doctor now, but Lori Arviso Alvord  
can still see herself as a little Navajo girl playing on a remote, 
dusty mesa. 
</P>
<P>
	Though a modern surgeon, teacher and administrator, she also  
once sought counsel from a medicine man -- an act that drew on a 
tribal philosophy of balance and harmony that Navajos call 
``walking in beauty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her new book ``The Scalpel and the Silver Bear,'' Alvord  
explores a life steeped in the dual worlds of advanced medicine and 
tribal teachings. 
</P>
<P>
	Lessons of the latter, she says, could help doctors find their  
way back to being healers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am definitely ... on a mission to change the way health care  
is delivered,'' she said. ``It's important to bring Navajo 
philosophy, which I think is incredibly valuable, and not well 
understood, to the larger world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born to a white mother and a Navajo father, Alvord, 40, was  
raised in Crownpoint, N.M., a small Navajo community near the edge 
of the tribe's reservation. She attended Dartmouth College and 
medical school at Stanford University before practicing medicine 
for six years at Gallup Indian Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	She now works as an associate dean at Dartmouth Medical School  
in New Hampshire, and as a general surgeon at Dartmouth-Hitchcock 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	It was while practicing Western medicine at Gallup that Alvord  
realized her Navajo surgical patients needed more than her 
technical ability and clinical skills. 
</P>
<P>
	If patients were to heal, she thought, they needed to be treated  
sensitively and respectfully, and be provided a calm and serene 
atmosphere during their surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
	Her book describes how she gradually incorporated into her  
practice elements of the Navajo belief of walking in beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	Navajos strive to live in harmony and balance with everyone and  
everything else, and they see sickness as a result of things 
falling out of balance, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	To medicine men -- one of whom Alvord consulted when she was  
pregnant -- patients are not seen as just bodies, but as whole 
beings. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvord wants medical students to understand that ``everything  
matters when it comes to looking at a patient -- not just a physical 
ailment, but whether a patient is in harmony or out of harmony with 
the rest of their world,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a holistic approach that shines through in her treatment of  
patients, said Dr. Susan Stuart, a friend and former colleague in 
Gallup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Surgeons have a tendency to focus on the acute problem, and  
not focus on the whole person,'' Stuart said. ``She managed to do 
that and set an excellent example for others to remember.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Navajos, the sick may be the focus of ceremonies that last  
up to seven days. Their entire families and communities mobilize 
around them, providing support. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing like that exists in Western medicine, that I know of,  
to make a person well,'' Alvord said. ``I would actually like to 
see elements of ceremony brought into Western medicine for 
non-Indian patients, because I think they're craving it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alvord acknowledges her ideas run contrary to the time pressures  
of managed care. But such concepts deserve to be discussed, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to sit back and look again at how our health care  
system is set up,'' she said, ``and decide for ourselves: Is that 
the best we could do?''

<HEADLINE> Rail Unions Bickering Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- North America's two biggest rail unions are  
back on a collision course. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Transportation Union and the Brotherhood of  
Locomotive Engineers have folded talks to merge by Jan. 1, and 
their bitter dispute over who gets to represent train workers is 
headed to a federal mediation panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Mediation Board, a federal agency that tries to  
work out rail industry disputes, has scheduled a hearing Tuesday in 
Washington on the UTU's request for a vote by employees of the 
Union Pacific Railroad to decide who will represent them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, which opposes a Union  
Pacific vote, has planned a protest and rally in Washington to 
coincide with the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Cleveland-based BLE's 56,000 members are train  
engineers. The UTU, based in the Cleveland suburb of Lakewood, has 
about 125,000 members -- primarily train conductors, trainmen, 
brakemen and switchmen. Both unions trace their roots to the 
previous century and have members in the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Union Pacific, based in Omaha, Neb., operates west of the  
Mississippi River and has about 22,000 union-covered employees. 
About 14,000 of those workers are loyal to the UTU and 8,000 to the 
BLE. 
</P>
<P>
	The UTU believes the train workers should be considered a single  
craft, represented by the UTU. 
</P>
<P>
	The BLE believes train engineers are part of a distinct craft  
and that the proposed vote amounts to a raid on BLE's Union Pacific 
members. If everyone at Union Pacific votes for their own group to 
represent all the workers, UTU win easily, BLE leaders note. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a dangerous precedent happening here,'' BLE President  
Clarence Monin said. ``UTU is engaging in the equivalent of a 
hostile takeover and attempting to use a government agency to 
grease the skids. If UTU is allowed to steamroll this election, it 
would say there's no difference between a licensed engineer and a 
brakeman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But UTU spokesman David Eden said his group's only goal is to  
unify train workers to create a stronger voice in contract talks 
with the nation's rail companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you'll see that a great proportion of the rank and  
file believes in one union on trains,'' Eden said, ``On the BLE 
side, what you're seeing now are the last gasps of a 19th century 
union that doesn't want to do what's best for its members of the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney sent a letter Thursday  
presidents of all the labor organization's affiliated unions, the 
AFL-CIO's trade and industrial departments and regional directors, 
advising that AFL-CIO's executive council sides with the BLE in the 
dispute. Sweeney also banned any assistance to the UTU in its Union 
Pacific campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The two unions now are at the same point as in March 1998, when  
Monin and UTU President Charles Little met in Washington with 
high-ranking officials of the AFL-CIO, who urged them to stop 
bickering and consider some form of affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
	Merger talks lasted about a year and broke down May 10. The next  
day the UTU asked the National Mediation Board to activate its 
petition for a Union Pacific vote. 
</P>
<P>
	BLE spokesman John Bently said the BLE believes the UTU is  
motivated only by financial problems and that the merger talks 
broke off when the UTU failed to deliver a detailed financial 
report the BLE had demanded by a May 1 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``They use that as an excuse, but it's as bogus as a $7 bill,''  
said Eden, the UTU's spokesman. He said the UTU is financially 
secure, with $44 million in assets and with an insurance 
association that has $32 million in reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Eden blamed the breakdown of the merger talks on Monin's  
reaction to a recall election within the BLE. But Bentley 
disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	That recall, which is still pending, ``doesn't really have  
anything to do with the UTU situation,'' Bentley said.

<HEADLINE> Rock Group Morphine's Singer Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- The lead singer of the Boston rock band Morphine,  
Mark Sandman, has died of a heart attack at a concert outside Rome, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandman, 46, collapsed on stage in front of several thousand  
spectators at a music festival outside Rome on Saturday night just 
before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're devastated,'' band manager Deborah Klein said Sunday.  
``We don't even know what to say. We're all in shock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A doctor tried to revive him but failed, and Sandman was  
pronounced dead in an ambulance en route to a nearby hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandman, known for his deep, murky baritone, played bass, and  
wrote all of Morphine's songs. 
</P>
<P>
	``His music was completely special and unique,'' Klein said in a  
telephone interview from Boston. ``People loved him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said Sandman did not have a heart condition or any other  
major health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Morphine is a guitar-less trio which includes Dana Colley on  
saxophone and Billy Conway on drums.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Kendall Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jason Kendall should be packing his bags for  
the All-Star game. Instead, he probably won't put on a uniform 
again until spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pittsburgh Pirates' selection for the All-Star game will be  
announced Wednesday, and it seemed likely that Kendall would again 
be the choice. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was until Kendall shattered his right ankle in a  
horrifying accident at first base Sunday against Milwaukee that 
will sideline him for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the injury, Kendall seemed destined to become the first  
player in Pirates history to make the All-Star game in three of his 
first four seasons in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop Arky Vaughan came close, debuting in 1932 -- the year  
before the first All-Star game -- before making eight consecutive 
appearances from 1934-1941. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just Kendall's numbers -- .332, 8 homers, 41 RBIs and 22  
steals -- or his improvement behind the plate with each passing 
season. He also has stepped forward to become a leader on a team 
that previously was deficient in leadership and clearly is the most 
respected Pirate among opposing NL players. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Mets catcher Mike Piazza leads in the fan voting for  
the game July 13 at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	With Kendall out, it appears third baseman Ed Sprague (.302, 15  
homers, 49 RBIs) or outfielder Brian Giles (.298, 16 homers, 52 
RBIs) -- will represent the Pirates at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, the Pirates probably will send only one player to  
the All-Star game. They have not had two players selected since 
shortstop Jay Bell and center fielder Andy Van Slyke went in 1993. 
Bell, whose 22 homers lead all major league second basemen, could 
make it again this season for Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Linked to Anti-Minority Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- The man suspected of targeting minorities in  
a Midwest shooting spree once belonged to a white supremacist group 
called the World Church of the Creator, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The leader of the group tried to distance himself from Benjamin  
Nathaniel Smith, saying that to blame the shootings on the church 
was ``the same as people accusing the Pope of being behind all 
those abortion clinic bombings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People have their own free will, they do what they please,''  
church leader Matt Hale said. ``I've always encouraged our members 
to be legal. I've certainly never encouraged violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was a member of the church from June 1998 until May, Hale  
said. Hale said Smith never gave any predilection for violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I spoke to him he never gave any inkling of being able to  
do this,'' said Hale, who runs the organization from his parents' 
home in a middle-class neighborhood in East Peoria. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsletters, a Web site and other church literature advocate a  
white racial holy war on ``mud races,'' blacks and Jews to further 
the expansion of the white race. Most group literature also include 
notices that violence is not condoned. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloomington Police Chief Jim Kennedy said the church was  
involved in the distribution of anti-minority and anti-Semitic 
literature there last year when Smith was a student at Indiana 
University. Kennedy said the material ``certainly alarmed the 
people in this community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bloomington Mayor John Fernandez said city officials and  
authorities were ``very aware'' of Smith and his involvement with 
the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had substantial briefings from the FBI and other police  
agencies to keep apprised of that group and find whether there's 
any kind of a threat,'' Fernandez said. ``Some of the hate 
literature and the calls to action on their Web site really walk a 
very fine line between just ignorant speech and inciting harmful 
actions, violent conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings came on the heels of a decision by an Illinois  
state hearing board to reject Hale's appeal for a law license. The 
board said Hale's beliefs and character make him ill-suited to 
practice law, and unable to follow the state's rules of conduct for 
lawyers.

 *J. Curtis Counts    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- J. Curtis Counts, a longtime labor negotiator  
credited with expanding the Federal Mediation and Conciliation 
Service's efforts to settle labor conflicts, died Wednesday. He was 
83. 
</P>
<P>
	Counts negotiated with many well known organized labor figures,  
including Teamsters leaders Jimmy Hoffa, Jackie Presser and Frank 
Fitzsimmons, and George Meany of the AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
	Counts had a 30-year career at Douglas Aircraft, rising to vice  
president of employee relations and negotiating all contracts with 
the unions. 
</P>
<P>
	But he left in 1969 to work for his old friend, Richard Nixon.  
</P>
<P>
	Counts became head of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation  
Service, which was set up by Congress in 1947 as an independent 
agency to promote stable labor-management relations. At the post, 
he was instrumental in expanding the agency's role in settling 
labor disputes before they became strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	He left the agency in 1973, and later did consulting work on  
labor-management issues. 

</P>

 *Dick Sullivan    	
</P>
<P>
	MASON CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Dick Sullivan, columnist and former city  
editor at the Mason City Globe-Gazette, died Friday in Liberty, 
Mo., after a lengthy illness. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan was city editor of the Globe-Gazette from 1974 to 1986  
before he retired and returned to his native Missouri. He also 
wrote a regular column, ``I Don't Know, Too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He began as a reporter at the Globe-Gazette in 1960 following  
graduation from the University of Missouri School of Journalism. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the Globe-Gazette courthouse reporter and assistant  
sports editor until 1967, when he became general assignment and 
city affairs reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970, Sullivan won the top Iowa Associated Press Managing  
Editors award for a story on life inside a hospital psychiatric 
unit. Sullivan admitted himself to the mental health unit to get a 
firsthand view of treatment, dispelling many misconceptions of 
psychiatric inpatient treatment of that time. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, three sons and a daughter.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks opened sharply higher Monday following  
a Bank of Japan survey showing business sentiment has improved. The 
dollar gained against the yen amid intervention by the central 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 68.69 points,  
or 0.38 percent, to 18,001.16 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
On Friday, the average closed up 71.72 points at 17,932.47 -- the 
index's highest finish since Sept. 29, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.79 yen, up 0.71 yen from late Friday in  
Tokyo and above its level late Friday in New York of 121.01 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank's closely-watched ``tankan'' survey said that  
business sentiment among large manufacturers had improved over the 
past three months -- the biggest advance since August 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were also encouraged as companies predicted that  
optimism would improve further by the time of the next survey in 
three months, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, big gains on Wall Street last week also contributed  
to the sharp rise in Tokyo stocks, traders said. In New York on 
Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record-high 
11,139.24 points, up 72.82. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, a top Finance Ministry official confirmed  
market rumors that the Bank of Japan intervened Monday to prop up 
the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we took action in the markets,'' said Haruhiko Kuroda,  
head of the international bureau at the ministry, after being asked 
to comment on market rumors of yen-selling and dollar-buying 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuroda described premature yen strength as ``improper.''  
</P>
<P>
	Japanese authorities fear that excessive strength in the yen  
could damage prospects for Japan's recession-hit economy, which has 
shown recent signs of improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 125.08 yen, up from  
123.86 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government bond fell to  
1.6100 percent from Friday's finish of 1.6600 percent, driving its 
price up to 101.66 yen from 101.21 yen.

<HEADLINE>  India Grabs Strategic Kashmir Peak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DRAS, India (AP) -- After a 10-hour battle in rain and fog,  
Indian soldiers captured a strategic Himalayan peak held by 
Pakistan-based fighters Sunday, marking a major turning point in 
fighting in the divided Kashmir region, military officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	India made its claim before Pakistan's prime minister was to  
meet with President Clinton in Washington in a U.S. attempt to 
defuse tensions over Kashmir. India's leader declined an invitation 
for separate talks with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington and other world powers fear the fighting in Kashmir  
could turn into a wider conflict between the rival South Asia 
neighbors, who last year became the world's newest nuclear powers 
and have already fought two wars over the mountain territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``All agreed the situation is dangerous and could escalate if  
not resolved quickly,'' the White House said in a statement about 
the visit by Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and a call made by Clinton 
late Saturday to Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. 
</P>
<P>
	India accuses Pakistan of sending hundreds of fighters -- among  
them Pakistani troops -- across the cease-fire line dividing Kashmir 
between the two countries to seize mountain positions on the Indian 
side in early May. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan denies that its troops have crossed the 1972 cease-fire  
line. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will win this war,'' Vajpayee told a gathering of party  
workers Sunday, using that term for the first time to describe what 
the military has called a ``localized conflict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fighting late Saturday and early Sunday, troops seized a  
major guerrilla position on the top of 16,500-foot Tiger Hill after 
days of surrounding the peak, Indian officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-hour battle was punctuated by the roar of multiple-rocket  
launchers and artillery shells bursting in the cloudy night sky. 
Only a half-dozen guerrillas remained, firing automatic rifles from 
behind boulders, when Indian troops scrambled over the last rock 
outcropping and overran the fortress, local commanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian flag is ``absolutely right on top'' of Tiger Hill,  
military spokesman Col. Bikram Singh told journalists in New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
	The position on the peak allowed the entrenched fighters to  
oversee the only highway through Indian-controlled Kashmir, and its 
capture ``is a turning point,'' Singh said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will facilitate the eviction of the enemy from other  
positions in the Dras sector,'' he said, referring to the town 
closest to the main part of the front. 
</P>
<P>
	Pockets of guerrilla fighters still held lower promontories of  
the mountain, he said. Fierce fighting was continuing elsewhere 
along the 85-mile battlefront, particularly in the Batalik sector 
to the east, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerrillas are still holding a few scattered areas overseeing  
the highway -- which is the main route for civilian and military 
traffic in the region -- but they will ``be cleared soon,'' Singh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to fight a long and hard battle for this. It is an  
important win for the Indian army,'' Defense Minister George 
Fernandes told soldiers in the northern city of Amritsar. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pakistan, Sayed Salauddin, head of the United Jehad Council --  
an alliance of 14 Muslim guerrilla groups, including some that are 
involved in the Kashmir fighting -- denied Indian soldiers had 
captured Tiger Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indians are resorting to heavy artillery fire and air strikes  
on our fighters, but they are holding on to their positions,'' 
Salauddin said in a telephone interview from Muzaffarabad, the 
capital of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	Singh said 251 Indian soldiers have been killed and 420 wounded  
in more than seven weeks of fighting. He also has said 467 
Pakistani soldiers and more than 120 guerrillas have been killed. 
The casualty figures could not be independently verified. 
</P>
<P>
	India's premier, Vajpayee, has rejected any dialogue with  
Pakistan over the fighting or the wider issue of Kashmir's status 
until the fighters are ejected from the Indian-controlled zone. 
Both countries claim the entire Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	In their 10-minute conversation late Saturday with Clinton,  
Vajpayee turned down the invitation from the president for talks in 
Washington, Foreign Ministry spokesman Raminder Singh Jassal told 
reporters. The time was ``not convenient'' for a visit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, Russia, Japan, Britain, Germany, France and  
other Western nations have dismissed Pakistan's denials that it is 
involved with the fighters and urged it to withdraw the forces. 
</P>
<P>
	India says the fighters consist of Pakistani troops leading  
guerrillas from Islamic groups that have been fighting for 
Kashmir's independence from majority Hindu India.

<HEADLINE> Israel Shocked by Chicago Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- The shooting of six Orthodox Jews in Chicago in  
a suspected hate crime was front-page news in Israel on Sunday, 
with commentators expressing concern over violence motivated by 
anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
	A black man also was killed in Saturday's attack, and an Asian  
couple was fired at but unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those wounded in Saturday's attack, 34-year-old Gideon  
Sapir, is an Israeli citizen, formerly a resident of the West Bank 
settlement of Alon Shvut. From his hospital bed in Chicago, he told 
Israeli army radio that he had just left synagogue services with 
the other victims when they were fired on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as the shooting started, I pushed my son who was just  
beside me and I laid on him,'' Sapir said. ``My daughter was behind 
me. The entire event took two or three seconds in which he shot 
five, six or seven bullets and then disappeared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sapir was in good condition. His life and those of the other  
five Jews were not in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect has not been apprehended. Chicago police said they  
did not yet have the evidence to prove the shooting was a hate 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting overshadowed political talks leading up to the  
installation of the new government in the Israeli media. Newspapers 
carried front-page headlines and radio and television newscasts led 
with accounts of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi David Rosen, head of the Anti-Defamation League in Israel,  
told Israel radio that anti-Semitism has actually been on the 
decline in the United States but that at the same time the severity 
of individual hate crimes was growing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see from these incidents that there is still enough hate  
among the public that needs a lot of awareness and a lot of 
tracking and clear and strong legislation,'' Rosen said.

jurors. The trial is not expected to last more than seven days. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge moved the trial 200 miles to Bartow, 40 miles  
southeast of Tampa, for its large courtroom and because the crime 
has not generated as much publicity as in Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we could find any juror without some knowledge  
of this case,'' Arnold has said. He banned attorneys, families, 
witnesses and police from discussing the case. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 3, Maddie had been outside playing for 30 minutes -- some  
of the time chipping golf balls -- when her mother, Sheila Clifton, 
called her home to practice the piano. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddie never responded.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the next few days, volunteers handed out fliers and  
pictures of the missing girl, even distributing fliers and yellow 
ribbons to 70,000 fans at a Jacksonville Jaguars-Cincinnati Bengals 
NFL game. 
</P>
<P>
	A week after Maddie's disappearance, Melissa Phillips saw liquid  
oozing from underneath her son's waterbed, pulled aside the frame 
and saw Maddie's feet. She ran outside and grabbed a police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy showed Maddie had been beaten over the head and  
stabbed at least nine times in the chest and twice in the neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Joshua gave them a statement incriminating himself.  
</P>
<P>
	But his attorney Richard Nichols, said Joshua's statement was  
coerced. The boy was not given an opportunity to first talk with a 
lawyer, although he had asked to do so, Nichols said, and Joshua 
was intimidated by detectives. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Nichols wants the statement presented to jurors. He  
said Joshua suffers from an unspecified mental dysfunction, and he 
has filed documents indicating he plans to use that to defend his 
client.

<HEADLINE> Jarrett Builds Winston Cup Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- With about five laps to go, Kelley  
Jarrett and the kids were getting antsy. They wanted to hurry down 
to victory lane. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we heard on the radio that Dale Earnhardt was trying to  
take the lead,'' she said. ``We thought it would look pretty 
foolish if we're down there waiting and we didn't win the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No need to worry. Nobody, not even Earnhardt, could catch  
Kelley's husband for the victory at the Pepsi 400 on Saturday 
night. And the next question is: Can anyone cut into Dale Jarrett's 
commanding lead in the Winston Cup points standings? 
</P>
<P>
	The victory gave one of stock car racing's most popular drivers  
a 177-point lead over Bobby Labonte heading into the second half of 
the season. Not since 1992, when Alan Kulwicki overtook Davey 
Allison in the last race of the season, has someone leading at the 
halfway point failed to win the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a good stat to know,'' said Jarrett, in pursuit of his  
first series title. ``I don't want to end that string. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without sounding cocky or overconfident, if we can continue  
doing what we've done, they'll have trouble catching us. But it 
only takes one race to make this a close battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, however, has been the most unlikely candidate to throw  
in a stinker this season. 
</P>
<P>
	His only bad effort came on opening week in the Daytona 500, an  
event he won in 1993 and 1996. This time, Jarrett was involved in a 
multicar accident that resulted in a 37th-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he has finished out of the top 10 only once, a  
16-race stretch of consistency unlike any the 15-year veteran can 
recall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't remember being involved in anything like it,'' Jarrett  
said. ``We've overcome some things where we shouldn't have finished 
in the top 10 and we did. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done things we need to do to win championships. There  
have been days we needed all 500 miles, or all 600 miles, to get 
the car right. But we continued to work on it and get it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This race was won thanks to crew chief Todd Parrott's decision  
to turn the last pit stop into a quick ``gas and go.'' On lap 144, 
Jarrett made a four-second stop -- maybe not even that long -- that 
gave him just enough fuel to complete the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming out of the pits, Jarrett opened up a big lead on Rusty  
Wallace and the rest of the field. A pair of yellow flags tightened 
the gap, however. And when the final yellow came out at the end of 
lap 157, it was Jarrett trying to hold off Earnhardt for one more 
lap around the 2 1/2-mile tri-oval. 
</P>
<P>
	He did, then ran the last two laps of the race under yellow. So  
slim was the margin that Jarrett's car ran out of gasoline on his 
victory lap. It left some doubt as to whether he could have held 
Earnhardt off had the yellow not come out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it would have been any different,'' Jarrett  
said. ``Earnhardt wasn't getting much of a push from anybody, so I 
was able to keep him kind of where I needed to keep him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt disagreed. He had taken on two new tires on his final  
pit stop. It helped him move from sixth to second in the eight laps 
before the final yellow came out. 
</P>
<P>
	At the finish, he was bearing down on Jarrett, looking for his  
second straight victory on a restrictor-plate track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think within a few more laps we would have gotten by  
Jarrett,'' Earnhardt said. ``He might have run out of gas, because 
he was really close. That caution really helped him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's one of those great debates that will linger for years to  
come. 
</P>
<P>
	And now, the drivers are hard-pressed to make the chase after  
Jarrett over the rest of 1999 even half as interesting.

<HEADLINE> Ump Leaves Game With Heat Exhaustion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Home plate umpire Greg Kosc left Sunday's game  
between the New York Yankees and the Baltimore Orioles in the 
seventh inning because of heat exhaustion and was taken to a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosc, 50 and listed at 255 pounds, drew criticism from Yankees  
catcher Jorge Posada, who had argued with him an inning earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is the guys are not in shape,'' Posada said.  
``I understand it's hot, but you have to be able to go through the 
whole game. They're not prepared, they're not in shape. It's a 
shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The umpiring crew had left the ballpark by the time Posada made  
his comments. 
</P>
<P>
	It was cloudy and 89 degrees at gametime, and the temperature  
climbed to 94 after the sun came out in the middle innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosc was sweating profusely on the humid afternoon, and umpired  
much of the game with a white towel around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	He left just after B.J. Surhoff's grand slam put the Orioles  
ahead 7-3, talking to crew chief Larry Barnett, who was umpiring at 
third, and then walking off the field with a Yankees trainer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosc, a 24-year veteran of the American League, was given fluids  
in the umpires' room and taken to Columbia-Presbyterian Medical 
Center as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	An inning before Kosc left the game, he called Posada out on  
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't called it all day, then he's going to call it  
because it's hot?'' Posada said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Kosc left, play stopped for 10 minutes while second  
baseman Ed Hickox went inside to put on a chest protector, then 
moved behind the plate.

<HEADLINE> Ump Leaves Game With Heat Exhaustion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When the home plate umpire left Sunday's game  
between Baltimore and New York because of heat exhaustion, Yankees 
catcher Jorge Posada had a beef. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is the guys are not in shape,'' Posada said  
after Greg Kosc, a 24-year AL veteran, was taken to a hospital on a 
humid afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosc, 50 and listed at 255 pounds, had been sweating profusely  
during the hot and humid afternoon. He left in the seventh, one 
inning after he called Posada out on strikes, which caused an 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand it's hot, but you have to be able to go through  
the whole game,'' Posada said. ``They're not prepared, they're not 
in shape. It's a shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The umpiring crew had left the ballpark by the time Posada made  
his comments after the Yankees' 7-3 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greg passed the required physical examination. He is a weight  
lifter,'' said AL president Gene Budig, who watched the game on 
television at his New Jersey home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was dehydrated. He's been hospitalized as a precautionary  
measure,'' Budig said. ``We are taking no chances with his 
health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The weight of umpires is a sensitive topic in baseball. NL  
umpire John McSherry, who weighed more than 325 pounds, died of a 
heart attack on the field in Cincinnati on the opening day of the 
1996 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Gregg, another NL umpire, repeatedly battled a weight  
problem and currently is on leave. 
</P>
<P>
	It was cloudy and 89 degrees at gametime, and the temperature  
climbed to 94 after the sun came out in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosc umpired much of the game with a white towel around his  
neck. 
</P>
<P>
	``He started hitting that wet towel early,'' Yankees manager Joe  
Torre said. ``They always tell you stay away from it until later in 
the game, because as good as the feeling is, the letdown when it 
wears off is greater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kosc left just after B.J. Surhoff's grand slam put the Orioles  
ahead 7-3, talking to crew chief Larry Barnett, who was umpiring at 
third, and then walking off the field with a Yankees trainer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosc was given fluids in the umpires' room and taken to  
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	An inning before Kosc left the game, he and Posada argued  
following the called third strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't called it all day, then he's going to call it  
because it's hot?'' Posada said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Kosc left, play stopped for 10 minutes while second base  
umpire Ed Hickox went inside to put on a chest protector, then 
moved behind the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees starter Roger Clemens said the heat had its biggest  
effect on the catchers and the plate umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys you have to worry about are the guys wearing the  
extra gear,'' Clemens said. ``That's 13 pounds or so of stuff. It's 
especially tough on them.''

<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Ante Razov scored two goals to lead the Chicago  
Fire to a 2-1 win over the Dallas Burn at the Cotton Bowl on Sunday 
night in Major League Soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago (9-7) moved into a tie with Dallas (9-9) for second  
place in the Western Conference, just one point behind first-place 
Colorado. Colorado lost 3-0 to Columbus on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fire won both games of the weekend series against Dallas,  
after also defeating the Burn 2-1 in a shootout at Soldier Field on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Razov, scoreless in his previous 12 matches, put Chicago on the  
board with a goal in the fifth minute, blasting a shot past Burn 
goalkeeper Mark Dodd from 25 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas tied the game just nine minutes later as midfielder  
Ritchie Kotschau kicked the ball into his own net. 
</P>
<P>
	Razov tallied the game-winner in the 35th minute, with an assist  
from Peter Nowak. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas played without striker Dante Washington, who missed the  
match with a medial collateral ligament sprain in his right knee.

<HEADLINE> Search On for Boat Crash Victims </HEADLINE>

<P>
	BAYPORT, Minn. (AP) -- Divers returned to the St. Croix River on  
Sunday searching for as many as eight victims of a pleasure boat 
collision known to have killed two men. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonar identified three objects in about 35-40 feet of water. It  
wasn't clear what the objects were. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as eight people may be missing, said Washington County  
Sheriff Jim Frank. Two fatalities were confirmed Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just the prospect of anyone making it out of this crash alive,  
the percentages aren't very good that someone survived,'' Frank 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two boats were apparently traveling toward Hudson, Wis., on  
Saturday when they collided. The larger powerboat was so new it 
wasn't registered. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators from the National Transportation Safety  
Board were aiding in the probe.

<HEADLINE> Posh Spice Marries Soccer Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Spice Girl Victoria Adams -- better known  
as Posh Spice -- wed English soccer hero David Beckham on Sunday at 
a 15th century Irish castle in a ceremony shielded from the prying 
eyes of the press and fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Posh Spice reportedly wore a diamond and gold coronet that  
outshone royalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 29 close family and friends -- including the three other  
members of the British pop group, Baby Spice Emma Bunton, Sporty 
Spice Melanie Chisholm and Scary Spice Melanie Brown -- witnessed 
the wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	Geri Halliwell, the former Ginger Spice, who quit the group 13  
months ago, was not there. In pouring rain, she sang at an outdoor 
concert to a 100,000-strong crowd in London's Hyde Park, held to 
benefit Prince Charles' charity, the Prince's Trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Strict security surrounded the wedding, prompted by a deal  
reportedly worth $1.6 million giving the British celebrity magazine 
OK! exclusive rights to what it called the wedding of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	A long white tent shielded guests and the couple from other  
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	What Adams, 25, and Beckham, 24, wore for the occasion was a  
closely guarded secret -- but publicists offered other tidbits. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop Paul Colton of the Church of Ireland performed the  
ceremony. Adams, reflecting ``girl power,'' didn't promise to obey 
Beckham in the vows. The couple's four-month-old son, Brooklyn, 
attended. 
</P>
<P>
	An 18-piece orchestra played a selection of Spice Girl hits at  
the reception for 236 guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Sir Elton John, who had been invited to perform at the  
reception, had to cancel his appearance, the couple's spokeswoman 
said. The British rock legend was suffering from heat stroke after 
getting too much sun during a concert tour in Italy, she said, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams wore a $160,000 gold-and-diamond coronet, The Sunday Times  
reported, saying it outdid the tiara that Queen Elizabeth II lent 
to her newest daughter-in-law, the former Sophie Rhys-Jones. She 
married Prince Edward last month.

<HEADLINE>  Levy Named Israel Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak picked  
as his foreign minister Sunday the man who quit the same job in 
disgruntlement under Barak's predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of the appointment came from David Levy, who emerged from  
talks with Barak on the formation of the new Cabinet and told 
reporters he had been given the post in the new government, 
expected to take office Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy, a top official in Barak's One Israel party, had quit as  
foreign minister in January 1998 to protest Netanyahu's hard-line 
policies toward the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment had been expected. Several other politicians  
have announced publicly they have been promised portfolios in the 
Barak government, but Levy was the first to specify the job he had 
been given. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was clear two days ago, yesterday and we concluded it and  
he informed me about it now,'' Levy told reporters as he left the 
meeting. ``I'm very happy that we will be able to work in 
harmony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Moroccan-born Levy is fluent in Arabic and French, but some  
Israeli commentators have questioned his fitness to serve as 
foreign minister because he cannot speak English. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy's decision to withdraw his Gesher faction from Netanyahu's  
government left it paralyzed, with only 61 members in the 120-seat 
Knesset, the parliament. Netanyahu announced elections a few months 
later in large part due to that gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Yediot Aharanoth newspaper reported Sunday that  
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will meet on July 12, 
the first talks Barak has scheduled with a foreign leader after the 
Knesset is expected to approve his government on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two will meet at the Erez border crossing between Israel and  
the Gaza Strip, the daily reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak's office confirmed Friday that the premier-elect had  
called Arafat and the two had agreed to meet soon but spokesman 
David Ziso would not say when. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak assured Arafat in the call that he would follow in the  
footsteps of the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who signed the 
first Israeli-Palestinian agreement with Arafat in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	During the three years of Netanyahu's rule, peace talks with the  
Palestinians proceeded in fits and starts and then were frozen by 
him in December last year. He had also refused to renew 
negotiations with the Syrians. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak spokesman David Ziso would only say that no decision had  
yet been made on a meeting with Arafat and no date was set. 
</P>
<P>
	The prime minister-elect has promised to quickly advance in the  
peace process on all tracks. The coalition he cobbled together of 
religious, secular, dovish, centrist and nationalist parties 
comprising 75 members in the Knesset has agreed to back his 
moderate views on the negotiations with Israel's Arab neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Indians Lose Fryman for Two Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Indians third baseman Travis Fryman is expected  
to be sidelined two months after injuring his knee in a collision 
at first base. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury, a partially torn ligament in the right knee,  
happened Saturday against the Kansas City Royals. The Indians 
placed Fryman on the 15-day disabled list Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not that frustrated,'' Fryman said. ``I'm more aggravated.  
It is just the result of playing and it's a tough break. Nobody's 
to blame. It was just one of those strange plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman became entangled with first baseman Jeremy Giambi during  
the sixth inning of a 9-5 win in the second game of a doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman grounded out to third baseman Joe Randa, whose throw  
caused Giambi to reach to his right. Fryman ran into Giambi and 
straddled the first baseman for an instant. He twisted his knee 
when he landed. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman was sidelined June 16-25 with lower back spasms. He is  
batting .259 with eight homers and 42 RBIs in 62 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Infielder John McDonald was recalled from Triple A Buffalo to

<HEADLINE> Suspect in Shooting Spree Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALEM, Ill. (AP) -- The white supremacist suspected of targeting  
minorities in a deadly drive-by shooting spree in Indiana and 
Illinois shot and killed himself late Sunday during a high-speed 
chase by police, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin Nathaniel Smith dumped his blue Ford Taurus at a truck  
stop in this southern Illinois town and carjacked a van, said Doug 
Garrison, an FBI spokesman in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 21, shot himself in the chin as police chased him, he  
said. His car crashed off the road and he was pronounced dead at a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI officials said they must double-check fingerprints to make  
sure the body was Smith's. 
</P>
<P>
	But two guns found with the body were consistent with the  
shootings and the body had a tattoo on the chest that said 
``Sabbath Breaker'' -- which Smith was said to have. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith had been the subject of a two-state search following  
shootings that began Friday in Chicago when a black former college 
basketball coach was fatally shot and six Orthodox Jews were 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooter fired at Asians and blacks in two Illinois cities on  
Saturday and fatally shot a Korean man Sunday outside a church in 
Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Sunday, one of Smith's ex-girlfriends told the Daily  
Illini, the student newspaper at the University of Illinois, that 
the timing of the shootings was not a coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is his Independence Day from the government, from  
everything,'' said Elizabeth Sahr, who said she had a one-year 
relationship with Smith. ``He is not going to stop until he's shot 
dead. He's not going to surrender. He's not going to give up until 
he leaves this world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was a member of the World Church of the Creator, a white  
supremacist organization, and often distributed anti-minority and 
anti-Semitic literature while a student in Bloomington at Indiana 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	The church, based in East Peoria, Ill., is led by Matt Hale, who  
said Smith was a member from June 1998 until May and never showed 
any predilection for violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I spoke to him he never gave any inkling of being able to  
do this,'' Hale said before Smith took his life. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Harlan Loeb, Midwest counsel for the Anti-Defamation  
League, said his organization has had Smith ``on our radar screen 
for quite some time, which is particularly tragic for someone so 
young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the gunman wounded six Orthodox Jews leaving  
synagogue on the Jewish Sabbath in Chicago. The same shooter is 
believed to have killed Ricky Byrdsong, the black former basketball 
coach at Northwestern University, as he walked with his children in 
nearby Skokie, and fired at an Asian-American couple in the suburb 
of Northbrook. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on Saturday, police said, the same blue Taurus was seen at  
shootings in Springfield and Champaign-Urbana. In the first attack, 
the gunman fired on two black men, but no one was hit, Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 12 hours later, six men of Asian descent were standing on  
a corner near the University of Illinois when three or four shots 
were fired, Hayes said. A 22-year-old graduate student was hit in 
the leg and was in serious condition Sunday, Urbana police 
spokesman Michael Metzler said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's attack, Won-Joon Yoon was hit twice in the back and  
killed outside the church. Witnesses told police that after firing 
into the crowd, the shooter sped off, running several lights. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was apparently parked at the corner and waited for these  
people to come out of church and then fired,'' Bloomington Police 
Chief Jim Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes said .380-caliber shell casings -- the same kind found in  
some of the Chicago shootings -- were also found at the scene of the 
Indiana church attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year on the Fourth of July, Smith tucked white supremacist  
fliers under windshields around Bloomington. Asked whether the 
shootings this weekend were related to Independence Day, 
Bloomington Police Capt. William Parker said, ``It raises questions 
in our minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parker said Smith passed out similar hate literature when  
enrolled at the University of Illinois. The Daily Illini reported 
that Smith attended the school from 1996 through 1998 before being 
expelled. Urbana police said he had been in trouble with campus 
police, including for drug possession. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith attended Indiana University from the summer of 1998  
through the spring of 1999, and he is believed to have moved to the 
Chicago are in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``The towns he's hit, he's either lived there or been enrolled  
in college at each of the towns,'' Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the men wounded in Friday night's shootings, who asked  
that his name not be used for fear of retribution, said he looked 
into the gunman's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got the sense he was enjoying himself,'' the man told the  
Chicago Sun-Times from his hospital bed. ``He had this predator 
look to him.''

<HEADLINE> Alibi in 1963 Church Bombing Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- A former Ku Klux Klansman suspected in a  
1963 Alabama church bombing that killed four black girls claimed he 
watched wrestling on TV at home the night before the explosion, but 
The Clarion-Ledger reported Sunday no such program aired. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Frank Cherry, now 69 and living in Mabank, Texas, has been  
questioned by a federal grand jury considering new charges in the 
bombing, which tore through a church wall on a Sunday morning and 
illustrated to the nation the depth of racial hatred in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, Cherry's granddaughter told the grand jury he had  
bragged about helping with the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Cherry repeatedly has denied any role in the crime. The only  
person convicted was a Klan member, Robert Chambliss, who died in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The dynamite bomb planted outside the Sixteenth Street Baptist  
Church exploded on the morning of Sept. 15, 1963, killing Denise 
McNair, 11, and 14-year-olds Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson and 
Addie Mae Collins. Authorities believe the device was planted the 
night before. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with the Clarion-Ledger at his Texas home,  
Cherry said he was at a Birmingham sign shop -- several blocks from 
the church -- the night before the bombing, but left about 9:45 p.m. 
to get home to watch live studio wrestling on WBRC-TV. The retired 
truck driver said the 10 p.m. program was a Saturday-night ritual 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always made sure I was home for wrestling,'' Cherry said.  
</P>
<P>
	But the newspaper reported there were no wrestling programs on  
Birmingham TV stations in September 1963. According to local 
newspaper TV listings for Sept. 14, 1963, WBRC aired ``Films of the 
Fifties'' at 10 p.m. and WAPI-TV aired ``Route 66.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to explain, Cherry said: ``Something's wrong. Wrestling  
was on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cherry didn't mention the wrestling program in 1963 statements  
to the FBI, according to reports obtained by the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said a friend of the family, Flora Thomas, was at  
his home taking care of his wife, who had cancer, the night in 
question. He obtained an affidavit from Ms. Thomas in 1980 stating 
that he was home watching TV the night before the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never missed wrestling on TV,'' the affidavit said. ``I  
stayed up most of the night due to sickness in the family. Bobby 
never left the house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Doug Jones, whose Birmingham office is handling  
the reopened investigation, declined to comment on Cherry's alibi.

<HEADLINE>  Ump Leaves Game With Heat Exhaustion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When the home plate umpire left Sunday's game  
between Baltimore and New York because of heat exhaustion, Yankees 
catcher Jorge Posada had a beef. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is the guys are not in shape,'' Posada said  
after Greg Kosc, a 24-year AL veteran, was taken to a hospital on a 
humid afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosc, 50 and listed at 255 pounds, had been sweating profusely  
during the hot and humid afternoon. He left in the seventh, one 
inning after he called Posada out on strikes, which caused an 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand it's hot, but you have to be able to go through  
the whole game,'' Posada said. ``They're not prepared, they're not 
in shape. It's a shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The umpiring crew had left the ballpark by the time Posada made  
his comments after the Yankees' 7-3 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greg passed the required physical examination. He is a weight  
lifter,'' said AL president Gene Budig, who watched the game on 
television at his New Jersey home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was dehydrated. He's been hospitalized as a precautionary  
measure,'' Budig said. ``We are taking no chances with his 
health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The weight of umpires is a sensitive topic in baseball. NL  
umpire John McSherry, who weighed more than 325 pounds, died of a 
heart attack on the field in Cincinnati on the opening day of the 
1996 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Gregg, another NL umpire, repeatedly battled a weight  
problem and currently is on leave. 
</P>
<P>
	It was cloudy and 89 degrees at gametime, and the temperature  
climbed to 94 after the sun came out in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosc umpired much of the game with a white towel around his  
neck. 
</P>
<P>
	``He started hitting that wet towel early,'' Yankees manager Joe  
Torre said. ``They always tell you stay away from it until later in 
the game, because as good as the feeling is, the letdown when it 
wears off is greater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kosc left just after B.J. Surhoff's grand slam put the Orioles  
ahead 7-3, talking to crew chief Larry Barnett, who was umpiring at 
third, and then walking off the field with a Yankees trainer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosc was given fluids in the umpires' room and taken to  
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	An inning before Kosc left the game, he and Posada argued  
following the called third strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't called it all day, then he's going to call it  
because it's hot?'' Posada said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Kosc left, play stopped for 10 minutes while second base  
umpire Ed Hickox went inside to put on a chest protector, then 
moved behind the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees starter Roger Clemens said the heat had its biggest  
effect on the catchers and the plate umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys you have to worry about are the guys wearing the  
extra gear,'' Clemens said. ``That's 13 pounds or so of stuff. It's 
especially tough on them.''

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- In the latest attack on Venezuela's  
president, a leading writer says Hugo Chavez is imposing 
authoritarian rule on one of Latin America's longest-running 
democracies. 
</P>
<P>
	Arturo Uslar Pietri, one of the nation's most famous writers,  
criticized Chavez's promotion of 34 military officials without 
congressional approval as required by law and his declaration last 
week that Congress should be temporarily shut down. He described 
the president's actions as a ``coup d'etat,'' said the El Universal 
newspaper Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chavez, a former army paratrooper who led a failed 1992 coup  
attempt in the name of the poor, shot back at his critics Sunday, 
describing them as part of a corrupt political elite that has

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The Brazilian government plans to  
sell off billions of dollars' worth of state properties, ranging 
from buildings and empty lots to beaches and ecological reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	The state, which owns three million properties worth an  
estimated $400 billion, will sell off as many assets as it can to 
the highest bidder at auctions later this year, the newspaper O 
Globo reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrative Secretary Claudia Costin, who ordered a study to  
evaluate each property, said the buyers will not be allowed to 
erect buildings on lands that are now ecological reserves.

	Since President Fernando Henrique Cardoso assumed power in 1995,  
privatizations have been a major part of his economic policies. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gov't Agencies Fight for Forfeitures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When Arkansas state troopers found $3 million in cash in trucker  
Roberto Zamarripa's cargo, they declared the ``tainted'' money 
property of the county. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time county prosecutors got to court, they found another  
claimant: the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress weighs whether to make it harder to seize citizens'  
property, federal and local agencies fight in courtrooms throughout 
the country over the spoils of asset forfeiture. The disputes 
reveal this incentive: Cash-strapped law enforcement agencies seek 
not mere punishment, but money as well, from citizens with property 
that police think might be linked to crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forfeiture laws have run amok,'' says Steven Kessler, a trial  
lawyer who once headed the asset forfeiture unit of the Bronx 
district attorney's office. ``The focus is no longer on combatting 
crime. ... It's on fund-raising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Arkansas case, Zamarripa made no claim to the money. A  
local prosecutor sued to recover it from a federal agency that 
``adopted'' the forfeiture from cooperative state police. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the Arkansas Highway Police wanted the $2.8 million  
they'd get under a federal forfeiture. Under a state seizure, 
they'd recoup only $250,000. The yearlong feud ended in March with 
Crittenden County keeping the cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The disputes between governments occur because many states --  
like Arkansas, Missouri and Kansas -- give law enforcement agencies 
a smaller slice of forfeited money than the 50 percent to 85 
percent they'd get from Washington. In many states they get only 
expenses -- an officer's gas or overtime, for example -- for their 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers who seized Zamarripa's cash had a good reason for going  
to the feds, Arkansas Highway Police spokesman Randy Ort says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We turned it over to the federal government because it was an  
interstate case,'' he says, noting that the driver was just passing 
through. ``We don't do that to raise money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas is not the only place where government rivals face off  
in court. 
</P>
<P>
	In Missouri, state law requires that money seized in the state  
go for education. But local police often turn over forfeited money 
to the federal government in exchange for a larger slice of the 
cash, saying the money isn't actually ``seized'' until they pass it 
on to federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
	To stop that, the Kansas City Board of Education filed a  
class-action lawsuit earlier this year that asks Missouri law 
enforcement agencies to pay back all the money they've received 
from federal forfeitures since 1986. Since 1993, with the enactment 
of new forfeiture laws, police in Missouri took in more than $32 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they do is engage in an end-run around the legislature's  
intentions,'' says Roger Pilon, legal affairs director of the 
Center for Constitutional Studies at the libertarian Cato Institute 
in Washington. ``It signifies the greed that is just below the 
surface in the entire forfeiture arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In one case last year, a judge fumed that federal agencies were  
usurping states' rights. Judge James B. Loken of the 8th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals questioned whether federal agencies were 
``using their extensive forfeiture powers to frustrate the fiscal 
policy of states such as Missouri.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the federal government gets the money, getting it back can  
be extraordinarily difficult, even for someone never accused of a 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Ask Fernando Marquez.  
</P>
<P>
	Pursuing Marquez's son on gambling charges in 1995, police found  
two safety deposit keys in his house in New Rochelle, N.Y. The keys 
led police to $490,920, which they seized. The elder Marquez went 
to court, arguing it was his money and his bank box, not his son's. 
</P>
<P>
	When a New York judge ordered the money returned, the district  
attorney's office said it had been turned over to the FBI -- without 
the required court order. After 3 1/2 years of court wrangling and 
mounting legal fees, Marquez agreed to accept half of the sum. 
After legal fees, he got $177,053 back -- about one-third. He was 
never accused of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``For an innocent person, it's like a stickup,'' says Marquez,  
60, who attributes a bout of alcoholism, a failed reconciliation 
with his wife and health problems to his fight with the government. 
``I really appreciate that Congress is taking the steps to correct 
the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the House passed a bill requiring the federal  
government to prove with ``clear and convincing'' evidence that 
property was eligible for forfeiture if an owner files a legal 
challenge. To take Marquez' money, police needed only show 
``probable cause,'' the lowest level of proof under the law, that 
the property was used in a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, now pending in the Senate, would also:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Require officers to prove criminality, not simply allege it.  
Currently, property owners are required to prove they are not 
connected with the alleged crime; 
</P>
<P>
	-- Require the government to give owners notice before seizing  
property; 
</P>
<P>
	-- Enable a judge to release property to the owner if continued  
government possession would pose a substantial hardship; 
</P>
<P>
	-- Allow judges to appoint counsel for poor defendants;  
</P>
<P>
	-- Let owners sue the government for negligence if their property  
is lost or damaged; 
</P>
<P>
	-- Allow some owners of seized cash to receive interest on the  
amount returned; 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would not affect state laws and would apply only to  
civil, not criminal, forfeitures although civil forfeitures 
sometimes follow criminal prosecutions. It would not affect state 
forfeiture laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In a criminal forfeiture case, the accused must be convicted and  
then the jury must reach a second verdict to forfeit the property. 
</P>
<P>
	In a civil forfeiture, it is the property, not the property  
owner, that is accused of wrongdoing. That's borne out in the names 
of lawsuits: $3,166,199 v. Arkansas Highway Police; United States 
v. One 1987 Mercedes Benz; Commonwealth v. One 1987 Ford Econoline 
Van. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have strong incentive to seize property. Joseph  
MacNamara, former police chief in San Jose, Calif., recalls asking 
the city manager why the city budget had no allocation for police 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``He dismissively said, `You guys seized $4 million last year. I  
expect you to do better this year,''' MacNamara wrote in a 
newspaper opinion piece. 
</P>
<P>
	It's no different at the federal level. In 1990, the Justice  
Department was falling short of the $470 million in forfeitures the 
agency expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every effort must be made to increase forfeiture income,''  
Attorney General Richard Thornburgh warned federal prosecutors.

<HEADLINE> 200-Year-Old Dock Found in N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Two years after departing for China, Capt.  
Stewart Dean and his weary crew were swept by April winds back to a 
port in Albany with a load of porcelain, fine silks and tea 
``superior to any hitherto imported.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The return of The Experiment in 1787 -- just the second sloop in  
the United States to make the journey to China -- put the Hudson 
River port on the map as a force in trade. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 years later, the same port where Dean docked his  
ship is being turned into a parking garage for State University of 
New York administrators. 
</P>
<P>
	But before the state's developers get their claws in the dirt,  
Tricia Barbagallo and a team from Hartgen Archeological Associates 
Inc. are sifting through the area to uncover history. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the city records tell us what the people who lived here  
did and what it cost, we don't know what it means or what it looks 
like until we uncover it,'' said Barbagallo, the site historian. 
</P>
<P>
	Because most of downtown Albany is in a national historic  
district, state and federal laws require that archeological surveys 
be conducted on any sites targeted for development. Archeologists 
look for cultural resources and record information about the area's 
terrain, soil and history. 
</P>
<P>
	At Barbagallo's site on the corner of Dean Street and Maiden  
Lane, workers painstakingly toil in the heat under blue tarp 
covers, picking through clumps of dirt and running them through 
sifters. 
</P>
<P>
	Since April, they have unearthed thousands of artifacts  
including clay tobacco pipes, hand-painted delft tiles and 
porcelain, wine bottles, nails, nutshells and even strawberry and 
sesame seeds believed to have been consumed in the 1500s. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the site is three blocks from the Hudson shore,  
archeologists have found three boat docks and the remnants of a 
boat launch, indicating this was the original Hudson shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two of them were built before Colonial America and one after  
the Revolution,'' she said. ``We can see from these docks that 
laborers were here. Their presence wasn't necessarily recorded 
through other artifacts, but these docks are the result of their 
hard work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one-square-block area started out as a camp where American  
Indians fished and hunted in the 1500s and Europeans settled around 
1624. 
</P>
<P>
	The original motive for settlement in Albany -- and one that  
remained dominant through the Colonial period -- was the lucrative 
trade in beaver pelts and other furs. 
</P>
<P>
	Albany's location at the headwaters of the Hudson River estuary,  
then the greatest waterway in British North America, put Albany at 
the center of trade in furs and later other goods such as wheat 
flour, meat, lumber. With the coming of independence and the influx 
of new settlers, the commercial life of Albany blossomed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The location of Albany is very advantageous in regard to  
trade,'' wrote Peter Kalm, a Swedish naturalist who visited Albany 
in 1749 and conveyed one of the best-known descriptions of the city 
in Colonial times. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hudson River which flows close by it is from twelve to  
twenty feet deep. There is not yet any quay made for the better 
landing of boats, because the people fear it will suffer greatly or 
be entirely carried away in spring by the ice which comes down the 
river.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for the trappers' furs, Albany's merchants imported  
British manufactured goods and tropical products such as sugar, tea 
and rum from the West Indies that were then dispersed through the 
hinterlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Albany, 140 miles up the Hudson from New York, also was an entry  
port for African-American slaves. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 18th century, the stone-paved streets surrounding the  
port marked a bustling mecca, drawing English, Scandinavian, 
German, Dutch, Irish and French settlers. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1810 there were more than 200 sloops on the Hudson; by 1850,  
despite the advent of steam, there were 400 to 500 sloops in 
regular service between Albany and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1897, spice companies and wholesale coffee roasters built  
warehouses on the site, taking advantage of the Hudson River 
traffic and railroad system that carried goods to the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the area is lined by federal and state buildings. A  
highway separates the block from the river. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most famous resident of the port in the Colonial  
period was Stewart Dean, a Maryland-born sea captain and merchant 
who was one of two residents of the dock in the 1770's. He set up 
an elaborate link between New York City and upstate traders, 
Barbagallo said. 
</P>
<P>
	His trip to Canton, China, also gave Albany a new look. Upon his  
return, a 1787 newspaper advertisement reveals what Dean brought 
back from his voyage: ``Souchong Tea, superior to any hitherto 
imported. Nakeens, large pieces and of the finest kinds. China 
Ware, elegant patterns, pencilled and gilt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He went out and bought all of these cheap goods in China and  
sells them as very expensive wares in Albany. In the process he 
puts Albany on the map,'' Barbagallo said.

<HEADLINE> First Lady To Face Senate Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About to kick off a get-acquainted road show  
in anticipation of a New York Senate candidacy, Hillary Rodham 
Clinton faces questions such as whether she can represent a state 
she's never lived in and whether she should be using government 
aircraft to campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	That's before she even gets to the issues, such as how she'll  
stick up for New York's interests and her husband's Medicare 
proposals at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any doubt that she's going to mount a campaign  
and she's going to win. There's no downside at all,'' Rep. Charles 
Rangel, D-N.Y., said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' He was 
among the first Democrats to suggest to the first lady that she run 
for the Senate in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,  
brought along a carpet bag and pulled out items he said he wanted 
to give Mrs. Clinton, including a map of New York to ``help her 
find her way around her adopted state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not as if she's living in a different country. She knows  
New York State,'' said Geraldine Ferraro, a former Democratic vice 
presidential candidate and former New York congresswoman. She 
appeared on ``ABC's This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is said to be house hunting in Westchester County  
outside New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 reporters are expected to tag along on Mrs.  
Clinton's ``listening tour'' across upstate New York that starts 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	As the first lady moves closer to running, so does Republican  
Rep. Rick Lazio, raising the prospect of a primary battle with New 
York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio said on NBC that he will announce ``over the next two  
months that I will be in this race.'' And he did not reject the 
possibility of a conservative third-party try if he loses the 
Republican nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent polls have shown Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani head-to-head  
in popularity in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's aides have said her four-day trip to upstate New  
York, beginning with a visit to Sen. Patrick Moynihan's farmhouse 
in Delaware County, will be aimed at listening to New Yorkers and 
their concerns. Some critics have questioned how much listening 
will be possible with the media crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a huge spectacle ... a lot of big hoopla.  
She's not going to be able to meet people and have an exchange,'' 
said former Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York, appearing 
on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady's aides have said that Mrs. Clinton is accustomed  
to dealing with large numbers of media and that the trip was being 
fashioned so she will still be able to meet with small groups. But 
they acknowledged that her stature has both advantages and 
disadvantages. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's expected candidacy is forcing even longtime  
veterans of New York politics into unfamiliar grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions have been raised about Mrs. Clinton's use of  
government aircraft during campaign trips, use of government staff 
and other expenses that critics say will be paid for by taxpayers. 
Recently GOP Chairman Jim Nicholson charged that $220,000 in 
taxpayer money has been used in connection with her 12 trips to New 
York so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Secret Service has insisted that Mrs. Clinton continue to  
use U.S. Air Force planes in her travel because of security. Some 
White House staffers who have helped Mrs. Clinton with her Senate 
plans have said they have done so on their own time. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is expected on Tuesday to announce creation of a  
Senate campaign exploratory committee that, in part, will raise 
money to pay for future campaign costs. Clinton aides have said the 
campaign will reimburse the government for costs related to 
campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	A more complex question involves Mrs. Clinton's ability to  
separate herself from the president on issues critical to New 
Yorkers. Appearing on ABC's ``This Week,'' former Republican Rep. 
Susan Molinari of New York raised questions about Mrs. Clinton 
``having that gut reaction to protect your state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue was raised recently in connection with the president's  
Medicare reforms, which would cause New York's teaching hospitals 
to lose tens of millions of dollars in federal aid. ``She can't 
have it both ways. ... She's going to be tied to (the president's) 
policies,'' insisted D'Amato. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., also on ``Fox News Sunday'' said  
Mrs. Clinton will have no problem disagreeing with the president on 
issues that affect New York. ``Sure she can criticize him,'' said 
Lowey. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's going to be able to lobby him in a way that no other  
person could possibly lobby the president of the United States,'' 
said Ferraro, who lost a bid for the Democratic Senate nomination 
last year in New York.

<HEADLINE>  Pirates' Kendall Breaks Right Ankle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Pirates catcher Jason Kendall was  
carried off the field on a stretcher Sunday with a fractured right 
ankle after stumbling over first base unsuccessfully trying to beat 
out a bunt. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates had been held hitless for 4 1-3 innings by  
Milwaukee's Steve Woodard when Kendall put down a bunt along the 
third-base line. 
</P>
<P>
	As he neared first base, Kendall's right foot awkwardly struck  
the right side of the bag. He took five or six more strides before 
collapsing several feet behind the bag. 
</P>
<P>
	As Kendall was carried off on a stretcher, obviously in pain,  
Pirates trainer Kent Biggerstaff carefully supported his right 
ankle. A few minutes later, the Pirates described the injury as 
both a fractured and dislocated ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	A serious injury to their most productive everyday player is a  
significant loss to the surprising Pirates, who began the day in 
third place in the NL Central with a 40-39 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall is batting .332 with eight homers and 41 RBIs and seemed  
to be a lock for his third All-Star game appearance in his four 
major league seasons. The NL All-Star team will be announced 
Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall has started 74 of the Pirates' 80 games and his backup,  
Keith Osik, has only 38 at-bats all season. 
</P>
<P>
	After Kendall left the field, Warren Morris broke up Woodard's  
no-hit bid with a double.

	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Lindsay Davenport added the Wimbledon  
championship to her U.S. Open title when she beat seven-time 
champion Steffi Graf 6-4, 7-5 in the final today. Making her first 
appearance in the All England Club final, Davenport showed few 
nerves and was in control of the match after breaking in the 
opening game. Graf's only other loss in the final was 12 years ago, 
when she was 18 and playing Martina Navratilova. Davenport's 
victory ensures two Americans winning on the Fourth of July. In the 
men's final later today, defending champion Pete Sampras is meeting

marching today through this town's hostile Catholic district, an 
annual confrontation that has triggered widespread mayhem for the 
past three summers. But unlike previous years, leaders of 
Portadown's Orange Order brotherhood took precautions to ensure 
that their followers behaved peacefully outside the rural Anglican 
church that is the parade's focal point. About 3,000 Orange Order 
members and their supporters, led by victims of Irish Republican

	CHICAGO (AP) -- A Jewish group has offered a reward following a  
string of shootings in the Chicago area. The American Jewish 
Committee will give $10,000 for information leading to the arrest 
and conviction of the suspect. Police say a white male gunman in 
his late 20s drove around for about ten miles Friday night, killing 
a black former college basketball coach, wounding six Orthodox 
Jews, and firing at an Asian-American couple. Police said the 
crimes appeared to be motivated by racial hatred, but stopped short 
of labeling the shootings hate crimes because the gunman did 
nothing to indicate his motives.

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Russia postponed its planned airlift

alliance would block the flights until disagreements over Russia's 
role in the peacekeeping force are resolved. Two IL-76 military 
cargo planes that were scheduled to airlift about 100 Russian

several countries would not grant Moscow permission to use their

<HEADLINE> Shooting Victim: Gunman Enjoyed Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The gunman who targeted minorities in a deadly  
shooting spree had a ``predator look to him,'' one of his victims 
said as he recovered from a gunshot wound. 
</P>
<P>
	A black man was killed Friday night, six Orthodox Jews were  
wounded and shots also were fired at an Asian-American couple, who 
were unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Police believe the same shooter fired at blacks and Asians in  
Springfield and Champaign-Urbana, Ill., before killing a Korean man 
outside a church in Bloomington, Ind., on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Jewish victims of Friday's shootings said he's used  
to being stared at by people unfamiliar with his faith, but he saw 
something more unnerving in the eyes of the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got the sense he was enjoying himself,'' the man told the  
Chicago Sun-Times from his hospital bed. ``He had this predator 
look to him. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old man asked that his name not be used for fear of  
retribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Another hospitalized victim, Gideon Sapir, 34, said he was a  
former captain in the Israeli army and found it ironic that he was 
shot while walking home from a synagogue in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (the gunman) didn't say anything, and I had no opportunity  
to see him,'' Sapir said. ``I wasn't trying to see who it was, I 
was trying to get out of the line of fire and protect my 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the shots were fired from inside a light blue Fort  
Taurus that stopped in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pushed down my son who was near me, I turned around and lay  
down on top of him,'' Sapir said. ``Apparently as I was turning 
around, I was hit by a bullet.''

	``It has been a difficult year because they are still cutting in  
Texas, and they are supposed to start cutting in Nebraska the first 
of the week,'' Thompson said Friday. ``There is more and more 
dependence on custom cutters who follow the harvest from Texas to 
Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His plight is becoming a familiar story to Steve Fenton,  
elevator manager at the OK Co-op in Kiowa. It was here that the 
Kansas wheat harvest really began in early June. But there have 
been precious few good harvesting days since then. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quality is going down every day. We need to get it out of the  
fields, but we just don't have the cutters to get the job done,'' 
Fenton said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the harvest started, the elevator was getting grain with  
test weights running 61 pounds per bushel. Now they are getting 
down to 57 pounds per bushel, but at least the elevator has not yet 
seen any sprout-damaged wheat come in. They have taken in 3 million 
bushels so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Kiowa area harvest was done in 10 days. Fenton  
wouldn't even venture a guess how long this one is going to take: 
``It's very, very slow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This harvest has been particularly difficult for Thompson, a  
small-time farmer who has difficulty even in good years finding a 
custom crew willing to bother with his acreage. And like most other 
Kansas farmers, he doesn't have enough land to justify an expensive 
combine he only uses a few days every year. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson's usual custom cutter has been delayed by rain at an  
earlier stop. The custom crew cutting his neighbor's fields already 
plans to move north to Nebraska to begin harvest there this week, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For his 19-year-old son, Todd, the harvest has been frustrating  
too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were looking at a pretty good crop this year. My dad said  
it was one of the best -- he was so excited about it. But the 
weather caused us to hold off,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been difficult for him to watch his father's enthusiasm  
fade with each subsequent rain, and watch him struggle to find 
someone to cut the family's wheat during the occasional days when 
fields are dry enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been tough to have patience. I have seen dad coming  
home from work and he is dealing with trying to find cutters -- and 
it is stressful for him,'' Todd Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many custom cutters have moved out to harvest wheat in northwest  
Kansas, leaving the farmers in southern Kansas with a shortage of 
cutters, said Brett Myers, executive vice president of the Kansas 
Association of Wheat Growers. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the weather problems with the harvest this year, the  
Kansas crop will be average or above average this year in terms of 
the number of bushels, Myers said. But the quality will not be the 
same as in the past couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going downhill, quality wise, every day,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	If it stays dry, the vast majority of the Kansas wheat harvest  
should be finished by July 12, Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those most worried about getting their crops soon are  
farmers who have planted white wheat, which is more susceptible to 
sprouting than the red varieties most commonly grown in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our growers all realize the greater risk of white wheat  
sprouting and where they had a chance they jumped on those first,'' 
said Kent Symns of the American White Wheat Producers Association.

<HEADLINE> Bush Defends Vietnam-Era Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MERRIMACK, N.H. (AP) -- Amid questions over his Vietnam-era  
military service, Texas Gov. George W. Bush defended his record 
Sunday, declaring that ``I served my country'' as a National Guard 
pilot in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	He received no special treatment, the Republican presidential  
hopeful insisted, after details of his stateside duty during the 
Vietnam War emerged in the Los Angeles Times and the Dallas Morning 
News. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked to become a pilot. I met the qualifications, and I  
ended up becoming an F-102 pilot,'' Bush said as he prepared to 
march in a Fourth of July parade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said Bush, as a young recruit in the late 1960s,  
became a second lieutenant just out of basic training, jumping into 
the officer ranks without credentials that many other officer 
candidates possessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said the Texas Air National Guard  
was short of pilots, and a candidate had to be a commissioned 
officer to go to flight school. 
</P>
<P>
	``The military found him absolutely qualified to be  
commissioned,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said it was informed by Tom Hail, a historian for the  
Texas Air National Guard, that Bush's unit had 27 pilots at the 
time he began applying, two short of its authorized strength. But 
he said the unit, the 147th Fighter Interceptor Group in Houston, 
had two other pilots in training and another awaiting a transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper reported that Bush was allowed to transfer to the  
Alabama National Guard for three months in 1972 to work on the 
Senate campaign of a politician there, and at one point he was 
suspended from flying for failing to ``accomplish'' the annual 
physical. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes said Bush missed the physical because he was in Alabama,  
and there were only a few special doctors who could do physicals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas newspaper said records from Bush's military file  
showed that after inquiring about National Guard admission, Bush 
went to an Air Force recruiting office and scored in the 25th 
percentile on the pilot aptitude section of a test. That was the 
lowest score allowed for prospective pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	He scored better than 95 percent of those taking the ``officer  
quality section'' of the test, dealing with leadership and other 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush told the Dallas paper that he sought the Guard position on  
his own, before graduating from Yale University in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential hopeful Steve Forbes, who served six  
years in the National Guard, said Bush ``has got to answer the 
questions'' on his military service ``if anything illegal was 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While waiting for the start of a parade in which he was to  
participate, Pat Buchanan said, ``Governor Bush is a good man. He 
comes from a great family.'' Buchanan otherwise declined to comment 
on Bush's military service. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, Buchanan, Elizabeth Dole and Gary Bauer all participated  
in the same parade and all were drenched in sweat by mid-morning as 
the temperature soared close to 100 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Dole appeared the coolest in her short-sleeved blouse,  
skirt and white tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	A microphone pinned to her blouse broadcast her chit-chat with  
parade-watchers from a van just ahead of her. Everywhere she and 
the others turned they found a baby to kiss, a dog to pat, a hand 
to shake. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the parade started, Mrs. Dole made her way through the  
crowd to Bush, who later said it was the first time they had seen 
each other since he began campaigning. The two hugged and kissed 
each other on the cheek. 
</P>
<P>
	``She looks great,'' Bush said. ``She looks like she's holding  
up well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another GOP hopeful, John Kasich of Ohio, said, ``Why don't we  
stop all this nonsense of people digging things up? I hope this 
isn't the beginning of `gotcha' politics in the presidential 
campaign.'' Kasich appeared on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On CNN's ``Late Edition,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said ``I  
don't see how anybody can find fault with'' Bush, who ``went and 
flew airplanes and learned to be a pilot and was prepared to go'' 
to war. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iowa, former Vice President Dan Quayle attended an ``Honor  
America'' rally at a large fundamentalist church in Des Moines. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpening his appeal to social conservatives, Quayle took  
credit for an increased focus by presidential candidates of both 
parties on social and cultural issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Iowa, Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley took  
to the pulpit of a West Des Moines church as a poll published by 
the Des Moines Register showed Vice President Al Gore favored by 64 
percent of those questioned. Bradley was backed by 24 percent, 
while another 12 percent saying they were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	After church, Bradley told reporters that voters have a right to  
focus on the values and faith of a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll was conducted June 13-29 by the Des  
Moines-based Selzer and Co. among 403 registered voters who said 
they were likely to attend a precinct caucus. The poll claimed a 
margin of error of 4.9 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Marine Opposes Flag Burning Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Ex-Marine Kit Hinrichs, a collector of  
hundreds of flags since childhood, would never burn his beloved 
Stars and Stripes. But he thinks others should have that right. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't force people to respect the flag,'' said the former  
Eagle Scout as he stood before a flag with 45 stars which dates 
back to when Teddy Roosevelt was a Rough Rider. 
</P>
<P>
	He also believes other controversial forms of political protest  
should be allowed, including burning a cross. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I do get upset when I see the Ku Klux Klan using the flag  
as if only it can be patriotic,'' Hinrichs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinrichs, who has 300 American flags among a collection of 2,500  
Old Glory items, belongs to an ad hoc group called Veterans 
Defending the Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization of about 400 members sprang up on the Internet  
to fight legislation that bans desecration of the U.S. flag. Some 
funding comes from the American Civil Liberties Union, said 
spokeswoman Rita Marcus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get mail from people who assume I'd be for the flag burning  
amendment,'' said Hinrichs, a graphic designer and partner in 
Pentagram Design Inc., which has produced logos for such companies 
as Muzak and Gymboree. 
</P>
<P>
	That wouldn't be an unreasonable assumption about a man who  
served in the Marine Corps reserve from 1963-1969. He served six 
months on active duty during the Vietnam War and ``always had my 
bags packed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinrichs started his flag collection when he was a boy. He was  
spurred by a family heirloom, an 1865 flag of 36 stars that was 
sewn by his great-great-great aunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kept under a bed and I would pull it out and take it to  
school for show and tell,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That flag is the pride and joy of his collection, along with an  
unusual one from the same era that came from West Virginia, which 
saw invasion by both Union and Confederate troops. The flag that 
belonged to a Northern sympathizer is on the back of a quilt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Legend has it that the quilt could be flipped over and the  
flag shown when Northern troops were in town,'' Hinrich said. 
``When the South showed up, it became just a quilt again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, his collection includes political buttons, postcards,  
kimonos, boots, rugs and just about anything big enough to paint or 
print a flag on. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinrichs, 57, has even amassed hundreds of toy soldiers, all  
carrying a U.S. flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all the items are a tribute to America. One is a German  
doormat with the U.S. flag on it. Another is a 1960s era placard on 
which the stripes are rifles and the stars are bombers. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,000 objects from the collection are on display at the  
San Jose Museum of Art under the title of ``Stripes &AMP; Stars: A 
Visual History of an American Icon.'' Included is a flag made of 
2,500 red, white and blue pencils. 
</P>
<P>
	Even without his ancestor's handiwork, Hinrichs said he would  
still be fascinated by the nation's flag. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a designer, I am drawn to it for professional reasons,'' he  
said. ``But more than that, the stars make it the only flag that 
can change. It's capable of change, just like its people.''

<HEADLINE> Juan Gonzalez Won't Be All-Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Joe Torre is honoring Juan Gonzalez's request to  
skip the All-Star game but doesn't agree with the decision by the 
Texas Rangers' outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, angry that Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. and Cleveland's  
Manny Ramirez and Kenny Lofton are ahead of him in voting for the 
AL's three starting spots, said he would go as a starter or not at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame,'' Torre said Sunday before his New York Yankees  
played the Baltimore Orioles. ``I think it is an honor, and if not 
honored they should be obligated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Final fan voting totals for the AL starters will be announced  
Monday, and reserves for both leagues on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I respect the fans, but if they don't vote me, then I don't  
want to play,'' Gonzalez said later Sunday before the Rangers' game 
against Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said he had intended to pick Gonzalez, who began the day  
with 23 homers and 76 RBIs, third in the AL in both categories. 
</P>
<P>
	``He deserved to be there,'' said Torre, manager of the AL team  
at Boston's Fenway Park on July 13. ``I was told by the American 
League office they had been in touch with the Texas Rangers, and 
they asked that he not be chosen. Instead of being chosen and not 
going, they asked he not be chosen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As of last week, Griffey had 1,752,313 votes and was trailed by  
three Indians: Ramirez (1,095,174), Lofton (965,148) and David 
Justice (753,667). Gonzalez was next at 493,038. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a popularity contest,'' Torre said. ``It's a matter of  
which ballparks vote. He shouldn't be upset by the process because 
the process includes his ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Gonzalez said he didn't want to go to the game as a  
reserve, he said he was upset that Torre had bypassed him for the 
1997 game in favor of Yankees outfielders Paul O'Neill and Bernie 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``1997 is history,'' Gonzalez said Sunday. ``People think  
because it's the same situation with Joe being the manager, that 
there's something to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez said the schedule hurt him in the fan voting.  
</P>
<P>
	``We played eight games at home in June,'' he said. ``Who's  
going to vote for Juan? No one's going to vote for Juan.''

<HEADLINE> Two Set Records at Belmont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELMONT, N.Y (AP) -- Crafty Friend set a stakes record in  
capturing Sunday feature race at Belmont Park, while a 26-year-old 
track record was bettered in the day's co-feature. 
</P>
<P>
	Crafty Friend staged a courageous front-running performance to  
get the better of favored Affirmed Success in the 25th running of 
the $150,000, Grade II Tom Fool Handicap for horses 3-years-old and 
older. 
</P>
<P>
	In so doing, Crafty Friend carried 116 and Richard Migliore  
seven furlongs on the fast track in 1:20.3, a clocking which 
bettered by one-fifth those of J.O. Tobin in 1978 and Birdonthewire 
in the 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Affirmed Success was easily second best in the Tom Fool,  
finishing five lengths before Artax. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the second in five starts this year for Crafty  
Friend, who earned $90,000 for Ahmed bin Salman and returned 
$10.80, $3.30 and $2.20. Affirmed Success was $2.50 and $2.10, and 
Artax paid $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	A 2-year-old lightning bolt named More Than Ready raced 5 1/2  
furlongs in track record time to register a 4 1/2-length victory in 
the 107th running of the $108,400 Grade III Tremont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	With 119 and John Velazquez up, More Than Ready clocked 1:02.56  
over the fast track, bettering the standard established in 1973 by 
Raise A Cup and duplicated by Ruffian in 1974 and again by Salt 
Lake in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner was hand-ridden throughout, with Velazquez peeking  
back twice through the stretch in search of nonexistent threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Afternoon Affair was second of six, another 5 3/4 lengths before  
King Kokand. 
</P>
<P>
	With the victory, More Than Ready remained undefeated in four  
starts. The win was the second straight in stakes company for the 
colt by Southern Halo from the Woodman mare, Woodman's Girl. He 
took the Flash stakes in Belmont on June 4. 
</P>
<P>
	While on the lead, More Than Ready posted fractions of 22:55,  
45:21 and 56:40 on his way to a final clocking of 1:02.56. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner earned $65,040 for James. Scatuorchio and returned  
$3, $2.10 and $2.10. Afternoon Affair paid $2.50 and $2.10, and 
King Kokand returned $2.10.

<HEADLINE> China 5, Norway 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- It will be a rematch of the 1996 Olympic  
gold medal game -- China vs. the United States for the Women's World 
Cup championship. 
</P>
<P>
	China used its speed on a steamy Sunday night -- scoring early  
and rushing past slower Norway -- and ran into the final with a 5-0 
win over the defending champions, the biggest semifinal margin in 
World Cup history. 
</P>
<P>
	Next stop for the Chinese in their coast-to-coast quest for  
their first World Cup title: the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., 
next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway will be there, too, for the third-place game. For the  
first time in the three World Cups, it failed to reach the final. 
Instead, it will play Brazil, a 2-0 loser to the United States in 
Sunday's other semifinal in San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	China's victory, sparked by two goals each by Sun Wen and Liu  
Ailing, set up a rematch of the Olympic title game, won by the 
United States 2-1 in Athens, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans will have a tough time if China dominates the ball  
as it did Sunday. Norway, whose 10-game World Cup winning streak 
ended, didn't get a shot on goal until the 63rd minute, by Solveig 
Gulbrandsen. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese goalkeeper Gao Hong was rarely tested as Norway was  
outshot 11-0 in the first half, although she made several good 
saves in the final minutes. In going 5-0 so far, China has 
outscored opponents 19-2. 
</P>
<P>
	China, meanwhile, closed in often on Norwegian goalie Bente  
Nordby. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun scored in the third minute and Liu connected in the 14th  
minute. Six minutes into the second half, Liu scored again with a 
12-yard left-footed volley after a Norwegian defender tried to 
clear a corner kick into the box. Fan Yunjie made it 4-0 in the 
65th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun then tied Sissi of Brazil for the tournament lead with seven  
goals as she scored on a penalty kick after a defender touched the 
ball with her hand in the box in the 72nd minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's game matched the teams who played in the opening game  
of the first World Cup in China in 1991. The Chinese won that, 4-0, 
but Norway reached the final, losing to the United States 2-1. In 
1995, Norway beat Germany 2-0 for the title. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 28,986 in 58,868-seat Foxboro Stadium was largely  
subdued on a hot night. As the game began, the temperature was 87 
degrees with a relative humidity of 67 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't bother China, which scored twice before the heat  
could take its toll. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu kicked the ball from about 35 yards, leading Jin Yan into  
the box. Nordby made a kick save on Jin's 12-yard shot and went to 
the ground. She got up but was beaten by Sun's left-footer for a 
1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	China's next goal came off a corner kick. It was knocked down in  
the box by Monica Knudsen, but went to Liu about 20 yards in front 
of the goal line. She fired a hard shot past Nordby. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese, spurred by Zhao Lihong's sprint with the ball down  
the left wing, continued to attack in the first half, and Nordby 
made several outstanding saves, some at pointblank range, to keep 
the score 2-0 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	Then China scored three goals in the first 27 minutes of the  
second half, assuring its spot in the final.

<HEADLINE> Congress To Probe Civil Air Patrol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the Air Force accusing its civilian  
auxiliary of fraud, financial mismanagement and safety lapses, 
Congress is poised to order a double-barreled investigation of the 
Civil Air Patrol, the nation's premier volunteer search and rescue 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Escalating a three-year feud between the top ranks of the two  
organizations, the Air Force asked Congress in May to give it broad 
oversight over the CAP and its 60,000 volunteers, to ensure 
accountability for the nearly 30 million in tax dollars the 
auxiliary spends out of the Air Force budget each year. 
</P>
<P>
	After CAP leaders denied the allegations, accused the Air Force  
of a power grab and mustered a grassroots lobbying campaign, the 
Senate approved a compromise directing the General Accounting 
Office and the Pentagon inspector general to investigate the 
charges and recommend appropriate action. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is expected to enact the compromise as part of the  
fiscal 2000 defense bill after it returns from the Independence Day 
recess. In the meantime, Acting Air Force Secretary Whit Peters and 
Gen. James A. Bobick, national CAP commander, have begun direct 
negotiations under the auspices of key senators to settle their 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was candid, open and very productive,'' Bobick said of the  
meeting with Peters last week that was arranged by Sen. Tom Harkin, 
D-Iowa, and Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo. Jim Wolffe, a special 
assistant to Peters, said both sides laid out their concerns and 
``a lot of progress was made on most of the contentious issues that 
have divided us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The battle lines between the two organizations began evolving in  
1996, when Air Force auditors concluded that the Air Force needed 
greater control over CAP to comply with federal laws and Pentagon 
regulations governing tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	A subsequent Air Force audit and a visit to CAP headquarters in  
Montgomery, Ala., in April by a special assessment team produced 
allegations that: 
</P>
<P>
	--Top CAP executives had claimed double expenses for a conference  
on board a Caribbean cruise ship. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some CAP units had claimed both federal and state expenses for  
the same counter drug missions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Several CAP wings could not account for more than 70 percent of  
the communications equipment purchased with Air Force funds. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some CAP members and former members had claimed retaliation  
from CAP officials for complaining about lost equipment, aircraft 
safety practices and in at least one case, an assault. 
</P>
<P>
	The CAP issued a point-by-point denial of the allegations and  
leveled a few of its own. A statement from CAP headquarters noted 
that all CAP expenditures are approved by Air Force personnel 
before they are reimbursed, including the cruise ship conference 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The AF currently requires $18.3 million to oversee CAP's $28.3  
million appropriations,'' the statement said. ``This equates to an 
oversight cost of 70 cents for every dollar appropriated to CAP. 
Wasteful?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate compromise calling for independent investigators to  
sort out the facts seems to have quieted the rhetoric on both 
sides. Bobick and Wolffe, in interviews last week, say they're 
optimistic an agreement can be reached without Congress having to 
step next year and impose a solution.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In a flash of camera bulbs, a century's  
worth of American faces were captured on film Sunday -- those of 112 
people born on Independence Days since 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Photo of the Century'' was taken at 7:04 a.m. in front of  
Independence Hall in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Twins, triplets and quadruplets, a man and his dog, a mother and  
daughter smiled while sporting red, white or blue shirts, throwing 
confetti and waving miniature American flags and fake sparklers. 
</P>
<P>
	The photographer, Paul Hosefros, represented 1947 and used a  
remote control to snap the photo while standing on the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
	The youngest face was that of Sarah Elizabeth Kitz, who had been  
born three hours earlier, weighing in at 7 pounds, 4 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
	The oldest was 99-year-old Betty Marx, whose caretaker helped  
apply her lipstick before the picture. One boy carried videotaped 
the event for his memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see, we've all grown up thinking the fireworks and  
America's birthday were for us, and here we are again with another 
big birthday party,'' said David Betz, 40, of Hopkinsville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	The photo was just one of the many ways Americans celebrated the  
nation's 223rd birthday on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Arlington, Va., 52 people from 49 countries became citizens  
at a ceremony in Freedom Park. And 87 people from 31 countries were 
sworn in at Monticello, Thomas Jefferson's home in Charlottesville, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have lived in the United States for 19 years and I took time  
to decide to be a U.S. citizen,'' said Carmen Aguilar, a native of 
Venezuela who took the oath in Arlington. ``This is the very best 
decision of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humid and hazy weather didn't deter an estimated 500,000 people  
from attending the famous Fourth of July Boston Pops concert and 
fireworks display over the Charles River. 
</P>
<P>
	The concert, now in its 70th year, included swing and patriotic  
tunes conducted by Pops conductor Keith Lockhart and country hits 
performed by singer Trisha Yearwood. 
</P>
<P>
	Emil Kannengieszer of Abington, Pa., fulfilled his lifelong  
dream by being there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always watched this on TV,'' said the 61-year-old retiree,  
who arrived at 6 a.m. to get prime seats for the show. ``I told my 
wife, `Someday before I die, I want to see this.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In the New York City borough of Brooklyn, 134-pound Hirofumi  
Nakajima, ``The Tokyo Terror,'' had to relinquish his 3-year-old 
title as the world champion hot dog eater. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Keiner, 50, of Egg Harbor Township, N.J., became top dog  
Sunday at Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest on Coney Island 
after eating 20 and one-quarter hot dogs in 12 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took the Zen approach,'' the 317-pound Keiner said,  
acknowledging the cultural influence of his Japanese competitor. 
``I went down a path that the hot dog was one with me, and I was 
one with the universe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nakajima, who had been champion three years in a row, came in  
third, downing just 19 franks. ``Hungry'' Charles Hardy, a 
320-pound corrections officer from Brooklyn, came within a mouthful 
of winning, with 20 dogs.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Airways Could Be Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- If Olympic Airways employees do not  
cooperate with the company's new management under a subsidiary of 
British Airways, the troubled state-owned carrier could be sold, a 
government official warned in an interview published Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the last chance for the company. The employees have to  
understand and have to cooperate. If this effort also fails, the 
market place will give the answer,'' Economy Minister Yannos 
Papandoniou was quoted as saying in Apoyevmatini. 
</P>
<P>
	The British Airways subsidiary, Speedwing, took over management  
in a bid to turn around the money-losing airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic's new chief executive, Rod Lynch, told a parliamentary  
committee last week that his mandate was ``not to change anything, 
but to undertake the company's existing activity. We are not 
arriving here with any hostile plans for Olympic. We are here to 
learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unions have protested the agreement, under which Speedwing will  
run Olympic for 30 months, overseeing a financial rescue plan for 
the airline long plagued by debts and labor disputes. British 
Airways will be allowed to buy a stake in the airline of up to 20 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, employees staged a strike in protest of the new  
management, grounding more than half of the day's flights. Unions 
have also threatened to organize another strike on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic was once a proud symbol of Greece under the ownership of  
shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. But it has fallen on hard times 
because of chronic fiscal and labor problems.

<HEADLINE> Women's World Cup Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Michelle Akers must have felt as if she was playing in an  
American football game. 
</P>
<P>
	Akers, who scored on a penalty kick in the United States' 2-0  
victory over Brazil in the Women's World Cup semifinals on Sunday, 
was battered for much of the game. In no particular order, she took 
a foot to the face, was kicked in the hand, knocked in the ribs and 
``had my bell rung.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Akers, at 33 the oldest U.S. player, considers herself a  
survivor. That's exactly what she needed to be against Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get to the point where you are so beat up, another little  
ding is not going to stop you,'' said Akers, who has chronic 
fatigue syndrome and has her playing time strictly monitored by the 
coaching staff. ``I've learned how to stuff it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oddly, it was not a foul against Akers that brought the penalty  
kick in the 80th minute. It was star forward Mia Hamm who was 
fouled in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	When Akers saw the foul she said, ``Yeah, baby, let me at it.''  
Then she sent the ball into the right side of the net to clinch the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THE NEW REDHEAD/BLUEHEAD:* U.S. defender Kate Sobrero vowed to  
dye her hair red and blue if teammate Joy Fawcett scored a goal in 
the Women's World Cup. When Fawcett put in a header against Germany 
in the quarterfinals, Sobrero was put on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
	She came through, coloring her hair auburn with streaks of blue.  
It wasn't very becoming, but Sobrero and her teammates got a kick 
out of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a promise and I had to live up to it,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	It could have been worse. Sobrero said she would shave off her  
hair if co-captain Carla Overbeck scores. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *REVENGE?* Doing what the U.S. men couldn't five years ago  
didn't seem to have much impact on the American women Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 4, 1994 in Stanford Stadium, Brazil edged the United  
States 1-0 in the men's World Cup. The Brazilians went on to win 
their fourth title, the most of any nation. 
</P>
<P>
	After their 2-0 victory over the Brazilian women, the Americans  
didn't claim vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very proud of our men's team and what they did when the  
World Cup was here,'' Carla Overbeck said. ``I think what the men 
did in 1994 was a great start for our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added U.S. coach Tony DiCicco: ``We are the men's biggest fans  
and they are our biggest fans. We are working together to grow 
soccer in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the Americans hope their fate is the same as was  
Brazil's after the last July 4 match. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BRAZIL'S COMPLAINTS:* Brazil's women were incensed by the work  
of referee Katriina Elovirta of Finland. They felt she let the 
match get too physical, and the penalty kick awarded to the United 
States in the 80th minute came on a very questionable call. 
</P>
<P>
	Mia Hamm was chasing Michelle Akers' long header in the Brazil  
penalty area when she bumped with Brazilian captain Elane and went 
down. Replays showed the contact was incidental, but the penalty 
was awarded and Akers put it home, clinching the 2-0 semifinal 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Elane was fortunate not to draw a yellow card for her actions  
after the call. She picked up the ball and held it over her head as 
she waved to the fans, sarcastically encouraging them to cheer. 
Then she clapped her hands in the air and continued egging on the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the Brazilian players were made available to comment  
after the game. But coach Wilson de Oliveira expressed his 
disenchantment with the officiating. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no necessity for the refereeing being that bad,'' he  
said. ``The United States is a great team and they needed no help. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were many fouls she did not punish and let them go.''

<HEADLINE> DAR Accommodate Today's Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- As the nation enjoys its long Fourth of July  
weekend, the female descendants of the people who made it all 
possible have a message for America: We're not your grandmother's 
DAR. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daughters of the American Revolution, founded in the late  
19th century, is seeing even more Internet-savvy working moms and 
professional women join its ranks at the end of the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before, it was extremely difficult to document your  
ancestors,'' said Denise VanBuren, the spokeswoman for the DAR in 
New York. ``The Internet has made it interesting and exciting to 
join DAR and have a connection to the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once viewed as exclusive and stodgy, the DAR is changing with  
the times. Young mothers and professionals are joining in 
increasing numbers. Chapters hold daytime, evening and Saturday 
meetings to accommodate the demands on today's women. 
</P>
<P>
	The national DAR has its own website (www.dar.org) and many  
state organizations and local chapters have already established 
their own Internet links, or plan to. 
</P>
<P>
	``Genealogy itself has almost taken on a hobby atmosphere,''  
said Merry Ann Wright, the DAR's director of development. ``People 
are wanting to know more and more what their ancestors did. The 
Internet allows them easier access to that information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DAR membership is open to any woman 18 or older who can prove  
she's a descendant of someone, man or woman, who helped the nation 
achieve independence from Britain between 1775 and 1783. That 
includes any ancestors who were soldiers, sailors, militiamen, 
civil servants, members of the Continental Congress and the Boston 
Tea Party, even nurses who aided the wounded and ministers who gave 
patriotic sermons. 
</P>
<P>
	The national DAR membership peaked at 218,000 in the mid-1980s,  
Wright said, and the decline in membership was stemmed six months 
ago. The DAR has set a membership goal of 200,000 in 2000. Its 
current membership is more than 172,000, with 2,975 chapters in the 
United States and six other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	VanBuren's mid-Hudson Valley chapter has taken in 50 new members  
over the past few years, a dramatic increase considering less than 
500 women joined the chapter during its first 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
	VanBuren, 38, joined the DAR along with her three sisters 12  
years ago, when they were in their 20s and 30s. At the time, she 
says her image of the DAR was ``little old ladies with white gloves 
who sat around having tea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she was ``pleasantly surprised'' to discover the  
organization's many community-based works. ``It was appealing to 
link your past with a service organization that does things in the 
present,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The DAR is still dedicated to its three original objectives:  
historic preservation; promotion of education; and patriotic 
endeavors. But DAR members also volunteer at veterans' hospitals, 
provide literature for immigrants working to become American 
citizens, and honor outstanding students. This year it's helping 
raise funds for the World War II memorial in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York state organization, with 156 chapters and about  
8,000 members, is the nation's second largest, after Texas. Isabel 
Hobba of Niagara Falls, a DAR member for 26 years, is head of the 
state organization. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she's met people from college students to bikers who've  
praised the DAR for honoring those who fought for America's 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are realizing the importance of that once again,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonnie Wiegard of Hopewell Junction has the DAR in her blood.  
Her mother is a national officer who gave each of her four 
daughters a DAR application on their 18th birthdays. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably the greatest gift she's given me,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	A 31-year-old hairdresser and mother of three, Wiegard is in  
charge of membership for the state organization. She, too, has 
noticed the influx of younger members, especially since the DAR 
went online. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a while it wasn't a cool thing to be proud of your roots  
and proud to be an American,'' Wiegard said. ``It's a great thing 
to be able to know your history and share your patriotism with 
children.''

<HEADLINE> Law Covers Mark's Disappearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- A draft law covering the disappearance of  
the German mark and introduction of euro bills and coins in 2002 
will be presented soon to Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Cabinet, a 
Finance Ministry spokeswoman said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The law codifies an agreement reached last October between the  
Finance Ministry and banks, retailers, the service industry and 
vending machine companies for a two-month ``buffer period,'' the 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although technically the mark, symbol of postwar Germany's  
economic might, will stop being legal tender on Jan. 1, 2002, 
stores and businesses will continue to accept it until Feb. 28 that 
year, along with the single European currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Only private individuals will be able to demand payment in euros  
from Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision affects only Germany, one of 11 European nations  
that launched the single currency this year -- but only in an 
abstract form used mainly by central banks, currency markets and 
multinational corporations for bookkeeping purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The actual introduction of bills and coins in 2002 is the last  
phase of the union. Initial plans called for a six-month transition 
period, but banks and retailers wanted a shorter period to curb the 
costs of dealing in two currencies.

<HEADLINE> National Zoo Proposes Panda Lease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Officials at the National Zoo have made a  
10-year, $2.5 million offer to lease a pair of giant pandas from 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of three zoo officials and researchers have been in China  
for a week to discuss a possible panda rental -- China no longer 
sells or gives away the endangered species -- and were scheduled to 
return to Washington Saturday night, said Robert Hoage, the zoo's 
chief of public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The team, led by Benjamin Beck, the zoo's associate director for  
biological programs, is scheduled to meet with top zoo officials 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The zoo's one remaining panda, Hsing Hsing (pronounced Shing  
Shing), is 28 and suffers from an irreversible kidney condition. He 
and another panda, Ling Ling, were diplomatic gifts from China in 
1972 after President Nixon's historic visit. Ling Ling died seven 
years ago, and none of the pair's five cubs survived. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other two pandas in the United States are at the San  
Diego Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 1,000 giant pandas live in the wild in China, their  
only native habitat, and 100 live in Chinese zoos. Since they are 
endangered, China no longer gives pandas as gifts and does not sell 
pandas overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoo Atlanta, however, recently reached an agreement to lease a  
pair of 2-year-old pandas as part of a 10-year study on why pandas 
are not interested in mating while in captivity, said Georgia Tech 
scientist Rebecca Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	In return for the loan, Zoo Atlanta has agreed to raise $11  
million for panda research and education programs in China and 
Atlanta by 2007, zoo officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Zoo, one of the few U.S. zoos that charge no  
admission, cannot afford $11 million for two pandas and instead 
hopes China will accept its offer of limited funding along with 
proposals for extensive, collaborative educational and research 
projects, Hoage said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those include the development of a national census of giant  
pandas in the wild; development of a radio tracking and satellite 
monitoring system of pandas and research and training projects in 
veterinary, nutritional, behavioral and ecological studies on 
pandas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been doing these studies and working with them off and  
on now for years,'' Hoage said of the collaborative research with 
China. ``There's more of an emphasis now, but it's not something 
brand new.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other costs associated with two new pandas include the $400,000  
a year to maintain them and a proposed $3.5 million plan to 
refurbish the giant panda house, Hoage said. 
</P>
<P>
	The zoo anticipates some financial return -- possibly as much as  
$1 million a year in increased concession sales -- if China does 
accept its offer, he said.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Keeps No. 1 Despite Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Andre Agassi's astounding revival  
during the past month included winning the French Open, regaining 
the No. 1 ranking and surging to the Wimbledon final. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he ran into Pete Sampras.  
</P>
<P>
	Agassi's bid to become the first player since Bjorn Borg in 1980  
to win the French Open and Wimbledon back to back crumbled Sunday 
under a grass-court onslaught from his greatest rival. 
</P>
<P>
	The best returner in tennis, Agassi failed to break serve once  
as Sampras overwhelmed him 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 for his sixth Wimbledon 
title and 12th Grand Slam championship. 
</P>
<P>
	His brilliant counter-punching style, which earned him the 1992  
Wimbledon title and was so effective in his six previous matches, 
was powerless against Sampras' flawless serve-and-volley game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He played some impeccable tennis at the most important  
times,'' Agassi said, ``and I didn't come up with better stuff than 
he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi virtually lost the match in the seventh game of the first  
set, when he was unable to convert after earning three break points 
on Sampras' serve at love-40. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't that Agassi squandered his chance; Sampras simply  
responded with some of the biggest serves of the match. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came out with four big bombs and basically an unreturnable  
second serve,'' Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi didn't see a break point the rest of the match.  
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, meanwhile, broke for the first time in the next game  
and never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next thing you know,'' Agassi said, ``I'm down a break and  
the set is over, and six minutes later, I was down 6-3, 1-0 with a 
break. That's how Pete plays. You've got to weather his storm, and 
when you weather his storm, that's when he's vulnerable. But his 
storm was too strong today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi took Sampras to 30-all on his serve several times, but  
that was about as close as he could get to a break. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he didn't hit an ace on the first serve, he was hitting his  
second serve 109, 111, sometimes 119 or 122 mph,'' Agassi said. ``I 
mean, he hit one serve the whole match that was 100 mph. He's 
taking chances out there, and people think he's walking on water 
until he starts missing a few of those. But he didn't. So he walked 
on water today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Men's tennis needs the rivalry between Sampras and Agassi, polar  
opposites in lifestyles and playing styles. 
</P>
<P>
	The two hadn't played much in recent years as Agassi, lacking  
motivation and perhaps distracted by his marriage to Brooke 
Shields, tumbled all the way down to No. 141 in the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	But Agassi, who split from Shields in April, has made a  
remarkable comeback. By winning the French Open, he became only the 
fifth man in history to win all four Grand Slams. And by reaching 
the Wimbledon final, he supplanted Sampras as No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi has almost single-handedly revived interest in men's  
tennis, which has suffered from a shortage of compelling 
personalities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact I have accomplished what I've accomplished up until  
this day makes me feel better,'' he said. ``Every time you're on 
the court, you've got to prove that you're No. 1, and today on 
Centre Court at Wimbledon, I was not No. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Agassi has tended to fade from view after a big  
loss. But this time, he said he's ready to challenge Sampras again 
for supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now is a great time,'' he said. ``Certainly, all the  
anticipation is built, including mine. I want another shot at him. 
And I want another shot at him this summer. I want another shot at 
him in the finals of the U.S. Open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi suggested that Sampras will be under more pressure the  
next time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's interesting how he's going to respond,'' Agassi said.  
``He hasn't played that great all year and then he comes back to 
Wimbledon and wins it. Every player knew that he was capable of it, 
and many of us were actually expecting it. 
</P>
<P>
	``But how he responds from here will be a question. ... I plan  
on doing my part. I have no anticipation of slowing down on any 
level. This has motivated me to get better.''

<HEADLINE> 'Controlled burn' destroys California homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEWISTON, Calif. (AP) -- A fire that federal authorities set to  
thin brush got out of control and roared through a mountain hamlet, 
destroying two dozen homes and forcing 500 people to flee. 
</P>
<P>
	High winds and hot weather Friday fanned flames of the  
``controlled burn'' beyond a 100-acre expanse of brush and weeds 
and into Lewiston. There were no injuries, but many homeowners who 
fled returned Saturday to little more than smoking rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just exploded,'' said one resident, Rod Robinson.  
</P>
<P>
	``We had a few minutes to get out of there,'' he said as he  
examined the smoldering debris of his home. ``I grabbed our coats, 
I grabbed our guns out of the cabinet. I got the '57 Chevy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the house, Robinson lost his workshop, several  
automobiles, motorcycles, and a collection of 85-year-old china. 
</P>
<P>
	``I apologize for this. It just happens sometimes,'' said Doug  
Held, who was in charge of the fire set by the Bureau of Land 
Management to thin out fire-prone overgrowth. ``I think we're going 
to have to re-evaluate our prescription burn program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By Saturday, the fire had blackened more than 2,000 acres of  
brush and forest land. It was 50 percent contained by the 
afternoon, but there was no estimate of when it would be completely 
under control. Falling temperatures and lighter wind were aiding 
the effort, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Air tanker planes, helicopters and more than 2,000 firefighters  
were at the scene, a rugged swath of the Shasta-Trinity National 
Forest about 300 miles northeast of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	In central Utah, dozens of firefighters were battling to save  
homes in two small communities from a fire fanned by high winds. 
The fire had charred an estimated 40,000 acres by Saturday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	About 60 people in the town of Mammoth, Utah, who had been  
evacuated on Friday and allowed to return Saturday morning again 
had to abandon their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite wind gusts of up to 50 mph, a fire in Nevada was  
contained Saturday after racing through 3,000 acres of dry brush in 
Reno and damaging two homes.

<HEADLINE> Investors Unsure How High Is Up / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Almost 17 years after the start of one of the  
mightiest bull markets in financial history, investors are still 
faced with the stubborn question ``How high is too high?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street boom traces it origins to August 1982, when the  
Dow Jones industrial average began to climb from a low point of 
777. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few months later, when the average surged past its  
previous closing peak of 1,052, set a decade before in January 
1973, analysts began to fret that it had climbed too far, too fast, 
and had moved into dangerous ``overvalued'' territory. With few 
interruptions, they've been worrying about the same issue ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
	The intensity of the debate reached a new level in December  
1996, more than 2 1/2 years ago, when chairman Alan Greenspan of the 
Federal Reserve Board first voiced his concern over ``irrational 
exuberance'' in the market. But that didn't slow the bull's 
progress in the slightest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow, which stood in the mid-6,000s at the time of  
Greenspan's first warning, went on to soar past 11,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Presumably, Greenspan and other Fed policymakers had concern  
about inflating prices of financial assets very much in mind when 
they acted last week to nudge short-term interest rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
	But once stock-market participants have decided on a way of  
looking at things, it's not easy to change their attitude. On 
Thursday, the day of the Fed's restraining action, stock prices 
jumped ahead and the rally continued Friday with new record highs 
in several indexes including the Dow, which closed at 11,139.24. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, even after a round of credit-tightening, the model used by  
the Fed to gauge the level of the stock market remains ``grossly 
overvalued,'' in the words of Edward Yardeni, chief economist at 
the investment firm of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. ``I see a great 
deal of risk,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Steadfast bulls may take some perverse reassurance from talk  
like this. In keeping with the ancient adage, ``bull markets climb 
a wall of worry,'' stocks have seemed impervious to charges of 
overvaluation all through the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, everybody who owns stock investments these days  
has to operate under the financial equivalent of a continuous 
tornado watch. 
</P>
<P>
	It stands to reason, analysts say, that stock prices can't keep  
rising at double-digit rates each year indefinitely unless 
corporate earnings can grow at the same pace, or pretty close. 
</P>
<P>
	``No asset can outrun its own fundamentals forever,'' says  
Timothy Vick in his newsletter Today's Value Investor, based in 
Hammond, Ind. ``Over long periods, the market value of a company's 
stock cannot outstrip its own internal growth rates by very much. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, technological gains can cause improvements in corporate  
efficiency and lead to temporary quantum leaps in earnings. But the 
competitive, cyclical natures of markets help maintain the direct 
relationship between sales, earnings and valuation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last word comes from Eric Miller at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;  
Jenrette Securities Corp.: ``Forecasts a decade ago for the 1990s 
tended to have a common theme, that it was going to be a lean 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was thought to have been years of greed and excess in the  
1980s was sure to be followed by relative austerity and less 
selfish behavior.'' Instead, the great expansion has only gained 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe this grand era can be extended for some time,'' Miller  
concludes, ``but one requirement, in our view, is that too many 
people better not kid themselves. We worry that some investors are 
engaging in 'irrational rationalization,' and that their 
expectations are vulnerable.''

<HEADLINE> Two Set Records at Belmont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELMONT, N.Y (AP) -- Crafty Friend set a stakes record in  
capturing Sunday feature race at Belmont Park, while a 26-year-old 
track record was bettered in the day's co-feature. 
</P>
<P>
	Crafty Friend staged a courageous front-running performance to  
get the better of favored Affirmed Success in the 25th running of 
the $150,000, Grade II Tom Fool Handicap for horses 3-years-old and 
older. 
</P>
<P>
	In so doing, Crafty Friend carried 116 and Richard Migliore  
seven furlongs on the fast track in 1:20.3, a clocking which 
bettered by one-fifth those of J.O. Tobin in 1978 and Birdonthewire 
in the 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Affirmed Success was easily second best in the Tom Fool,  
finishing five lengths before Artax. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the second in five starts this year for Crafty  
Friend, who earned $90,000 for Ahmed bin Salman and returned 
$10.80, $3.30 and $2.20. Affirmed Success was $2.50 and $2.10, and 
Artax paid $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	A 2-year-old lightning bolt named More Than Ready raced 5 1/2  
furlongs in track record time to register a 4 1/2-length victory in 
the 107th running of the $108,400 Grade III Tremont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	With 119 and John Velazquez up, More Than Ready clocked 1:02.56  
over the fast track, bettering the standard established in 1973 by 
Raise A Cup and duplicated by Ruffian in 1974 and again by Salt 
Lake in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner was hand-ridden throughout, with Velazquez peeking  
back twice through the stretch in search of nonexistent threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Afternoon Affair was second of six, another 5 3/4 lengths before  
King Kokand. 
</P>
<P>
	With the victory, More Than Ready remained undefeated in four  
starts. The win was the second straight in stakes company for the 
colt by Southern Halo from the Woodman mare, Woodman's Girl. He 
took the Flash stakes in Belmont on June 4. 
</P>
<P>
	While on the lead, More Than Ready posted fractions of 22:55,  
45:21 and 56:40 on his way to a final clocking of 1:02.56. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner earned $65,040 for James. Scatuorchio and returned  
$3, $2.10 and $2.10. Afternoon Affair paid $2.50 and $2.10, and 
King Kokand returned $2.10.

<HEADLINE> Gore's 1st Grandchild Born July 4th </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's first grandchild was  
born on the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gores' daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, 25, and her husband,  
Drew Schiff, 33, had been expecting the baby in late June. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the instincts of a politician, Wyatt Gore Schiff  
delayed his inaugural appearance until Sunday -- Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president's office in Washington announced that he was  
born at 10:05 a.m. in New York City, weighing in at 6 pounds, 3 
ounces and measuring 20 inches long. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president and wife Tipper were in New York on Sunday to  
be with the young couple and their new son. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were married at Washington National Cathedral in 1997.  
Mrs. Schiff is in her second year at Columbia University law 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Al and I are thrilled about the prospect of becoming  
grandparents for the first time,'' Mrs. Gore said in a statement 
issued in February announcing that her daughter was pregnant. ``We 
look forward to welcoming our first grandchild.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton's Trips Under Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton embarks this week on a  
get-acquainted ``listening tour'' across upstate New York as 
critics question her seeking a Senate seat from a state in which 
she has never lived. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``carpetbagger'' charge carried across the television talk  
show circuit Sunday as the first lady's supporters and critics 
debated her almost-certain bid to replace retiring Democratic Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan in the 2000 election. 
</P>
<P>
	On CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,  
brought along a carpet bag and pulled out items he said he wanted 
to give Mrs. Clinton, including a map of New York to ``help her 
find her way around her adopted state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not as if she's living in a different country. She knows  
New York state,'' Geraldine Ferraro, a former Democratic vice 
presidential candidate and New York congresswoman, retorted on 
``ABC's This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A likely Republican opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph  
Giuliani, also has made note of Mrs. Clinton's lack of a New York 
address, although she is said to be looking for a house in suburban 
Westchester County. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, an avid New York Yankees fan, recently made a point of  
attending a Cubs game in Mrs. Clinton's native Chicago and joked 
that he was thinking of announcing exploratory campaign committees 
in Illinois and Arkansas, Mrs. Clinton's adopted home state. The 
first lady, a longtime Cubs fan, became a Yankee rooter when she 
began seriously considering the New York Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent polls have shown her and Giuliani head-to-head in  
popularity in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	But Giuliani may have other problems. Republican Rep. Rick Lazio  
signaled he has every intention of vying for the Senate seat, 
saying on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that he will announce ``over the 
next two months that I will be in this race.'' He did not reject 
the possibility of a conservative third-party try if he loses the 
GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Mrs. Clinton was expected to announce Tuesday she is  
forming a formal campaign exploratory committee for the Senate 
seat. The next day she begins her four-day tour of upstate New 
York, stopping first at Moynihan's farm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any doubt that she's going to mount a campaign  
and she's going to win,'' Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said on NBC. 
Rangel said her candidacy will bring out voters and ``there's no 
downside at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 reporters were expected to tag along on Mrs.  
Clinton's tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a huge spectacle ... a lot of big hoopla.  
She's not going to be able to meet people and have an exchange,'' 
former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., predicted on ``Fox News 
Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's expected candidacy is forcing even longtime  
veterans of New York politics onto unfamiliar ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions have been raised about her use of government aircraft  
and aides and other assets paid for by taxpayers. Republican Party 
chairman Jim Nicholson says $220,000 in public funds have been used 
in connection with her 12 trips to New York so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Secret Service has insisted that Mrs. Clinton continue to  
use U.S. Air Force planes in her travel because of security. Some 
White House staffers who have helped Mrs. Clinton in her Senate 
plans have said they have done so on their own time. The new 
campaign exploratory committee, in part, will raise money to pay 
future campaign costs. Clinton aides have said the campaign will 
reimburse the government for campaign-related costs. 
</P>
<P>
	A more complex question involves Mrs. Clinton's ability to  
separate herself from her husband on issues critical to New 
Yorkers. Appearing on ABC's ``This Week,'' former Rep. Susan 
Molinari, R-N.Y., questioned whether Mrs. Clinton possessed ``that 
gut reaction to protect your state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue was raised recently in connection with Medicare  
changes proposed by the president that would cause New York's 
teaching hospitals to lose tens of millions of dollars in federal 
aid. ``She can't have it both ways ... She's going to be tied to 
(Clinton's) policies,'' D'Amato contended. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., said on Fox that Mrs. Clinton will  
have no problem disagreeing with her husband on issues that affect 
New York . ``Sure she can criticize him,'' the congresswoman said.
