<HEADLINE> Talks on Drumcree Crisis Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 11 (Xinhua) - Talks aimed at finding a way to
avert more violence over a banned protest march began Saturday at
a secret location in Northern Ireland, a BBC TV report said.
</P>
<P>
The move to involve both sides of the Drumcree stand-off in
what were called "proximity talks" was launched by Prime Minister
Tony Blair with strong support from the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
The last-ditch move came as security forces signaled renewed
determination to prevent thousands of Orangemen violently
overturning the ban on their march down the primarily nationalist
Garvaghy Road in Portadown, Co Armagh.
</P>
<P>
There are fears of more trouble on Monday, when Orangemen
parade across Northern Ireland to commemorate the Battle of the
Boyne in 1690 when William of Orange defeated a Catholic king.
</P>
<P>
Tony Blair made an eleventh-hour bid Saturday morning to break
the deadlock at Drumcree by inviting the Orange Order and the
Garvaghy Road Residents' Association to hold "immediate indirect
contact talks". Both sides agreed.
</P>
<P>
BBC TV quoted one report as saying the negotiation was being
held in a district council building in Armagh city.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Hopes G-7 Not Press IMF, World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Saturday expressed his hope that the G-7 countries would
not pressurize international financial institutions for
discriminatory treatment to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen at the Prime Minister's House Saturday
afternoon, Sharif expressed the determination to face sanctions at
all costs.
</P>
<P>
However, he asked the G-7 countries not to pressurize the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank for
discriminatory treatment towards Pakistan which is facing
sanctions imposed by some Western nations because of its
detonation of nuclear devices at the end of May.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said these clutches, which he was expecting, would not
remain forever. Citing the example of Japan and Germany, he said,
there was no price for sovereignty, dignity and honor.
</P>
<P>
He admonished the rumor mongers and ruled out the possibility
of raiding banks or seizing lockers.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also assured that the government had no
intention to demonetize the currency. These rumors were just
baseless and malicious, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question about foreign currency accounts, he said
he believed in minimum restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Regarding frozen dollar accounts, he said an alternate policy
would soon be announced to compensate such account holders.
</P>
<P>
Sharif advised the people to have patience and courage to face
the challenges boldly.
</P>
<P>
Sharif noted that on the day when Pakistan conducted nuclear
blasts he had asked the nation for belt tightening as a result of
this honor of being a nuclear state.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about signing the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT), Sharif said he had already made it clear that the
Kashmir dispute which was the root cause of the tension in this
region should be addressed first.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is a peace-loving country and has no aggressive
designs against anyone, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was ready for exchange of views on CTBT
and would take a decision which was in the national interest.
Pakistan, he said, had its own considered policy over this issue.
</P>
<P>
Sharif asked the U.N., the G-7 and the international community
to play their due role towards contributing for long lasting peace
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Replying to another question about non-aggression pact, the
prime minister said he had already clarified his position and had
also responded to the Indian prime minister's invitation for
dialogue in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the U.S. attitude towards Pakistan, Sharif reiterated
that "we have to live like an honorable country and not like bond
servants. If somebody wants to punish one, every sovereign nation
opts to face the challenges gracefully."

World Bank would fulfill their promises as Pakistan has acted
according to the agreements with the institutions.

<HEADLINE> Indian Postal Employees Intensify Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The national strike by some
600,000 Indian postal employees entered third day Saturday as
fresh talks between strike leaders and government officials ended
in a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Following talks with senior officials of the postal department
Saturday afternoon, postal union representatives ruled out any
possibility of calling off the strike until their demands
including higher pays and regularization of extra departmental
agents were met.
</P>
<P>
The strike leaders said the Postal Joint Council of Action
(PJCA) would review the situation in light of the fresh talks with
the departmental authorities.
</P>
<P>
The postmen began an indefinite national strike Thursday which
disrupted services in most parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Around 90 percent of the postal employees stayed away from work
in most states, said organizers of the strike, the National
Federation of Postal Employees (NFPE) and the Federation of
National Postal Organizations (FNPO).
</P>
<P>
The two major unions listed nine demands including improved pay
scales and revision of bonus formula by removing the 40-day
ceiling for permanent employees while Communications Minister
Sushma Swaraj appealed to the employees to call off the strike as
their demands were being considered.
</P>
<P>
NFPE Secretary General R. L. Bhattacharya said Saturday
afternoon that they would not call off the strike till all of
their demands were met and the strike leaders had decided to
intensify the agitation from Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision was taken at a meeting of the PJCA soon
after talks with senior department officials.
</P>
<P>
Strike leaders claimed that the government agreed in its
proposals offered during the talks Saturday afternoon to consider
the demands for revised pay scales, leave facilities, status and
payment of gratuity.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the strike said Thursday that postal staff had
submitted a 10-point charter of demands last year to the
Department of Posts and had subsequently called off a similar
indefinite strike last November following assurances from the
government.
</P>
<P>
However, they said, neither the government nor the department
concerned looked into their demands, forcing them to go on strike.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, eight central government employees' unions belonging
to income tax, audit and accounts, telecom and telegraph
departments expressed their support to the postal strikers and
offered solidarity.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Visits Libya for First Time in 4 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat left Gaza Saturday for a visit to
Libya, a country opposing holding an Arab summit on Mideast peace
as proposed by Arafat.
</P>
<P>
This is Arafat's first visit to the country since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian radio Voice of Palestine reported that Arafat
went to see Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who underwent a medical
operation last week.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said that Arafat would travel to Tripoli
by car from Tunisia after the United States blocked a request for
an exemption to the U.N. sanctions to allow him to fly there.
</P>
<P>
Libya has rejected Arafat's proposal that an Arab summit be
held to coordinate Arab stands over the stalled peace process,
complaining that the PNA failed to keep Tripoli informed of the
development of the situation.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed no-fly sanctions on Libya after it refused to
hand over to the U.S. two Libyans suspected of blowing up an
American airline in 1988. A total of 270 peoples were killed in
the incident.

<HEADLINE> Third FIFA Women's World Cup to Be Held in United States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, Jyly 11 (Xinhua) -- The 3rd Women's World Cup will be
held in the United States next year with 16 participating teams,
four more than the previous two editions of the tournament, FIFA
announced here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The inaugural Women's World Cup was held in Guangzhou of China
while the second was played in Sweden in 1995.
</P>
<P>
FIFA president Sepp Blatter said the women's World Cup is among
three major football competitions for 1999. The 2nd Conferdation
Cup will be held in Mexico in January while the FIFA Under-21
Championships will be held in Nigeria in March.
</P>
<P>
Alan Rothenburg, president of the United States Soccer
Federation, said the tournament will be played in seven cities from
coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
"The opening game will be played in the Giant Stadium while the
championship game will be held in the Rose Bowl stadium, exactly the
same as in the 1994 World Cup finals." said Rothenburg.
</P>
<P>
Donna de Varona, president of the local organising committee,
said all the 32 matches of the tournament will be televised for the
first time in the history of Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Varona also said with the larger stadiums and increased interest
in women's soccer, the 1999 Women's World Cup could attract more
spectators than ever before.
</P>
<P>
Among the 16 participating teams, the United States qualify
automatically as hosts. Brazil, which won the South American Women's
Soccer Championship in March of 1998, and Italy which won the Group
2 in European Qualifying, both have booked a berth in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Japan, the
top three teams in the Asian Women's Football Championship, all
qualified for the 1999 Women's World Cup.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Germany for Political Settlement in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of Russia and
Germany said Saturday that the Kosovo issue can only be settled
through political means.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after their meeting, Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and his German counterpart,
Klaus Kinkel, said real autonomy should be given to Kosovo and the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's territorial integrity should be
preserved.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel was here on a brief working visit.
</P>
<P>
Primakov stressed that as an inseparable part of Yugoslavia,
Kosovo, even if it gets autonomy, should not seek secession and
assume the name "Greater Albania."
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is a region in Yugoslavia's Serb Republic. Ethnic
Albanians account for 90 percent of the population in Kosovo,
where militant Albanian groups are pressing for independence from
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between federal forces and the militant Albanians have
resulted in the death of more than 300 people.
</P>
<P>
"We are bearing great responsibility for the state of affairs
in Kosovo and agreed to act in close contact," Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders noted the "positive influence" of a recent
meeting between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Milosevic has been showing restraint since that meeting,"
Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel, for his part, praised Russia's role in trying to settle
the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
"Russia plays an important role in the resolution of the Kosovo
problem," the Itar-Tass news agency quoted Kinkel as saying.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Cabinet Approves Signing of Land Mine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian cabinet Saturday
approved the signing of an international anti-land mine treaty
which bans the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of
anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian official news agency Petra quoted Jordanian Queen
Noor as announcing that "as of this morning, the Jordanian
government approved the signing of the Ottawa convention and it
will now proceed with the constitutional arrangements for signing
and ratification."
</P>
<P>
Queen Noor was addressing the opening ceremony of the 1st
Middle East Conference on Land mines and Rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has not imported land mines since 1974 and will never
import them anymore, said the queen at the meeting which is
devoted to discussing ways of assisting land mine victims in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom has cleared 65,000 mines in the past five years and
the work is still being continued, she told the meeting, sponsored
by the land mine Survivors Network, a private organization based
in Washington D.C., the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, the work goes slowly because of lack of equipment and
necessary technical assistance, she added.
</P>
<P>
There are still 185,000 mines remaining in the territory of
the kingdom, the bulk of which are planted along the border with
Israel after the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
The Ottawa convention was reached in Canada last
December. Altogether 127 nations have signed it, but only 23 of
them have ratified it.
</P>
<P>
There are now some 300,000 people around the world living with
injuries from land mines and every month some 800 people are
killed and 1,200 are maimed by land mines, according to reports by
Petra.

<HEADLINE> Verdict on Tehran Mayor to Be Announced Within 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The verdict on the fate of Tehran
Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi will be issued within the next 10
days, the judge in charge of the controversial case Mohseni Ejei
announced here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to local reporters at the end of the final court
hearing, Ejei said seven to ten days after the defendant
Karbaschi and his lawyers gave their final defense and documents
to the court, the verdict will be issued.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, Ejei said he has
planned to announce the verdict on the case at a press
conference, adding that Karbaschi's services could affect the
verdict and he can lodge any complaints after the ruling is
issued.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was put on an open trial since June 4 on graft
charges. But he rejected the accusations against him during the
past seven sessions of hearing.
</P>
<P>
The mayor's case became a hot topic between the country's
rival political factions. The moderates criticized that the case
was politically motivated by the conservatives with an aim to
weaken the government of President Mohammad Khatami since
Karbaschi has been a strong supporter of Khatami.
</P>
<P>
After Karbaschi was temporally detained in April, Khatami
appealed to the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to release
him and Khamenei accepted Khatami's proposal, ordering the
judiciary to follow the case in a just circumstances.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Supports Russian Anti-Crisis Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 11 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin Saturday
telephoned Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in a fresh
attempt to rally support for Russia's anti-crisis program from
world leaders.
</P>
<P>
"During the exchange of views on the complex situation on the
international and Russian financial markets, Ryutaro Hashimoto
praised the stabilization program worked out by the Russian
government," the Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Russian
presidential press service as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Given international experience, the Japanese prime minister
expressed his confidence that a speedy implementation of measures
contained in the program will make it possible to reach a positive
effect in the financial and economic sphere in the near future,"
the press service said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's conversation with Hashimoto came after his telephone
calls to leaders of France, Germany, the United States and the
head of the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The flurry of calls were seen as attempts to press for a speedy
approval of a stabilization loan of 10-15 billion U.S. dollars
from international financial institutions to stabilize the Russian
financial market and prop up the ruble, which is under increasing
pressure to devaluate.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Itar-Tass reported that talks on
the stabilization credit between Kremlin's financial envoy Anatoly
Chubais and director of the IMF European Department John
Odling-smee ended Saturday.
</P>
<P>
No details of the results were available, but earlier in the
day, a Chubais aide said the IMF delegation acknowledged that
Russia had made "considerable progress in the development of a
program for stabilizing the national economy."
</P>
<P>
However, the delegation insisted that some issues still needed
to be worked out, Itar-Tass quoted Andrei Trapeznikov as saying.

He was quoted as saying that "Israel doesn't listen to the
voice of justice and ignore the agreements signed (with Arabs)."
</P>
<P>
He pointed his finger at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, saying "that person refuses to accept any
international initiatives which are designed to achieve a full,
just and lasting peace in the region."
</P>
<P>
Kadoumy said his visit came when Arab countries were
undergoing a dangerous phase which needs Arabs' solidarity and
unified steps in order to decide the fate of this region.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian track in the peace process is currently stalled
as Israel refuses to accept a United States plan for an Israeli
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli negotiations with Lebanon and Syria have been
deadlocked for nearly two years after Netanyahu came to power in
June, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official said that during his visit, he will
hold talks with Lebanese leaders on bilateral ties and latest
developments in the region.

<HEADLINE> Defence Key to Final against Brazil: Deschamps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- French captain Didier Deschamps said
water-tight defence would be the key factor in their World Cup final
against Brazil.
</P>
<P>
"Defence is the key to the game," said Deschamps in the French
training base in Clairefontaine outside Paris on Saturday. "We're
going to have to be very strong physically and cut off the supply to
their forwards.
</P>
<P>
"We must be organized and disciplined... We have a really strong
team spirit and I admire the self-belief of each individual player,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Up until now I don't have any regrets. We're going to be
part of a memorable and historic event on Sunday and there are only 90
minutes left for France to go down in history."
</P>
<P>
Deschamps said Brazil was still a formidable team but they also had
weakpoints to take advantage of.
</P>
<P>
He added: "Brazil's game is the best in the world, so obviously it
doesn't suit anyone. However like all teams, they have their weakness
and it's up to us to take advantage of this."

<HEADLINE> Diplomatic Row Hurts Belarussian Tourist Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's decision to
deny entry visas to top Belarussian officials has "boomeranged on
ordinary people" and hit Belarus' tourist industry, the Interfax
news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman with the Alatan-Tour company said tours to France
have been called off over the last few days, and the lack of visas
will compel tourists to cancel future trips.
</P>
<P>
The row between Minsk and the EU broke out in June when
diplomatic envoys living in the Drozdy complex were asked to leave
so as to facilitate the overhaul of the buildings.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats refused to move and the stand-off finally led to
the recall of ambassadors of the United States, European Union
countries, Poland and Japan, plunging Minsk's ties with those
countries to a low point.
</P>
<P>
"The EU decision may level a heavy punch on the tourist
business in Belarus," Interfax quoted the spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Belarussian government has condemned the EU move as
imposing political pressure on Minsk.
</P>
<P>
Belarus' relations with the West have been rocky in recent
years and President Alexander Lukasheno has attributed it to
Minsk's closer integration with Russia and its staunch opposition
to NATO's eastward expansion.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Insists on Selling Scrap Iraqi Tankers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait reiterated Saturday
that it has the right, under United Nations resolutions, to sell
several scrap Iraqi tankers that have been laying in the Gulf for
over eight years.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad
Al-Sabah told reporters after attending the National Assembly
session that Kuwait has authorization from the United Nations to
sell the Iraqi tankers.
</P>
<P>
Sabah said that Kuwait has drafted a reply memorandum to a
letter from Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed al-Sahhaf to the
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan protesting the Kuwait
plan.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi letter of last week said that Kuwait plans to sell
five Iraqi oil tankers as scrap to unnamed parties for 16.5
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah confirmed that the state-owned Kuwait Petroleum
Corporation has been assigned to sell the tankers.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the Kuwaiti Oil Ministry has said that the
five Iraqi oil tankers have been destroyed during the 1991 Gulf
war in which the allied forces helped drive invading Iraqi
soldiers out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sanctions Committee of the United Nations has
decided to consider the scrap tankers as war booty and registered
internationally as the property of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has accused Iraq for stealing and destroying billions of
U.S. dollars' worth of Kuwaiti property during the 1990-91
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Under Security Council resolutions, Iraq must return or pay
compensation for Kuwaiti property before the Council will
consider removing sanctions imposed on Baghdad after the
war.

<P>
PARIS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Roberto Carlos has two
objectives in his mind when his team clashes with defending champions
Brazil on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
As a defender he is one of key chains of the Brazilian defence
while as a player eager to dash forward to aid the attacks he also
wants to score goals.
</P>
<P>
"The powder is in the cannon," said Carlos on Saturday in the
Brazilian training camp in Ozoir-la-Ferrier outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
"If God gives me the chance, I only have to shoot. I'm naturally
referring to the free kick goal I made last year against Fabien
Barthez at the Tournoi de France," he said.
</P>
<P>
Carlos scored the only Brazilian goal in their 1-1 tie against
France in that game in Lyon, blasting an extraordinary curved kick
from 30 meters.
</P>
<P>
As to their opponents in the final, he said: "I may be too
confident. But if the Frenchmen win, I'll be the first to congratulate
them."

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Ready to Postpone Deployment of Russian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
said Saturday that he is ready to postpone the deployment of
Russian-made anti-aircraft S-300 missiles if talks on the Cyprus
issue begin and achieve substantive progress.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at Larnaca Airport before his departure for
Russia, where he will be guest of honor at the opening of the
World Youth Games to be held in the Russian capital, at the
invitation of Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov, Cyprus News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Clerides told reporters that he stated the position in his
recent reply letter to U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
concerning the deployment of S-300 missiles.
</P>
<P>
The president said he assured Albright that Cyprus is ready to
cancel the order for the Russian-made missiles if the Turks
accept his proposal to open talks on a reduction of forces and the
demilitarization of the island.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government ordered the S-300 missiles from Russia
in January 1997 to boost its defense. The missiles are expected to
be deployed later this year.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his four-day visit to Moscow, Clerides described
it as a courtesy but substantive visit.
</P>
<P>
He said he would hold talks with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin on Monday, that will focus on issues "of common interest."
</P>
<P>
Clerides added that he would exchange views on the Cyprus
problem, its current position and issues of interest to both
countries with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Clerides' trip to Moscow takes place only two days after a test
firing of S-300 missiles in Russia, which was watched by Cypriot
Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou and Commander of the National
Guard Greek Lt. General Dimitris Demou.
</P>
<P>
The controversial missile deal has angered Turkey and the
Turkish Cypriots, who said their security would be seriously
threatened by the missiles that have a range of 150 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has vowed to take all necessary measures to prevent the
deployment of the missiles on the island.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz warned Friday that his
country would bring missiles to the occupied northern areas if
the Cypriot government went ahead with the deployment of the
missiles.
</P>
<P>
If the missiles are deployed, "tension will increase in Cyprus
and an armed conflict could arise, and we won't be the losers,"
Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
Greece, which has a joint defense pact with Cyprus, has also
warned that it will come to the aid of Cyprus if Turkey takes
action to prevent the deployment of the missiles.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies, have long been at odds
over, among other things, this strategic eastern Mediterranean
island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey landed and
took over the northern third of the island in 1974 after a
short-lived Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in the north, recognized
only by Turkey, which maintains 35,000 troops there.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges U.S. to Do More to Save Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
Saturday reiterated his country's support to the U.S. initiative
to save the Mideast peace process and urged more steps.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt backs the U.S. initiative aiming at salvaging the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, but the plan is a step which
should be followed by several others," he said in an interview
with the Cairo-based Voice of Arabs Radio over telephone from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Moussa voiced his pessimism over the stalemate facing the
Mideast peace process in light of the recent adverse developments
in the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Under the American plan, already accepted by the Palestinians
and rejected by Israel, Washington calls for Israeli troops'
pullout from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who arrived in Washington on Thursday, conferred late
Friday night with U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross on the Mideast
peace process which has been stalled for 16 months.
</P>
<P>
Moussa's talks in the U.S. will also cover the latest
developments in Iraq, Libya, Sudan, the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister met with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright earlier Friday to lay down the basis of a
strategic dialog between the two countries to promote bilateral
relations through periodical discussions.
</P>
<P>
In the interview with the radio, he said the strategic talks
constitute an attempt to bolster relations between the two
countries in various domains.
</P>
<P>
The strategic dialog has been termed by both sides as a way to
establish fast communication channels between the Egyptian Foreign
Ministry and the U.S. State Department for better mutual
understanding and swifter handling of problems.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Portuguese government has
begun implementing the sanctions adopted by the United Nations
Secu/ity Council against the Angolan opposition movement.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on June 12 passed the No.1173
Resolution on imposing sanctions against the National Union for
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The Angolan News Agency Saturday quoted a source from the
Portuguese foreign ministry as saying that the ministry has
notified the government departments concerned to strictly carry
out the U.N. resolution in a bid to press the UNITA to implement
the 1994 Lusaka Peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said that Portugal's State Bank under the
Finance Ministry has been notified to carry out sanctions against
the UNITA.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the Portuguese Foreign Ministry, the
European Union (EU) has decided to implement the U.N. resolution
on sanctions against UNITA. As an EU member, the sources said,
Portugal has the responsibility to immediately carry out the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that EU decided to implement the U.N.
sanctions against the UNITA in Brussels Wednesday. In a "common
stance" taken by the EU, all of its 15 member states will carry
out the U.N. resolution on the Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
Q~s stipulated in the U.N. resolution, the money deposi{ted in
foreign banks by UzVNITA, its leaders and their relatives should be
frozen, and without the permission of the government of national
unity, diamonds exported by the UNITA are totally banned.
Meanwhile, it is banned to trade in mining equipment or to
provide mining services in the areas not controlled by the
Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the U.N. sanctions is to cut the
financial sources of the Angolan opposition group.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A team of foreign pathologists
performing the autopsy of late Chief Moshood Abiola of Nigeria
have ruled out any case of poisoning of the opposition leader who
died Tuesday afternoon in detention.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the preliminary outcome of the autopsy, the
pathologists said here Saturday evening that the autopsy was
carried out in a neutral hospital under the supervision of
Abiola's family, the Nigerian Medical Association and
representatives of the federal government, the state television
station reported.
</P>
<P>
The final report of the autopsy will come later after the
outcome is checked by experts abroad, probably in the United
States, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Abiola, the late opposition leader of the most populous
African country, was buried Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people attended the funeral in good order under
tight security protection.
</P>
<P>
Abiola, the presumed winner of the annulled June 12, 1993
presidential election, died at a meeting with government
officials and a high-level United States delegation to discuss
issues on his release from four years of detention.
</P>
<P>
The government announced the business-politician died of heart
attack, but some of his relatives were suspicious and requested
for an autopsy to make sure that he died a natural death.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere at the funeral was generally peaceful but it is
the fear of many observers that after they get on the streets
this evening, supporters of Abiola who are angry at his untimely
death may go on demonstrations which had triggered riots in the
last few days.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 people have reportedly died during the violent
demonstrations.

<HEADLINE> Syria Calls for Enhancing European Role in Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Speaker of People's
Council Abdel Kader Kaddura Saturday urged the European states to
enhance their role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the 16th meeting of the
Arab-European dialog on behalf of Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad,
Kaddura said that Europe has many cards that can be used in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Europe has a political weight comparable to its economic one
that can be used, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We hope for a greater European role, exceeding mere statements
that are no longer sufficient in deterring (Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin) Netanyahu's extremist government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Syria believes that the positions adopted by the previous
European Union summits will get the Netanyahu government
understand that the occupation of the Arab land, the violation of
the rights of its owners and the defiance of the U.N. resolutions
will lead to political and economic and isolation, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government must understand that the only way for
evading such isolation is to give up its expansionist policy and
to implement the signed agreements as well as the U.N.
resolutions, the Syrian speaker added.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that peace is the strategic option for the Arabs
if it is based on U.N. resolutions and the land-for-peace
principle.

CAIRO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
Cairo -- The Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OAPEC) said that Egypt has become one of the most active
countries in the field of oil and gas exploration as it has scored
the highest rates of discoveries last year among the Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt made 55 oil and gas discoveries last year and accounted
for 63 percent of the discoveries due to the intensification of
exploration activities that led to 35 discoveries, local daily
Al-Ahram reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Abu-Dhabi -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) urged its partners
in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to
commit themselves to the resolution adopted on July 1 to bring
down their oil production by 2.6 million barrels a day from the
figures of last February.
</P>
<P>
The recent Vienna declaration is the strong basis for the OPEC
success in restoring equilibrium to the oil market and raising the
oil prices, the UAE News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The UAE government's call follows the decline in the oil prices
amidist reports that some oil producing countries violate their
commitments to the implementation of the recent OPEC resolution.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwait will set up a "businessmen office" to
offer all kinds of services to visiting businessmen, Minister of
Commerce and Industry Abdel Aziz Al-Dekheel said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Dekheel told Kuwait News Agency that services of the office
include facilitation entry into Kuwait for businessmen, providing
information about the various sectors, laws of Kuwait, the
industrial and trade regulations, the foreign investment and the
free trade zone, as well as immediately resolving their problems.
</P>
<P>
He said the office will be affiliated to the Undersecretary of
Commerce and Industry. It will have a reception hall in Kuwait's
international airport to receive businessmen and will receive
service applications during the day and afternoon, Dekheel
said.

<HEADLINE> Six Rwandan Genocide Suspects Moved to UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Six suspects of the 1994
Rwanda genocide have been transferred to the detention facility
of the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
(ICTR) in Arusha, northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the tribunal Saturday said that four
suspects and one accused person, arrested in west Africa last
month, and another suspect who has surrendered himself to the
tribunal, Friday joined others at the detention facility in a
Tanzanian prison on the outskirt of Arusha, bringing the total
number of the detainees to 31.
</P>
<P>
The release said the first suspect is Mathieu Ngirumpatse, a
former director-general of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
president of the former Rwandan ruling party MRND (mouvement
republicain national pour la democtratie et le development). He
was arrested on June 11 in Mali.
</P>
<P>
The others are Edouard Karemera, former interior minister in
the interim government of Rwanda during the genocide and former
vice-president of MNRD; Joseph Nzirorera, former President of the
National Assembly and Secretary-General of the MRND; Omar
Serushago, a businessman and local leader of the Interahamwe
Militia in the Giseny prefecture; the accused person, Emmanuel
Bagambiki, former prefect of Cyangugu; Bernard Ntuyahaga, an
officer in charge of logistics at the Kigali military camp.
</P>
<P>
A total of 35 suspects have been indicted so far by the ICTR
founded by the United Nations following the Rwanda massacre in
April 1994 soon after the Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana died
when his plane was shot down over the capital Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one million people, mostly Tutsis and moderate Hutus,
were reportedly killed in the three-month slaughter.

<HEADLINE> Intensified Nationwide Anti-Corruption Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, July 12 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Wang Zhongyu
has called for intensifying the nationwide anti-corruption
drive by exerting greater effort to eliminate unhealthy tendencies
existing in various departments and trades.
</P>
<P>
He issued the appeal during the three-day national conference
on the rectification of the style of work, which ended here today
in the city of Changchun in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Wang stressed that key departments must place priority on major
issues related to the rectification effort.
</P>
<P>
He specifically pointed out the need to earnestly handle issues
such as examining non-budgeted funds and easing burdens on farmers
and enterprises, both of which are vital to nation's overall
development.
</P>
<P>
Wang stressed that the media must be granted full reign to
report unhealthy tendencies, and cases involving infringements on
the rights and interests of the people or excessive levies on
farmers and enterprises must be exposed to public.
</P>
<P>
He Yong, deputy secretary of the Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China, noted the
smooth and orderly progress of the rectification during 1998. He
noted the basis fulfillment of tasks related to relieving burdens
on farmers and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
China has abolished 20,713 illicit charge items involving some
50 billion yuan ( about 6 billion U.S. dollars) since last July,
according to He.

<HEADLINE> Pak-Iran Joint Team to Visit Afghanistan Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Iran will shortly
resume "shuttle diplomacy" to bring Afghanistan's Taliban militia
and the opposition Northern Alliance to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
A joint team of Pakistani and Iranian officials will visit
Afghanistan "very soon" for talks with the Taliban and leaders of
the opposition alliance as part of the shuttle diplomacy the two
countries launched late June, a report by the News Network
International said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On June 30 and July 1, a two-member Pak-Iran joint delegation
traveled together for the first time to Mazar-e-Sharif in northern
Afghanistan and the southern city of Kandahar and held talks
respectively with leaders of the Northern Alliance and the
Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The joint team for the next trip is likely to comprise
Pakistan's envoy on Afghanistan Iftikhar Murshid and his Iranian
counterpart Alaedin Boroujerdi, the report quoted official sources
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iftikhar Murshid paid a visit to Iran recently and held
follow-up consultations about the Pak-Iran joint team's trip to
Afghanistan, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides discussed various proposals to put on track the
Afghan peace talks which broke down in Islamabad on May 3, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban and the Northern Alliance held peace talks in the
Pakistani capital late April, but the dialogue collapsed later.
Pakistan and Iran's efforts paved the way for the first ever
face-to-face talks between the two rivals, said the report.
</P>
<P>
During Iftikhar Murshid's visit to Tehran, the report further
said that Pakistan and Iran agreed to continue joint efforts to
promote another visit to Mazar-e-Sharif and Kandahar soon to
inform the Northern Alliance and the Taliban about the outcome of
the Tehran's consultations.

TOKYO -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said Sunday
that the setback suffered by his ruling Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) is his responsibility entirely and he will decide what to do
about it.
</P>
<P>
"It is all my responsibility. I will decide my move as a
politician on my own," Hashimoto said in a television program.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said he had asked LDP Secretary General Koichi Kato
to hold a LDP executive meeting Monday, indicating he would reveal
his decision at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto is likely to be forced to step down to take
responsibility for the LDP's setback in Sunday's House of
Councillors election.
</P>
<P>
The LDP is expected to end up with less than 55 seats, far
short of its 61 seats being contested in the triennial election,
according to a Kyodo News exit poll.
</P>
<P>
Following reports on the LDP setback in the election Sunday
night, an LDP source told Kyodo that Hashimoto, who is also the
LDP head, will "announce his resignation today or tomorrow."

LONDON -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Sunday condemned
an arson attack which left three boys dead in Balymoney as "an act
of Barbarism."
</P>
<P>
"Nothing can possibly justify an act of barbarism that leads to
the loss of three young lives," Blair said in a statement. "These
people should not, and will not, thwart the will of the vast
majority of people who believe in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"Evil and vicious sectarian murders must not be allowed to
triumph," he added.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said the fire at Ballymoney, 65 kilometers
northwest of Belfast, started at about 4:30 a.m. local time (0330
GMT) when the attackers "ignited some sort of device." The dead
children were brothers aged 10, nine and seven.
</P>
<P>
Three adults who were also in the house were taken to hospital
for treatment. (BRITAIN-N.Ireland-BLAIR)

<HEADLINE> 1.40b Dollars Converted in Pak Rupee: Pak Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The domestic banks have so far
converted frozen foreign currency worth 1.40 billion U.S. dollars,
the News Network International quoted Pakistani Finance Minister
Sartij Aziz as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that till May 28 when the Pakistani government
announced freezing of foreign currency accounts, the country's
foreign exchange was reportedly above 11 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government did so to retain dollar for two reasons: to
preserve foreign exchange and to store maximum dollar in order to
counter the possible suspension of loan from the International
Monetary Fund to pre-empt default, he said.
</P>
<P>
The domestic banks have converted foreign exchange equal to
1.40 billion dollars into rupees so far and the process is still
continued, said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Minister made it clear that the government would
not de-freeze foreign currency accounts frozen immediately after
Pakistan's detonating of nuclear devices on May 28.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the new foreign currency accounts, which were
opened on or after July 1, would be operative and the people can
deposit and draw foreign currency without any problem.
</P>
<P>
The government has announced the official exchange rate of 46
rupees to a dollar, and these days dollar-rupee parity in the open
market is in a narrow range of 53 to 55 because of the dearth of
the greenback in Pakistan after the freezing of foreign currency
accounts.

<HEADLINE> Top Orangeman Urges End to N.Irish Stand-off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior member of Protestant
Orange Order in Portadown, Northern Ireland, called on Sunday for
an end to the Drumcree protests that lasted for a week.
</P>
<P>
The Reverend William Bingham said the situation was out of
control and a parade from Drumcree church down Portadown's
Garvaghy Road was a goal no longer worth pursuing.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the Orange Order needs to call off its protest
because we cannot control them," he said in a church sermon.
</P>
<P>
"Drumcree is rapidly getting out of our hands. We have to back
off from that," said Bingham, a senior Orange negotiator and
chaplain to the Order in county Armagh.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking only hours after three young Roman Catholic
boys died in what police said was a sectarian arson attack on
their home.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the arson attack, Bingham said, "After last
night's atrocious attack, a 15-minute walk down the Garvaghy Road
would be a hollow victory in the shadow of the coffins of three
children."
</P>
<P>
The Orange Order, the biggest of a number of Protestant
fraternities that hold an annual Summer "marching season", is
determined to parade through Portadown's Catholic Garvaghy Road as
part of celebrations marking the 1690 victory of William of Orange
over Catholic King James.
</P>
<P>
But the parade has been barred by the independent Parades
Commission and since last Sunday thousands of Orangemen and their
supporters have clashed with police and soldiers at Portadown, 50
km southwest of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The eight-day stand-off at Portadown has been followed by
widespread riots and violence across the divided province.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Orange Order has refused to accept any linkage
between their stand-off at Drumcree and violence elsewhere in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the independent Parades Commission on Sunday turned
down a renewed Orange Order application for a march down the
Garvaghy Road.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Initiate Time-Befitting Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
politically determined and committed to initiating a
time-befitting population policy, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Her government would implement the policy in letter and spirit
to stop a population boom in the country, Hasina told the
inaugural session of the World Population Day function, jointly
organized by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the
United Nations Population Fund.
</P>
<P>
She underscored the need to create mass awareness among the
people so that the movement for curbing population explosion in
the country could be a total success.
</P>
<P>
The poor parents of the country wished to produce many children
so that they could be helped by their offspring when getting old,
she said, which had caused the rapid population growth.
</P>
<P>
"If we could develop a kind of social security for them ... the
poor people would not go for many children," the prime minister
noted.
</P>
<P>
Population was a kind of asset for some countries, but it was a
matter of deep concern for developing countries like Bangladesh,
she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Her government would spend 28.59 billion taka (about 608
million U.S. dollars) in the population sector by the year 2002
under the country's Fifth Five-Year Plan, she added.
</P>
<P>
Hasina called on political parties, social and voluntary
organizations to make an united effort to make the huge population
of the country into potential human resources.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, with an area of about 144,000 square kilometers and
a population of about 127 million at present, has one of the
world's highest population density of about 880 people per square
kilometer.

JERUSALEM, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli opposition Labor Party
leader Ehud Barak said here Sunday that he welcomes former Chief
of General Staff Amnon Lipkin Shahak to join his party.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Barak said that if Shahak
decides to take up political carrier, he will welcome Shahak "with
open arms."
</P>
<P>
Barak reportedly wanted that Shahak could thereby enter as the
party's No. 2 and his candidate for defense minister.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Shahak said on Sunday morning that until now
he has not arranged a meeting with Barak to discuss this issue.
</P>
<P>
Shahak, who had been Lieutenant General and left the post of
chief of general staff last week, enjoys high prestige in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Since Shahak prepared to close his 36-year service in Israeli
army several weeks ago, he has indicated that he was considering
a public or political position rather than private business.

TOKYO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto is likely to face strong calls for his resignation
because of the setback his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
is expected to suffer in Sunday's House of Councillors election,
the Kyodo News service reported.
</P>
<P>
The LDP is expected to end up with less than 55 seats, far
short of its 61 seats being contested in the triennial election,
shows a Kyodo exit poll.
</P>
<P>
Following reports on the LDP setback in the election Sunday
night, an LDP source told Kyodo that Hashimoto, who is also the
LDP head, will "announce his resignation today or tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
If Hashimoto resigns, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi and former
Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama are the likely candidates
to become his successor, Kyodo quoted LDP sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The LDP also plans to ask some opposition parties, including
the New Peace Party and the Komei party, to join hands with the
LDP in a partial alliance.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto was scheduled to visit France and the United States
from July 19 but the election result may change this, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Import 200 Double-decker Buses from China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- A Bangladeshi company will import
200 double-decker buses from China to facilitate the capital city
of Dhaka's transport system.
</P>
<P>
The agreement in this regard was signed here Sunday between
Bangladesh's Nitol Group and China's Tianjin Machinery Import and
Export Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of Chinese double-decker buses would further
improve the city's transport system, Bangladeshi State Minister
for Foreign Affairs Abdul Hasan Chowdhury said at the signing
ceremony.

"I am sure the city dwellers would be extremely benefited with
the introduction of the double-decker buses as they are safe,

<HEADLINE> Yangtze Navigation Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Surging flood waters along the
Yangtze, China's longest river, have forced the suspension of
navigation in the Three Gorges area.
</P>
<P>
A water diversion canal, one of two navigation channels built
following blockage of the river last November to facilitate
construction of the massive Three Gorges Dam, was closed on
Saturday night when the excessively rapid flow rate threatened the
safety of vessels, according to the Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
A temporary lock, the second channel, was closed on July 10 and
all navigation in the section has been temporarily suspended.
</P>
<P>
Other modes of transportation have been provided for stranded
passengers, according to the local navigation management
department.
</P>
<P>
Last night's closure marks the first since the 3.5-km canal
entered operations in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that vessels negotiating the canal enjoy
maximum safety when the water flow rate is less than 20,000
cu.m. per second. However, the flow rate hit 50,000 cu.m. per
second on Saturday night when the flood peak entered the Three
Gorges section. The rate is not expected to abate until sometime
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The closure will quite likely last for another several days due
to the fact the resumption of navigation depends on the flow rate
dropping to at least 35,000 cu.m. per second. Experts also noted
that the lock will be functional with a flow rate of 45,000
cu.m. per second.
</P>
<P>
The canal and lock were designed to remain fully functional until
the year 2003.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Oil Minister Leaves for Syria on Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed
Rashid left here Sunday for Syria on a visit which is regarded as
another step to resume normal bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency quoted Rashid as say before his
departure that his visit was in response to an invitation
extended by Syrian Oil Minister Maher Hosni Jamal.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi oil minister said he and his delegation will discuss
with Syrian officials means of further promoting bilateral oil
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Syria was the only Arab state that sided with Iran during the
1980-88 Iran-Iraq war and joined the allied forces in the Gulf War
in 1991 which drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
However, the countries have started mending fences with
exchanging official visits. During the latest weapons inspection
crisis between Iraq and the United Nations in February this year,
Syria was strongly opposed to U.S. military strikes against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Labor Exports Decline in First Half of 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam sent about 5,000 workers
abroad in the first half of this year, a reduction of eight
percent from the same period last year, Vietnam News Agency (VNA)
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This brings the total number of Vietnamese out-of-country
workers to date to 45,000, sources from the Overseas Labor
Management Bureau (OLMB) under Vietnam's Ministry of Labour, War
Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) told the VNA.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Labor exports have sharply dropped due to both the
reduction of the number of countries where Vietnamese workers are
working and the fierce competition from other regional countries.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the drop is the current Southeast Asian
financial crisis, which has caused a lot of difficulties to some
countries which employ Vietnamese workers.
</P>
<P>
MOLISA advocates efforts to both maintain the existing markets,
namely South Korea, Japan and Libya, and to develop new markets
such as Brunei, Latin American countries and Gulf states, the VNA
quoted OLMB deputy director Pham Do Nhat Tan as saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and Egypt Sunday signed
minutes of medical cooperation to boost ties in the health and
medicinal fields, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the minutes signed by Iraqi Health Minister Omed Mehdat
Mubarak and his Egyptian counterpart Ismail Salam, three
committees will be set up in curative, preventive and
pharmaceutical fields to coordinate and organize meetings between
the two ministries.
</P>
<P>
The minutes provide for promoting bilateral relations in the
fields of medicine, health and exchanging expertise and visits
between Iraq and Egypt, said the news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian health minister, who arrived here on Friday
leading a large medical delegation, started talks on Saturday with
Iraqi officials to discuss means of upgrading medicinal industry
of both countries as well as arranging reciprocal visits.
</P>
<P>
The two health ministers also met with representatives of
Egyptian medicinal companies and discussed with them on how to
increase the volume of Iraq's imports of Egyptian medicines and
medical appliances under the U.N.-Iraq oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Under the new and enhanced oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed
to export 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil in six months as
of June 3 this year to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies for its people.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi people are living a hard life under the
U.N. sanctions imposed in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Acknowledges Responsibility for LDP Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto said Sunday that the setback suffered by his ruling
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is his responsibility entirely and
he will decide what to do about it.
</P>
<P>
"It is all my responsibility. I will decide my move as a
politician on my own," Hashimoto said in a television program.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said he had asked LDP Secretary General Koichi Kato
to hold a LDP executive meeting Monday, indicating he would reveal
his decision at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto is likely to be forced to step down to take
responsibility for the LDP's setback in Sunday's House of
Councillors election.
</P>
<P>
The LDP is expected to end up with less than 55 seats, far
short of its 61 seats being contested in the triennial election,
according to a Kyodo News exit poll.
</P>
<P>
Following reports on the LDP setback in the election Sunday
night, an LDP source told Kyodo that Hashimoto, who is also the
LDP head, will "announce his resignation today or tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
If Hashimoto resigns, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi and former
Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama are the likely candidates
to become his successor, Kyodo quoted LDP sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The LDP also plans to ask some opposition parties, including
the New Peace Party and the Komei party, to join hands with the
LDP in a partial alliance.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto was scheduled to visit France and the United States
from July 19, but the election result may change this, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto has indicated the 61 LDP seats at stake as a win-loss
line. LDP Secretary General Koichi Kato expressed similar views.
</P>
<P>
The LDP fielded 87 candidates, 30 for the proportional
representation slots, under which voters cast their ballots for a

<HEADLINE> Namibia, Zambia Warn UNITA of Stiff Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Namibia and Zambia have warned
Angola's former rebel group, the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), of stiff measures against it if
it continues to defy the Lusaka Peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma said this when he met Zambia's
Vice-President Lieutenant General Christon Tembo at a closed door
meeting Saturday in Namibia's northeastern border city
Katimamulilo.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Sunday quoted Nujoma as saying that the two
countries will take stiff measures against UNITA including
banning the movement from entering the two countries if it fails
to comply with the Lusaka peace accord brokered under the U.N.
auspices to end the civil war in Angola.
</P>
<P>
He stated that his country is concerned about the continued
instability which threatens to derail the 1994 peace agreement
signed in Zambia's capital.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma added that his country will strive to ensure that peace
prevails not only in Angola but the regions as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Zambian vice-president said that there is need
for Zambia and Namibia to join efforts in seeking peace for
Angola.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries have seen the need to combine
efforts as instability in Angola is a threat to peace in
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with Zambia Information Services
shortly after the meeting with Nujoma, Tembo also said that the
influx of Angolan refugees is a threat to the economies of the
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Both Zambia and Namibia will continue to work towards peace to
ensure that there is stability in the region, said Tembo.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the one-day meeting were Zambian Presidential
Affairs Minister Eric Silwanmba and some other senior government
officials.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urged to Be Careful With Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has been urged to be
careful with privatization because some foreign giant
corporations that want to buy some of its companies could dictate
terms to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Chairman and chief executive of the African Working Group
(AWG), Brad Hubbert, said Saturday in Ndola, northern Zambia,
that at least 30 percent of the ownership of the companies being
privatized should remain in the hands of local businessmen,
Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
When he called on Copperbelt Minister Matthew Mulands, Hubbert
said that there is a danger that the major corporations that are
buying companies in Zambia will become monopolies and will
repatriate profits to their countries of origin with no tangible
revenue accruing to the Zambian government.
</P>
<P>
Even after privatization the government is still supposed to
have decision-making power in such companies, said the chairman
of the Atlanda-based body.
</P>
<P>
Another member of the visiting AWG delegation, Deman Rageh,
said that if Zambia's mines go into foreign hands without the
participation of locals it will be tantamount to going back to
neo-colonialism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States government has pledged to help
African countries through the AWG to train small scale
entrepreneurs in enhancing the economy of the continent.
</P>
<P>
Hubbert told Copperbelt small business entrepreneurs that the
U.S. government has embarked on a program to build economic
partnership with the African countries.

<HEADLINE> Firm Management of Charges and Fines Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- China's top discipline inspection
official, Wei Jianxing, recently urged local governments to
strengthen controls over the management of administrative charges
and penalties to prevent corruption.
</P>
<P>
During his recent fact-finding tour of east China's Jiangsu
Province, Wei, secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said that
judicial, industrial, commercial administrative departments across
the country must establish separate agencies for collecting and
disposing of administrative charges and fines as stipulated by
central government regulations.
</P>
<P>
He said local governments should not set quotas for the levies
and fines by judicial and law enforcement departments, but should
also severely punish those found guilty of violating related
management stipulations.
</P>
<P>
Wei instructed concerned local departments to maintain a firm
hand on monitoring and controlling the prohibited use of
communications devices.
</P>
<P>
He noted that related efforts by the end of this year will not
only result in substantial savings, but will also promote Party
practices and gain the respect of the people.
</P>
<P>
Wei toured Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi and Suzhou in Jiangsu
Province between July 3-11.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Unpaid Telephone bill arrears by
former members of the Indian Parliament have amounted to 150
million rupees (about 3.75 million U.S. dollars) since 1979, the
Press of India daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A list of 1,123 defaulters prepared by the Mahanagar Telephone
Nigam LTD (MTNL) on a Mumbai High Court order included present
Union minister Lal Krishna Advani (Home) and George Fernandes
(Defense).
</P>
<P>
Officials said if this high profile list is submitted to the
court, it would cause a lot of embarrassment to the government.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two weeks, they said, MTNL officials have in fact
written letters to the defaulters giving them time till next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to informed sources, an MP filed a public interest
litigation in the Mumbai High Court last September and the court
passed an oral order in June asking MTNL Delhi and Mumbai offices
to submit details of the outstanding telephone bill "applicable
for all ex-MPS of Mumbai and Delhi."
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the court made the matter complicated by
seeking details of phone disconnections and the action taken for
recovery of dues.
</P>
<P>
Because of the political clout of the ex-MPS and orders by a
former minister that no disconnections are made in VIP cases
without his order, it was not possible to take strong action.
</P>
<P>
MTNL has threatened to withdraw the call facility from the
phones of defaulters.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese women are paying closer
attention to reproductive health, according to a recent national
survey on population and reproductive health.
</P>
<P>
Maternity, child health and how to nurture more intelligent
children represent the most important areas of concern for women
of child-bearing age, according to the survey released today by
the State Family Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Some 57 percent of women of child-bearing age expressed
knowledge of venereal diseases and sexually transmitted diseases,
with 63.5 percent expressing an awareness of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Most respondents acquired information
from radio and television programs, as well as newspapers,
magazines, relatives, colleagues or neighbours.
</P>
<P>
Some 75 percent of married women said they were "satisfied or
relatively satisfied with their sex life".
</P>
<P>
The 1997 survey questioned some 16,000 women of child-bearing
age and found the average age for first menstruation was 15.2
years, with the age of menopause averaging 44.8 years.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed that 44.3 percent had little
preliminary knowledge.
</P>
<P>
The results also showed that older women were more vulnerable
to maternity disorders, with women in 5-19 age group accounting
for less than nine percent of sufferers, women aged 30-34
accounting for 30 percent of the total, and those older than 35
for the remaining 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some 63 percent of patients suffering from related disorders
reported to need to see a doctor.
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed great popularity of breast-feeding in
China, with 92.6 percent of newborns enjoying the benefits of the
practice which is considered to be good for a child's immune
system and development.

CAIRO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Jordan Gulf Bank will double its capital to 40
million Jordanian dinars (about 56 million U.S. dollars) over the
next three years, thus becoming the third bank in Jordan to do so
within this year, local newspaper Jordan Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The decision to raise the bank's capital was made to boost the
bank's operations, strengthen its financial status and increase
the public confidence in it, the paper quoted Zuhair Awartani, the
bank's chairman, as saying.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, the Arab Bank and the Housing Bank, two of
the kingdom's top banks, declared in tandem to double capital to
empower themselves in race against local and international banks.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan's total exports of fruits and vegetables in
June reached 46,000 tonnes, worth about 11 million dollars,
sources of the Agricultural Marketing Corporation have said.
</P>
<P>
Vegetables made up 83.7 percent of the total exports, Jordan's
official news agency Petra late Saturday night quoted the sources
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The market of the United Arab Emirates came in the first
place, absorbing 41.5 percent of the total exports. It was
followed by Kuwait (24.3 percent), Qatar (13.5 percent), Bahrain
(11.4 percent), Oman (7.3 percent), Lebanon (0.7 percent) and
Saudi Arabia (0.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
The exports to non-Arab countries were 418 tonnes, or 0.9
percent of the total.

KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah
has said Kuwait welcomes foreign companies' bids for giant
investment in building the country's port facilities.

creation of new exporting ports and facilities, but things will
not be clear in two months.
</P>
<P>
He said the experience of foreign companies is the main
advantage in these offers especially as to operating these ports.
</P>
<P>
However, Saud said the foreign companies' participation will
not cover the natural resources.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, the minister also said his country is
looking forward to transfer of technology and expertise to
increase its oil production to more than 3 million barrels per day
in the coming five years.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Married Chinese Women Adopt Contraception </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 83.8 percent of Chinese
married women of child-bearing age succeeded in the use
contraceptive methods during 1997, according to a State Family
Planning Commission (SFPC) report released today.
</P>
<P>
The use of intrauterine devices (IUD) and other means of
contraceptive methods such as condoms and injections reached 89.7
percent of the total contraceptive methods.
</P>
<P>
One fourth of women who adopted contraceptive methods
experienced failure and became pregnant, according to the national
survey of 186,000 people in 337 cities and counties.
</P>
<P>
Some 63 percent of women received free contraceptive agents and
devices from family planning departments, with 28.6 percent
purchasing the same contraceptive devices from stores.
</P>
<P>
The survey found the average 1997 age of the first marriages of
women was 23.4 years, up 1.5 years from the 1990 figure.
</P>
<P>
China, a country with a massive population of 1.243 billion,
has witnessed a steadily declining birth rate which fell from
22.11 per thousand in 1989 to 16.57 per thousand last
year.

<HEADLINE> Russia Faces Demographical Crisis: U.N. Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The average life expectancy for
Russians dropped by six years in the 1990-1996 period in what
U.N. experts described as an unprecedented demographical crisis.
</P>
<P>
The life expectancy now stands at 59.6 years for men and 72.7
years for women, the U.N. Population Fund's office in Moscow said
in a statement published by the Russian news media Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The experts attributed the drop to higher death rates and lower
birth rates, which were believed to be a result of deteriorated
living conditions, drug abuse and the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The figures were released on the occasion of the U.N.
Population Day, which fell on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Russia's total population is 147.6 million, 31.4 million of
them below the age of 15.
</P>
<P>
The country's death toll among men and women exceeds that in
the United States by 55 percent and 35 percent respectively, and
child mortality is twice the figure of the United States, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Birth rate in Russia dipped to an all-time low by 1997. On
average, every Russian woman of child-bearing age only has one
child.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Population Fund also expressed concern over the rising
number of drug addicts and AIDS cases in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russia registered 2 million drug addicts at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Fund is implementing a number of projects in the country,
including fight against the spread of AIDS and drug abuse, and
studies on the causes of high death rates.

<HEADLINE> Macao SAR Preparatory Committee Passes Important Documents (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Several important documents
concerning Macao's future were passed during the second plenary
session of the Preparatory Committee for the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) which closed today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese rule will end and China will regain sovereignty over
Macao on December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Committee members engaged in thorough discussions and granted
approval for suggestions to accelerate the localization of civil
servants in Macao, the budget for the new special administrative
region in 2000, social security issues and the transitional
arrangements for the issuance of stamps.
</P>
<P>
The committee also passed a proposal for public holidays
between December 20 and 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Vice premier Qian Qichen presented the closing speech and
pointed out that the localization of civil servants has been a
major issue vital to the smooth transition and future operations
of SAR.
</P>
<P>
Qian, chairman of Preparatory Committee, stressed the necessity
to urge the Portuguese side fulfill its responsibility and pledge to
basically realize the localization of civil servants on the
department directors level within 1998.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out the efficiency of Macao's social security
will not only affect the region's stability, livelihood and
economic development, but also the smooth transition and handover.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration stipulates that the
Portuguese government is responsible for the administration of
Macao during the transitional period and bears full responsibility
for the existing social security system.
</P>
<P>
"We're full cognizant that Portuguese-Macao authorities
recently adopted various measures related to social security. The
Chinese Government will continue to provide strong support and
cooperation to the positive measures adopted by the Portuguese
side," said Qian.

The 19.3-kilometer railway line between the cities of Xiamen
and Zhangzhou will join the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway which runs
from inland Jiangxi Province to southeast China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The railway, which is scheduled for completion in one year,

KUWAIT CITY, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE)
rallied Sunday after hitting a record low for the year Saturday,
with the index gaining 38.6 points to close at 2,035.4 points.
</P>
<P>
The volume, transactions and value all took a sharp rise with a
total of 43.51 million shares over 1,436 deals against 21.6
million shares over 715 deals Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The value of shares changed hands also climbed to 9.54 million
Kuwaiti dinars (31.48 million U.S. dollars) from 5.54 million
Kuwaiti dinars (18.28 million U.S. dollars) the previous day.
</P>
<P>
The KSE index crashed to 1,996.8 points Saturday, the first
time dropping below the 2,000-point psychological barrier this
year.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts said that a "wait and see" attitude adopted by
major dealers and the drop in oil prices are the main reasons for
Saturday's slump.
</P>
<P>
Some economists also insisted that the government shoulder
some blame for the slide in the stock market. The government does
not have a precise financial policy, they said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Enters Negotiations With IMF on Financial Bailout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko entered negotiations Sunday with a delegation of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a multi-billion-U.S.-dollar
financial bailout for Russia.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko met with a senior IMF official, John Odling-Smee, in
an effort to reach agreement before financial markets open on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency reported that most of an agreement was
in place, but talks continued on a few remaining issues. Media
reports quoted Russian officials as saying that the agreement will
cover a 10-15 billion-dollar IMF bailout for Russia.
</P>
<P>
The loan package is intended to prop up Russia's ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
Russia also hopes to get a World Bank (WB) loan of 600 to 800
million dollars this October to fund structural economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Both the IMF and WB loan agreements are likely to be
conditional. Both have indicated that key fiscal legislation must
be voted into law by the State Duma, lower house of Russia's
parliament.
</P>
<P>
In May, foreign investors fled Russian financial markets amid a
sharp drop in the prices of Russia's oil exports and a negative
impact of the Asian financial crisis on the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the stock market fell about 50 percent of its
value since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Though the financial crisis has not struck ordinary citizens
yet, a ruble depreciation would raise prices across the country
and could stir social unrest.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin insists that it will not allow a devaluation, but
the pressure is on since devaluation will largely boost Russia's
exports and increase desperately-needed revenues.

<P>
Qian expressed hope that the Portuguese side will cooperate
with China in preparing the 2000 budget in accordance with
Basic Law prior to the handover. He stressed the budget will
strictly be an internal matter hands by the SAR after the handover.
</P>
<P>
Qian said transitional arrangements for the termination of
stamps featuring Portuguese rule over following December 20, 1999,
and transitional stamps issued prior to the handover will
ensure the normal operation of Macao's postal services during the
transition period.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the decision to honor holidays during the
period will not only reflect China's resumption of exercise of
sovereignty over Macao, but will also ensure that institutions and
local residents can prepare for related activities.
</P>
<P>
Qian told committee members that formation of the election
committee for the first chief executive of Macao SAR constitutes a
central task of the Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The election committee will be formed and the chief executive
will be duly elected according to plan. The Preparatory Committee
will solicit the opinions of the general public in Macao to ensure
the democracy and openness of the work," said Qian.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee will use the next two months to form
an independent commission on corruption, auditing department and
customs office for the Macao SAR. It will also determine the
organization of government institutions and define the
responsibilities of leading government officials, as well as
review previous laws, study implementation of China's Nationality
Law in Macao SAR and review a series of economic and financial
issues, according to Qian.

<HEADLINE> Blair Condemns N. Irish Arson as "Act of Barbarism" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
on Sunday condemned an arson attack which left three boys dead in
Balymoney as "an act of Barbarism."
</P>
<P>
"Nothing can possibly justify an act of barbarism that leads to
the loss of three young lives," Blair said in a statement. "These
people should not, and will not, thwart the will of the vast
majority of people who believe in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"Evil and vicious sectarian murders must not be allowed to
triumph," he added.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said the fire at Ballymoney, 65 kilometers
northwest of Belfast, started at about 4:30 a.m. local time (0330
GMT) when the attackers "ignited some sort of device." The dead
children were brothers aged 10, nine and seven.
</P>
<P>
Three adults who were also in the house were taken to hospital
for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The province's Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan confirmed the
arson as a brutal sectarian Murder.
</P>
<P>
"We believe we are investigating the sectarian murder of three
children -- Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn -- asleep in their
beds. That's not protest. That's murder," he said.
</P>
<P>
The incident was the worst in a wave of violence followed the
ban of the Protestant Orangemen parade last Sunday through a
traditional route in Portadown, 50 kilometers southwest of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police have come under nightly attack by extremists,
some of them armed, across Northern Ireland. Catholic families
have been intimidated from their homes.
</P>
<P>
Flanagan appealed to all sides to review their actions in the
light of the escalating violence.

<HEADLINE> Top Israeli-Palestinian Meeting Soon: Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai will meet senior Palestinian official Mahmoud Abbas
(Abu Mazen) soon, Israel Radio quoted a senior source in
Israeli Prime Minister Office as confirming Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli and Palestinian officials have said in the last
few days that the two officials planned to meet in the near future
as the United States is urging urgent direct talks between the
sides to resolve their dispute over the pullback issue.
</P>
<P>
Pressing for a deal over the long overdue Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has
demanded the two sides resume direct talks, saying progress was
impossible without such contacts.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's media adviser
David Bar-Illan expressed satisfaction that Albright backed a key
Israeli demand for holding direct Israeli-Palestinian talks as a
mechanism to resolve the existing problems.
</P>
<P>
"This is what we have been saying for more than a year," he
was quoted by the radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian talks broke down about 16 months ago
when Israel began the construction of a Jewish settlement in the
disputed Arab East Jerusalem in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
In response to the U.S. call for direct talks, the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) has said it would do so only if Israel
publicly accepts the U.S. proposal for a 13.1 percent withdrawal
from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian side is fully ready to resume negotiations at
the moment the Israeli government announces its willingness to
negotiate and its acceptance of the American initiative," the PNA
said in a statement issued after its Cabinet meeting last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, upon return from
Washington talks with U.S. officials, said a meeting between
Mordechai and Mazen, PNA's deputy head, was set several days ago
but Mordechai cancelled it at the last moment.
</P>
<P>
It remained unclear that if the Mordechai-Mazen meeting would
signal that Israel has decided to accept the U.S. pullback plan
which it has rejected so far on security grounds.

<HEADLINE> Balloting for Japan's Upper House Election Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Balloting for Japan's 18th House of
Councillors (upper house) election started Sunday morning amid one
of the country's slowest economic growths since the end of World
War II.
</P>
<P>
The poll is seen as a test of public confidence in Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's economic policies, which have come
under much fire amid the economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
One focal point of the triennial upper house race is whether
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) can retain its 61 seats
being contested, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
If the LDP fails to hold on to all of its pre-election seats,
Hashimoto is expected to be forced to step down, leading to a
change in Japan's political spectrum, they said.
</P>
<P>
"I think I did as much as I can do (during the campaign
period). I really hope for a good result," Hashimoto told
reporters Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
During a 17-day campaign period, Hashimoto reiterated his plea
for trust, while stressing that he intended to embark on tax
reforms that would result in a permanent income tax cut so as to
spur the sluggish Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
Voting, which takes place at about 53,000 polling stations
across Japan, started at 7:00 a.m. (local time). Voting hours
have been extended for two hours to 8:00 p.m. in a bid to boost
voter turnover.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Home Affairs Ministry said estimated turnout at
11:00 a.m. stood at 17.68 percent, up 1.73 percentage points from
the previous election in 1995 which recorded a record low 44.52
percent turnout.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Syria Warns of Serious Situation in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Expressing pessimism over the
Middle East peace process, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Sharaa has warned of serious situation in the region, the
Syrian Al-Baath daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a French magazine before a visit by Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad to France, al-Sharaa said the situation
in the Middle East had never been so serious ever since the end of
the Cold War and the 1991 Madrid peace conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that today it was either to have a just peace or no
peace at all.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed pessimism over chances for reaching a
compromise with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who
refuses to trade land for peace.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel, among other countries, participated in the
Madrid conference which kicked off the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
But their peace talks have been stalled since early 1996. The
two countries have so far failed to bridge the gap over the future
of the Golan Heights captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967
Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad will start a three-day official visit to France on
July 16, during which he is expected to discuss with French
leaders issues of common concern, including the stalled Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa hailed France's key role in regional and world
affairs, the Middle East peace process in particular.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Syrian official criticized Turkey for
strengthening military ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel have signed a number of agreements on
military training and defense cooperation since 1996. Syria and
other Arab states have accused Turkey, an Islamic country, of
betraying the interests of Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Turkey have also been at odds over issues of water
sharing and Turkey's Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
Turkey accuses Syria of supporting its outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party, which has been fighting since 1984 for an
independent state in the southeast of Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Starts Primary Health Care project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has started a primary
health care project in the country's four biggest cities to
provide primary health care facilities to the poorer section of
the people, The New Nation daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The project, with the assistance of 2.5 billion taka (53.2
million U.S. dollars) provided by the Asian Development Bank, is
set to be completed by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
Of an estimated population of 12 million in the four cities --
the capital city of Dhaka, and southeast, southwest and northwest
cities of Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi -- more than half live
below the poverty line, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
The population of these cities would reach 25 million by the
year 2010 with proportionate increase in the number of
poverty-stricken people, some demographers predict.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 3 million people in these four cities live in
slums, and in Dhaka alone there are over 200 slum areas which
create unhygienic conditions, and are the breeding grounds of
measles, chicken pox, polio, tuberculosis, sexual diseases, the
report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Merapi Volcano in Indonesia's
Central Java has continued to spurt heat clouds till Sunday
morning, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The volcano has spewed 14 times since Saturday evening to
Sunday morning and the hot lava flowed to 1.5 kilometers, the
reports quoted local officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is still in the status of "alert" because greater eruption
may take place any time, but no villager around the mountain has
evacuated, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Merapi, 2,968-meter high, is one of the most active volcanoes
in Indonesia. It erupted at 4:38 local time on Saturday and the
ash has hit as far as 60 kilometers around.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the Saturday eruption was bigger than that of the
last one in 1994 which killed 60 people, but this time warning of
the danger had been announced before by the local government.
</P>
<P>
There have been no reports of casualties yet.
</P>
<P>
There are 127 active volcanoes in Indonesia. The worst eruption
of the volcano in this century occurred in 1930, killing 1,300
people.

<HEADLINE> Three Children Killed in Arson Attack in N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Three Catholic boys died early
Sunday in what police called a sectarian arson attack in Northern
Ireland, according to Northern Ireland police.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said the victims, aged 10, nine and seven,
were brothers living in a largely Protestant area in Ballymoney
town north of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The incident was seen as an escalation of a week old upheaval
in the British-ruled province sparked by the ban of a Protestant
Orangemen parade in Portadown.
</P>
<P>
"I can now confirm that we are treating this as a brutal
murder of three young Catholic boys in the Carnaney (housing)
estate in a sectarian arson attack," police chief inspector Terry
Shevlin said.
</P>
<P>
Two women and a man, who were also in the house, were receiving
treatment in hospital after the blaze.
</P>
<P>
Media reports here said Protestant Oragemen have launched a
wave of violence in retaliation for halting a street parade by
police and security forces a week ago.
</P>
<P>
An indirect talk between the Orangemen and Catholic residents
on Saturday was adjourned without any agreement. Further talks to
settle the crisis will resume next week.

along with African countries to make Africa intergrate into the
future global economy.

PARIS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The sport of soccer is so involved in
different aspects of social life that even some negative phenomenons
could not be avoided, FIFA said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Football is such a social phenomenon that it bounds to be
accompanied by some negative aspects," said FIFA Communications
Director Keith Cooper.
</P>
<P>
French policeman Daniel Nivel was beaten into coma by German

He said, "The quality of football should be remembered down the
years. There are controversies and results that people talked about in
bars, schools and offices.

"You forget the problems. You remember the great matches, great

<HEADLINE> Roundup:SriLanka Economy Performs Well in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's economy had a good
showing in the first quarter of this year, with all major economic
sectors recording a growth except mining and quarrying.
</P>
<P>
The island country's gross domestic product (GDP) in real terms
expanded by 5.8 percent in the first quarter compared with the
same period last year when it grew by 4.4 percent, according to a
report by the national Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector grew by 4.2 percent, with the impetus
for the 1998 growth coming from the paddy sub-sector.
</P>
<P>
Paddy production hit a 16-year high to reach 1.77 million tons
during the main cultivation season, a 21.8 percent increase over
the same period last year. In 1982, the output of paddy stood at
1.78 million tons and last year, it rose by just 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tea and fisheries were other sectors which contributed to the
growth of agriculture during January-March. Tea production grew by
6.2 percent after doing well in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
The fisheries sub-sector grew by 2.9 percent as a result of the
recovery in aquaculture and the expansion of inland fisheries.
</P>
<P>
The performance of the mining and quarrying sector was mixed,
with the mining sub-sector declining by 37 percent and the
quarrying sector growing by 12 percent. The growth in quarrying
was due to a pickup in construction activities in which quarrying
products are the major inputs.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the mining sub-sector was mainly due to the
setback in gem exports following the slowdown in demand from Japan
and other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector recorded a growth of 7.4 percent, but
the pace was slower compared with 11.1 percent in the previous
corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown has been mainly attributed to the fact the output
in certain export-oriented categories was affected due to strong
competition from East Asian countries following the rapid
depreciation of their currencies.
</P>
<P>
The number-one foreign exchange earner, the textile and apparel
industry, obtained 692.3 million U.S. dollars, an increase of 18
percent.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector recorded a significant growth of 12
percent compared with the 6 percent in the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The services sector registered a 5.7 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
With sufficient rainfall in hydro-catchment areas and an
increase in the capacity of power generation, the electricity, gas
and water sector recorded an impressive growth of 16.1 percent. In
the first quarter of 1997, it grew by a mere 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the trade sector, export grew by 9 percent and import by 5.5
percent, while domestic trade expanded 3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Economic Cooperation Focus of Kiriyenko's Japan Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko leaves for Japan Sunday afternoon on a trip that is
expected to focus on economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko told reporters Saturday that the purpose of his trip
is "not to expand cooperation with Japan, but to fulfil the tasks"
set forth by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin during their informal summits.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Hashimoto met in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, in November
1997 and in Kawana, Japan, last April.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko, who is scheduled to arrive in Japan on Monday, said
he will not "have any additional talks on new credits" for Russia.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he plans to work out the terms of the first 400
million U.S. dollar tranche of Japan's 1.5 billion dollar credit
to Russia agreed earlier to help the country's economic reforms,
Itar-Tass said, quoting sources with the Russian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Besides holding talks with Hashimoto and Foreign Minister
Keizo Obuchi, Kiriyenko will also meet Japanese Emperor Akihito.
</P>
<P>
During the trip, the two sides are also expected to sign a
memorandum on the drafting of an agreement on mutual encouragement
and protection of investments.
</P>
<P>
A 1993 intergovernmental agreement on space exploration, which
expires in October, is also expected to be extended for another
five years.
</P>
<P>
Although Japan is among Russia's 10 largest trading partners,
Tokyo's trade with Moscow only account for a mere 1 percent of its
total.
</P>
<P>
Trade turnover between the two countries stood at 5 billion
dollars last year, with Russia mainly selling raw materials to
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Although businessmen of the two countries discussed a number of
joint cooperation projects, only a few were implemented.
</P>
<P>
Observers attribute the lagging trade between the two countries
to the slow pace of their political ties.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-three years after the end of the World War II, Moscow and
Tokyo still have not signed a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
The most thorny issue in bilateral relations is the Kuril
islands claimed by Japan and occupied by Russia.
</P>
<P>
No major breakthrough on the islands is likely, taking into
consideration Kiriyenko's capacity.
</P>
<P>
When appointed Prime Minister about three months ago, Kiriyenko
was told by Yeltsin "to stay away from politics" and concentrate
on economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, Kiriyenko ... will not dare to disobey the
president, even if his views on the territorial dispute with Japan
differ from Yeltsin's," the Itar-Tass said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Review Population Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
plans to review the 1996 population policy at a time when the
world population are growing at an alarming rate, a cabinet
minister has said.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of State for Planning and Parastatal Sector
Reform, Nassoro Malocho, was quoted by Sunday News as saying that
the population growth in Tanzania has been attributed to
development achievements especially in the health sector which
have substantially reduced infant and maternal deaths.
</P>
<P>
Malocho, speaking Saturday in the northern region of
Kilimanjaro to mark the World Population Day, said that a study
made in the country in 1996 showed that there were 103 infant
deaths per 1,000 births between 1986 and 1990. The rate declined
to 88 deaths in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The minister has also praised the northern zonal regions,
including Kilimanjaro, for their success in reducing infant
mortality by 40 deaths per 1,000 births.
</P>
<P>
He said, despite the achievement in the health sector,
delivery of essential services has yet to be fulfilled partly
because of population explosions coupled with limited government
resources.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's growth rate stands at 2.8 percent, against an
economic growth rate of 3.5 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the United Nations Population Fund representative in
the country, Teferi Seyoum, underscored the need for family
planning and education so as to enlighten the community on the
hazards of high population growth rate.
</P>
<P>
He said women should be allowed to make a choice on the number
of children they would like to have and that men should support
such decisions in order to enable couples plan wisely for the
children they were bringing forth.
</P>
<P>
"The smaller the family, the slower will be the pace of
population growth," Seyoum said, adding that at present, the
number of world population increases by 80 million each year.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urges Higher Economic Growth in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has urged Jordan to
achieve higher economic growth following Jordan's failure to meet
the set targets in the past two years, the semi-official Jordan
Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to the paper, the World Bank said it
dispatched a senior delegation to Jordan late June to review the
Jordanian reports on its economic growth rates in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
A consensus was finally reached between the two sides that the
growth rates in 1996 and 1997 were 0.8 percent and 2.7 percent
respectively, as against the Jordanian government's original
estimates of 5.2 percent and 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank, which co-sponsors with the International Monetary
Fund the 1989-1998 economic reform program for Jordan, expressed
its concern about Jordan's failure to meet the targets of economic
growth in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
It urged Jordan to boost its economic growth through its
current economic reform and development program and by encouraging
exports and expanding the role of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
"It is the private sector and exports that could be the engine
of growth, and an improved regional environment would greatly
facilitate the acceleration of growth," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The bank also called for creating more jobs and ensuring equity
in the distribution of incomes in order to increase the economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
It believed that Jordan could achieve higher economic growth
because its economy has been stabilized "with low inflation rates,
a balance of payments surplus, adequate foregin exchange reserves
and improved creditworthiness."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abderrzaq Bani Hani, director of the economic reform
program for Jordan, told Xinhua that Jordan's economic recession
was largely due to the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said the deadlock in the process has created instability in
the region and reduced Jordan's exports to Iraq, Malaysia,
Indonesia, Korea and other countries substantially.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesia's Ruling Golkar vows to Compete in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's ruling Golkar is ready
to become a political party and vows to compete in the general
election next year, according to a political statement it issued
after ending a three-day extraordinary national congress late
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the seven-point statement issued at midnight, Golkar said
that in view of the future social and political developments, the
political organization is ready to compete in the general election
in such a multiparty system.
</P>
<P>
The country's highest legislative body, the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR), will convene an extraordinary meeting
on November 10 this year to set the date for next general
elections in May or June.
</P>
<P>
In his closing speech at the congress, newly elected Golkar
General Chairman Akbar Tanjung said Golkar was determined to carry
out five working programs involving the upcoming extraordinary
meeting of MPR and the MPR General Session, scheduled to be held
by the end of 1999 to elect a new president and vice president.
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old Akbar, reportedly backed by President B.J.
Habibie and Armed Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto, captured the
Golkar chairmanship in the first ever voting election by the
political organization, beating former defense minister Edi
Sudradjat who received the backing of retired senior generals.
</P>
<P>
Akbar, who is minister/secretary of state, collected 17 votes
while Edi obtained 10 out of a total of 27 voters held by chairmen
of the Golkar provincial chapters.
</P>
<P>
Akbar later announced a 138-member central executive board to
assist him in leading the party at central level until the year
2003.
</P>
<P>
Most people in the board wanted to maintain all of Golkar's
potentials to face the next general elections, Akbar told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Golkar, which is an Indonesian abbreviation for functional
group, was established in 1964 as a coalition of various
professional and mass organizations. The dominant Golkar has
always refused to call itself a party for the last 32 years.
</P>
<P>
Delegates at the congress were unanimous that Golkar was indeed
a political party and it should never hesitate to claim to be one
in the new situation.
</P>
<P>
Golkar had been helping former president Soeharto to ensure his
reelection time and again, and in March this year he was again
elected for a seventh consecutive five-year term.
</P>
<P>
The organization has split into several groups since Soeharto
stepped down on May 21 this year. However, it remains influential
because of the sheer number of seats it still controls in the
House of Representatives and the MPR.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to keep its long-time political dominance by winning
the new general elections, internal consolidation has become the
party's pressing issue, observers noted.
</P>
<P>
"I need the help of all Golkar members to regain Golkar's past
success and glory. I know it will take time to unify all Golkar
members," Akbar said.
</P>
<P>
Edi responded positively to Akbar's desire for consolidation,
saying he would persuade all his supporters to help Akbar develop
Golkar into a better institution.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian political observers believed that the survival of
Golkar would be more secure under the leadership of Akbar as his
election is expected to create national political stability.
</P>
<P>
As President B.J. Habibie pointed out in his opening address to
the congress on Thursday, Golkar must reform itself to survive the
tight competition unleashed by the political reforms that will see
new political parties emerging and contesting general elections.
</P>
<P>
In the past, only three political parties including Golkar were
allowed to take part in the five-yearly general elections, the
other two being the United Development Party (PPP) and the
Indonesian Democratic Party. However, Since May this year several
political parties have been set up in the country.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Retrenchments to Exceed 25,000 This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Minister for Manpower
Lee Boon Yang said on Sunday that the country's retrenchment
figure this year is likely to exceed 25,000 if business conditions
do not improve.
</P>
<P>
Lee Boon Yang told a seminar that the figure would be 25
percent higher than the retrenchment of about 20,000 workers
during the 1985 economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
Billing job security as the most immediate impact of the
current economic woes, Lee said: "With a drop in demand for our
products and reduced trade with our neighbors, we are seeing
increasing retrenchments."
</P>
<P>
Singapore's Manufacturing output and non-oil export fell by 4.5
and 4.8 percent respectively in May compared with the same period
last year. Its economic growth forecast has been revised down to
0.5-1.5 percent from 2.5-4.5 percent estimated in February.
</P>
<P>
Lee Boon Yang urged workers and employers to join the Skill
Redevelopment Program (SRP), which he said was part of the
country's long-term strategy to cope with the skills mismatch and
structural unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The SRP works by encouraging companies to send their workers
for skill upgrading. Employers of such workers will get from the
government 80 percent of subsidy for the training cost and up to
70 percent of the worker's absentee payroll. The remaining cost is
paid by the employer.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's National Trades Union Congress estimated that up to
20,000 workers would require retraining under the SRP each year
for the next five years.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Supports Burial of Marcos in Hometown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
is hopeful that the reported plan to bury the remains of Ferdinand
Marcos in his hometown will finally resolve the issue of the late
president's burial, a presidential press release said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The press release said Estrada was reacting to news reports
that the Marcos family is planning to bury Marcos in his hometown
in Batac, Ilocos Norte province, the northern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
A burial in Batac will lay to rest various emotions and
sentiments that flared up amid plans to inter the former
president's remains at the Heroes Cemetery in Manila, Estrada
said.
</P>
<P>
Marcos' remains are currently kept in a crystal sarcophagus in
his ancestral mausoleum after being allowed to return to the
Philippines in 1993 from Hawaii, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Marcos went into exile in Hawaii after being ousted in a
bloodless revolt in 1986 and died there three years later.
</P>
<P>
Former president Corazon Aquino refused the return of his
remains. Her successor Fidel Ramos changed the decision but
refused to bury him as a state hero in Manila.
</P>
<P>
After assuming office on June 30, Estrada allowed the interment
of Marcos at Manila's Heroes Cemetery, but he was forced to change
his mind after the decision was widely opposed by Aquino and human
rights victims of the Marcos regime.

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA CITY, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat praised China's role in the Middle
East peace process, saying the PNA is in constant contact with
China over the development of the situation.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in an exclusive interview with Xinhua on the
eve of his Monday's visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he will discuss with Chinese leaders ways to
further bilateral relations and exchange views with them on the
stalled peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Although not a mediator in the process, China has expressed its
deep concern over the current stalemate in the peace process,
stressing that the key to break the deadlock is to implement the
signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Arafat expressed the hope that China, one of the permanent
members of the United Nations Security Council, will continue to
exert its influence on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"China is a major power that has a political, social and
economic weight," Arafat said, adding that "we hope that we will
get more support and assistance (from China) to our cause till we
build our independent state with Jerusalem as its capital."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader recalled that China was the first
country he visited following the signing of the historic Oslo
Accords at the White House in September 1993. He went to Beijing
for an official visit in October that year at the invitation of
Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Arafat hailed the Sino-Palestinian relations as "very strong"
and featuring "firmness and seriousness."
</P>
<P>
Arafat said "China was one of the first countries that
supported the Palestinian revolution materially and morally."
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian people and their leadership appreciate China's
supportive attitude towards us on bilateral and international
levels," he said.

BANGKOK, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has called on Thailand
and other member states of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations to continue playing an active role in helping improve the
political climate in South Asia, Thai deputy foreign minister
Sukhumbhand Paribatra said.

Sukhumbhand said both Thailand and Bangladesh expressed concern
about recent nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan.

During Sukhumbhand's three-day visit, an extradition treaty and
an agreement on avoidance of double taxation were signed between

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Failure in Peace Means Violence for Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA CITY, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat has warned that the failure of the signed
Palestinian-Israeli peace accords will lead the region to violence.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks in an exclusive interview with Xinhua
on the eve of his visit to China. He will start his three-day
visit to China on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinians are seeking peace -- but with several
options all open in resisting the abhorred Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
"We have the longest revolution and the longest intifada
(uprising) in the modern history. The collapse of the (signed
peace) accords ... will return the region to the circle of
violence," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The basic rule to push forward the peace process," he said,
"only requires the honest implementation of the accords and
adherence to land-for-peace principle, in line with international
legitimate resolutions, especially Security Council resolution 242
and 338."
</P>
<P>
Arafat blamed Israel for the 16-month-old stalemate in the
peace process, saying the Israeli side had in reality
relinquished the peace accords ever since the Israeli incumbent
government came to power two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Israel has failed to keep their promises made in signed
agreements on issues like redeployment in the West Bank, Jewish
settlements, and issues of transition period, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
"These measures constitute grave and flagrant violation of
international legitimate resolutions, including Resolution
242 ... They also violate the Oslo accords which very distinctly
call for refraining from any measures that touch any issues of the
final negotiating phase with the issue of Jerusalem in the
forefront," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized Israel for its "unjust blockade" of
Palestinian areas, including the prevention of the entry of goods
and obstruction of the free movement of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
"We are regularly losing more than 10 million (U.S.) dollars
each day by the economic blockade, that is to say, many times as
much as the donor countries are offering if measured on annual
basis," he said, adding that unemployment rate in the Palestinian
areas exceeds 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli policy is causing much frustration to the
Palestinians and leading to misery and grave danger, Arafat said,
noting that "the situation is approaching starvation, and I ring
the bells of danger. In as much as peace is in the interest of
all, the explosion will hit everyone."

<P>
But despite this, the Palestinians are seeking peace despite
difficulties caused by Israel's hard-line policy, the Palestinian
leader said, urging the international community to help revive the
moribund peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We have accepted the American initiative to activate the
peace process, despite the injustice befalling us," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. initiative, which calls for a 13.1 percent Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank, falls far short of the minimum
Palestinian demand, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians "agreed in principle and then accepted the
weak initiative ... because we are keen on our people's strategic
option, namely, a lasting, just and comprehensive peace for all
and along all Arab tracks, particularly the Lebanese and Syrian
tracks," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The PNA is in constant contact with the U.S., Russia, the
European Union and China as well as the non-aligned nations in an
effort to push forward the stalled peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about his proposal that an Arab summit to be held to
discuss the deadlocked peace process, Arafat said that he is
engaging in "intensive efforts and contacts" with the Arab
countries over this issue. "There is an Arab unanimity on holding
such a summit," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the agenda of the summit will be the Palestine question, and
the peace process on the Palestinian track as well as the Lebanese
and Syrian tracks, according to the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
"The summit will put the Arab leaders face to face with their
responsibilities towards Palestine, the holy land and the other
occupied Arab lands," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PNA is calling for a meeting by the foreign
ministers of the Islamic countries "as prelude to raising the
(peace process) issue at the United Nations Security Council," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are also active on the international arena to contain
Israel's hostile attitudes," Arafat said. The PNA has called upon
the Security Council to examine Israel's plan to expand Jerusalem
far beyond its current borders, he said, dismissing the plan as
"an attempt to Judaize the holy city."
</P>
<P>
Asked about his comments on the U.N. resolution overwhelmingly
approved by the General Assembly last Tuesday to upgrade the
status of Palestine to a near statehood from that of an observer,
Arafat hailed the voting as "a strong international support for
the Palestinian people and the Palestinian cause."
</P>
<P>
The international community should "exert every possible
effort" to save the peace process and help the Palestinians
rebuild their economy, Arafat stressed.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated in the interview that the Palestinians have the
right in conformity with the signed agreements to proclaim an
independent Palestinian state in May 1999, when the transition
period stipulated in the Oslo accords terminates.
</P>
<P>
"We hope this century will not end before it witnesses the
dawn of the state of Palestine on Palestinian land," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rate Cuts in China Open Up Options </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Banking deposits will no longer
remain the first choice for Beijing residents when they arrange to
invest their surplus money after the recent cuts in banking
interest rates, today's Business Weekly says.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Beijing dwellers show more interest in spending for
their future, according to a survey.
</P>
<P>
About 44.9 percent of the surveyed say they will spend their
money on their children's education, houses, home appliances,
automobiles and marriage, compared with 27.1 percent who will
continue to deposit in banks.
</P>
<P>
The survey, sampling 576 Beijing citizens at and above the age
of 25, was conducted between July 2 and 4, following the central
bank's announcement of a cut in both lending and deposit interest
rates on July 1.
</P>
<P>
After the interest cut, the interest rate for one-year banking
deposits has been slashed to 4.77 percent, the lowest since the
late 1970s. Such a low interest level propels people to turn to
consumption and investment in securities and insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
In view of the government's move in interest rate reduction, a
majority of Beijing residents hold an understanderable attitude,
according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
A total of 86.4 percent of the respondents knew of the cut and
44.1 percent showed a positive response to the government's
policy, considering it a stimulus to economic growth or a possible
boost to consumption.

<P>
As to the remaining, 39.2 percent are indifferent to the policy
and only 16.7 percent disagree with the cut.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicates that the interest cut is unlikely to
affect the existing banking deposit, since nearly two-third of the
respondents say they will not change their deposits.
</P>
<P>
Only one out of six plan to withdraw their money and 60 percent
of these people will remove just 20 percent to 50 percent of their

<HEADLINE> Idle Money Should be Directed in Investment and Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists are proposing
further measures to direct the enormous savings deposits into
investment and consumption so as to stimulate the economy, today's
China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, outstanding savings deposits topped 4.97
trillion yuan (599 billion US dollars), a year-on-year increase of
17.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
This amount of idle money is deemed by many Chinese economists
as too high, though they believe reasonably high-level savings
deposits are a driving force for further economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The excessively high level of idle money is partly blamed for
the country's excessive commodity inventories which account for
about 20 percent of the total investment, the economists pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
The economists suggested to take possible measures to improve
the efficiency of savings deposits including diverting the savings
into the securities market, developing consumption bank credits to
boost spending, exploring the agricultural market, cutting banking
interest rates, and levying more taxes on the affluent.

<HEADLINE> China's Jewellery Market to Be Exploited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- China's gold and jewellery market
has a high potential to be exploited as people's living standards
continue to witness a steady improvement, today's Business Weekly
reported.
</P>
<P>
"The fast growth of individual income is stimulating the demand
for gold jewellery," said Liu Shengyu, president of the China Gem
Importing and Exporting Co (Sinogem).
</P>
<P>
The emergence of more than 10,000 gold jewellery shops
throughout the country reflects the increasing demand.
</P>
<P>
China is both a traditional jewellery production and consuming
country. Since 1991, China has, on average, consumed more than 200
tons of gold jewellery a year, according to a report released by
Sinogem.
</P>
<P>
It says that in urban areas, where more than 200 million of the
country's people live, nearly 40 percent of the total population
possess gold jewellery and that pure gold jewellery only account
for 20 percent of total sales.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, where more than 900 million people live, 15
percent of residents own gold jewellery.
</P>
<P>
"This is a far cry from market saturation, both in urban and
rural areas," said Liu,
</P>
<P>
Last year, the average Chinese purchased a mere 0.2 gram of
gold, which lagged far behind the 9 grams of gold purchased in
Hong Kong and the world's average of 1.5 gram.
</P>
<P>
"China's tradition of owning gold jewellery serves as a key
element to maintain the huge potential market," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the currency chaos in Southeast Asia has only
served to convince Chinese people that gold is still the main
method of keeping treasure safe at times of rapid devaluation.
</P>
<P>
China is the third largest country after the United States and
India in the sale of gold jewellery, with a total demand of 213.8
tons in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Estrada to Compromise With Marcoses On Hidden Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- President Joseph Estrada said he
was willing to compromise with the family and business allies of
the late president Ferdinand Marcos over the long-disputed Marcos
wealth, the Philippine Journal reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But the compromise will be transparent, legal and will be for
the benefit of the poor, Estrada said, adding that the
cash-strapped government could use the money from these deals to
fund programs aimed at reducing poverty, creating jobs and
ensuring food security.
</P>
<P>
"As long as it is in the national interest, we will do it, and
it is not a violation of law," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Estrada noted that the ill-gotten wealth cases against the
Marcoses and their alleged cronies have dragged on for 12 years in
courts under both the Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos
administrations.
</P>
<P>
It would be better to settle these cases and use the money to
help the poor than let the legal stalemate continue for another
six years, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we have an amicable settlement that is favorable to the
government, we will agree. If we wait for another six years, we
will again not get any benefit from the money," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Estrada reiterated that he would abolish the
Commission on Good Government which was set up by former president
Aquino to retrieve the wealth Marcos hid abroad, mainly in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The commission is spending so much scarce resources paying the
fees of lawyers handling these cases when the money could be put
to good use uplifting the living conditions of the poor, Estrada
said.
</P>
<P>
It was until April this year that the commission retrieved some
300 million dollars of the Marcos wealth from two Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
Marcos was toppled in a popular revolt in 1986. He fled to
Hawaii, the United States and died there three years later. He was
accused of plundering 5 to 10 billion dollars from the state
treasury during his 20 years' rule of the country.

<HEADLINE> Health Products Find Smooth Way Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Despite the buffeting of the Asian
financial turmoil, exports of Chinese medicines and health
products will have a bright prospect in the long run, the Business
Weekly today quoted experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhao Chunhua, president of the China Chamber of
Commerce of Medicines and Health Products Importers and Exporters,
since East and Southeast Asian countries are traditional markets
for Chinese medicines and health products, such exports dropped by
12.5 percent to 120 million US dollars during the first five
months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Chinese herbal medicines and health products, with
their special charm, have opened the gates of the US market, which
consumes 35 percent of the world's annual drug output, and some
European countries.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
first time approved a Chinese medicine to be sold on the US market
after clinical confirmation. Another Chinese herbal treatment
recently received the FDA's preliminary approval, and still
another is expected to get the FDA approval soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, related authorities in Germany and Australia have
also approved a dozen traditional Chinese medicines.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Ruling Golkar Sets Up New Executive Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Newly elected General Chairman
Akbar Tanjung of Indonesia's ruling Golkar has announced the
lineup of a 138-member central executive board, and promised to
carry out five working programs.
</P>
<P>
Making the announcement late Saturday at the end of the party's
congress, Akbar said the programs were aimed at internal
consolidation, resolving the current economic crisis and carrying
out reforms in the run-up to a special meeting of the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR) scheduled for November 10 and the MPR
General Session next year.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming special meeting of MPR, the country's highest
legislative body, will set the date for the next general election
expected in May or June next year, and the MPR General Session
will elect a new president and vice president.
</P>
<P>
Akbar said the most difficult task he was facing in his new job
would be the party's internal consolidation.
</P>
<P>
"I need time to carry out consolidation, to enable Golkar to
remain successful in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the composition of Golkar's new central executive board, the
North Sumatra-born career politician said the 138-member team had
accommodated the interest of various organizations or groups in
Golkar.
</P>
<P>
In the lineup, Akbar would be seconded by 14 chairmen including
State Minister for Youth and Sports Affairs Agung Laksono,
Minister of Manpower Fahmi Idris and deputy chairman of the old
executive board Abdul Gafur.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Toeswandi, an instructor at the National Resilience
Institute, was appointed as party Secretary General.
</P>
<P>
The three-day extraordinary congress has also decided to
abolish its powerful Board of Patrons headed by former president
Soeharto and two other top-level internal bodies.
</P>
<P>
Golkar may create a new advisory board which would differ from
the old because its advice would not be binding, said Moestahid
Astari, chairman of Golkar's commission A which is in charge of
organizational affairs.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't mean that high-ranking government officials,
including the president, would automatically become members of the
advisory board," Astari added.
</P>
<P>
The congress also decided to turn itself into a real political
party.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Mt. Merapi Eruption Spews Ash Over 60 km </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Ash of Merapi Volcano in
Indonesia's Central Java, which erupted early Saturday, has hit
areas as far as 60 kilometers around, reports reaching here said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 2,968-meter high mountain erupted at 4:38 a.m. (local time)
on Saturday and the heat clouds blew to an uninhabited area six
kilometers west of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
Villages in Magelang regency were covered by the volcanic ash
as houses, trees and roads turned white with dust up to two
centimeters thick, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
But there have been no reports of casualties as yet.
</P>
<P>
Observers remain worried about a greater eruption because of
the more than 40 subsequent small eruptions and dozens of volcanic
tremors recorded as of 10 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Merapi is one the most active volcanoes in Indonesia. There are
127 active volcanoes in the country.
</P>
<P>
In November 1994, Merapi erupted suddenly, killing 66 people.
In January 1997, more than 8,000 villagers living at the foot of
the mountain had to be evacuated when it began spewing ash and
lava.
</P>
<P>
The worst eruption of the volcano in this century occurred in
1930, killing 1,300 people.

<HEADLINE> China Considers to Open Gold Industry Wider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Studies and applications
concerning opening up of China's gold industry are in progress,
today's China Daily quotes a gold industry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The opening of our gold industry to the outside world will not
stop," Wang Dexue, director-general of the Gold Bureau under the
State Economic and Trade Commission, said.
</P>
<P>
At present, foreign investment in China's gold sector has been
limited to the development of low grade and refractory gold
resources, resulting in stagnant cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, his bureau plans to further promote
cooperation with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
The open-up plan also involves breaking up the industry's
boundary and open up to other industries, and breaking up the
boundary of administrative regions and introduce the shareholding
system and multi-channel investment mechanism into the industry,
according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Since gold serves as a fiscal reserve in China, all gold mined
in the country is purchased by the central bank at a fixed price,
which is currently higher than the price on the international
market.

<P>
With the pressure of low gold prices in the international
market since 1997, China has cut its gold price three times.
</P>
<P>
The price reduction forced the mines to increase production as
much as possible in an effort to keep up the profit level, said
Wang.
</P>
<P>
"However, the basic resolution lies in the complete transition
from the traditional monopoly to the market-oriented development
mode," he said.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts pointed out that opening the gold market would
set a concrete basis for domestic companies to be restructed along
market-oriented lines.
</P>
<P>
But, since the Chinese currency, the yuan, has not become fully
convertible, the government is unlikely to open the gold market
anytime soon, despite shouldering pressure from the international
market, they said.

<HEADLINE> Italian Police Arrest Key Camorra Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Italian police captured Francesco
Schiavone, a key Mafia leader, on Saturday in Italy's southern
city Naples after a run of six years.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Schiavone, who led a Mafia branch called Camorra
in Naples, dealt a heavy blow to the Mafia and other criminal
organizations alike, said Interior Minister Giorgio Napolitano.
</P>
<P>
Schiavone, 44, who was considered one of the most dangerous
members of Naples' underworld, has accumulated more than 100
million U.S. dollars of assets and property by illegal businesses
including drug trafficking and cigarette smuggling.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested in a luxurious underground house in Casal di
Principe, south of Naples.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, Schiavone was the key link between
Camorra and another branch of the Mafia -- the Cosa Nostra on
Sicily.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the police also arrested another Camorra chief in
Naples and launched raids on two drug dealing groups in the
northern city of Padova and Trento. Twenty-one people were
arrested in the operations.

<P>
SAN JOSE, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of dengue victims in
southern Costa Rica is on the rise, despite efforts by health
workers to bring it under control, the Health Ministry said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At a hospital in the Golfito City, more than 500 people with
classic dengue symptoms and four women affected with hemorrhagic
dengue have been treated in the past days.
</P>
<P>
The situation is getting worse as the outbreak has spread to
other regions in the south.
</P>
<P>
Director Leonardo Marranghello of the epidemiology section in
the ministry said that many cases have been reported in the
southern cities of Neily and San Vito de Java.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican health workers have taken a series of measures to
prevent the disease from further spreading.
</P>
<P>
However, health workers have expressed worries over the poor
hygiene condition in the region. In Golfito city alone, mosquitos
that transmit the dengue disease were spotted in 30 percent of the
local households.

BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:

 People's Daily

<P>
-- The leading national newspaper frontpaged an article on how
Xinfei Electrical Appliance Co. Ltd. of Henan Province has
survived fierce market competition to emerge as the third largest
refrigerator maker in China.
</P>
<P>
-- Shanxi Province, a major coal production base in north
China, has accelerated the building of power stations.
</P>
<P>
 China Youth Daily

<P>
-- For the first time, China Central Television Station (CCTV)
beamed live a court hearing to viewers across the country. The
case involved a dispute on the infringement of copyrights.
</P>
<P>
China Daily (Business Weekly)
</P>
<P>
-- China's gold industry is pledging a series of open-up
measures, including breaking the industry's boundary and open up
to other industries; breaking the boundary of administrative
regions and introduce the shareholding system and multi-channel
investment mechanism into the industry and promote cooperation
with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese foreign trade experts are urging the government to
guide more foreign companies to invest in knowledge-intensive
service sector, pointing out that the lack of knowledge-based
service sectors will form a big obstacle to China's further

<HEADLINE> Chinese Government Urged to Guide Foreign Fund Flow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government should
guide more foreign companies to invest in knowledge-intensive
service sectors, a senior expert was quoted as saying by today's
Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhile, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of
International Trade and Economic Co-operation under the Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec), said that the
lack of knowledge-based service sectors will form a big obstacle
to China's further introduction of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
"When a foreign company is planning to enter the Chinese
market, it usually needs an enterprise consultative company which
is familiar with the Chinese market to do market research and
offer business advice. After the foreign company steps in, it will
request various services ranging from accounting to financial and
legal consultation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, China's knowledge-intensive service industries
seem to be incapable of fulfilling the requirements of foreign
companies.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of foreign companies which are experienced in
providing such services will pave way for more foreign
investment. Meanwhile, the involvement of these foreign
knowledge-based service firms in China will also accelerate the
evolution of their Chinese counterparts, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
More space should be opened to foreign investors in service
sectors such as accounting, legal consultation and air
transportation, Zeng said.

<HEADLINE> China's Anti-smoking Campaign Gets Official Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 12 (Xinhua) -- China's anti-smoking campaign won
official support when nearly 100 officials of Shanxi Province
proposed that government employees quit smoking.
</P>
<P>
The officials asked government employees to pay attention to
no-smoking regulations in public places, and not to smoke or give
cigarettes to others while on the job.
</P>
<P>
They also asked that youngsters stop smoking or avoid it, and
suggested that there be a greater effort to make people aware of
the fact that smoking can harm one's health.
</P>
<P>
The one hundred or so ministers and vice ministers at the
central government first made the proposal last year, and some
chain smokers made a commitment then and there to give up the
habit.
</P>
<P>
Such activities are considered quite positive but still "mostly
symbolic" since the country has a 320-million-strong army of
smokers and its tobacco industry is one of the major taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
Officials should be models in this because what they do may
have a strong influence on ordinary people, says Prof. Zhang
Yifang, a leader in the anti-smoking campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, many of them fail to do it, including some
high-ranking officials," he added.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Start Voting in Upper House Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Voting for Japan's 18th House of
Councillors (upper house) election started Sunday morning amid one
of the country's slowest economic conditions since the end of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
The poll is seen as a test of public confidence in Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's economic policies, which have come
under much fire amid the economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
One focal point of the upper house race, held every three
years, is whether the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) can
retain its 61 seats being contested, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
If the LDP fails to hold on to all of its preelection seats,
Hashimoto is expected to be forced to step down, leading to a change
in Japan's political spectrum, they said.
</P>
<P>
Voting, which takes place at about 53,000 polling stations across
Japan, started at 7 a.m. (local time). Voting hours have been extended
for two hours to 8 p.m. in a bid to boost voter turnover.
</P>
<P>
Of the 252 seats in the upper house, 126 will be contested -- 76
seats from 47 prefectural constituencies and 50 under proportional
representation.
</P>
<P>
A total of 316 candidates run for the constituency seats, while 158
candidates from 14 political parties and groups vie for the
proportional representation seats.
</P>
<P>
Formal results are expected to be known by 3 a.m. Monday.

HAIKOU, July 12 (Xinhua) -- A boy on the Chinese mainland
suffering from leukemia is being scheduled for a bone marrow
transplant since a man in Taiwan has agreed to donate his bone
marrow.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old boy, Zhu Guangfu, has waited for two years
because doctors could not find a suitable donor among his
relatives and other people who volunteered across the country,
according to the People's Hospital in China's southern province of
Hainan.
</P>
<P>
The hospital contacted a Taiwan center to get information and
they helped to find the donor, a 40-year-old man, from more than
300,000 marrow donors on the island.
</P>
<P>
The marrow will arrive at Haikou, Hainan's capital, on July 15,
the hospital says.
</P>
<P>
Leukemia patients who get bone marrow from people who are not
blood relatives may be able to restore their hematopoietic, or
blood forming, function, but only four such operations have been
done in China so far, and only two of them were
successful.

<HEADLINE> World Youth Games Start in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Teenage reporters and a faltering
Mashutka mascot stole the limelight at the press conference of
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov at the first day of the World Youth
Games here.
</P>
<P>
To highlight its young characteristics, the main press center
at the Luzhniki Stadium was thronged with a junior press corps
eager to hone their newly acquired journalistic skills.
</P>
<P>
The first question to Mayor Luzhkov was raised by a girl of
about 15. Her question was about the Mashutka mascot, or bear cub.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the mayor detailed how the bear cub, the
"grandson" of the 1980 Moscow Olympics mascot as he called it, the
junior mascot, a stuffed bear cup standing on the podium,
faltered, first backward, then foreward, drawing laughters.
</P>
<P>
The light atmosphere was soon to be submerged by questions on
the mayor's fume over the country's major television channels',
such as the state RTR, public ORT, and commercial NTV, that plan
no coverage of the games.
</P>
<P>
He sent a message to President Boris Yeltsin to solicit his
support. Yeltsin was scheduled to attend the games' grand opening
ceremony on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The opening extravaganza was postponed so as to facilitate
those who attend the World Soccer Games in France.
</P>
<P>
At Saturday's press conference, Luzhkov again blasted the TV
stations, accusing them of reporting only the "secondary details"
and dwelling on the negative sides.
</P>
<P>
Despite the coverage problems, Luzhkov remains optimistic of a
successful staging of the games.
</P>
<P>
He said the main goal of the games, which gather contestants
aged 12-17 from around the world, was to promote health, peace,
friendship and unity among young people.
</P>
<P>
"Scores, seconds, first places and medals do not matter in the
World Youth Games. We want Moscow to become a place where young
athletes would understand what the Olympic spirit, the Olympic
competition and the Olympic friendship are," the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
"Ours are the first games in the history of the Olympic
movement and I am sure not the last one."
</P>
<P>
Lev Kofman, general director of the World Youth Games, told
reporters that Brazil and China's Hong Kong have expressed
interest in holding the next world youth games.
</P>
<P>
While the Itar-Tass new agency said 7,006 guests were in
Moscow, 5,180 of them athletes from 104 countries and regions, the
Interfax news agency, quoting the capital city's Interior
Department, put the number of athletes already in Moscow at 1,220.
</P>
<P>
Participants to the games will compete in 15 categories:
athletics, basketball, fencing, football, free-style wrestling,
Greco-Roman wrestling, gymnastics, handball, judo, rhythmic
gymnastics, synchronous swimming, swimming, table tennis, tennis
and volleyball.
</P>
<P>
Basketball, wrestling, volleyball, tennis and some other
competitions started on Saturday. The Chinese volleyball team beat
Peru by a comfortable win of 3-0 in the girls preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
Security has been tightened as more than 30,000 interior
officers are deployed in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Through a successful launching of the youth games, Moscow hopes
to hold another summer Olympiad. It last hosted a Summer Olympics
in 1980.
</P>
<P>
During an Internet interview Thursday, Luzhkov told websurfers
that the city has never dropped the idea to bid for the 2012
Olympic games.

<HEADLINE> Audi Takes Over British Engine Producer Cosworth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Germany's carmaker Audi said Saturday
that it has bought British engine producer Cosworth from its
parent company Vickers.
</P>
<P>
A contract on the deal, worth 117 million British pounds (about
192 million U.S. dollars), was signed Saturday with the British
company, said Audi, a subsidiary of Germany's largest carmaker
Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
The sale, however, still needs regulatory approval from the
European Commission.
</P>
<P>
Audi's offer to acquire Cosworth was first made in early June
amid a fierce bidding war between Volkswagen and its German rival
BMW to take over the British luxury carmaker Rolls-Royce, which
was also owned by Vickers.
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen finally emerged as the winner in the bidding war
earlier this month and acquired Rolls-Royce for about 479 million
pounds (790 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Cosworth has owned a name especially for its high-performance
engines for racing cars. It achieved a total turnover of about
116.9 million pounds (192 million dollars) in 1997 with about
1,400 employees.
</P>
<P>
Apart from taking over Cosworth, Audi also announced last month
that it would buy Italian sports car manufacturer Lamborghini.

<HEADLINE> Deal Nears for Russia's Bailout Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators of Russia and the World
Bank agreed on a draft loan of 500-600 million U.S. dollars in the
wee hours of Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The draft still has to be approved by the Russian government
and the headquarters of the World Bank, the Itar-Tass reported,
quoting Andrei Trapeznikov, aide to President Boris Yeltsin's
special envoy to international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Trapeznikov said the World Bank delegation believed that Russia
"has made considerable progress in the development of a program
for stabilizing the national economy."
</P>
<P>
On Chubais' talks with John Odling-Smee, head of the
International Monetary Fund's department for the former Soviet
Union, on a stabilization loan of 10-15 billion dollars,
Trapeznikov said negotiations are expected to end over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin held an unusual Saturday session with Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko and other top government officials and said he
was satisfied with progress in the loan talks, the Kremlin said.
</P>
<P>
He praised the government's rigorous stance on major companies
defaulting on tax payments, the Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also expressed appreciation of the positive tone of
debate of the tax laws introduced by the government in the State
Duma, or lower house of parliament, urging Kiriyenko to find
rapport with both houses of parliament at the final stage of its
review of package of laws needed by the stabilization program.
</P>
<P>
On Friday and Saturday, Yeltsin telephoned leaders of the
United States, France, Germany and Japan to brief them on the
country's anti-crisis program. All have expressed support.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced 32 million dollars to help local officials tailor
anti-drug strategies in his weekly radio address Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The move followed a nationwide 1 billion dollar government
anti-drug ad campaign over five years launched Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In his address Clinton also urged Congress to provide an
additional 85 million dollars to expand mandatory drug testing and
treatment programs for probationers, prisoners and parolees.
</P>
<P>
Of the federal grant released Saturday, 27 million dollars will
be used to create special drug courts in 150 jurisdictions. More
than 270 drug courts already exist around the country, combining
supervision with sanctions, testing and drug treatment to coerce
nonviolent criminals to come clean.
</P>
<P>
"To stop the revolving door of crime and narcotics, we must
make offenders stop abusing drugs," Clinton said. He noted that in
some cities, drug-court participants have recidivism rates as low
as 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
An additional 5 million dollars in federal money was released
to six cities with documented problems of methamphetamine abuse.
</P>
<P>
"There is no single national drug problem. We have lots of very
different local drug problems," said Jeremy Travis, director of
the National Institute of Justice, research arm of the Justice
Department.

<P>
PARIS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Davor Suker scored his sixth goal at
World Cup while Croatia beat the Netherlands 2-1 in the third-place
playoff here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Suker, who had scored five goals in his previous matches, put
Croatia 2-1 ahead at the 35th minute. He will be the top scorer of
the France'98 if Ronaldo fails to score more than two goals in the
final against France on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the first half, Robert Prosinecki scored his first
goal in the tournament at the 13th minutes.
</P>
<P>
Prosinecki, who didn't have the chance to start a game until
Saturday's playoff, proved that he was not at all off form.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch team soon levelled the score at the 20th minute when
Boudewijn Zenden put up a superb sole performance in front of the
penalty area and beat the Croatia defence line with a left-foot shot.
</P>
<P>
Then came the winner by Suker at the 35th minute. He got a pass
from midfield in a quick counter-attack and shot the ball between
the legs of Dutch defender Jaap Stam. Dutch goal-keeper Edwin van
der Sar fully extended but still could not block the ball.
</P>
<P>
The second half was more exciting though both teams failed to
score any more goals. The Dutch team had several golden chances but
Patrick Kluivert and Clarence Seedorf just shot wide.
