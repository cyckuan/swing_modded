<HEADLINE> Adams Appeals to Ulster Catholics to Keep Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams today
urged Catholics in Northern Ireland to keep calm in the wake of
the warning issued by the loyalist paramilitary groups that they
would end their truce as a response to the bombing campaign
launched by the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Belfast, Adams told Catholics in
favor of the reunification of the whole island of Ireland that the
British and Irish governments guaranteed that all-party talks on
the future of Northern Ireland to be convened on June 10 would be
"real" and would deal with the cause of the region's conflict.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, he added, Britain and Ireland could ease mounting
pressures from the IRA and the loyalist paramilitary groups who
strongly defend British rule over Ulster.
</P>
<P>
But Adams also urged the Catholics to keep alert on the
developments of the peace process because "dangers and tensions"
among the loyalist paramilitary groups would surface as peace talks
were delayed.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, leading members of the Ulster Volunteer Force
(UVF), one of the loyalist paramilitary groups, claimed that the
UVF was on the verge of calling off its cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
They argued that the loyalist paramilitary groups had gained
little or nothing from holding on to their truce after the IRA
renewed its campaign of violence since February 9 with a huge
blast in east London.
</P>
<P>
The UVF leaders indicated that they would consult with the
Ulster Defense Association, with which it had a kind of
partnership under the umbrella organization the Combined Loyalist
Military Command (CLMC).
</P>
<P>
Loyalist groups in the name of the CLMC declared their
cease-fire on October 13, 1994 two weeks after the IRA's truce
announced.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Palestinian residents
marched from the Church of Nativity to Rachel's Tomb in
Bethlehem, West Bank, this afternoon in protest against land
confiscation by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police tried to prevent the demonstrators from
reaching the tomb area which is under Israeli control according
to the Oslo agreement, but the protesters crossed the checkpoints
after clashing with the Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators carried banners protesting land seizure and
demanding the defense of their lands.
</P>
<P>
Leila Khalid, a returnee of the Popular Front for Liberation
of Palestine, participated in the protest condemning the Israeli
measures against the Palestinian people. She warned that if the
situation continues as such, it will explode as it did in the
past decades.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several hundred demonstrators in Qalqilya clashed
with the Israeli forces by throwing stones in protest against the
building by Israel of a fence separating the residents from
their land and preventing them from utilizing it .
</P>
<P>
This is the second day for the Qalqilya residents to stage
their protest against Israel's action. A number of Palestinians
were injured by tear gas and rubber bullets fired by Israeli
soldiers who tried to disperse them.

On the experiment in issuing convertible bonds, he said that
before special regulations are unveiled, no locality is allowed to
act for itself in this field, "the experiment can only be carried
out in very few enterprises this year."
</P>
<P>
As far as the futures market is concerned, he said that
regulations should be strengthened by improving construction in
futures trading houses and turning all dealers into members of
those houses.
</P>
<P>
He added that futures brokerages should face more strict
supervision, and serious measures should be taken to deal with
market manipulation, with resolute action against various illegal
futures trading activities.

Also at the conference, Zhou Zhengqing, chairman of the
Securities Committee, said that since the two stock exchanges were
set up five years ago, the securities market has played a positive
role in promoting economic growth and furthering reforms in
economic systems, strengthening citizens' financial awareness, and
modernizing people's ideas on investment.

Though some problems have cropped up as the futures market has
grown blindly over the past few years, China has done a lot to

<HEADLINE> China Kicks Off Large Education Program in Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China today launched a
10-billion-yuan education program in Beijing designed to promote
compulsory education in poverty-stricken areas in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
The State Education Commission and the Ministry of Finance
signed letters of responsibility for implementing the program with
deputy governors of 12 provinces who are in charge of local
education affairs.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng wrote inscriptions
for the start of the program, both calling for a conscientious
implementation of the program to enhance national quality.
</P>
<P>
Attending the signing ceremony, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
underlined the strategic and political importance of the project
for economic and social development in poor areas, and asked
governments at various levels to carry it out earnestly.
</P>
<P>
The program is the nation's largest in the field of education
since 1949, and the central authorities will provide 3.9 billion
yuan for it by the year 2000, with local governments making up
the remainder.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the program will cover poverty-stricken areas in 21
provinces and autonomous regions to improve education conditions
in primary and middle schools.
</P>
<P>
The 12 provinces, which signed letters of responsibility today
are the first group in the program. Some 42,000 schools in the 12
provinces will receive a total input of 5.3 billion yuan before
the end of next year to improve their conditions.
</P>
<P>
Li said that all the funds under the program should be injected
into designated education projects only, and governments at all
levels should establish a management system and take concrete
measures to ensure an efficient use of the money.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Appeals for Flood Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun
today appealed for greater measures to control floods this year to
help guarantee a good agricultural harvest, economic growth and
people's security.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the appeal at the first working conference of the
State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters held in
Tianjin today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also chief of the headquarters, said that despite the
huge achievements China has made in controlling flood and drought
in the 1991-95 period, the country's ability in dealing with
natural disasters still lags far behind social and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
"We must guarantee the security of big rivers, big lakes and
large and medium-sized reservoirs and at the same time take
tougher measures to control possible flooding on medium-sized or
small rivers and small reservoirs," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We must make sure that even when large floods come they will
not burst the dykes of big rivers, lakes, and the dams of big
reservoirs, or submerge big or medium-sized cities," he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
He called for attention to be given to restore projects damaged
by floods, setting up of flood-control teams and preparing
anti-flood materials, drawing up anti-flood plans, intensifying
anti-flood work for small and medium-sized rivers or reservoirs
and for small or medium-sized cities, and building
water-conservancy projects for farmland.

<HEADLINE> Top architect Named Senior Advisor For Suzhou City Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, May 7 (Xinhua) -- World famous architect Leoh Ming Pei
has become a senior urban construction advisor to Suzhou city, in
east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The city is striving to preserve its old charming appearance
while developing economically.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the local government, 79-year-old Pei paid
a short visit to Suzhou, where he closely studied the ancient
city, helped set up a protection zone for ancient architecture,
and received a letter of appointment from the mayor.
</P>
<P>
He suggested Suzhou gives first priority to the protection and
cleaning-up of its rivers, as ancient architecture in the city was
most renowned for "building structures with white walls and black
tiles alongside the rivers".
</P>
<P>
He also voiced strong opposition to the construction of
factories in the old city proper, calling it a devastation of
traditional culture.
</P>
<P>
Suzhou is the ancestral home to Pei, veteran member of the US
National Architects' Association and the British Royal Architects'
Association.
</P>
<P>
In a career dating back to the 1950s, Pei has won more than 20
major international prizes for architecture. His most successful
designs include the glass pyramid at the entrance of the Palais Du
Louvre in Paris, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and
Kennedy Airport in New York.
</P>
<P>
Suzhou, which in ancient time was described as "paradise on
earth" along with Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang
Province famous for its West Lake, still attracts a large number
of tourists every year with an abundance of beautiful ancient
parks and scenic gardens.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Media Told to Ban 'Paid-News' Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese official today called
for a code of morals among the country's journalists to stop the
practice of paid news.
</P>
<P>
A conference was held in Beijing, attended by major newspaper
and media organisations to throw the spotlight on the 'unhealthy
trend' of journalists being paid to produce stories.
</P>
<P>
"The media sector should be highly responsible to the party,
the people and the cause of journalism, and should take it as a
perennial task to fight 'paid-news'," said Xu Guangchun, deputy
head of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China, at a forum held in Beijing today to
debate the topic.
</P>
<P>
Officials from 25 major media organs and provincial propaganda
departments attended the forum, at which they compared notes in
promoting professional morals over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the staff in our media sector have regulated
themselves strictly and have been honest in performing their duties,"
Xu said.
</P>
<P>
"However, we should clearly see that the tendency
of 'paid-news' has revived sometimes because bad phenomena and
corruption in society have infected the news media."
</P>
<P>
Whether the problem can be solved depends on whether leading
officials pay sufficient attention to it, and have determination to
solve it, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Every media organs should step up professional ethics, bar the
activities of 'paid-news', revise regulations on self-discipline,
and set up appropriate mechanism to ensure the implementation of
those regulations, he added.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate Up in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The annual rate of inflation rose to
9.2 percent at the end of April, compared to 9.1 percent in March,
according to figures released today by the National Statistics
Service (NSS).
</P>
<P>
The rise was due to the fact that the consumer price index
(CPI) in April this year increased by 1.3 percent, against an
increase of 1.2 percent in the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The NSS said that the April CPI had been burdened by 0.18
percent as a result of the increase in the price of tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
Other products and services responsible for the CPI increase
were oranges, apples, vegetables, lamb, gasoline, heating oil and
the new hotel rates.
</P>
<P>
NSS General Secretary Fani Zervou described as "encouraging"
the fact that prices in the market appeared to be settling down,
noting that the price increases in April concerned isolated
products and did not create general inflationary trends.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Reassures Clinton on Russian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin held telephone talks earlier this
morning about issues concerning the forthcoming presidential
elections in Russia and the situation in Chechnya, the White House
said.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry described in a statement the
20-minute talks as "encouraging and warm."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration had been alarmed by the reported
suggestion of Yeltsin's security chief Alxander Korzhakov that the
Russian elections scheduled for June should be postponed as
Yeltsin is facing a strong challenge from the Communists.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the White House expressed deep concern about
Korzhakov's remarks.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said that Yeltsin reassured Clinton that he was
committed to free and fair elections on June 16, rejecting
Korzhakov's advice that he should delay the vote.
</P>
<P>
"President Yeltsin could not have been more direct in saying
that he considers a free and fair election one of his
constitutional responsibilities as president of the Russian
federation," the spokesman said. "We were gratified at President
Yeltsin's strong rebuke" of his aide's comments, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Russian presidents also discussed fighting in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged Yeltsin to hold formal talks with rebels and
restrain military action in the region, McCurry said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese-Syrian Proposal on Monitoring Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz said he conveyed to U.S. and French envoys today a joint
draft proposal of Lebanon and Syria on the formation of an
international committee to monitor the Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire
in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the U.S. and French ambassadors, Richard
Johns and Jean-Pierre Lafon, Boueiz announced that he handed over
to the two diplomats copies of a "joint draft agreed upon by
Lebanon and Syria on the formation of the monitoring committee."
</P>
<P>
He said that he had entrusted the Lebanese Ambassador to
Washington, Riad Tabbara, to attend a conference called for by the
United States on May 10 to prepare the committee's agenda.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said there were some common points between the Lebanese
draft and the proposals previously put forward by the United
States and France.
</P>
<P>
He added that he believed the Washington conference would
justify some ideas on the formation of the monitoring committee.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria today proposed a joint draft to counter a
U.S. blueprint they had earlier rejected on establishing a
five-nation group to monitor the cease-fire in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri told reporters today that
he agreed with the Syrian government on the joint draft in talks
he held in Damascus Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria have rejected a U.S. proposal to form the
committee at a cabinet-minister level with headquarters in
Washington and the U.S. holding the chair.
</P>
<P>
Lafon, the French ambassador, disclosed that the Lebanese draft
regarding the monitoring committee contained ideas which were not
included in the French proposal or the U.S. one.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the members of the monitoring committee could
be at the ministerial level and could include military experts.
</P>
<P>
Johns, the U.S. ambassador, said that negotiations on the
formation of the committee were continuing, stressing that he did
"not see any obstacle which could not be overcome."
</P>
<P>
He said he expected that progress would be made by the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz, accompanying Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri, paid a
prompt visit to Damascus Monday night and returned home at dawn
today. Hariri and Boueiz held a meeting in the Syrian capital
Monday night with Syrian Vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam and
Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi also met with his Syrian
counterpart Hafez al-Assad at the Syrian port city of Lattakia
last weekend. It was the first Syrian-Lebanese summit meeting
since the end of the Israeli aggressions in southern Lebanon last
month which claimed over 160 civilian lives.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed diplomatic sources in Beirut said that the
Lebanese and Syrian leaders consulted steps for the formation of
the international monitoring committee in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
According to the cease-fire understanding which was reached on
April 26, and which put an end to 16 days of the continuous
Israeli bombardment in southern Lebanon, the five-nation
committee is to be set up in order to monitor the enforcement of
the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The committee will consist of the representatives from
Syria, Lebanon, Israel, the U.S. and France. Consultations are
underway between the parties concerned on the composition,
function, headquarters and funding of the committee.

<HEADLINE> Rival Somaliland Militiamen Surrender To Egal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 militiamen royal to
former "Somaliland" leader Ali Tuur have surrendered to the
current break away republic leader, Mohamed Haji Ibrahim Egal.
</P>
<P>
According to Radio Hargeisa, the militiamen also brought two
armed vehicles to the self-claimed "Somaliland president" over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen received what the radio said "warm welcom" from
Egal and his top officials. Hundreds of residents lined up along
the streets of Hargeisa, capital of the break away republic, to
greet the militiamen, according to the radio.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen, who came from southeast of Hargeisa, called on
those still in the jungle to give up fighting and avoid further
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for Tuur said in South Magadishu that
they would continue fighting against the Egal-led Somaliland in
northern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Since President Siad Barre's regime was overthrown in 1991,
Somalia has been in anarchy. The country has been divided into
several parts controlled by warlords and faction fightings have
been reported frequertly.
</P>
<P>
In May 1991, Tuur declared independence of a "Repblic Somaliland".
Later he renounced his break away policy and became the "first
deputy president" of General Aidid's South Mogadishu government.
</P>
<P>
Egal took over the leadership of "Somaliland" in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Sino-EU Cooperation Agreements Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China and the European Union will
strengthen cooperation in intellectual property rights (IPR)
protection, according to an agreement signed in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement specified that Sino-EU cooperation in IPR will
include IPR training program and technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
The accord is among four agreements reached between the two
sides, and signed by Sun Zhenyu, vice-minister of China's Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, and Sir Leon Brittan,
vice president of EU.
</P>
<P>
The other three agreements are on bilateral cooperation
concerning higher education and universities, technology and
commerce in the dairy sector, and water buffalo development.
</P>
<P>
The EU will invest almost 57 million US dollars for the
projects which will be completed within three to five years.
</P>
<P>
IPR and higher education and university cooperation is an
important sector in Sino-EU relations, whereas China has been
cooperating with EU in agriculture since early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony prior to a reception marking
Europe Day, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing cited the agreements
as a new driving power for the existing Sino-EU political and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the economies of EU and China, as a developed
economic giant and the largest developing country respectively,
are complementary with each other.
</P>
<P>
To bring such ties into full play, the two sides will both
profit, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Sir Leon said that the signing of the agreements signals a new
step forward in EU-Chinese cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral cooperation in higher education and universities
is aimed at furthering human resource development in China by
promoting greater interest and understanding of the EU in
China. It provides opportunities for European professors to visit
China, fellowships and internships for Chinese scholars in Europe,
and collaborative research projects.
</P>
<P>
Technical and Commercial cooperation in the dairy sector
focuses on three areas of cooperation from production at the farm
level to the market. It will support the modernization of China's
large state-owned dairy companies, and promote European
involvement in China's dairy industry.
</P>
<P>
The water buffalo development project recognizes the importance
of water buffalo to the farming economies of Yunnan, Guangxi and
Guandong provinces. Its aim is to genetically improve the
buffaloes, opening up opportunities for buffalo dairy products in
urban markets.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to speed up
selecting the fourth group of enterprises to be listed on overseas
markets and will this year expand the experiment of issuing B
shares, strictly for foreign investors, said a senior Chinese
securities official.
</P>
<P>
"The country will list more firms on foreign markets,
especially the market in Hong Kong," said Zhou Daojiong, executive
vice-chairman of the Securities Committee under the State Council
at a conference on securities market held today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, also chairman of the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC), the country's securities watchdog, noted that
more efforts will be made to draft and revise the Securities Law
this year in a bid to develop the securities market to a new level
over the next five years,
</P>
<P>
"The promulgation of separate administrative regulations will
be accelerated, and effective measures be adopted to strengthen
law enforcement, and to check and crack down on major cases," he
said, adding that methods should be improved in the issuing of new
shares.
</P>
<P>
"When market conditions are appropriate, we will select some
enterprises which have postponed issuing new shares to raise funds
on the securities market.
</P>
<P>
"Regulation over the stock exchanges should be buttressed so as
to give full scope to spot supervision.
</P>
<P>
"To consolidate listed companies' awareness to release
information, a mechanism to monitor their operations and a regular
sampling system should be established, and CSRC and the two stock
exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen should clearly differentiate
their functions in releasing information," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that CSRC and the stock exchanges should spur and
help companies listed to improve their constitutions and upgrade
management structure according to the Corporate Law.

<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the National
People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, met with Lawrence
Gonzi, speaker of Maltese House of Representatives, in Beijing
today.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting at the Great Hall of the People, Qiao said
this was the first visit by a high-ranking delegation of Malta's
House of Representatives, which will surely help promote
understanding and friendship between the two countries'
parliaments and friendly relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China's NPC attaches great importance to its
friendly and cooperative relations with the Maltese House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
In June 1994, Wang Guangying, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing
Committee, was accorded a warm reception while heading a
delegation to Malta, a visit that proved to be a complete success,
he added.
</P>
<P>
With the joint efforts of both sides, China and Malta are
carrying out effective cooperation in all fields, including
politics, economics, science and technology, and culture, he added.
</P>
<P>
Qiao briefed the guests on the situation of China's
legislation.
</P>
<P>
"This is the most advantageous period now for China's economic
development and economic legislation," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"When we drafted the first constitution in 1954 we made a
careful study of the constitutions of other countries in the world;
now in the process of reform and opening-up, we more than ever
before need to study and acquaint ourselves with legislation of
other countries in order to match them in this regard," Qiao
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Qiao also outlined the NPC's task of law enforcement and
supervision, and the work of the NPC and local people's congresses.
</P>
<P>
Gonzi described his delegation's visit to China as a mile-stone
for Malta's House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we value our contacts with China's NPC in the
past and hope that we will continue regular contacts."
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply impressed by China's rapid progress in
legislation, as well as in economic development and reform and
opening-up," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Maltese delegation arrived in China on Sunday for a
week-long visit at the invitation of the Chinese NPC Standing
Committee. The visitors will also travel to the cities of Shanghai
and Xi'an during the visit.

<HEADLINE> Committee Launched to Control Hepatitis B Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A hepatitis prevention organization
was launched in Beijing today to tell ordinary Chinese people and
health workers how to prevent the disease.
</P>
<P>
The Hepatitis B-Control Promotion Committee, with members from
the Ministry of Public Health and some leading hospitals and
medical academies, will hold a series of publicity activities
across the country in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The committee is held responsible for arousing people's
awareness on the prevention of hepatitis B, a serious disease
endangering the health of Chinese people, said Dai Zhicheng,
director general of the Disease Control Department under the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
More than half of China's population have been infected by the
hepatitis B virus. The country has reported more than 100 million
carriers of such virus, accounting for one third of the world's
total hepatitis B patients, said Dai, also one of the committee
members.
</P>
<P>
Experts warn that the patients will probably die of liver
cirrhosis and liver cancer caused by hepatitis B.
</P>
<P>
But they also suggest that effective prevention measures will
help to control spread of the disease, since its virus is usually
transmitted through blood, semen and spittle.
</P>
<P>
Chinese medical departments have organized a number of
nationwide or local publicity activities, as well as inoculating
more than 80 percent of newly-born infants against hepatitis B
every year, and controlling diseases transmitted through blood,
according to Dai.
</P>
<P>
The work of the committee is expected to be an important part
of the country's efforts to control hepatitis B, said
Vice-Minister of Public Health Zhang Wenkang, also a committee
member.
</P>
<P>
All the promotion activities of the committee will be funded by
the British-based Adelphi Communications Ltd. and LaChine
Associates Ltd.

<HEADLINE> China To Put Huge Fund In Updating Air Traffic Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China is to invest more than six
billion yuan in updating its air traffic control systems in the
next five years, the country's biggest ever investment in the
field.
</P>
<P>
Bao Peide, deputy director of the Civil Aviation Administration
of China (CAAC), said in Beijing today that the money will be used
on more than 1,000 projects to improve the systems.
</P>
<P>
He said 5.5 billion will be used to improve communications,
navigation and radar equipment, and 440 million to build CNS/ATM
systems, a new kind of air traffic control system that is being
adopted worldwide.
</P>
<P>
In the coming few years, China will focus on improvement of air
traffic control systems in the eastern part of the country,
especially in the Beijing-Shanghai-Guangzhou Delta, the area with
the biggest air traffic flow in China, Bao revealed.
</P>
<P>
He added that the the skies over three biggest airports in
Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou will be covered by triple radar
surveillance layers before the end of the century, to improve
safety and reduce the intervals between plane departures and
landings.
</P>
<P>
Capital airport in Beijing, China's biggest and best equipped,
handles more than 300 departures and landings each day, while some
of the biggest airports in the world can handle over 2,000.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, China injected a total of 3.5 billion
yuan in some 400 air traffic control projects. China recently
started to use the first satellite communications network
exclusively for aviation, and is to build a second one in the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
Bao and other CAAC officials today also awarded prizes to
communications technicians for their contributions in helping to
ensure flight safety. Chinese airlines have reported no flight
accidents in China for 21 consecutive months.

<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Building the new Euro-Asia bridge

<HEADLINE> Electricity Falls Far Short of Demand in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh needs an additional 2,000
megawatt of electricity in the next five years to meet the
country's growing demand, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The local press reported today that the country's electric
power production now stands only at less than 2,200 megawatts and
has to be increased to 4,200 megawatt by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
The installed capacity of the country's power sector is high,
but production is much lower due to poor maintenance of the
outmoded power plants and transmission lines, the experts said,
adding that most of them need immediate replacement.
</P>
<P>
The installation of the 2nd generating unit of the Rauzan power
plant in Chittagong, being set up by the China National Machinery
and Equipment Import and Export Corporation, and some other
expansion projects will enhance the generation capacity.
</P>
<P>
But the experts said the increased capacity is still far from
enough to meet the growing demand.

<HEADLINE> China's Twin Sisters Keep Growing Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China's sister cities have been
flourishing in numbers over the past four years with, increasing
at a rate of 74 pairs annually.
</P>
<P>
The second national conference of the China International
Friendship Cities Association (CIFCA) opened here today with an
announcement that CIFCA membership has reached 206, compared with
147 in 1992 when it was initiated.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 28 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities, and 179 cities had established almost 700 sister
cities with partners in 81 countries across five continents.
</P>
<P>
The CIFCA has also established regular co-operative relations
with international or national organizations on sister city
issues.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than 600 trade fairs have been
organized through the sister-city channels and some 4.2 billion US
dollars of business volume has been reached. Trade volume between
sister cities through other forms totaled 1.9 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sister-city relations have produced over 1,200 foreign- or
jointly-financed projects in China, and introduced some 10 billion
US dollars of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Besides, more than 30,000 people have took part in professional
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Qi Huaiyuan, president of the Chinese People's Association for
Friendship with Foreign Countries, said at today's working meeting
that China's eastern region has been considerably more active in
forging sister-city relations than inland areas, and the partners
are mainly focused in the developed countries of Asia, Europe and
America.
</P>
<P>
The CIFCA will pay more attention to the middle and western
areas to strike a balance in this respect, Qi said.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Pledges Conditioned Financial Support for Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji has
made a conditioned pledge to state-owned enterprises that they
will receive sufficient financial support from banks.
</P>
<P>
Ending an 11-day inspection tour of Guizhou and Jiangxi
provinces, Zhu said that the banking sector will provide
state-owned enterprises with enough working funds to meet their
needs.
</P>
<P>
However, such loans should not be misappropriated for the use
of capital construction work, and they will be designated for
production of goods that meet market demands, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
It is equally essential that the enterprises should make
repayments to banks in due time, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier held that the monetary policy has not been
very tight since late 1993 when the central authorities began to
strengthen macro-economic control, as the growth of bank loans has
continued to outstrip that of industrial production for the past
years.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that many enterprises have complained about fund
shortages mainly because they have diverted working funds to
capital construction.
</P>
<P>
In economic development, there will always be some problems and
such problems will be dealt with gradually, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
During the inspection tour, Zhu also paid close attention to
rural development in the two provinces.
</P>
<P>
On the supply of chemical fertilizers to farmers, the vice
premier said that the market prices are now too high for farmers
to bear, while fake or poor-quality chemical fertilizers have
added to the problem, especially for farmers in poverty-stricken
areas.
</P>
<P>
Such a situation must not be allowed to continue and leading
officials at various levels must take effective measures to tackle
the problem, he said.

CAIRO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Saeb Erekat, member of the Palestinian
delegation to the Palestinian-Israeli final stage negotiations,
today described the current negotiations as "the start of a new
stage in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"It can be said that the real negotiations between the two sides
have started," he told the Sawt el-Arab radio.
</P>
<P>
"Holding these negotiations in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of
Taba highlights the fact that Egypt forms a substantial weight in
bolstering the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility that Israeli Likud party comes to power,
Erekat said the Palestinians were trying to make peace with Israel
as a whole, not with a particular political party.
</P>
<P>
He added that the May 29 Israeli elections are Israel's
domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
The first round of the final phase of the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations concluded Monday at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of
Taba.

<HEADLINE> Latest Mishaps in HK's MTR System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- About 80,000 commuters of Hong
Kong's Mass Transit Railway (MTR) were stranded or delayed Monday
after a signal failure caused a major disruption along the
subway's Tseun Wan line for about an hour.
</P>
<P>
And 33 passengers fainted on crowded trains and platforms and
had to be treated on the spot or sent to hospital.
</P>
<P>
This was the latest incident happened since the MTR was put
into operation in stages from October 1979 to August 1989.
</P>
<P>
Comprising 43 kilometers with 38 stations, the MTR is run on
three lines with a fleet of 711 cars operating in eight-car trains
 and, as one of the world's busiest metro systems, it carries 2.4
million passengers per day.
</P>
<P>
Following are some of the incidents during the system's
seven-plus years' services:
</P>
<P>
November 6, 1990: 5,000 passengers forced to walk along MTR
Cross-Harbor Tunnel to Admiralty after a train broke down during
the morning rush hour because of a power fault. Services on the
Hong Kong Island line were disrupted for more than two hours.
</P>
<P>
March 11, 1991: Half a million passengers stranded between
Cheung San Wan and Lai Chi Kok stations after a broken insulator
damaged overhead power supplies, again during the morning rush
hour. The incident led to service disruption on the Tsuen Wan
line for six hours. A damaged overhead line was found to be the
cause.
</P>
<P>
April 27, 1993: A morning rush-hour train split into two, 200
meters from Tseun Wan terminus. Passengers in the rear cars had
to walk along the track to the terminus. Services on the Tseun
Wan line were disrupted for about an hour and 30,000 commuters
were affected. An inquiry revealed that couplings linking the
cars had broken off.
</P>
<P>
January 28, 1994: A train derailed at Kowloon Bay. The
incident happened in the evening and did not cause widespread
inconvenience to passengers. A loose metal bolt was later found
to be blamed.
</P>
<P>
May 10, 1994: Services between Tseun Wan and Kwai Fong were
disrupted for 50 minutes after a set of doors on a Central-bound
train failed to close at Kwai Hing on the Tseun Wan line. At
least 2,500 passengers had to alight and take other transport.
</P>
<P>
May 1, 1995: A gas canister exploded at Kowloon Bay. No
injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
September 22, 1995: Faulty electric cable brackets damaged two
trains between Wong Tai Sin and Lok Fu, and Shek Kip Mei and
Diamond Hill. The incident caused disruption to services on the
Kwun Tong line for more than three hours. Passengers blasted the
company for misinforming them about service resumption
times. About 125,000 passengers were affected.
</P>
<P>
December 29, 1995: Two trains almost collided head-on at
Central when one train switched to the wrong track. The two
trains, with thousands of passengers on board, came within 100
meters before both were stopped automatically by a built-in
computer system. The train service regulator was later found to
have issued conflicting instructions that led to the near crash.
</P>
<P>
February 29, 1996: A metallic balloon lodged against an
overhead cable causing an electrical fault that disrupted services
for 100,000 Island line commuters.

<HEADLINE> HK's Banknotes Printing Plant Could Print Renminbi: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The newly acquired Hong Kong Note
Printing Ltd. was capable, technically speaking, of printing
Renminbi, a Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) official said here
 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Yam, chief executive of the HKMA and chairman of the
Hong Kong Note Printing Ltd., said: "If China wants the note plant
to print her currency notes, we are able to do so."
</P>
<P>
But China was not one of the markets of De La Rue, a
Britain-based company which used to own the plant, he said.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang Yam-kuen officiated
yesterday's opening ceremony of the plant located in Tai Po, which
was acquired by the government through the Exchange Fund in
January this year at a price of 255 million HK dollars (32.7
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Apart from printing local banknotes, I think the plant has
great potential in developing other areas of business and
operating on a profitable basis," he said.
</P>
<P>
The plant is a two-storey building with a gross floor area of
7,600 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The operation of the 118-staff plant has produced over 300
billion HK dollars (38.5 billion US dollars) worth of Hong Kong
banknotes since its establishment in 1984.

<HEADLINE> Wang Sets World Best, Qu Finishes Last </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 7 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Women's 10,000m world record
holder Wang Junxia registered a world fastest time of the year,
while Qu Yunxia, 1,500m world record holder, suffered a
humiliation defeat Tuesday at the Chinese athletics trials for the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who set the best time this season in the 5,000 meters two
days ago, ran an incredible fast race in the 10,000 meter heat
early Tuesday in 31:01.76, chalking up the world best mark this
year.
</P>
<P>
Wang's time also beat Portugal's Fernanda Ribeiro's 31:04.99,
the world best last year which was well outside of wang's 29:31.78
global record.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Chinese, who ranked fifth in the world last
year, took a solo lead in the day's heat and completed the 5,000
meter mark in 15:27.00. Her finished last lap in 64.77 seconds.
</P>
<P>
"My goal is to beat the last year's world best, and I just ran
with a regular speed of 73 seconds for each lap," said Wang, who
left Ma Junren in 1994 and now is coached by Mao Dezhen.
</P>
<P>
Mao told Xinhua:"We want Wang to run a fast heat. She will run
in tomorrow's final. We also have a plan for that."
</P>
<P>
Jiang Bo, who ranked fourth in the world last year in the 5,000
meters, didn't compete in the 25-lap event. "She injured her left
ankle," her coach Guo Jinfeng said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Qu Yunxia, coach Ma Junren's ace runner, tried hard in the
1,500m final, but could only finish a distanced eighth with a poor
time of 4:13.05.
</P>
<P>
Liu dong, former world 1,500-meter champion who made her first
appearance since 1994, looked no good as well when the 25-year-old
wound up third in 4:10.20, behind Wang Chunyan, 4:09.28, and Yan
Wei, 4:09.48.
</P>
<P>
Qu and Liu refused to say anything after the race. But Mao,
also Liu's coach, blamed Qu by saying that Qu's pace in the first
two laps was too slow.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody expected Qu that weak, but when Liu and other runners
realized that, it was too late for herself," Mao said.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon finals, Huang Geng, Asian men's long jump
record holder, posted the world third best mark this season with a
8.29-meter jump. The 1.79-meter-tall Chinese also had two
impressive jumps of 8.27 and 8.26.
</P>
<P>
Huang, who arrived here Sunday night, competed in two
international meets last week in Japan, leaping 8.23 and 8.33
meters but the latter was a wind-aided one.
</P>
<P>
"I have already competed in 10 meets so far this season. I'm
aiming to do big at the Olympics," said Huang after the
competition.
</P>
<P>
A new Asian record was set by Li Shaojie in the men's
discus. His winning distance was 65.76 meters, beating the old
mark by 14 centimeters. The toss is the world fourth best this
season.
</P>
<P>
Han Chaoming clocked 20.54 seconds to set a new national record
in the men's 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
The five-day trials will end Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Four Hong Kong scientists won the
Chinese State Natural Science Awards here today, the nation's top
prize for achievements in basic and applied research.
</P>
<P>
The awarding ceremony for winners in the Hong Kong region was
held at the Hong Kong University today, drawing some 100 local
scholars, scientists, teachers and students. Academician Xu
Guanhua, vice minister of the Chinese State Science and Technology
 Commission, presented medals, certificates and premiums to the
four researchers.
</P>
<P>
Professor Thomas C.W. Mak of the Chinese University of Hong
Kong, was awarded the third prize, the highest among the four, for
his 30-year dedication to the study of chemical crystallography.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong University was proud to have two winners -- Professor
So Kwok Fai for a biological project on axonal regeneration of
retinal ganglion cells in adult mammals and Dr. Z.D. Wang, who has
carried out investigations on the physical properties in the mixed
state of high-temperature superconductors. Both got the fourth
prize in joint efforts with their partners in China.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Tong B. Tang of Hong Kong Baptist University shared a
fourth prize with four scientific workers in Shanghai by exploring
defect structure and impurity effect in lithium niobate, a topic
in the field of materials science.
</P>
<P>
So far ten Hong Kong scientists have won China's top awards in
natural science since the biennial award was first conferred on
Hong Kong scientists in 1989.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu Guanhua, of the four prize-winning projects,
three were accomplished jointly by Hong Kong scientists and their
counterparts in China. He expressed the hope that scientists in
the two places would expand their cooperation to make greater
achievements as Hong Kong will return to the motherland next year.

<P>
Also at the ceremony, Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the
Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, spoke highly of the Hong Kong
scientists, who took four titles out of a total of 57. He said
that the development of science and technology will help Hong Kong
succeed in transforming the economic structure so as to maintain
its long-term stability.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Traditional Chinese Architecture Favored in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Traditional Chinese architecture
has become a most-favored choice in designing and building public
recreational places in Hong Kong, said Tse Shun-kai, senior
architect with the Hong Kong Architectural Services Department
(ASD) which is in charge of building the territory's public
facilities.
</P>
<P>
A 9,000 sq. m. public leisure garden is to be built in the style
of the Tang Dynasty (618-907) in Diamond Hill of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
This is one of a series of building projects in Hong Kong which
adopt traditional Chinese styles in a bid to boost public
awareness of Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Tse said that traditional Chinese
architecture occupies a unique position among the world's
architectural styles, which combines character, music, painting,
sculpture, construction and greening together to incarnate Chinese
culture.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is an international metropolis, and over 90 percent
of the residents are Chinese, he said. So it is reasonable to
build Chinese-style gardens and public facilities for people to
have leisure in busy metropolitan lives.
</P>
<P>
Traditional Chinese architecture has been largely neglected in
the development history of Hong Kong from a fishing village to an
international commercial, monetary and tourism center.
</P>
<P>
"The ASD realized the importance of traditional Chinese garden
in Hong Kong and began to study its social function and building
pattern for social service," said Tse who earned his M.A. in
architecture from the University of California, USA.
</P>
<P>
Kowloon Walled City Park was the first major project built in
Chinese style in recent years. The 29,000 sq.m. park features
traditional South China style of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
"Since the park opened to the public last December, it has
received over 770,000 visitors, many of whom are young students,"
Tse said, whose design of the park won a prize in Germany.
</P>
<P>
"People here are hungry for Chinese culture," he added.
</P>
<P>
Other such projects include Northern District Park, with the
"Small West Lake (Shou Xi Hu)" in East China's Yangzhou as the
blueprint, a squash and table tennis center combining both Chinese
and western cultural characteristics, Lai Chi Kok Park featuring
the style of North China royal garden, Tsuen Wan Natural
Ecological Park in the style of Hangzhou garden, and Sha Tin
Museum in Chinese civil residential style.
</P>
<P>
Some of the projects have been completed, some are under
construction and some are being planned.
</P>
<P>
To make these projects perfect, Tse and other designers have
visited many provinces on the mainland in the past few years to
seek typical traditional Chinese architecture and absorbed the
essence of traditional Chinese architecture into their designs.
</P>
<P>
Tse said that many skilled workers have been invited from the
mainland to participate in building these projects. The Kowloon
Walled City Park even used bricks and tiles removed from old
residential buildings in China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
He said the ASD's study of traditional Chinese architecture is
continuing and more projects are expected to be built in Chinese
styles.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to contribute some to Chinese architectural culture,"
Tse said.

<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will be more prosperous
and stable when China resumes the exercise of its sovereignty next
year, Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji said today.
</P>
<P>
Meeting a delegation in Beijing from the Hong Kong General
Chamber of Commerce, Zhu said that after July 1, 1997, Hong Kong
will implement the principles of "one country, two systems" and
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
It is the responsibility of the Hong Kong people and the
government of the future Special Administrative Region to maintain
Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, he told the delegation, led
by its newly-appointed Chairman James P.G. Tien.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhu said that because of the integration of the
economies of Hong Kong and the mainland, as the economy on the
mainland grows well, so will that in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I am fully confident about the mainland's economic
growth. So long as we work hard together, Hong Kong will continue
to keep its prosperity and stability."
</P>
<P>
At present, the main aspects of Hong Kong and its prospects are
good, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Zhu briefed the visitors on the mainland's
economic growth and answered a number of their questions.

<HEADLINE> 3rd Phase of India's Polling Ends with Low Turnout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The third and final major phase of
polling of India's general elections ended today with a low
turnout and stray violent incidents that claimed four lives.
</P>
<P>
The polling, which covered 11 states and two constituencies of
India-held Jammu and Kashmir, was held for 183 seats in the Lok
Sabha (lower house of parliament) and 154 assembly seats in West
Bengal.
</P>
<P>
Involving an electorate of 210 million, today's voting started
on a rather dull note and gradually picked up as the day advanced.
 But reports reaching here so far suggested a very low turnout.
</P>
<P>
Bihar, the country's second most populous state, saw a voter
turnout of only 30 to 35 percent till 4 p.m. local time (1030
GMT), one hour before the end of polling.
</P>
<P>
In some of the states going to the polls today, only less than
20 percent of the voters cast their votes by noon.
</P>
<P>
The polling proceeded peacefully by and large, except for minor
incidents of violence in Bihar and Manipur.
</P>
<P>
In the violence-prone state of Bihar, a police officer and his
driver were killed and four others injured in a land-mine
explosion in Hazirabagh district early today.
</P>
<P>
Also in Bihar, two people were reportedly killed in
poll-related clashes.
</P>
<P>
In Manipur, a small state in east India, armed miscreants
attacked some polling stations and destroyed polling materials.
Election officials said they are considering repolling in some
polling booths of the state.
</P>
<P>
Today's polling was practically the final phase of India's
month-long general elections as 537 of the 543 Lok Sabha seats
have now been contested.
</P>
<P>
Counting of the votes will begin tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Hariri Says Lebanon Seeks Political and Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri
said here today that the current contacts which his country is
conducting are aimed at rallying political and financial support.
</P>
<P>
Asked about a proposed international consultative committee
responsible for assistance to Lebanon, the premier said "the
contacts which we are carrying out have two purposes."
</P>
<P>
One of the purpose is political, he said, that is to persuade
all the countries to "stand together on Lebanon's side in the
future stage."
</P>
<P>
The second purpose is for obtaining assistance and long-term
loans, he added.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held several hours before his departure
for Rome to start his European tour, the Lebanese prime minister
asserted that his visit to Italy, Belgium and France is not only
for getting assistance for southern Lebanon, but also for the
whole country.
</P>
<P>
"The attainment of the assistance is not easy," he said.
"But we should be patient."
</P>
<P>
"And the assistance should go to the reconstruction
projects," said the multi-billionaire prime minister, who is the
architect of Lebanon's ambitious plan of reconstruction and
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
According to a cease-fire understanding reached on April 26
which put an end to 16 days of Israeli military operations
in southern Lebanon, an international consultative committee is
to be set up in order to draw assistance to the
war-devastated southern Lebanese towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
Hariri is scheduled to leave here this afternoon for Rome
to begin a European tour of Italy, Belgium and France to speed up
the process of extending aid and soft loans to finance Lebanon's
reconstruction plans.
</P>
<P>
Hariri held meetings this morning with Lebanese President Elias
Hrawi and House Speaker Nabih Berri.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz, Hariri paid a
prompt visit to Damascus Monday night and returned home at dawn
today. Hariri and Boueiz held talks in the Syrian capital with
Syrian Vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam and Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Shara.

<HEADLINE> Asian Youth Educated to Combat AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A 10,000-strong army of young people
in China and across Asia are to launch a battle against the spread
of killer disease AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The peer-group educators will be trained in ten Asian
countries in next few years, an Asian AIDS meeting was told in
Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
A group of medical and technical professionals from 10 Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies across Asia gathered in the
Chinese capital for the three-day meeting. They are putting the
finishing touches to the World's First-Ever Cross Border AIDS
Prevention Program, with young people directly involved in its
development.
</P>
<P>
Guided by the Asian Red Cross and Red Crescent AIDS Task Force
(ART), the societies from China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, Nepal, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam have
combined to generate a manual on reproductive health and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The manual will form the basis for the training of 10,000 youth
peer educators, who, in turn, will cascade key HIV/AIDS prevention
messages to young people in China and the other participating
countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition to youth peer education, ART members will also
focus particularly on strategies to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS
among women, who must rely on their partners to practise safe sex
and are, therefore, increasingly vulnerable to the deadly virus.
</P>
<P>
"National boundaries cannot contain or exclude the HIV/AIDS
virus -- which is why a regional approach to the pandemic is
vital," said Patric Couteau, Regional Health Delegate for the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of confirmed HIV (Human
Immuno-deficiency Virus) cases in Asia has increased by one
million to 4.3 million last year, with half of the victims with
HIV infection are under 25 years old.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that there are up to 50,000 to 100,000 people
in China who have tested HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
The AIDS prevention education for young people and women has
been carried out in west China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
in West China, and in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region and Yunnan Province, said Dr. Lan Jun, director of the
Health and First Aid Services Department of Red Cross Society of
China.
</P>
<P>
He said that more funding is needed to expand preventative
education in other parts of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Airlines (PAL), the
country's flag carrier, recorded a loss of 2.029 billion pesos (78
million US dollars) for the 10-month period from April 1995 to
January 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the airline said today that it expects to earn some
600 million pesos (23.07 million US dollars) in its system-wide
operations during the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PAL lost 88 million pesos (3.38 million US
dollars) in its international operations for the 10-month period
in review.
</P>
<P>
But it expects to make some 500 million pesos (19.23 million US
dollars) in the coming fiscal year from the same operations.
</P>
<P>
The PAL said that the positive financial projections will be a
direct result of the gradual acquisition of new aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The PAL right now is busy with its modernization program, which
involves the acquisition of 36 new aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The refleeting program will enable the PAL to increase the
average aircraft utilization rate from 8 to 14 hours a day and
will allow the airline to expand its domestic, regional and
international route networks.

<HEADLINE> Manila Criticizes HK Consultancy Firm's Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today criticized the report of a Hongkong consultancy firm, which
cited the Philippines as the most unsafe place for business in
East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Hongkong-based Political and Economic Risk
Consultancy Ltd. gave Manila a rating of 7.24 percent on a risk
scale from zero to 10.
</P>
<P>
It listed the Philippines as the most unsafe place for
investments in the countries in East Asia due to kidnapping
incidents.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in San Jose, Antique, some 250 km
south of Manila, Ramos said that the report is "just a spot report
and not comprehensive in contrast to other big international firms
like Barings, Merril Lynch and Salomon Brothers which are more
credible."
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippines continues to entice foreign investors
and indicated that the Philippine Stock Exchange is about to hit
the all time high 3,000 index points.
</P>
<P>
Philippine exports posted a 25 percent increase and the
country's international reserves have hit more than nine billion
US dollars for the first time, he added.
</P>
<P>
The president blasted the consultancy firm for not identifying
clearly the respondents in the so-called survey.
</P>
<P>
The reality is that business investment in the Philippines is
booming to record heights, he said.

<HEADLINE> Former Barings Chief to Be Suspended as Director </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Peter Norris, former chief executive
of Barings, is to be suspended for three years from its Register
of Directors and will pay a cost of 10,000 pounds (15,000 U.S.
dollars), the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) announced
today.
</P>
<P>
In a settlement with the SFA, Norris admitted that he failed to
pursue a 50 million pound (75 million dollar) discrepancy in the
accounts of Nick Leeson, a Singapore-based trader who eventually
brought down the bank in February 1995 with 830 million pounds
(1.2 billion dollars) of losses.
</P>
<P>
Barings was later bought by Dutch bank and insurance giant
Internationale Nederkanden Groep NV in March 1995.
</P>

Norris was removed from his position as chief executive after
the collapse of Barings, but remained as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
SFA officials said Norris "failed to act with due skill, care
and diligence with regard to the level of positions reportedly
held by Barings in its switching business on Singapore
International Monetary Exchange and the Japanese exchanges."
</P>
<P>
But the securities regulator has held back from declaring that
Norris is not "fit and proper" to work in the securities industry,
which would have made it difficult for him to find further
employment in the sector.
</P>
<P>
However, Ron Baker, the former head of Barings' financial
products group and Leeson's ultimate boss, has reportedly refused
to accept the regulator's verdict on him and will today begin the
process of appealing to an independent tribunal.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Building the new Euro-Asia bridge

UN organizations meeting in Beijing today.
</P>

The new Euro-Asia continental bridge, starting from the eastern
Pacific coastal cities in China and ending in the eastern Atlantic
coastal cities, refers to a comprehensive international corridor
connecting Asia with Europe mainly by means of land communications.
</P>
<P>
As both sides of the bridge are the most dynamic markets with

resources, the area has witnessed promising prospects for regional
economic cooperation.

the State Science and Technology Commission, met with Sir Leon
Brittan, first vice-president of the European Union Commission,
and other senior officials present at the symposium. Both Song and
Sir Leon called the symposium an action to carry out the theme of
the Euro-Asia Summit held in March in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>

relations with EU over the past 15 years in such fields as
biotechnology, energy, telecommunication, agriculture, remote
sensing and geology. He expressed his wish that a science and
technology agreement soon be signed soon between China and the

MANILA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will grand
incentives to joint venture infrastructure projects between
government and private firms.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Investments (BOI) said today it is seeking
concurrence from the National Economic Development Authority to
expand the coverage of infrastructure projects in the existing
investment priorities plan (IPP).
</P>
<P>
BOI officials said that the infrastructure heading in the IPP
covers only projects that comply with the build-operate-transfer
(BOT) laws.
</P>
<P>
The BOI's move is to expand the coverage to include joint
venture arrangements of government-owned corporations whose
charters allow them to enter into joint venture with private
companies.
</P>
<P>
These government-owned firms include the Bases Conversion
Development Authority, the Philippine National Construction Corp.
and the Philippine National Railway.
</P>
<P>
BOI officials noted that joint venture projects of
government-owned corporations could not adopt a BOT scheme because
these projects do not undergo the BOT process.

FREETOWN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States government said
Tuesday it ''will bar with immediate effect, entry into the US
by Liberian faction leaders, their families, close associates and
others who are impeding the peace process and transition to
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
A release issued by the American Embassy here quoted
Department of State Spokesman Nicholas Burns as saying ''the
action results from the refusal of the faction leaders to heed
the pleas of the Liberian people or to respond to calls from the
international community to stop the wanton killing, looting and
fighting in Monrovia and return to the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
''With Liberia on the verge of total chaos, it is critical
that faction leaders agree to reinstate the april 19 ceasefire
agreement, reestablish Monrovia as a safe haven for its one million
civilian inhabitants and attend the May 7-8 emergency ECOWAS summit
in accra,'' the release said.
</P>
<P>
''The US is prepared to consider further measures to demonstrate
its intolerance of the faction leaders obstruction of the peace
process,'' the release concludes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Kabbah left here Tuesday to attend the
ECOWAS summit.
</P>
<P>
In Monrovia itself, sporadic fighting continues early Tuesday
between supporters of Charles Taylor and Roosevelt Johnson.
Pentagon officials said Tuesday that US marines guarding the
American Embassy with 20 diplomats inside shot back in self defence
after gunfire was directed at them. No casualties were reported.
</P>

The inquiry which was authorised by President Tejan Kabbah is

Kabbah warned his compatriots ''not to allow their quest for
monetary gains to overide considerations relating to their
personal safety and those of others.''
</P>

At the mortuary in port Loko, in the north of the country,
Kabbah said, "such an unfortunate incident could have been
avoided if the boat owners and captain had adhered to laid down
regulations governing transportation by sea.''

''It is unfortunate that a boat licenced to carry a maximum of
about 55 passengers had on board some 210 passengers in addition
to a sizeable consignment of iron rods,'' Kabbah added.

BEIRUT, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon and Syria handed over today a
joint response to the United States and France to their proposals
on a five-nation committee monitoring the cease-fire in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Returning from a prompt visit to Damascus, Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik al-Hariri announced this morning that he had
reached an agreement with Syria to hand over a joint draft to the
U.S. and French ambassadors in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Details of the draft remained secret.
</P>
<P>
But Diplomatic sources in the Lebanese capital said that the
joint Lebanese-Syrian proposal, which was drafted in Damascus
Monday night, is more in line with the French plan.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hariri, accompanied by Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz,
returned home at dawn from the Syrian capital, where they held
talks Monday night with Syrian Vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam
and Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed diplomatic sources in Beirut said that the
Lebanese and Syrian leaders, during their consultations in the
past days, reviewed steps for the formation of the international
monitoring committee.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Boueiz had separate meetings in his office with
U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Richard Johns and French Ambassador
Jean-Pierre Lafon to deliver the draft to them.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the committee was part of the April 26
understanding mediated by the U.S., which put an end to 16 days of
exchange of gunfire between the Israeli forces and the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The committee, comprising representatives from Syria, Lebanon,
Israel, the U.S. and France, is to be set up in order to monitor
the enforcement of the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Consultations are still under way among all parties concerned
on the committee's formation and mechanism of its operations,
especially on the proposals raised by Washington and Paris
regarding the committee's composition, function, headquaters and
funding.

<P>
Syria and Lebanon have rejected a U.S. proposal to form the
committee at a Cabinet-minister level with headquaters in
Washington and the United States holding the chair.

BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said today

vice-president of European Union (EU) Commission.
</P>
<P>

The vice-president noted that the EU is willing to make new
efforts to expand its economic and technological cooperation with
China.
</P>

a new Asia-Europe partner relationship, which would offer
favorable opportunities for Asian and European countries to

in their economic cooperation, and the two sides should become
cooperative partners of equality and mutual benefit.

<HEADLINE> Consultation Services Popular in Shenyang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of residents
of Shenyang, capital city of northeast China's Liaoning Province,
have acquired the habit of seeking advice from professionals in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 7,000 persons attended a recent
consultation fair for two days, which Yang Qiulin, one of the
co-sponsors of the activity, attributes to the increase in
psychological pressures caused by the pace of life.
</P>
<P>
"In such a volatile society, people, especially the elderly,
are easily confused by rapidly changing circumstances, and as a
result, anxiety increases considerably," Yang explained.
</P>
<P>
A number of consultation services have sprung up in the city to
meet the growing demand, covering a wide range of topics, such as
a range of psychological problems from personal feelings to
everyday affairs like shopping and household disputes.
</P>
<P>
"It's a paradox," Yang pointed out, "on the one hand, people's
education level has been climbing, but on the other, people cannot
keep up with the pace of the changing world and are less confident
of themselves."

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Raises Minimum Wages for JV Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 7 (Xinhua)-- The Vietnamese government has decided
to increase minimum wages paid to Vietanamese workers in
foreign-invested enterprises, said an official report here Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the English "Vietnam News" quoting Tran Dinh Hoan,
Minister of Labour, War Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA), the
decision will become effective as of July 1.
</P>
<P>
The minimum wages in foreign-invested enterprises in Hanoi and
Ho Chi Minh city will be fixed at 45 U.S. dollars a month, while
those in the nine cities of Haiphong, Halong, Vinh, Hue, Danang,
Nha Trang, Bien Hoa, Vung Dau and Can Tho at 40 U.S. dollars, and
35 U.S. dollars in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-invested enterprises situated in regions with poor
infrastructure conditions and facilities and those employing a
large work force may have to pay only 30 to 35 U.S. dollars with
the consent of MOLISA.
</P>
<P>
Minimum wages and salaries at foreign-invested enterprises have
been fixed at 35 U.S. dollars a month in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh
city at present, and 30 U.S. dollars in other parts since May 5,
1992.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Hoan explained that the wages of the Vietnamese workers in
foreign-invested enterprises have devalued by 30 percent, as
commodity prices in the country have gone up since 1992 whereas
the rate of exchange of the Vietnamese currency against the
U.S. dollar has declined.

<HEADLINE> Draft of Explanation of HK Nationality Law for NPC (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- From July 1, 1997 on, all Hong Kong
residents of Chinese descent will hold People's Republic of China
citizenship, if they were born in China, which includes Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the stipulations of a draft explanation for
several questions related to the implementation of the Nationality
Law of the PRC in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which
was submitted to Chinese legislators for consideration today.
</P>
<P>
The legislators are attending the 19th session of the Standing
Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress, China's
legislature, which opened here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The draft also says that Hong Kong citizens who meet the
conditions of the Nationality Law are also Chinese citizens after
the 1997 takeover.
</P>
<P>
In his report on the draft at the meeting, Qiao Xiaoyang, vice
director of the Commission of Legislative Affairs of the NPC
Standing Committee, pointed out that Hong Kong residents'
citizenship is an extremely complex issue because of historical
reasons.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the British government for further complicating this
problem with its 1990 British Nationality Selection Scheme, which
granted British citizenship to some 225,000 Chinese residents of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In order to maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, he
said, it is necessary for the NPC standing committee to provide an
explanation for the implementation of the Nationality Law in the
SAR, which should be in accordance with the Basic Law of the SAR
and consistent with state policies on citizenship of Hong Kong
residents.

<HEADLINE> Draft of Explanation of HK Nationality Law for NPC (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Qiao said that a recent meeting of the chairman and
vice-chairmen of the NPC Standing Committee decided that the draft
explanation, based on a proposal from the Preparatory Committee of
the Hong Kong SAR on March 24 this year, should be submitted to
the current session for consideration.
</P>
<P>
The draft explanation states that Hong Kong Chinese residents
will be considered Chinese citizens whether they hold a foreign
passport or not.
</P>
<P>
All Chinese in Hong Kong, whether they possess British
Dependent Territories Citizen Passports, or British National
(Overseas) Passports, or not, are Chinese citizens, and the
British citizenship of any Chinese citizens in Hong Kong obtained
through the British Nationality Selection Scheme is not recognized
by the Nationality Law.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign passports held by Chinese in Hong Kong can be
used as travel documents for purposes of travel to other countries
and regions, according to the draft explanation.
</P>
<P>
Qiao pointed out that this flexible and pragmatic ruling is
intended to be convenient for Hong Kong citizens and will play a
positive role in maintaining Hong Kong's current status as a free
port and an international financial and trade center.
</P>
<P>
The draft explanation also states that Chinese citizens in the
Hong Kong SAR may apply to SAR departments in charge of
nationality applications if they intend to change their
nationality status.
</P>
<P>
It authorizes the Hong Kong SAR government to designate its
Immigration Department to deal with nationality applications
according to the Nationality Law and relevant regulations.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Expel Nine British Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia is going to expel nine British
diplomats who it said were spies working under the cover of the
British embassy in Moscow and who were declared "persona non
grata."
</P>
<P>
Alexander Zdanovich, spokesman of the Russian Federal Security
Service (FSB), told reporters here today that a message about the
planned ecpelling had been handed over to the British Ambassador
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The message contains "detailed information on the activities of
each of the mentioned intelligence officers and documentary proofs
about their contacts with the Russian citizens arrested for spying
for Britain," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
"The talk is about career spies, not about diplomats. All of
them have been completely exposed also by the evidence of the
agent -- a Russian citizen -- who was caught red-handed,"
Zdanovich went on to say.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the decision to expel "the spies working under
the diplomatic cover was taken on the basis of a thorough check of
the materials submitted by the counterintelligence."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said on Monday that Moscow had arrested a Russian
man who was passing political and military secrets to the
British. In interrogations, the man gave detailed evidence against
a number of members of the British embassy, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Zdanovich explained today that the Russian spy was arrested yet
in April, however it took time to thoroughly check his evidence
and "the diplomatic demarche was made only now after the data
submitted by the FSB was examined by the Russian leadership."
</P>
<P>
"Expelled are only those who are in any way connected with the
case of the arrested spy who handed over political and
military-strategic information," the spokesman said, refusing to
say whether or not there were other diplomats working as spies
under the cover of the British embassy.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Pours New Investment Into Oil Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's crude oil reserve may
swell by about 25 percent of its current stock under a strategic
investment scheme on which the government will spend 2.8 billion
US dollars between now and 1998.
</P>
<P>
The sum is part of the five billion US dollar budget creaed by
the Nigerian government for investing in the oil sector between
1994 and 1998, according to a report releasd by the state-run
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) today.
</P>
<P>
Major targets of the scheme, intended to enhance the activities
and operational efficiency of the petroleum sector, include:
</P>
<P>
-- Shoring up the crude oil reserve to 25 billion barrels
from its current level of 20 billion barrels, and nigeria's
production capacity to 2.5 million barrels per day (mbpd) from
2.0 MBPD.
</P>
<P>
-- Eliminating or drastically whittling unscheduled shutdowns of
refineries.
</P>
<P>
-- Ensuring reliability and efficiency in domestic supply of
petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
-- Reviewing and divestig NNPC equity holdings in enterprises
considered unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
-- Attracting as well as promoting increased privatesector
participation in the developmen of gas utilisation project.
</P>
<P>
The report said the proposed 25 percent increase in the
crude oil reserve is to be achieved through fostering agreessive
exploration by NNPC's joint venture partners, production sharing
contractors and the corporation's subsidiary, the Nigerian
Petroleum Development Company (NPDC).
</P>
<P>
Petroleum production provides Nigeria huge revenue which
accounted for over 80 percent of the foreign currency earnings
over the years.
</P>
<P>
And the national economy of the country, which is the largest
petropetroleum producer in Africa, unevenly depends on
revenue from the crude oil.
</P>
<P>
However, the local participation in the oil sector has been
unacceptably low for the last three decades as most of the oil
producing factories are controlled by foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Head of State General Abacha said earlier this week
that the government will initiate a major campaign to enhance
local participation in the oil sector so as to make its own
national oil industry independent at an early date.
</P>
<P>
And the scheme announced today is part of the initiative.

<HEADLINE> Five Draft Laws Under Legislative Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Five draft laws on statistics, water
pollution controls, lawyers, application of scientific
achievements, and vocational education have been submitted to the
19th session of National People's Congress Standing Committee,
which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by an NPC law committee official at
today's session, the five drafts are basically feasible. It was
proposed that they be put to vote at the end of this session,
after being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
The latest draft amendments to the statistics law included
additions on curbing false statistics and ensuring the quality of
statistics.
</P>
<P>
The new version prohibits officials from forcing statisticians
to distort or falsify numbers to curry favor with higher officials.
</P>
<P>
Statisticians are to use periodic surveys or random samples
instead of mainly relying on reports from government bodies, the
latest draft said.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendments to the law on water pollution controls
increase means of controlling water pollution in an entire river
valley instead of by using separate rulings by different
administrative regions.
</P>
<P>
In response to suggestions of members of the NPC Standing
Committee, the lastest draft of the law on lawyers added articles
on stricter requirements on qualifications, and on protecting the
rights of lawyers.
</P>
<P>
The draft law on application of scientific results provided
more specific regulations on illegal activities, such as stealing
scientific discoveries or fraud.
</P>
<P>
The latest version of the vocational education law says that
the state should develop a new system requiring laborers to have
necessary training before taking on a new job.
</P>
<P>
Three other draft laws, the draft amendments to the archives
law, the draft law on national defense, and the draft law on
firearms control, are to be handed over to the legislature on May
11.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, presided over
today's meeting.
</P>
<P>

days.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Brand-name products are playing an
increasingly important role in the industrial development in Jilin
Province, northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Seventy brand-name products, which were verified by the
provincial government at the beginning of last year, contributed
16.7 percent of Jilin's total industrial value, 38.4 percent of
its pre-tax profits, and 23.3 percent of its export earnings in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The province issued a series of preferential policies to
support the development of brand-name products. Changchun, Jilin's
capital, set aside ten million yuan last year as special aid to
develop its famous products.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to this, the profits of the province's brand-name
products increased by 10.6 percent last year over the previous
year, and 29 of them achieved all-round rise in output value and
pre-tax profits.
</P>
<P>
In its efforts for brand name products, The Changchun
Motorcycle Group poured more than 90 million yuan into technical
renovation, bringing its annual output to 220,000, becoming one of
the country's top eight motorcycle enterprises.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-African friendship boasts a
long history and it has ushered in a new era since the founding of
the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
As early as in the 1950s, representatives from African nations
and organizations visited China and made contacts with the Chinese
side on international occasions.
</P>
<P>
In April 1955, Zhou Enlai, the then premier of the Chinese
State Council, attended the Bandung conference in Indonesia, where
for the first time, he met with state leaders from Egypt,
Ethiopia, Ghana, Liberia, the Sudan and Libya. Afterwards, the
relationship between China and African nations enjoyed great
development.
</P>
<P>
On May 30, 1956, Egypt became the first African nation to
establish full diplomatic relations with China. So far a total of
44 African nations have established and maintained diplomatic
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
China and African countries have sympathy with and supported
one another in their common struggle against imperialism and
colonialism as well as in seeking peace and development.
</P>
<P>
China has always taken the lead in recognizing the newly
independent African countries, and timely providing them with
moral and material support.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, late Chinese leader Mao Zedong more than once
told visiting African leaders that China and African countries all
belonged to the Third World and that China would always be opposed
to hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
African countries in general offered powerful support to China
in its efforts to restore its legitimate seat in the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
In short, China and African countries have always supported and
cooperate with one another in the international arena, and joined
hands in making unremitting efforts to create fair and rational
new international political and economic orders.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people have always attached great
importance to the development of friendly cooperation with African
countries.
</P>
<P>
The frequent exchange of visits between leaders of China and
African countries has also increasingly strengthened Sino-African
friendship.
</P>
<P>
Former Guinean President Ahmed Sekou Toure, who visited China
in September 1960, became the first African head of state to step
on the Chinese soil. Since then, more than 150 heads of state or
government from African countries have paid separate visits to
China.
</P>
<P>
In order to develop friendly relations and promote mutual
understanding with African countries, Chinese leaders have also
visited the African continent one after another.
</P>
<P>
From December 1963 to February 1964, the then Premier Zhou
Enlai visited 10 African nations and was warmly welcomed by
governments and peoples of those countries. During his visit in
Africa, Zhou brought forth five principles in developing relations
between China and African states, and between China and Arab
nations as well as eight principles governing China's external
technical assistance. From March to June 1965, Zhou paid two
visits to Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, since 1957, more than 30 senior
Chinese government leaders paid goodwill visits to 40 African
states.
</P>
<P>
China also carried out a wide range of economic and cultural
cooperation with African nations. Since the 1970s, Sino-African
joint construction and production projects have reached 5,400,
with a value of over 7 billion U.S. dollars, among which are the
Tanzania-Zambia railway and the Cairo International Conference
Center.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the bilateral trade between China and Africa hit 3.9
billion dollars, a 56 percent rise from 1993.
</P>
<P>
China has sent about 13,000 medical workers to some 40 African
nations and given medical help to more than 200 million people,
since the first medical team was sent to Algeria in 1963. In the
1980s when the African people were suffering from serious drought,
China called for mass donations from its people to help them.
</P>
<P>
For decades, China and African countries have been keeping
peaceful and friendly relations based on equality, which sets the
example of sincerity, equality, friendship and cooperation among
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
In their longstanding common struggle, China and African
countries have established and developed fraternity, which has
stood the test of time and drastic changes of the international
situation.
</P>
<P>
Sino-African friendship has a distant source and is like a long
stream -- as long as the Yangtze River and the Nile.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Sudanese Foreign
Minister Ali Osman Mohamed Taha said here today that both Sudan
and Malaysia wished to further enhance their bilateral economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after meeting with Malaysian
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the Sudanese minister said
that both sides agreed to promote bilateral cooperation especially
in the economic field.
</P>
<P>
Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, who arrived here Monday for a three-day
visit, said that there were good investment opportunities in Sudan
in the fields of textile industry, sugar and food production,
agriculture, tourism, mineral extraction and petroleum industry.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has shown a "desire to benefit from Malaysia's experience
in those areas especially in oil production as Sudan has a
reasonable large oil reserve," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the political situation in Sudan was
"quite conducive" for investment, as he knew this was important to
attract businessmen to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the visiting Sudanese minister also had a talk
with his Malaysian counterpart Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. During
their meeting, the two ministers discussed the Organization of
Islamic Conference (OIC), of which the two countries are members.
</P>
<P>
"We are of the view that OIC members should resolve their
internal problems to enable them to focus on development in their
respective countries," Ali Osman Mohamed Taha said.

<HEADLINE> NAM Thanked For Supporting U.N. Bodies To Remain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Minister for Foreign Affairs
and International Co-operation Kalonzo Musyoka has thanked the
Non-aligned countries for supporting Nairobi to remain as one of
the U.N. centers.
</P>
<P>
Kalonzo Musyoka said the presence of the two U.N. bodies, the
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and Habitat in
Nairobi is important as it makes the capital to be at par with
the other headquarters of U.N., Geneva and New York.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks when he hosted the visiting
chairman of the movement Dr Rodrigo Garcia who paid him a
courtesy call here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He also thanked Dr Rodrigo Garcia for his support during his
tenure as the chairman of the movement.
</P>
<P>
During the last three years, some western countries have been
pressing the U.N. to move UNEP and Habitat out of Kenya under the
pretext of Nairobi's insecurity.
</P>
<P>
Dr Garcia who is also the Colombia Foreign Minister arrived in
Kenya on Saturday for consultations with Kenyan ministers on how
they can work out an open process of closer participation within
the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).
</P>
<P>
He said that despite there being only one superpower, the
movement is still active in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the claims that NAM is irrelevant and said it is
now concerned with the development of its member countries most
of which are in the Third World.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Court Rejects Ershad's Appeal for Bail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The High Court of Bangladesh Monday
rejected the bail prayer of former president Hossain Mohammad
Ershad in the corruption case known as "Janata Tower case" in
which he was sentenced to seven years imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Ershad's counsel argued that the former president has been in
jail custody since December 12, 1990 and he, at 67, is entitled to
be released on bail.
</P>
<P>
The high court division bench rejected the appeal and said, "We
do not find any logic as to why the appellant should be granted
bail after allowing his prayer for adjournment of hearing of this
appeal which has already been heard in part."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ershad had filed an application for quashing the
charges of accumulating wealth beyond known source of income
brought in connection with the funding of the construction of
Janata Tower in Dhaka before a high court division bench but the
application was rejected on September 23, 1992.
</P>
<P>
Ershad, who seized power early in the 1980s, was toppled down
in the 1990 democratic movement but is still chairman of the major
opposition Jatiya (national) Party.

KUALA LUMPUR, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Defense Minister Syed
Hamid Albar said today that his ministry would never slow down its
modernization program and would continue to buy military hardware
from foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the seventh five-year development plan announced by Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad at parliament Monday, the government is
to allocate a budget of 7.2 billion Malaysian Ringgit (about 2.88
billion US dollars) for the Ministry of Defense.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press gathering in Kuala Terengganu today, Syed
Hamid said that his ministry would spend a major portion to buy
military equipment, Malaysia's news agency Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
He said the military purchases included frigates from Britain,
Corvettes from Italy, CN235 helicopters from Indonesia, F-18 jet
fighters from the United States and MiG-29s from Russia.
</P>
<P>
He said that his ministry could apply for a special or
supplementary allocation during the mid-term review of the 7th
five-year plan for its other programs, adding the modernization
and development of the armed forces would not stop.
</P>
<P>
Bernama also quoted the minister as saying that the Defense
Ministry had identified several strategic interests for
modernization of the armed forces to make them a credible force.
</P>
<P>
However, he said: "It is up to the government to determine the
priority, in the meantime we use what is available."

<HEADLINE> Dhaka's Privatization Hampered by Liberal Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's privatization program
floundered last year due to buyers' apathy, triggered primarily
by trade liberalization at home, according to an assessment by the
Privatization Board.
</P>
<P>
During the period, bidders of two big public enterprises have
withdrawn halfway through negotiations while buyers of the other
two enterprises stopped payment even risking their bid money.
</P>
<P>
Series of tenders and re-tenders for selling public sector jute
mills also received poor response.
</P>
<P>
The Privatization Board attributed the buyers' indifference to
trade liberalization which left most of the domestic
market-oriented industries vulnerable to highly competitive
international production.
</P>
<P>
The board observed that most of the state-owned enterprises,
listed for privatization, were domestic market-oriented and money
losers with dilapidated machinery, thus keeping potential buyers
suspicious.
</P>
<P>
The board, which itself drew severe criticism for failing to go
ahead with the program, is considering to terminate its contracts
with the existing consultants and replace them with "suitable"
ones.

<HEADLINE> Upcountry Fares Rises In Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMAPLA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Fares from Kampala to upcountry towns
have gone up two-fold as polling day approaches in Uganda, the
local daily the New Vision reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said travellers on the western route now pay double the
usual fare of 5,000 Uganda Shillings (about five US Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Uganda Bus Operators Association Administrative Officer John
Kasozi was quoted as saying that the increase has been because of
many people going upcountry with few for the return journey.
</P>
<P>
Kasozi said the additional fare would cover fuel and other
expenses.
</P>
<P>
A coach which operates on the Kampala-Kigali route via
Kagitumba also increased the fares from 15,000 shillings to 20,000
shillings.
</P>
<P>
It said that more and more Ugandans are now leaving here for
the villages to escape the May 9 presidential polls which may
lead to violence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile fearful of violence and rocketing commodity prices over
the polling period Ugandans have been stocking up on the essentials.

<HEADLINE> Abacha Urges Local Participation Of Nigeria's Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General Sani
Abacha on Monday urged local participation of the oil sector in
the largest petroleum producing country in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Abacha noted that little technology has been acquired in the
last three decades because the largest shares of the industry
have been owned by foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
The non-participation of Nigerian in their own industry has
''stopped them from gaining accruable from the oil sector''
which provides over 80 percent of the country's foreign currency
revenue.
</P>
<P>
''Oil is the mainstay of our nation's economy. the level of
current internal participation in the production of equipment
or services in the oil industry is unacceptably low, he said.
</P>
<P>
''This is an unfavorable situation which has greatly reduced
the benefits we would have driven from this sector,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government collected over 150 million u.s.
dollars of oil revenue in 1995. enditem

<HEADLINE> Largest Aluminum Alloy Joint Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Construction work on a Sino-Israeli
joint venture to produce aluminum alloy sheet recently started in
the capital city of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest joint venture ever built by the China
National Nonferrous Metals Industry Corporation, according to its
general manager, Wu Jianchang.
</P>
<P>
The 3.5-billion-yuan investment will come from both sides, and
cover an up-to-date production line that handles melting,
hot-rolling, cold-rolling and finish grinding. Major technology

<P>
The plant has a designed annual production capacity of 120,000
tons of aluminium alloy sheet and is covered by a 30-year
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Economists say the venture is significant in promoting
Sino-Israeli economic cooperation, improving China's aluminum
processing, and cutting its aluminum imports.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China imported 100,000 tons of aluminum
sheet last year to satisfy its rapidly growing building, packing
and automobile industries.

<HEADLINE> China Seeking Overseas Cooperation in Combatting Water Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China is looking for international
cooperation in its attempts to solve the serious pollution problem
in the Huai River, one of the country's seven major river systems,
according to a top Chinese environmental official.
</P>
<P>
At a recent symposium in Bengbu, an industrial city in east
China's Anhui Province, Xie Zhenhua, director of the China State
Environmental Protection Bureau, said that foreign funds and
technology are vital to the success of the battle against water
pollution in the river.
</P>
<P>
The Huai River flows across Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong
provinces in central and east China, covering one-eighth of the
country's total of arable land in its drainage area.
</P>
<P>
"The problem of water pollution in the Huai River drainage area
has become more and more serious over the past decade," Xie said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the 191 branches of the river have turned black
or developed a stench and are no longer potable or
usable. Departments monitoring pollution say that pollution levels
are as much as several hundred times the acceptable level.
</P>
<P>
Serious pollution has led to drinking water shortage for the
citizens of Bengbu, who rely heavily upon the Huai River, and
increases in the incidence of cancer and intestinal and stomach
ailments, as well as decreases in industrial and agricultural
output, Xie added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has developed a series of measures to
stop pollution in the river, he said, adding that in 1995 the
amount of COD discharged into the Huai River was decreased by
250,000 tons, 16 percent of the total in the drainage area, and a
150-million-yuan sewage treatment plant began operation in Xuzhou,
in northern Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that 1,089 wells were dug last year with
state or local funds to provide drinking water for some 700,000
people, and local governments are making efforts to close down all
small paper mills.
</P>
<P>
However, he conceded that the problem of pollution is still far
from being solved and remains quite serious in spite of all these
efforts.
</P>
<P>
"The key issue is money," he said, noting that complete removal
of the Huai River's pollution problem is expected to cost 27.5
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
He also admitted that the country still lacks effective
technology for fighting water pollution, especially in treating
waste water from paper manufacturers. "We hope that advanced
technology from other countries can be used, especially from
developed countries that have gone through the age of pollution
and are experienced in environmental protection," he said.
</P>
<P>
The symposium focused on technology for water pollution control
in the Huai River drainage area, and was sponsored by the China
Commerce Committee of the US's State of Maryland and attended by
government officials and entrepreneurs from China and the US.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Xie voiced his appreciation to the government of
Maryland for the assistance it offered in pollution control, and
expressed his wish for long-term cooperation between the two
sides.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldiers Clash With Palestinians In Kalkilya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli soldiers Monday fired
tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse some 600 Palestinians who
tried to halt bulldozers from clearing land for a fence around
Kalkilya.
</P>
<P>
At least a dozen people were wounded during the clashes on the
outskirts of the West Bank town, and two of them were shot by live
bullets, according to hospital officials.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army immediately declared the Kalkilya region a
closed military zone following the incidents, and has barred
Israelis from entering into the area.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians were protesting the confiscation of the land
where a 15-kilometer fence is to be erected separating Kalkilya
and other villages from Israel.
</P>
<P>
Kalkilya Mayor Marout Zahran said the fence is being built on
1,200 dunams (about 1126 hectares) of Palestinian land and came as
close as 20 meters to some homes of Palestinian residents.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army had completed its redeployment in Kalkilya,
along with other West Bank towns of Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah,
Bethlehem Tulkarm, by the end of last year, in accordance with
the Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Civilian and security controls over those major Palestinian
towns had been handed over to the Palestinian National
Authority, as part of the Oslo accords to expand Palestinian
autonomy to the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
However, in the wake of a series of suicide bombing
attacks in February and March inside Israel, which killed at
least 60 people and wounded over 150 others, Israel decided
to built fences to separate Palestinian areas and Israeli
villages in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinians have been holding protests against the
building of such fences, claiming that large parts of their
lands have been confiscated for the erecting of the fences.

<HEADLINE> China to Carry out National Education Campaign on Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- According to a draft resolution
submitted today by China's State Council, a drive to educate the
public about the law, focusing mainly on officials, law
enforcement personnel, business managers, and young people, is
expected to start this year.
</P>
<P>
Two such programs have been held over the past 10 years, to
provide elementary knowledge of the law for people from different
walks of life, related to their work and about the constitution
and other major laws.
</P>
<P>
"The drive is intended to increase public awareness of the law
and the proficiency of officials and law-enforcement personnel,
and provide a suitable legal framework for the country's reform,
development and stability," said Xiao Yan, Chinese minister of
justice, in explaining the draft resolution for the National
People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, whose session began
today.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution particularly states that officials,
especially high-ranking ones, should take the lead in learning
about the law in order to formulate policies in accordance with
the law and bring state affairs in line with the law.
</P>
<P>
Their level of awareness of the law is closely related to
whether or not the nation's goal of "administering state affairs
in accordance with the law and building a socialist legal system
for the country," as stated in the long-term development plan
adopted in March this year, can be realized, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The fact that laws are not observed or are loosely enforced,
and that violations of the law are not investigated or punished
still exists to a certain degree and is even rather serious in
some places, Xiao told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, educating the law enforcement officials is "of
immediate importance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Legal Knowledge is also important for business people to
conduct their business activities, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The young are regarded as a vital force in building the country
in the coming century, and former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping has
said that learning about legal knowledge should start from
childhoo, Xiao said, adding that with that in mind, the draft
resolution listed specific requirements for legal education from
primary school to college level.

SHANGHAI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Over 300 foreign enterprises from a
dozen countries, including Britain, the U.S., Italy, Germany,
Japan, and Australia are displaying new building materials and the
latest technology at Shanghai's International Building Materials
Exhibition.
</P>
<P>
According to an official source, China's fast-growing
construction industry has pushed the building materials sector
which hit 260 billion yuan in output value in 1995, with an annual
increase of 25 percent, creating chances for foreign enterprises
to expand their share of the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
The source said that China built a total of 530 million sq m of
residential housing and three billion sq m of rural residential
housing over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), the country
will build 230 towns and 5,000 market towns, some 1.2 billion sq m
of urban housing and three billion sq m of rural housing, and 2.9
billion sq m of rebuilding of residences.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said today that it
would be happy to offer to share its experience in improving the
quality of life of rural women and their families with other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here today, Siti Hasmah Mohd
Ali, wife of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, said that "Before
1965, women in our country' rural areas were faced with four evils
-- apathy, poverty, poor health and illiteracy, but we have
successfully overcome them."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's experience could be adopted by other countries, Siti
Hasmah said, adding that she would make the offer at the second
international steering committee meeting on rural women to be held
in Amman, Jordan from May 14 to 16.
</P>
<P>
She will lead a seven-member delegation, including Minister of
National Unity and Social Development Paduka Zaleha Ismail, to
attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that 16 wives of heads of government including
Angola, Belgium, Egypt and Turkey, are expected to attend the
meeting, which will be officially opened by the King of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, three group discussions will be held to
discuss the enhancement of the quality of life of rural women and
their families, food security and micro-credit for rural women.
</P>
<P>
Siti Hasmah said she hoped that this meeting would increase
efforts at the international level to bring rural women into the
mainstream of economic, health and educational development.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Raises Minimum Wages for Workers in Foreign Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The English-language "Vietnam News" Monday quoted Tran Dinh
Hoan, Minister of Labour, War Invalids and Social Affairs
(MOLISA), as saying that the decision will become effective as of
july 1.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, the minimum wages in
foreign-invested enterprises in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City will be
fixed at 45 U.S. dollars a month, while those in the nine other
cities of Haiphong, Halong, Vinh, Hue, Danang , Nha Trang, Bien
Hoa, Vung Dau and Can Tho at 40 dollars, and 35 dollars in other
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The current minimum wages and salaries at foreign-invested
enterprises have been fixed at 35 dollars a month in Hanoi and Ho
Chi Minh City, and 30 dollars in other parts since May 5, 1992.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Hoan explained that the wage of the Vietnamese workers
earned from foreign-invested enterprises has devalued by 30
percent, as commodity prices in the country have gone up since
1992 whereas the rate of exchange of the Vietnamese currency
against the U.S. dollar has declined.

<HEADLINE> New Computer Translation Software on Sale in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Translators in Kuwait now can
use a newly developed computer translation software to do their
work quickly as the translation aid device is put on sale in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The program, dubbed "The Arab Translator," can translate
English into Arabic. It is a huge dictionary including around 2
million Arab and English words, of which 250,000 are verbs, each
with 200 versions compiled from different dictionaries, the Arab
program creator Adnan Idan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that it can help the translator and saves his time and
efforts.
</P>
<P>
The English text can be entered by the keyboard, the scanner,
the modem or other means and both the English and Arabic texts
then appear on the screen to enable the translator to revise the
translation, Idan said.
</P>
<P>
The translation of a 500-page book would take only 15 to 150
minutes depending on the power of the computer, he said.
</P>
<P>
A translator who tested on the program said its precision can
go up to 80 percent in scientific and other specialized
translations while it is unable to give accurate translation in
other fields.
</P>
<P>
The program, described here as a revolution in translation,
took 10 years of efforts to develop.
</P>
<P>
Now the program is available in three Arab countries including
Kuwait, Egypt and Oman.
</P>
<P>
In Kuwait, it is expected that government institutions,
universities and Internet subscribers would like to buy the
program.
</P>
<P>
However, the program still has some negative aspects. It is
unable to understand the "esoteric" meaning of the words and long
years of efforts are still needed to improve it, the designer said.
</P>
<P>
It could help the translator but could not replace him,
he said.

<P>
NANCHANG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China is encouraging teachers
nationwide to compile new science textbooks for institutes of
higher learning to improve their quality.
</P>
<P>
The State Education Commission (SEC) this year introduced a
competitive system for textbook compilation to encourage more
teachers to become involved in the work.
</P>
<P>
China formerly assigned some elderly professors the task of
compiling books in designated areas. This was not useful for
training young teachers and the compilers chosen often could not
finish the work on time because of heavy teaching loads and their
scientific research,
</P>
<P>
According to the new methods, the new materials must be
submitted to the SEC for approval and textbook quality should be
up to standards. The authors who are chosen should sign contracts
with the higher education publishing houses under SEC.

<P>
SHANGHAI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Whatever you want, at your
fingertips, just a phone call away! Unthinkable? Well, not any
longer, not for the people of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In some sections of Shanghai, China's biggest metropolis, what
used to be a dream is now a reality, thanks to the new
Service-to-the-Doorstep business.
</P>
<P>
The service delivers everything right to customers'
residences. It is possible to get everything from simple daily
necessities like salt or sugar to complete meals, as well as
theater tickets, without leaving the living-room.
</P>
<P>
The first company to do this business was in direct sales of
agricultural products. Then, in January of this year, it started
getting involved in the catering business, delivering meals of
nicely-prepared dishes to homes of people whose orders it took
over the phone, ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
And now, with just a phone call, you can entertain your honored
guests at home, without lifting a finger, providing dishes sent to
you at a price lower than what you would pay in your favorite
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
Or, you may receive flowers at your door - a surprise greeting
from a close friend or relatives who have availed themselves of
the same service.
</P>
<P>
Other companies followed suit. A dozen companies dealing in
drinking water now employ people exclusively to deliver bottled
water to people's homes - a rather new development in China.
</P>
<P>
As one customer remarked, Service-to-the-Doorstep, as a result
of market competition, not only provides greater convenience for
customers, but is even providing some new opportunities for
employment.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Going to Eight-Digit Telephone Numbers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The telecommunications authority in
the Chinese capital has announced that telephone numbers in the
city will add another digit, starting tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Eight digits are currently used in Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong, and
Shanghai and are expected to enlarge Beijing's telephone exchange
capacity to 40 million, far more than potential demand for phones
in this city of 11 million people, before the year 2000, the
experts said.
</P>
<P>
"That's a remarkable change in Beijing's telecommunications
development history," Ni Yilin, director of the Beijing
Telecommunication Bureau, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's telecommunication sector grew only after China
adopted its reform and opening-up policies in the late 1970s,
though phone service had existed in the city since 1901, Ni noted.
</P>
<P>
Rapid economic growth spurred the development, he said,
explaining that the growth of the telecommunications sector was,
on average, ten percentage points higher than the local economy's
in the past six years.
</P>
<P>
Beijing had 4.09 million phones and 1.5 million subscribers by
the end of last year, compared with 26,000 and 17,000 subscribers
in 1949, and 300,000 phones and 86,000 subscribers in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The phone coverage rate reached 24 percent in the Beijing area
and 35.5 percent in urban districts in 1995. There was less than
one telephone for every 100 residents in 1949.
</P>
<P>
In China's urban areas, there are now an average of 13 phones
for every 100 families.
</P>
<P>
Ni also noted that the city took less than two years to go from
seven- to eight-digit phone numbers. The city used five-digit
numbers for 21 years and six digits for 33 years.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to install four million new phones by the year
2000, so that each Beijing family can have a phone by then.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Drops in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in the first four
months of the year dropped by more than half to a total of 1.24
billion U.S. dollars, an official report said today.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Investment Review which came out today quoted a
source of the Ministry of Planning and Investment as saying
that the investment total at the end of April was down 52 percent
over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment had amounted to 2.579 billion dollars in the
January-April period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
But the official did not give any reason for the decrease.
</P>
<P>
Year-on-year investment declined by 28 percent in Ho Chi Minh
city, the biggest city in Vietnam, and the drop was attributed to
a change in regulations concerning land lease procedures in the
metropolis.
</P>
<P>
A senior ministry official said that short-term comparison does
not attest to a general slowdown in foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the magazine as saying that foreign investment
increased by 17 percent in the first quarter as compared with the
corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The official predicted that as more projects are likely to get
investment licenses later on, the influx of foreign investment may
amount "to an astonishing level within the next few weeks."
</P>
<P>
Twenty projects are awaiting approval from the ministry and may
bring 80 million dollars in new investment into Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
Industrial projects are being given priority this year as 64 of
the 87 licensed projects so far are industrial in nature which
have drawn as much as 1.028 billion dollars or 83 percent of the
foreign investment total.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Gov't Ready to Talk with Opposition: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher Bahadur
Deuba has said that his coalition government was ready to hold
talks with the main opposition on its 30-point demand presented
three months ago.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with leaders of various class groups supporting
the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (UML) Monday, Deuba
said his government was always committed to holding discussions on
the UML demands, accusing the opposition party of not being
serious to solve problems through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the pro-UML groups, including All Nepal Women's
Association, All Nepal Peasants Association, Nepal Trade Union
Federation and All Nepal National Free Students Union, expressed
their support to the UML demands and urged the government to
fulfill them.
</P>
<P>
If the government fails to do so, they would launch a
nationwide anti-government movement, the leaders told the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The 30-point demand, presented to the government in a
memorandum by UML President Man Mohan Adhikari in February, asked
for, among others, controlling the soaring market prices,
restoring the public welfare programs introduced by the previous
UML government and solving social unrest in some remote areas
politically.
</P>
<P>
The UML memorandum said the party would launch a peaceful
people's movement against the government if the government fails
to fulfill these demands within a month.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition challenged the government through a
no-confidence motion in the lower house three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
The UML-sponsored no-confidence motion was defeated in the
205-seat house by 106 votes to 90.
</P>
<P>
UML leaders have recently vowed on various occasions to topple
the present coalition government in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The party last month announced to start a national awareness
movement at villages throughout the country, mainly pinpointing
the government's recent measures to raise prices of fertilizers,
public transport fares and some daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
It is expected the coalition government led by the Nepali
Congress Party would face another round of opposition challenge in
the forthcoming house session before July.

<HEADLINE> Sweatshop Owner Sentenced for Slaving Workers in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A woman who forced scores of Thai
workers to live and work as slaves in southern California was
sentenced Monday to seven years in prison and pay more than 4.5
million U.S. dollars to the enslaved workers.
</P>
<P>
The woman, Suni "Auntie" Manasurangkun, and her family ran a
garment shop from 1989 to 1995 with a captive work force of some
70 impoverished women recruited in Thailand. The workers were
forced to work 19 hours a day and were guarded by the master's men
to prevent them from escaping, the United Press International
reported.
</P>
<P>
The shop owners surrounded the El Monte compound, about 15
miles east of Los Angeles, with razor wire and a spiked fence,
while barricading the doors and windows of the workers' quarters.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Audrey Collins, who imposed the sentence on
the woman, also sentenced the woman's son, Wirachai, and Sunthon
Rawungchaisong, who was hired to guard the workers in the
compound, to six years' imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Two of Manasurangkun's other sons had earlier been sentenced to
six years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Another person, Rampha Satthaprasit, who started as a worker
but later turned to be an overseer, was sentenced to four years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney Nora Manella said the prison sentences and
restitution were among the highest sentences ever imposed in a
modern slavery case.

<HEADLINE> Wang Junxia Runs Year's Best at 10,000m Heat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- World record holder Wang Junxia ran
an incredible fast race in the women's 10,000 meters heats to
register the year's best time at the Chinese Olympic track and
field trials here Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The slim Chinese runner pulled away early to clock 31 minutes
and 1.76 seconds, much better than both the standing year's best
of 31:04.99 held by Portugal's Fernanda Ribeiro and the winning
time at the Gothenburg world championships last year.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Wang, who set the world record of 29.31.78 in
Beijing in 1993, was ranked fifth in the world last year at
31.23.24. She didn't compete in the Gothenburg Worlds.
</P>
<P>
After chalking up the year's fastest time in the 5,000 meters
Sunday, the in-form Wang ran an unbelievable fast pace in
Tuesday's heats, passing the 8,000 meters in 25.01.11 and running
the final lap in 64.77 seconds.
</P>
<P>
"My goal is to beat last year's world best," said the 1993
world champion.
</P>
<P>
"I believe I can do better in tomorrow's final," she added
before going to have her drug test.
</P>
<P>
Her coach Mao Dezhen said: "We asked Wang to have a fast heat
and we have a plan for the final."
</P>
<P>
The coach revealed that Wang ran each lap within 73 seconds in
the heats and that was exactly their pre-race plan.
</P>
<P>
Wang seemed not happy with her time. "I didn't read right at
the timeboard at the 13th lap, so I slowed a bit."
</P>

After watching Wang's race, no one doubts that the
1.62-meter-tall Chinese will post a strong threat to her opponents
at the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Bo, world junior 5,000 meters record holder who failed to
qualify for the final last Sunday, pulled out of Tuesday's race
for unknown reason.
</P>
<P>
But Jiang's hope of making the team still remains because the
Chinese Athletics Association said the results at the current meet
are not very important.
</P>
<P>
"We want the best athletes to go to the Olympics," said Han
Yongnian, the Chinese national team leader. "If Jiang can improve
in next two months, the door still opens for her."

<HEADLINE> Spanish Party Calls for Anti-U.S. Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The left-wing Coalicion Izquierde
Unida (IU), the third largest party in Spain, today called for a
parliamentary resolution to oppose a U.S. bill which tightens the
economic embargo against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
A woman IU deputy said the Helms-Burton Bill, which provides
for sanctions against countries trading with Cuba, violates
international law and the sovereignty of other countries.
</P>
<P>
The bill was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by
President Bill Clinton after Cuba in February shot down two light
aircraft piloted by Cuban exiles based in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish deputy said the bill showed that the U.S. made laws
in its own interest.
</P>
<P>
She urged the Spanish government and parliament to resist
U.S. actions which violate Spanish sovereignty and its right to
trade with other countries.
</P>
<P>
The IU also proposed that Spain's new Conservative government
maintain cooperation with Cuba and ask the European Union to
increase aid to the island-state.
</P>
<P>
Spain, Mexico and Canada are Cuba's closest trading partners.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Calls for Peace in the Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov
said mutual recognition among former Yugoslav republics is
a precondition for securing peace in the region, but ruled out the
formation of a federation among the countries.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German newspaper "Frankfurt
Allgemeine" which was published recently, Gligorov said Macedonia
is the only former Yugoslav republic to have established
diplomatic relations with all other former Yugoslav states.
</P>
<P>
He also said his government would not give up the name
Macedonia as the title of the new republic, although he didn't
oppose negotiations with Greece which has objected to the
country's use of the name Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Territory along the northern Greek border is also known as
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The dispute has choked trade and raised the threat of bloody
ethnic wars spreading throughout the southern Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Turning to ethnic issues, Gligorov said that except a few
separatists, the vast majority of ethnic people living in
Macedonia believe it is their motherland.
</P>
<P>
The intention of the ethnic Albanian community in the country
to establish an Albanian language in the north western area of the
country bordering Albania has exacerbated ethnic tensions in
Macedonia since late 1994.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics say ethnic Albanians, who account for 23
percent of Macedonia's total population, are the largest minority
in the country.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council Urges Liberian Factions to Cease Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council on
Monday called on the warring factions in Liberia to stop wanton
killing and atrocities against civilians and return the capital
Monrovia to normality.
</P>
<P>
A presidential statement read by Chinese Ambassador Qin Huasun
on behalf of the Security Council said that the escalating
violence among the factions puts the peace process at grave risk.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council calls upon the parties immediately to
cease fighting, to observe the cease-fire and to return Monrovia
to a safe haven under the protection of the Military Observer
Group of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOMOG),"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG is a 10,000-strong peacekeeping force sent to Liberia by
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in 1990 at
the height of the civil war.
</P>
<P>
The council expressed its support for the efforts of ECOWAS to
bring the conflict to an end.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance it attaches to the ECOWAS summit
meeting to be held in Accra, capital of Ghana, on May 8 1996, the
council urged the leaders of the Liberian factions to reaffirm by
concrete actions their commitment to the Abuja Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement, signed in August 1995, calls for
disarmament and elections over one year.
</P>
<P>
The council also reminded all states of their obligation to
comply with the embargo on deliveries of weapons and military
equipment to Liberia imposed under resolution 788 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Renewed fighting over control of Monrovia flared on April 6,
when fighters loyal to faction chief Charles Taylor attempted to
arrest Roosevelt Johnson, another faction leader.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are fighting around a training camp in Monrovia,
where Johnson's soldiers are holding out against Taylor's troops.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Make Offset Deal for F-16 Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's state-owned aircraft
manufacturer Pt. IPTN is eyeing an offset deal for the
government's purchase of nine F-16 fighters form the United
States, local press reports today quoted a senior official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
After an investment promotion meeting here on Monday, State
Minister of Research and Technology B. J. Habibie told local
reporters that the government is negotiating with the U.S.
government for such an deal.
</P>
<P>
The offset deal is a kind of trade arrangement under which the
buyer agrees to the purchase of goods on the condition that the
seller accepts a certain part of the payment in goods instead of
money.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto last month gave green light to the purchase
of the nine F-16 jet fighters, for which the two countries have
negotiated for a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
"According to a presidential decree, there must be an offset
for any import of high-tech products," said Habibie, who is also
Pt. IPTN president.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's air force chief of staff Sutria Tubagus said
recently that the air force has 11 F-16s, six of which are in the
air force's Blue Eagle aerial acrobatics team.
</P>
<P>
In addition to F-16s, the air force also plans to import 24
Hawk fighters from Britain.

<HEADLINE> Juppe Urges Family Policy Meeting to Reform Subsidy System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
today urged a national family policy meeting to discuss reforms to
the battered family subsidy system, in a bid to reduce the budget
deficit and narrow down the social rift.
</P>
<P>
Eleven cabinet ministers as well as dozens of heads of family
associations around the nation attended the meeting, planned by a
summit on social problems on December 21, 1995 in the wake of a
massive strike which paralyzed France.
</P>
<P>
Five working groups were set up to work on different aspects of
the family policy, including reforms of the subsidy system, and
they are expected to submit concrete proposals at the end of the
year to the next family meeting, Juppe told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Introduced soon after World War II, the subsidy system had in
decades played a positive role in encouraging child-birth and
promoting economic development and social stability.
</P>
<P>
But for the past 10 years and more during which sluggish growth
was registered, family subsidies, distributed in parallel with the
number of children of a family regardless of its income, were
blamed for a growing budget deficit and for social unfairness.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, for which the lastest figures were available, one out
of six French got subsidies, totaling 261 billion French francs
(some 50 billion U.S. dollars), nearly as much as the year's
budget deficit.

<HEADLINE> Canada Starts Delivering Census Forms to Households </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Thousands upon thousands
census-takers spread out across Canada today to deliver census
forms to over 11 million households and 280,000 farms of this vast
country.
</P>
<P>
May 14, 1996 is Census Day in Canada. All Canadians are asked
to "count themselves in" by completing and mailing in their census
form on that day.
</P>
<P>
Four in five households will receive a short census
questionaire, containing seven demographic questions, while one in
five will receive the long census form which has 55 questions.
</P>
<P>
Farmers will also receive a Census of Agriculture questionaire
which collects information on farm land use, crops, livestock,
paid agricultural labor and land management practices, said
Statistics Canada, the federal fact-gathering agency.
</P>
<P>
The census will "provide information needed by community
groups, businesses, and governments to develop plans for education
and training, new products and services, housing for seniors,
health care services, and many other programs that are important
to all of us," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The census happens every five years in Canada and this year's
census is estimated to cost the country 250 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The first releases from this census of population and
agriculture will be in the spring of 1997, it said.

<HEADLINE> FBI: Atlanta Rated Most Violent City in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- At a time when the opening of the
1996 summer Olympic Games is drawing, the host city, Atlant, was
rated as the most violent city in the United States by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) statistics.
</P>
<P>
The FBI figures revealed Sunday show that while crime
nationwide fell 2 percent in 1995, crime in Atlanta rose 4 percent
in the year. The figures make Atlanta's crime rate the highest
among U.S. cities of 250,000 or more people. It topped the
rankings in both violent and non-violent crime.
</P>
<P>
However, officials from the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic
Games (ACOG) said, "This is not representative of a lack of
preparation for the Olympic Games."
</P>
<P>
"If people who come here will follow instructions, I think
they'll be in the most secure place on Earth," said A.D. Frazier,
chief operating officer of the ACOG.
</P>
<P>
ACOG has mounted a massive security operation to protect the
Games, with more than 25,000 federal, state and local law
enforcement officers and military personnel. They will be assisted
by thousands of agents from the FBI, CIA and other secret services.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the worst, security forces held a series of
anti-terrorism exercises in the city last month, and law
enforcement officers uncovered a underground bomb factory in
central Georgia and arrested two men.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that ACOG security officials have travelled to
foreign countries to get advice on anti-terrorist tactics.

<HEADLINE> Less Loss in Coal Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
praised China's coal industry Monday for reducing its losses for
the third successive year.
</P>
<P>
And Wu expressed the hope that the industry is expected to
shake off its losses completely by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier wrote a letter to a national conference in
Beijing Monday, congratulating the industry on the decrease in its
losses for three consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Wu said that the Ministry of Coal Industry has
made fruitful achievements in the process of in reducing losses
and increasing profits in recent years, and that the industry
should strive to shake off losses completely by 2000.
</P>
<P>
For years China's coal industry has been operating under the
planned system, surviving by getting subsidies from the
government, which has led to ever mounting losses.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem ministry officials led coal workers to
work harder, and took measures to cut economic losses.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, losses of state-owned key coal mines in the whole
country totalled 3.26 billion yuan, down 43.3 percent from 1992;
In 1994, the loss was 1.97 billion yuan, down 36.6 percent; Last
year the loss was 1.03 billion yuan (about 124 million US
dollars), down 47.7 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 551,000 employeers were streamlined or
transferred to other trades by the state-owned key coal mines over
the past three years. After the measures efficiency in the mines
improved by a quarter.
</P>
<P>
In addition, coal workers' average salary increased nearly 900
yuan every year during 1993-95.
</P>
<P>
Last year, taxes handed over by key mines was 2.64 billion yuan
more than government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, minister Wang Senhao called on the whole
industry to focus attention on bailing the super-poor enterprises
out of difficulty.

<HEADLINE> New York Sees Drastic Decline in Overall Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- New York City has been listed by
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as one of the
U.S. cities that saw drastic declines in overall crime in 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary figures released Sunday by the FBI,
overall crime in New York City dropped by 14.5 percent, and the
city had one of the largest declines in homicides, to 1,170 in
1995 from 1,561 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Besides New York, Houston and Detroit also witnessed a drop in
the number of homicides. Murders in Houston dropped to 316 in 1995
from 375 in 1994, while in Detroit the number fell to 475 in 1995
from 541 of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The FBI figures also show that serious crimes dropped across
the nation in 1995 for the fourth consecutive year, led by an 8
percent decrease in homicides.
</P>
<P>
The declines are mainly attributed to more aggressive police
tactics, an increase in the number of criminals in prison and
stabilization of turf battle between drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
But experts warn that the new figures may mask a continued
rapid rise in violent crimes among young people that could soon
lead to an increase in crime rates because the number of teenagers
in the population is expected to grow 20 percent in the next
decade.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Investors in Hainan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A Taiwanese businessman who has long
been involved in real estate development has recently decided to
grow melons and other fruit and vegetables on his newly-purchased
piece of land in Hainan, China's southernmost island province.
</P>
<P>
He is somewhat slower than other Taiwan business people, who
began to shift a large part of their investment to rural areas one
or two years ago and have become managers of melon or vegetables
companies.
</P>
<P>
Real estate, restaurants, and entertainment are no longer the
island's investment hot spots. Statistics show that nearly 150
Taiwan-funded enterprises are now engaged in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
When Hainan Province was established in 1988, there was only
one Taiwan-funded enterprise involved in agriculture, but in
villages and on farmland there now, tanned faces of Taiwanese
business people can often be seen.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan business people have also paid increasingly close
attention to industry and high-tech fields in Hainan.
</P>
<P>
In the first two months of the year, the provincial government
approved 13 Taiwan-funded enterprises, four of which were in the
agricultural sector, six in industry and three in technical
service.

<TEXT>
<P>
THE HAGUE, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok, at a
meeting with visiting Chinese Minister of Water Resources Niu
Maosheng here today, offered China more assistance in the area of
water conservation.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands, which is experienced and successful in water
conservation, could help China to set up joint ventures to build
dredgers for clearing lakes and rivers, Kok said.
</P>
<P>
In response, Niu said that China and the Netherlands had a long
history of good cooperation in water conservation which, he said,
was expected to expand.
</P>
<P>
Niu held talks earlier with his Dutch counterpart Annemarie
Jorritsma on expanding bilateral cooperation in water conservation.
</P>
<P>
At a dinner party hosted by Jorritsma, the two sides signed a
contract for China to purchase six dredgers from the Netherlands
and a memorandum of understanding on Sino-Dutch cooperation in
conducting joint surveys of Dongting Lake in southern China.

KIEV, Ukraine, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine aims to become a full
member of the European Union (EU) and increase trade with the
15-nation bloc, the country's Foreign Minister Gennady
Udovenko said today.
</P>
<P>
But he called on the EU to give Ukraine preferential trade
treatment and said the EU should realize Ukraine is still in
transition from a planned to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko, speaking during the second meeting of the Ukraine-EU
Joint Committee, also called for the EU's support in its bid to
join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The joint committee was formed last year to strengthen
cooperation between the EU and Ukraine. The first joint meeting
was held last May in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said Ukraine attaches great importance to
cooperation with EU and described the trade between Ukraine and EU
as stable.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is now Ukraine's most important trading
partner. Total trade volume between the two reached 3.5 billion
U.S. dollars last year.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Wang Caiqing still does the
cooking and the sewing for her family, and can even climb up a
ladder to get on the roof with a basket in her hand - and she's 94.
</P>
<P>
When two Xinhua reporters offered to take a picture of the
sprightly woman, she said with a smile, "I don't want to have a
picture taken. At my age I'm not photogenic."
</P>
<P>
Wang is one of 12 people above the age of 80 in Aigaoping
Village in suburban Wu'an, in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The village in the Taihang Mountains has come to be known as a
"longevity village" because the villagers have an average life
expectancy of 80 years.
</P>
<P>
Wang Caiqing became the oldest person among 110 people in the
village after three people above the age of 100 died at the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
According to medical experts, a major reason for the villagers'
longevity is the unpolluted water from a mountain spring that they
drink.
</P>
<P>
Other reasons include the quiet environment, and the tea made
from a local plant, Lianqiao, that they drink, which is believed
to have various properties such as treating acute febrile
diseases, detoxification, and reducing swelling.

<HEADLINE> EU Inflation Holds Steady at 2.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's annual
inflation rate held steady at 2.7 percent in March but was down
from 3.2 percent the same month a year ago, the EU's statistics
agency said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the EU's inflation criteria set for nations hoping
to adopt the EU's common currency to be launched in 1999,
qualifiers must limit inflation to no more than 1.5 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
Most member nations met the inflation criteria. In March, the
three best performers -- Finland, Luxembourg, and Germany -- had
an average of 1.26 percent. Finland had the lowest at 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Failing to hit the target were Greece with 9.1 percent, Italy
with 4.5 percent and Spain with 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
EU nations are having far more problems meeting the single
currency criteria for low budget deficits and public debt. Only
Luxembourg meets all the targets.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Announce New Deregulation Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is to announce a new
economic deregulation package aimed at creating a strong and
efficient domestic industry, "Indonesia Observer" newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Minister of Trade and Industry Tunky
Ariwibowo as saying Monday that the deregulation measures are not
meant to compensate for the recent increase in production costs.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing the government wants more than to create an
atmosphere which is conducive to business, especially because we
will soon be entering an era of free trade," the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government plans to issue a deregulation package
by granting fiscal, monetary and administrative facilities to
labor-intensive industries.
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal sector, the government is to provide tax
incentives for value-added tax and in the monetary sector, lower
interest rates are in the offing. In the administrative domain,
the government will simplify export and import procedures.
</P>
<P>
Tunky explained that the main point of the upcoming
deregulation measures is to increase the efficiency of
labor-intensive, export-oriented industries, such as textile, shoe
and electronics industries.

NEW DELHI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Polling for the third phase of
India's general elections began at 7 a.m. local time today for 183
Lok Sabha (Lower House) and 154 state assembly seats amidst
unprecedented security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The polling is being held in the states of Maharashtra,
Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Orissa,
Bihar, Manipur, Tripura, Mizoram and Nagaland. Two of the six

There are nearly 5,000 candidates in the fray for the 183
parliamentary constituencies while more than 1,000 aspirants for
the 154 assembly seats in West Bengal.
</P>
<P>
An electorate of 210 million would be deciding the political
fortunes of the working president of All India Indira Congress,

Behari Vajpayee. The latter is the prime ministerial candidate of
the BJP, the largest opposition party in India.

To ensure a peaceful polling, 300,000 security personnel,
including elite para-military forces, have been deployed in these
states, especially in violence-prone areas of Bihar.

<HEADLINE> Consumers Get Compensation Over Poor Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Consumer groups around the country
recovered more than 52.5 million yuan (6.4 million US dollars) as
economic compensation for consumers in the first quarter of the
year, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the China Consumers Association, the national
consumer advocate, suggest that consumer associations and
committees in 29 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities
handled a total of 91,157 complaints, among which 1,730 were about
imported goods, in the first three months of this year and about
97 percent of the complaints have been settled.
</P>
<P>
The English newspaper quoted Wu Gaohan, an official with the
association, as saying that concerns about quality problems made
up a strong 70.7 percent of the total consumer grievances from
January to March, which was an increase of 6.7 percent over the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The official said consumer criticisms continued to focus on
such categories as small commodities for daily use, food,
household electrical appliances and machines, services, and
materials for farming and construction.
</P>
<P>
Wu pointed out that except for a small 3 percent decrease of
consumer complaints on food, increases of complaints were reported
on all other kinds of commodities, especially the service sector
including shops, hospitals and beauty salons, which saw a maximum
46 percent growth of complaints in the first quarter over the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that complaints about materials for agricultural
production, machinery for farming purposes and home-use electrical
appliances also experienced noticeable growth.
</P>
<P>
Public complaints about cheating activities are increasing as
more and more people come to know the law on the protection of
consumers' rights and interests, though they amounted to only 1.3
percent of the total complaints, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Wu said people are encouraged to report their complaints for
the sake of their own rights and interests and for the interests
of the State.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela's Iron Ore Exports Drop 32.4 Percent in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's exports of iron ore
contracted by 32.4 percent in 1995 than the year before due to
production problems and increase in domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The overseas sales of iron ore reached 719,000 tons in 1995 in
contrast to 1.65 million tons in 1994, according to a report
released today by Orinoco (Sidor), the state-owned steel company.
</P>
<P>
Orinoco attributed the drop in exports to rising domestic
demands for iron ore, which climbed 23 percent than the year
before.
</P>
<P>
A decrease in supply due to operational problems also
contributed to the shrinkage in foreign sales.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, 76 percent of the exports went to
countries in the Americas, particularly to Colombia and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Canada received 17.7 percent of the
exports while Europe and Asia got 6.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Organizers Say Atlanta Will be Safe for Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Atlanta Olympic Games Organizing
Committee said on Monday that the city will be safe for the games.
</P>
<P>
"This is not representative of a lack of preparation for the
Olympic Games," A.D. Frazier, chief operating officer of the
Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG), said.
</P>
<P>
"If people who come here will follow instructions, I think
they'll be in the most secure place on earth," he told the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The FBI said on Sunday the U.S. crime rate fell for the
fourth year in 1995, with murders reported to the police dropping
8 percent, but Atlanta's crime statistics jumped.
</P>
<P>
The figures show Atlanta had more crime per capita than any
other city with a population of 250,000 or more. It topped the
rankings in both violent and non-violent crime.
</P>
<P>
Georgia Attorney General Michael Bowers, who recently angered
local police by describing some of Atlanta's streets as more
dangerous than those in Sarajevo, said he was sure the city would
be safe for the Games, which run July 19 to Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a massive effort to protect our visitors," he
said.
</P>
<P>
ACOG has mounted a massive security operation to protect the
Centennial Olympics, with as many as 20,000 guards, 10,000
soldiers and thousands of agents from the FBI, CIA, secret
service and Georgia state patrol staff taking part. The committee
declines to put a price tag on the operation.

<HEADLINE> China's Horseback Herdsmen Ride Into Sunset </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Half of northwest China's remaining
400,000 households of nomadic herdsmen have bid farewell to a
lifestyle that has spanned thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 households of horseback herdsmen have finally
settled down, ending their traditional nomadic lives.
</P>
<P>
Generations of Tibetans, Mongolians and some other
nationalities had been moving about in search of new pastures in
the vast northwest China, boasting of some 100 million hectares of
grassland, for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
However, the out-dated living style could neither take full
advantage of pastures or cope with natural disasters, nor
facilitate the modernization drive of social lives in the area.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1980s, the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu and
Qinghai, as well as Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region have been engaged in a series of
pasture-building projects, in a bid to complete the historical
work of helping horseback nationalities settle down.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 12 years, governments at all levels have poured
300 million yuan into Qinghai Province, in a move to fund the
building of pastures.
</P>
<P>
The province has already completed more than 600,000 ha of
fenced pasture land and added 400,000 ha of man-planted grassland,
helping 56,000 of the 100,000 households within the province
settle down.
</P>
<P>
In Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, a total of 80,000 herdsmen
and their families have already settled down.
</P>
<P>
During the process of modernization drive, new townships have
mushroomed in the boundless northwest China, with the emergence of
the first group of modern herdsmen who are skillful in trading.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Good Prospect for China's Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Individually-run and privately-owned
businesses in China will hit a high development in the next few
years, an official from the All-China Federation of Industry and
Commerce (ACFIC) said in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The prediction was based on a government green light and its
encouragement to non-state-run sectors.
</P>
<P>
Outlining other favourable factors for the sector's growth, the
official said it enjoys special attention from government at all
levels, improved legal guarantees, and a higher status on domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed non-state enterprises have
accumulated one trillion yuan of liquid funds, laying a solid
financial basis for their future development.
</P>
<P>
Some localities, including Sichuan, Fujian, Hubei and Yunnan
provinces, have worked out their own regulations to guide
operations of non-governmental businesses to develop in a healthy
way.
</P>
<P>
Privately-owned businesses recorded a robust growth in China's
Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995) period. By the end of last year,
the number of privately-owned firms across China climbed to
631,000, employing 53 million workers and turning out a combined
annual output value of 229.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese economist calculated that the sector is expected to
grow to two million in number, and its output will see a
50-percent annual growth at 1.3 trillion yuan in output value in
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to a national estimation made by the State
Information Center, half of China's industrial output value will
be generated by collectively-owned enterprises by the year 2000,
while the other half will be shared by privately-owned and
state-owned firms.
</P>
<P>
After years of primitive accumulation, some well-matched
private firms began to set foot in the comprehensive development
of agriculture and high-technology, and exploitation at the
country's western parts.
</P>
<P>
Over 3,000 enterprising entrepreneurs have plunged into the
"Glory Undertaking Program" launched by the private sector to help
eliminate poverty in under-developed regions. It aims to train
1,000 technical personnel, build 100 projects and develop 10
untapped resources annually.
</P>
<P>
Facts have proved that development of individual and private
sectors opens a new channel to bring the unemployment rate
down. More people working in other trades will join in when the
"Iron rice bowl" is smashed in the economic reforms, a government
official said.
</P>
<P>
However, economists admitted, privately-owned businesses still
have difficulty in obtaining bank loans, land-use rights, expert
permits and chances of overseas tours. But these problems will be
solved gradually, he added.

<HEADLINE> Saive Bows Out at European Table Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, May 6 (Xinhua) -- World number-two Jean-Michel Saive
lost his title when he suffered a shock late night quarter-final
defeat to Sweden's Peter Karlsson at the European Table Tennis
Championships in Bratislava on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Belgian was beaten 11-21, 21-19, 21-16, 21-18 --
just 13 hours after the two men had played the first of their
three matches of the day at ten o'clock in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The bizarre start to the quarter-final contest indicated that
both men might have been affected by tiredness and tension, for
Karlsson won the first ten points of the match and Saive captured
the next 17 in a row.
</P>
<P>
Eventually the favourite took the first game having winning 21
of the 22 last points, and when he reached 17-15 in the second
game it looked as though he was going to join the other big names
in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
But Saive's forehand loop, arguably the best in the world, had
been fitfull all through, and he was unable to get in behind serve
on the next three points.
</P>
<P>
From 18-17 Karlsson served out for the second game and that
changed the mood of the match, with the world number 13 from
Sweden clearly getting a lift from his success.
</P>
<P>
During the interval before the third game Saive was receiving a
back massage and he rarely thereafter looked at his best,
struggling to get in with big attacks.
</P>
<P>
Karlsson, by contrast, was workmanlike and sensible, serving
tight and blocking excellently on the backhand, counter-hitting
well and taking his chances without fuss.
</P>
<P>
When Saive recovered from a two-point deficit to reach 17-17 in
the fourth game the Swede won a tremendous "loop the loop"
exchanges of forehand topspins to get his nose in front, before
winning three of the next four points on his serve to take the
match.

<P>
BONN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Germany fell to below
four million for the first time this year in April, with the
jobless rate down from 10.8 percent in March to 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of people out of work fell by 174,000 from 4.14
million to 3.97 million, the Federal Labor Office announced today.
</P>
<P>
The West German unemployment figure fell to 2.769 million,
going from 9.3 percent to nine percent, the East German figure to
1.198 million, down from 17 percent to 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Bernhard Jagoda, chief of the Federal Labor Office,
expressed pessimism about the drop in unemployment, saying that
the decline should have been larger after the lingering winter.
</P>
<P>
The slight drop showed that the national economy was still in a

<HEADLINE> Beijing Public Bath Houses Improve Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Complaints about public bath service
in Beijing have dropped substantially since 1994 following
improvements of sanitation, management and services in local
public bath houses.
</P>
<P>
There were 51 state-owned public bath houses scattered over the
eight municipal districts by the end of last year, most either
renovated or under renovation, today's "China Daily" quoted an
official with the Beijing Catering and Service Corporation as
saying.
</P>
<P>
As a result of renovation, their once out-dated facilities have
been modernized and poor sanitation has been improved, the
official He Baogui said.
</P>
<P>
Bath houses have set reasonable prices, averaging 4 to 5 yuan
(0.5 to 0.6 US dollars) for common bathing.
</P>
<P>
The official said that when the renovation process was under
way, it became clear that supervision regarding price, sanitation
and quality had also become necessary.
</P>
<P>
Improved living standards in China mean increasing numbers of
showers and baths at home, He said, and thus more and more people
consider public bath houses facilities for relaxation and
socialization, rather than as a hygienic necessity.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that it is inevitable that public bath
houses will thus introduce modern facilities and offer services
such as saunas, jacuzzis and whirlpools, along with traditional
services like pressure point massage.

first appearance at the Italian Open tennis tournament after nine
years and enter the 926,000-U.S.-Dollar tourney as the top seed.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old German, beaten a week ago in Tokyo by Kimiko
Date in the Federation Cup, won both tournaments that she has
played this year.
</P>
<P>
The German last played at the Foro Italico in 1987, beating
Gabriela Sabatini for the title.
</P>
<P>
Officially, her absence of almost a decade is due to tournament
scheduling. Others say that press criticizm in the 1980s about
her appearance kept her away until now.
</P>
<P>
Graf, like all ranking seeds, received a bye into the second
round and will await the winner of a Tuesday contest between
Alexia Duchaume-Balleret of France and American Kathy
Rinaldi-Stunkel.
</P>
<P>
Spain's Conchita Martinez, who has taken three consecutive Rome
titles, is seeded second, with last weekend's Hamburg winner
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain third.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and Iraq
resumed on Monday the oil-for-food talks which was interrupted by
the United Sates and Britain in April.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before the talks began, U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali expressed the hope that
the talks can be successful.
</P>
<P>
He said the success would depend on the co-existence of two
concepts, which are the strict control of humanitarian assistance
and sovereign and territorial integrity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Attending the current talks are Hans Correl, the Swedish
undersecretary-general for U.N. legal affairs and Abdul Amir
al-Anbari, Iraq's representative to the U.N. Educational, Cultural
and Scientific Organization.
</P>
<P>
The talks, the fourth round of its kind, is expected to focus
on a draft accord on the implementation of the Security Council
Resolution 986, which allows Iraq to sell in six months up to 2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil in exchange for food and other
daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
It is designed to relief the suffering of the Iraqi people
before the sweeping economic sanctions imposed since 1989 can be
lifted.
</P>
<P>
The talks was nearly a success in April when it was interrupted
by the United States and Britain, which insisted on important
changes. They demanded that the oil procceeds set aside for the
Northern Kurdish population should be handled by the United
Nations humanitarian relief agencies.
</P>
<P>
Key Security Council members, including China, Russia, France,
Germany, Italy have criticized the Untied States and Britain for
intervening in the talks.

UNITED NATIONS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali urged today that a contingency plan should
be prepared for Burundi so as to prevent a repeat of tragedy in
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
After briefing the Security Council, the secretary-general told
reporters that the situation in Burundi has deteriorated severely
and a group of member states should prepare a plan for
humanitarian intervention in case that a catastrophe happens.
</P>
<P>
He was not asking for a deployable preventive force. What he
demanded was that a group of countries met together and decided
the forces and logistics support they were ready to provide. When
the plan was ready, it would be put on the desk to wait.
</P>
<P>
"In case that an accident had happened, rather than an
intervention two months later -- that was what happened in Rwanda
where a half million people were killed and two million refugees
(fled the country) -- we will be able to intervene in next 24
hours or next 48 hours because everything has been prepared for
this intervention," he said.

NEW YORK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street share prices continued

<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 13.72 points to close at

The Dow index tumbled about 90 points over the past week in

Today's trading volume amounted to 376 million shares,
meanwhile declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 11 to 9

The U.S. government reported last week that the economy grew

<HEADLINE> Improved Efficiency Heralds New Era for China's Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A new trend for China's export
trade focussing on boosting economic efficiency played the main
tune of the 79th China Exports Fair which ended last week in
Guangzhou, capital city of south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The biggest of China's exports fairs, it has always been the
most sensitive monitor of changes in trends in the trade sector.
</P>
<P>
"The growth of China's external trade must be changed from
reliance on quantity increases to the improvement of economic
efficiency," said Shi Guangsheng, Chinese Vice-Minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Co-operations.
</P>
<P>
To boost exports, China used to grant many preferential
policies to export-oriented companies. Enjoying favorable terms
the companies usually resorted to expanding the quantity of their
exports to gain more profit.
</P>
<P>
China's recent adjustment in its trade policy, represented by
the lowering of tax rebates for export businesses, and the
consistently high exchange rates of RMB against foreign currencies
resulted in a sharp rise in the cost for export goods.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the new situation, export companies have to pay more
attention to improving the quality of export goods to enhance
economic efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou fair showed that export businesses have adjusted
the structure of their goods by increasing the export of high-tech
and high value-added items, to meet demands of the international
market.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, one of China's leading exporters, demonstrated the
need at the fair for a strategy of expanding markets with quality,
brand-name and high-value added goods, while giving up many
traditional labor-intensive products. Its business volume
accounted for 10 percent of the fair's total.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has been implementing a major plan to adjust its
export structure by developing 40 key products. Last year, the
export volume of these products reached 4.2 billion US dollars,
making up over 30 percent of the city's total, said an official
with the Shanghai delegation.
</P>
<P>
He said Shanghai is to develop 20 more such products each year
in the future.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the adjustment of exports structure, foreign trade
companies have at the current fair relinquished the practice of
dumping low-priced goods to compete with each other, which has
been a long-standing problem with China's export business.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade companies have also been active in developing new
markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong business people used to claim 40 to 50 percent of
both the total number of foreign traders and the business
volume. At this year's fair, 80 percent of the business volume
were struck with traders from areas other than Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> New Social Security System Takes Shape in Shandong (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the end of 1995, 139 counties and some 2,200 townships
across Shandong had adopted rural pension insurance, based on the
combination of personal contributions and collective
subsidies. Meanwhile 16 million farmers, about half of the
potential buyers, voluntarily bought 1.6 billion yuan of pension
insurance.
</P>
<P>
To promote the labor system reform in the enterprises, Shandong
has made continuous efforts to complete its unemployment insurance
system, which now covers not only state enterprises, but also
Chinese employees in foreign-funded enterprises and contract
workers in government and social institutions.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 5.8 million employees from nearly 30,000
enterprises and institutions in Shandong have joined the
unemployment insurance scheme.
</P>
<P>
Major advances have also been made in the reform of medical
care in both urban and rural areas. By the end of last year, 1.3
million female workers in Shandong's 61 cities and counties had
joined a newly-established birth insurance scheme.
</P>
<P>
With the successful reforms in the social security system,
Shandong has witnessed rapid development in aspects of social
welfare, relief, and resettlement.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the province has some 4,200 welfare enterprises,
which have provided job opportunities for 76,000 disabled people,
and 4,100 homes for the elderly in rural areas, which are
sheltering 83,000 old people.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 160 million yuan has been accumulated through the
work of 35,000 disaster-relief and poverty-alleviating foundations
set up at the village level, providing financial support for 1.2
million poverty-stricken households, and helping one million
families to shake off poverty.

<P>
WEIHAI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese fishing village Huangnigou
has decided to cast its net out into the future by setting up a
go-ahead scheme to help pensioners.
</P>
<P>
Now the village in Weihai, a coastal city in east China's
Shandong Province, has earned its own 'millionaire' status after
accumulating a massive seven-figure fund.
</P>
<P>
It all started in 1993 when Huangnigou, a small but prosperous
fishing village decided to set up a special fund from which
pensions for retired villagers could be drawn.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the village of 89 households took a further step to
form a special council to take care of the management and
distribution of the pension fund, which has now reached one
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaomin, head of the village, claimed that by the year
2002, male villagers above 60 and female ones above 45 will each
receive some 3,500 yuan (about 450 US dollars) a year for pension
and medical care.
</P>
<P>
The fledgling pension system in the seaside village is just one
piece of evidence for the emergence in Shandong of a new social
security system covering social insurance, welfare, and reliefs.
</P>
<P>
Shandong started nine years ago to reform the traditional
pension system, which completely depended upon the state, by
expanding it from within the enterprises, to the whole society.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the province adopted a multi-source pension insurance
system in its enterprises, which combined fundamental pensions
with enterprises' subsidies and personal deposits.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 5.5 million employees from more than 30,000
enterprises, 98 percent of the province's total, have participated
in the pension insurance, which has supported nearly one million
retirees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the pension insurance system has also been
introduced to the rural areas, where nearly 70 percent of the
province's population live, and gradually spread from the coastal
developed regions to the inland regions.

<HEADLINE> OAS Head Accedes to Demands of Brother's Kidnappers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- OAS Secretary-General
Cesar Gaviria said today that he is prepared to reveal his assets
and those of his relatives as demanded by the group that kidnapped
his brother Juan Carlos more than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Gaviria acceded to the demand of the kidnappers in an open
letter to "Bochica", the leader of the "Dignity for Colombia"
group, which was published by several newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general of the Organization of American States
(OAS) promised to disclose his income tax returns and those of his
family to all the media organization if his brother is released
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Gaviria said that he and his family will subject themselves to
the public scrutiny of their family assets in order to show that
he is "upright and clean."
</P>
<P>
"Dignity for Colombia" asked Gaviria and his relatives to
publish the assets they owned two years before Gaviria became
president of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The statements of their assets must be published in the "El
Espectatdor" and "El Tiempo" newspaper of Colombia as well as in
the "Miami Herald" and the "Washington Post" in the United States,
the group demanded.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers claim that Juan Carlos Gaviria, an architect,
benefited illegally from housing subsidies during his brother's
administration.
</P>
<P>
Juan Carlos Gaviria was abducted April 2 in Pereira, the
capital of Colombia's central-western department of Risaralda.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Rule of Law with Significance   (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- It is of epoch-making significance
that China plans to build a country with a socialist legal system,
Chinese legal experts said.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in decades China has clearly enshrined its
commitment for a new legal framework into a five-year plan for
social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
It is a milestone reflecting China's progress in constructing
democratic and legal institutions, legal experts and professors in
Beijing noted.
</P>
<P>
"The historic status of the item can even be compared with that
of building a socialist market economy," one expert said.
</P>
<P>
"The item entails not only that state affairs be managed with
law, but that "governing bodies" strictly abide by law, and
administer the state with legal methods," said Liu Shengping,
law professor at Beijing University at a seminar on the subject
held here today.
</P>
<P>
"This is expected to completely change the tradition of 'rule
of man' which has spanned thousands of years of history in China,
and will steer China away from the uncertainties resulting from
the 'rule of man', and avoid such mistakes and twists as the
Cultural Revolution," he said.
</P>
<P>
In this way China's policies will not change because of changes in
the views of leaders, or in any shifts in their attention, or the
replacement of those leaders, he said.

<P>
Wang Jiafu, a researcher with the China Academy of Social
Sciences, said that the rule of law and building a country with a
socialist legal system are an inevitable outcome of the
development of a socialist market economy in China.
</P>
<P>
The rule of law will protect the final establishment of a
socialist market economy in China because only comprehensive legal
mechanisms can ensure the healthy, sustained and orderly growth in
a market economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sun Guohua, a law professor of the People's University, pointed
out that "the rule of law will help further upgrade and strengthen
the leadership of the Communist Party of China."
</P>
<P>
"Party affairs and state affairs can be separated effectively
when the country is administered within the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The party can concentrate on training, selecting, and
recommending outstanding personnel to government organs, deal with
major issues of university and state significance, thus improving
the arts in leading the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past dozens of years, Chinese legal experts have only
talked about the rule by law. Now discussing the rule of law, and
building a country with a socialist legal system, they hailed that
"the best method has been found" in building socialism in China.
</P>
<P>
They reminded however that China has a long way to go before
really ruling the country with law and building a country with a
socialist legal system.
</P>
<P>
The legal system has room for large improvements, the law
enforcement mechanism has many loopholes, legal supervision is not
sufficient, and law enforcement personnel, ordinary citizens, and
senior officials, in particular, need to a have stronger awareness
of the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
The experts are happy that the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, China's top legislature, is expected
to deliberate tomorrow a draft resolution on further spreading
legal education across the country.

Kabariti reiterated here today Jordan's support for Bahrain in the
wake of series of bombing attacks in the Bahraini capital of

Sheikh Khalifa briefed Kabariti on the latest incidents and

It was the most devastating string of attacks against

HARARE, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government plans to
introduce a health insurance under the National Social Security
Authority (NSSA) scheme to ensure all working Zimbabweans are
covered by medical aid.
</P>
<P>
Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare Minister Nathan
Shamuyarira today said he planned to present the necessary bill
to parliament. If passed by parliament, the scheme would see
people contributing about five percent of their monthly
earnings, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are currently working on the modalities to incorporate the
civil servants and domestic workers into the pension scheme and
also on the inclusion of health as an important factor of social
security," he said.
</P>
<P>
"When these two steps have been taken, we will have a very
comprehensive social security scheme about which we can be proud
of," he added.
</P>
<P>
"There are of course other aspects of social security, such as
unemployment benefits, which we are not able to tackle at this
time because being a developing country, we do not have the
resources to deal with such a major scheme, but NSSA does take us
somewhere towards providing social welfare to the working
population,'' the minister said.

<HEADLINE> WEU to Shoulder More Security Responsibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Western European Union (WEU), the
European pillar of NATO, is expected to be vested with more powers
to handle military operations in Europe at the WEU Council of
Ministers conference to be held in Birmingham, England, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the one-day conference, foreign and defense ministers from
27 European countries will discuss how to further develop the
operational capability and effectiveness of the WEU, especially in
military operations without American participation.
</P>
<P>
British government officials confirmed that Britain will urge
its WEU partners to play a substantial role in organizing
peacekeeping, humanitarian and crisis management missions.
</P>
<P>
However, the British government is strongly opposed to any
intention of making the WEU subordinate to the European Union
(EU), saying NATO remains to be the cornerstone of European
security and stability.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will also discuss the establishment of the WEU
Situation Center, capable of monitoring future operations, and the
development of an Intelligence Section in the WEU's Planning Cell
to handle intelligence from various sources.
</P>
<P>
Another important issue to be discussed is whether the WEU
should take over the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia when the
US-led NATO peace implementation forces pull out of Bosnia at the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
However, Jose Cutiliero, secretary general of the WEU, has
reportedly ruled out any chance of the WEU shouldering the task,
saying the fledgling defense group simply does not have the
capability to mount such a big peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
Britain is the current presidency state of the WEU, which has
10 full members, two observer states, three associate members and
nine associate partners.

<HEADLINE> Peres: No Logic in Controlling Arabs in Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres said here today that he sees no logic in continuing the
Israeli control over the Palestinian residents in the disputed
West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Peres made the remarks during a meeting with the Haredi
Orthodox rabbis (Jewish religious leaders), who called on the
premier to delay the redeployment of the Israeli army in Hebron
for three months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Peres stressed that the army is making every effort
to protect the Jewish settlers living in the town.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the Machpelah Cave in Hebron, along with the
two other most important holy places for Jews, Jerusalem and
Rachel's tomb in Bethlehem, will remain under the Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Israel Radio reported that the initial stage of
the Israeli army's redeployment in Hebron may take place next
week, if the Israeli and Palestinian officials finalize the
details.
</P>
<P>
The first stage will involve a small scale of military
withdrawal from one of the Arab areas in the town, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli civil administrations reportedly have
already transferred most of their offices to the Har Manoa
military base outside Hebron, preparing for the long expected
withdrawal from the city.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said that they are ready to hand over the
full civilian controls of Hebron to the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) at short notice.
</P>
<P>
Hebron is the last West Bank town to be handed over to the
Palestinian National Authority, in accordance with the Oslo peace
accords between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army had already completed its redeployments in
other major Palestinian towns of Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah,
Bethlehem, Kalikilya and Tulkarm in the West Bank by the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel postponed the withdrawal of its troops from
Hebron, some 30 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem. It town is a
place of pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Moslems alike, and
tradition has it that patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their
wives are all buried in the Machpelah Cave (Haram al-Khalil).
</P>
<P>
There are some 400 Jewish settlers now living in the center of
Hebron, who moved back to the city's old Jewish neighborhood
after the 1967 War, during which Israel took over the town from
the Jordanian authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surrounding the Jewish community, there are more
than 200,000 Palestinian residents living in most other parts of
the city.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan of the redeployment, Israeli army is
expected to leave 85 percent of Hebron's municipal area, and then
to redeploy in the remaining 15 percent of the city.

<HEADLINE> Probe Galileo Finds Giant Iron Core in Jupiter's Moon Io </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Jupiter's volcano-pocked moon
Io has been found by the Galileo spacecraft to have a giant iron
core that takes up half its diameter, reported the May 3 issue of
the Science magazine.
</P>
<P>
From the data taken by Galileo, scientists have determined that
Io has a two-layer structure. At the center is a metallic core,
probably made of iron and iron sulfide, about 560 miles in radius,
which is overlain by a mantle of partily molten rock and crust.
</P>
<P>
The probe also has detected a large hole in the Jupiter's
magnetic field near Io, leading to speculation about whether Io
possesses its own magnetic field. If so, it would be the first
planetary moon known to have one.
</P>
<P>
This new information of Io may be related to the intense
heating of the moon caused by the constant squeezing and
distortion of Io in the Jupiter's powerful gravitational grip,
according to Galileo Project Scientist Dr. Torrence Johnson of
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
Galileo was launched aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis on October
18, 1989. It took the data during its flyby within 559 miles of
the Jupiter's moon last December 7, as the probe passed by Io on
its way to enter orbit around the Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
Io is less than a third of the Earth's size, but it generates
twice as much heat as the Earth.

<P>
BEIRUT, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Susanna
Agnelli left here this afternoon for home winding up a tour of the
region, including Cairo and Amman.
</P>
<P>
Agnelli, heading a European Troika delegation which included
Irish and Spanish officials in addition to the Italian minister,
arrived in the Lebanese capital at noon today and held meeting
with top Lebanese leaders and government officials.
</P>
<P>
Agnelli and her delegation met with Lebanese President Elias
Hrawi, House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Rafik
Al-Hariri in the Beirut presidential palace this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Italian foreign minister expressed pessimism over the
formation of a five-state committee in charge of monitoring the
cease-fire in southern Lebanon, and attributed the pessimism to
differences in the proposals raised respectively by the United
States and France on the establishment of the monitoring
committee.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the end of the meeting, Agnelli ruled
out a fast achievement of agreement on the committee's formation,
noting that the peace could not be realized so soon as wished.
</P>
<P>
Comprising the U.S. France, Israel, Syria and Lebanon, the
monitoring committee was provided with a cease-fire understanding
reached on April 26, which was aimed to putting an end to 16 days
of continuous Israeli bombardments and air strikes in southern
Lebanon. The bombardments and air strikes claimed over 160
civilian lives.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting with the three Lebanese leaders, the
Italian foreign minister held an exclusive meeting with Hariri,
who is scheduled to start a tour of Europe Tuesday. He will visit
Italy, Belgium and France.
</P>
<P>
A meeting was immediately held at the Foreign Ministry between
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz and the European
delegation upon the arrival of Agnelli and her delegation here.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the one-hour meeting, Boueiz announced that the
talks concentrated on the Middle East peace process and results
of the recent Israeli agressions against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that the talks dealt with the April understanding,
which put an end to the 16 days of Israeli military operation in
southern Lebanon last month, and the ways to set up "special
mechanism" to implement the understanding.
</P>
<P>
Agnelli said that consultations on the formation of the
proposed five-state committee monitoring the cease-fire in
southern Lebanon were still under way, noting that the Lebanese
foreign minister would have discussions in this regard with
Syrian Leaders while visiting Damascus tonight.
</P>
<P>
"We will see what a role Europe can play in this regard," said
the Italian foreign minister, who is currently chairman of the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Europe was always ready to provide help since
"it believes that the (European) Union has a useful role in the
peace process which we want it to be permanent and not limited to
a cease-fire."
</P>
<P>
Underlining a support for U.N. Security Council Resolution
425, which calls for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from
southern Lebanon, Agnelli confirmed that the European Union has
asked Israel "for thousands of times" to implement Resolution
425.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Ex-President Accused of Suppressing Civil Uprising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean prosecution said
today that former President Chun Doo-hwan "ordered the military
suppression of civil uprising" in Kwangju in 1980 when he was the
defense security commander, but Chun denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution made the accusation at the seventh trial
session on mutiny and treason charges, which involved Chun, his
successor Roh Tae-woo and some of Chun's fellow generals and
colonels, at the Seoul District Court here.
</P>
<P>
Standing trial at the court today were Chun, Roh and Chun's
nine close aides, including Hwang Young-shi, former first army
corps commander.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution told the court it found that at the army
general luncheon on May 18, 1980, Chun practically ordered the
bloody suppression, by saying that "since the Kwangju
demonstration is creating a very dangerous situation, the military
must put down it with early hard-line suppression."
</P>
<P>
Chun was at the luncheon meeting along with senior generals
including Lee Hui-sung, then martial law commander, Chung Ho-yong,
then special warfare commander, and Hwang Young-shi, the
prosecution said.
</P>
<P>
However, Chun denied the accusation, saying that "it is true
that we had a luncheon meeting on May 18, 1980, but we never
discussed ways to suppress the Kwangju demonstration."
</P>
<P>
About 200 people were killed in the military crackdown on the
student demonstration in the southwestern city of Kwangju.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16 former South Korean army officers including Chun
and Roh have been indicted for mutiny and treason. The mutiny and
treason charges respectively stem from their roles in the military
revolt on December 12, 1979 and in the bloody crackdown of the
Kwangju demonstration on May 18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who led a military coup in December 1979, was an army
strongman in 1980 until he took the presidency in August that
year. He was succeeded in February 1988 by Roh, who stepped down
in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the mutiny and treason charges, the two
ex-presidents, who were arrested last year, also faced charges of
corruption for amassing hundreds of millions of dollars while in
office.
</P>
<P>
Both Chun and Roh have already stood trial three times each
respectively on the graft charges.

<P>
HARARE, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Harsh economic conditions, poverty
and the AIDS pandemic are affecting Zimbabwe's efforts towards
implementing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child.
</P>
<P>
The three factors were identified at a one-day Parliamentary
and Media Child Survival Committee Meeting held here today,
as some of the major stumbling blocks in the implementation of
the 1990 convention.
</P>
<P>
Member of the UN Committee on Children's Rights, Swithun
Mombeshora, said while Zimbabwe had enacted appropriate
legislation to protect children, the law was being broken.
</P>
<P>
He said family instability was often responsible for child
abuse, adding that the over-crowded conditions under which the
majority of Zimbabweans lived created a conducive atmosphere for
abuse of the rights of children, such as privacy.
</P>
<P>
Trade unionist and epidemiologist Rene Loewenson said in light
of the economic hardships, minimum standards should be set that
would correspond with available resources.
</P>
<P>
He said while critical programs like child supplementary
feeding had been put in place, benefits were being eroded by
dictation to the country by international financiers of the
economic reforms that emphasized debt repayment at whatever cost.

<HEADLINE> Britain Issues Warning on Russian Spy Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain would make an "appropriate
response" if Russia carried out its threat to expel British
diplomats in Moscow, according to the British Foreign Office.
</P>
<P>
A British Foreign Office spokesman made the statement after a
meeting between Prime Minister John Major and Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind at Downing Street this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister and the foreign secretary had been in close
touch with the British embassy in Moscow to discuss the Russian
spy allegations, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government announced earlier today that it would
expel several British diplomats following the arrest of a Russian
citizen suspected of spying for Britain, the BBC television
reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Foreign Office dismissed the media reports as
groundless, saying. "We regard the kind of allegations reported as
completely unjustified."
</P>
<P>
Russian Federal Security Service chief Alex Zdanovich has
confirmed that the Russian government made a "stern protest" at
Britain's use of its embassy as cover for "illegal spying
activities," the BBC report said.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say that if the expulsion goes ahead, it will be
the biggest spying row between Britain and Russia since the end of
the Cold War.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Launches Challenges To Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 6 (xinhua)-- South African President Nelson
Mandela today issued challenges to the private sector, saying their
involvement was essential to the success of the Maputo Development
Corridor.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Development Corridor Investor Conference in
Maputo, Mozambique, Mandela said the governments of Mozambique and
South Africa had been working together over the past six months to
put in place the necessary foundations for the launch of the project.
</P>
<P>
The multi-billion-Rand project would establish a road and rail
development corridor linking South Africa's provinces of Mpumalanga
and Gauteng with Maputo.
</P>
<P>
''The development and cooperation elements of the initiative will
make an important contribution to the peace and stability in South
Africa,'' said the president, adding the participation of the private
sector was essential to the success of the project.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the conference was the first of many steps to engage
the private sector in the initiative, which had strategic
significance in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
''It is a practical implementation of the commitment of our
governments to regional cooperation within southern Africa,'' said
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
The president also stressed that the corridor would make access to
and from Maputo easier and more efficient, expanding the existing
cooperations in mining, manufacturing, agriculture and tourism
between the two countries.

HARARE, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA)
said today that the recently introduced two percent levy on hotel
bills will be extended to other sectors of the tourism
industry.
</P>
<P>
ZTA Chairman Isidore Gwashure said in a statement that problems

activities, innovation and creation of an extended tourism base.
Tourism is set to become Zimbabwe's most economically important

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Inter-party Summit Thrown Into Confusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's inter-party summit was
thrown into confusion today after a delegation from the ruling
Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) walked out of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the beginning of the summit, attended by heads of
all major political parties, leaders of some opposition parties
had insisted that the meeting should not be chaired by President
Frederick Chiluba who is also MMD president.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that a neutral body like the church or the Law
Association of Zambia should chair the meeting.
</P>
<P>
These calls from the opposition parties resulted in the MMD
delegation's walk-out of the meeting, headed by President
Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Other delegations from the opposition parties remained in the
conference room and some opposition leaders began reading out
their speeches at the meeting without the MMD delegation.
</P>
<P>
The church delegation tried in vain to advise the MMD
delegation to come back and attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The long overdue meeting was expected to discuss important
national issues facing Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Puts Full Stop on Rumors About Election Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 6 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin today
rejected statements by his chief bodyguard and confidant Alexander
Korzhakov that the presidential elections scheduled for June 16 in
Russia might be postponed.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Interfax news agency, Yeltsin said,
"Several people, not only Korzhakov, believe that (Communist Party
leader Gennady) Zyuganov's victory would be the beginning of a
civil war."
</P>
<P>
"I trust in the wisdom of Russian voters. That's why elections
will be held in the time determined by the constitution," the
president noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he had "told Korzhakov not to meddle in
politics and not to make such statements any more."
</P>
<P>
Rumors that Yeltsin is planning to delay the June polls
gathered steam Sunday with the statements by Korzhakov in which he
favored a postponement and backed a recent appeal by a number of
top businessmen for compromise between the candidates.
</P>
<P>
Korzhakov, head of the Presidential Security Service and widely
seen as one of the most influential members of Yeltsin's inner
circle, was quoted Sunday by Britain's The Observer as saying the
elections should be postponed to prevent instability.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of influential people are in favor of postponing the
elections and I'm in favor of it too because we need stability,"
he told the newspaper's Moscow correspondent after a May Day rally
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Korzhakov repeated the sentiments Sunday in comments to
Interfax. "People must be given time to calmly think about
everything and reach a mature conclusion. For this, more time is
needed than we have until June 16," he told the news agency by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
"The society is splitting, even families are splitting: some
are for Yeltsin, others for Zyuganov.... Such division of souls is
dangerous," he said. He stressed that he was expressing his
own opinion, which should not be identified with the opinions of
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Korzhakov's statements, Sergei Filatov, top
organizer of the election campaign for Yeltsin, opposed the idea of
postponing the elections and qualified it as "harmful."
</P>
<P>
"Today,, one month before elections, to raise the issue of
postponing elections, which is negatively assessed in society,
means to push towards danger when certain circle can provoke
disorder, coups," Filatov said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Korzhakov's statements were made in the wrong
moment and were caused by fear that the president would lose the
vote.

<HEADLINE> US Corporate Profits Flat in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Corporate profits in the U.S.
were essentially flat in the first quarter of this year but the
disparity between industries was wider than usual, The Wall
Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to a Wall Street Journal tabulation, the net income
of 692 large U.S. companies was unchanged. That was a sharp
turnaround from the first quarter a year ago but still better than
the fourth quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Corporate profits in the U.S. surged by 48 percent in the first
quarter last year but fell by 18 percent during the last three
months of the year.
</P>
<P>
During the first three months of this year, Wall Street firms
and banks excelled in net incomes and oil company profits soared
in rising petroleum prices. But steel and paper company earning
plunged on weak demand and too much capacity.
</P>
<P>
Still, the quarter's economic performance and corporate earning
were better than expected.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that excluding all large one-time gains and
charges, operating profits for 586 companies in the Dow Jones
universe of companies advanced by 7.1 percent in the first quarter
of this year, compared with a 23 percent gain a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The tabulation shows that the net income of the energy sector
soared by 40 percent in the first quarter this year and that of
the financial sector increased by 17 percent, while the consumer
and cyclical sector's profits fell by 42 percent, the poorest
among all sectors.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Premier Rules Out Stability Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
today ruled out the local reports that his fragile coalition
government would reveal new austerity package to rescue the
country's ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on the 50th day of the central-right
coalition government, Yilmaz said that the economy was not in
need of a stability program.
</P>
<P>
"The primary mission of this government is to achieve a series
of structural reforms which the previous government failed to do,"
said Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
The reforms, he said, will help the economy move from that
of a "rentier nature" into "production."
</P>
<P>
He described the days ahead as "days of restructuring" and his
government will withdraw from every activity the private sector is
able to involve itself in.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also revealed a "Special Consumption
Package" aimed at compensating part of tax losses from the
customs union with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The new taxes will be imposed on gasoline, motor vehicles,
tobacco, alcoholic beverages and a group of luxury consumption
goods.
</P>
<P>
The economic restructuring also includes a draft to tax
Turkey's huge underground economy by making comprehensive
amendments in the commercial code, the Banking Act and economic
legislation.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz added that his government would rearrange the value
added tax (VAT) to make low-income groups better off.
</P>
<P>
A principal means to achieve economic restructuring, Yilmaz
pointed out, is privatization.
</P>
<P>
He said the government privatized cement factories totaling
255 million U.S. dollars last month, adding the state will
entirely withdraw from the cement industry.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said the privatization office is working to invite bids
for the privatization of Turkey's national airlines THY, the
country's largest petrol company Petrol Ofisi and the leading
petrol-chemical plant Pektim as well as the state-owned maritime
companies.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council decided
today that economic sanctions against Iraq will remain unchanged,
Council President Qin Huasun of China said after a routine review
of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq after its
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. The Security Council reviews
the question every two months.
</P>

Ambassador Qin, as representative of China, told reporters that
Iraq has maintained good relations with the U.N. Special
Commission since the last review of the question, that the U.N.
and Iraq have completed three rounds of negotiations on the
oil-for-food plan and that the fourth round of the talks starts
today.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the negotiations will get rid of the external
interference and succeed so as to alleviate the humanitarian
situation in Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the question of sanctions, China has always urged Iraq to
cooperate with the United Nations and fully implement the Security
Council resolutions concerned, he reiterated.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, the Security Council should
objectively and fairly evaluate the efforts of Iraq in
implementing the Security Council resolutions and relax the
sanctions step by step according to the progress of Iraq's
implementation. First, embargo on its oil export should be lifted,
he said.
</P>
<P>
On the missing persons and the return of properties to Kuwait,
he said, Iraq should cooperate with the parties concerned to
settle the remaining issues of the Gulf War finally.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Rajko
Kasagic and international High Representative for Bosnia Carl
Bildt held a meeting today about the preparations for elections in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Kasagic and Bildt also discussed the establishment of some
forms of ties between the Serb entity Republika Srpska and the
Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed the opening of bus links, transit across
Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat federation, and the securing
of the freedom of movement" in line with the Dayton accords,
Tanjug news agency quoted Kasagic as saying in Banja Luka, the
largest Serb city in northwestern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Serb official said views had also been exchanged on
economic recovery and the securing of an electricity transmission
system in Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
The Serb authority boycotted the donors conference for Bosnian
reconstruction held in mid-April in Brussels because it rejected
to attend the conference in a joint delegation with the
Muslim-Croat federation. The international community, on the other
hand, said financial aid to the Serb entity must linked with the
step down of the Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Serb military
commander Ratko Mladic who were listed as war criminals by the
international war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Bildt told reporters after the meeting that efforts were being
made to establish economic and political cooperation on all of
Bosnian territory.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped meetings would continue to be held between
political parties in Republika Srpska and those in the
Muslim-Croat federation with a view to holding the elections
slated for mid-September in accordance with the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
Bildt also emphasized that the right of individuals to private
visits must be guaranteed and the freedom of movement for
civilians be realized.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, the Muslims and Serbs clashed several
times when Muslim refugees attempted to enter into Serb
territories to see their old homes and visit the graves of their
relatives.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The local elections in South
Africa's Kwazulu/Natal Province, scheduled for May 29, would be
postponed to a date not later than the end of June, Provincial
Affairs Minister Chris Fismer announced in Cape Town today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after a five-and-a-half-hour
meeting, called by President Nelson Mandela and chaired by Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki, and also attended by cabinet ministers and
leaders of political parties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Fismer said the
postponement had been a unanimous decision of the cabinet.
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader and Home Affairs Minister
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, present at the media briefing, said he had
accepted the decision as it was in the interests of peace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fismer said an announcement on the new date would
be made as soon as possible after his ministry had contacted
Kwazulu/Natal's Local Government Minister Peter Millier.
</P>
<P>
The decision to postpone the poll was welcomed by the main
political parties in Kwazulu/Natal, describing it as a good
compromise for all role-players in the province.
</P>
<P>
The Kwazulu/Natal local election was postponed from November 1
last year to March this year when concerned parties failed to
agree on delimitation of ward boundaries. It was then postponed
again to May.
</P>
<P>
The ANC wanted the poll postponed a third time, citing massive
voter registration fraud and ongoing violence in the province as
obstacles to free and fair elections.

<HEADLINE> Bildt Says Those Indicted for War Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The High Representative for Bosnia
Carl Bildt said today that individuals who have been indicted by
the international tribunal for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia
cannot stay in office.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Banja Luka, the biggest Serb city in
northwestern Bosnia, Bildt said their staying in office will only
be detrimental to Serbs because it does not help build up trust
between the Serb entity and the international community.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were referred to Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and
the Serb army chief Ratko Mladic. Both of them were charged by the
international tribunal as committing war crimes during the three
and half year civil war in Bosnia. The international community has
been pressing for the step down of the two Serb leaders from their
current post but the Serb authority has refused to do so till now.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 people in the former Yugoslavia have been indicted
as war criminals by the Hague-based international war crimes
tribunal, and most of them are Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Bildt stressed that the international community will persist in
its demands to secure the freedom of movement between the two
entities in Bosnia -- the Muslim-Croat federation and Republika
Srpska, equal access to the media for all political parties which
meet conditions for taking part in the upcoming parliamentary
elections in September.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the extension of IFOR's mandate and the forcible
entry of Muslims on Serb territory, Bildt said he did not see any
reason for IFOR to stay any longer than planned. He also said the
limitations imposed on Muslims, who cannot go back to their houses
and apartments in the Serb land, were a violation of an important
Dayton peace agreement provision that all refugees have the right
to return and all civilians have the right to move freely around
in the country.
