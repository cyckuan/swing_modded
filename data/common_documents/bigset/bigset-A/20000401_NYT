<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the last 15 years, as executive pay has soared and each new
plateau has met with something of a public outcry, America's
business leaders and their supporters have had a ready answer for
the critics: Look at the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, when the average pay of chief executives at large
companies first topped $2 million, the Dow Jones industrial average
ended the year at 2,168. By 1995, when average pay hit $5.8
million, the Dow had reached 5,117.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 31, 1999, the end of a year in which the average pay
package reached $11.9 million, the index closed at 11,497.
</P>
<P>
   The two numbers have enjoyed a symbiotic relationship, the
executives argue, as the promise of wealth, in the form of stock
options, has inspired them to create efficient companies that are
driving the longest economic expansion in American history.
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, the debate is over, and the executives have
won.
</P>
<P>
   Companies in Europe and Asia are starting to mimic the American
system by raising salaries and awarding more stock. Dot-com
billionaires have made the fortunes of some old-line executives
look moderate. And eight years after Bill Clinton made exorbitant
executive pay an issue in his first presidential campaign, the
topic has disappeared from the political scene.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at this moment of triumph _ when nine-digit packages are a
reality and eight-digit annual pay is the norm _ there is a rising
undercurrent of concern over the very thing that executives credit
with helping motivate the country's stunning growth: the tremendous
boom in stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, America's companies have handed over a
large portion of themselves to the executives who run them. That
has aligned management's interests with investors, delighting those
who advocate tying executive pay to performance.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of analysts warn that it has also created
the potential for a host of long-term problems that could undercut
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   As top executives (and other employees) continue to exercise
their rising pile of options over the next decade, other
stockholders will see their stakes watered down. It seems
unavoidable. Already, companies have spent billions of dollars in
recent years _ and taken on rising levels of debt _ buying back
shares to minimize the dilution.
</P>
<P>
   For the repurchasing to continue at its current pace, a recent
Federal Reserve study warned, companies would have to devote
virtually all of their future earnings to buybacks.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the skeptics worry, corporate America is using stock
options like a credit card without a spending limit. While every
penny in salary is recorded as a cost on company books, hundreds of
billions of dollars in stock options aren't counted at all. To the
fire of a blazing stock market, companies add the fuel of overly
rosy earnings reports, unencumbered by off-the-books promises of
future pay.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last summer, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said
stock options helped ``impede judgments about prospective
earnings'' and, over the last five years, had caused companies to
overstate profit growth by one to two percentage points each year.
</P>
<P>
   The level of exaggeration is on the rise, doubling between 1997
and 1998, according to a study by Bear Stearns. At some companies _
including Cisco Systems, a new-economy stalwart that briefly last
week boasted the highest market capitalization in the world _
earnings would be more than 20 percent lower if stock options were
accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dilution is a serious financial problem, and it ought to
be getting a lot of attention,'' said John C. Bogle, the founder
and former chairman of the Vanguard Group, the big mutual fund
company.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees, to be sure. By attracting and motivating
the best workers and managers, stock options spur long-term growth
at a faster rate than they dilute a company's shares, many
executives argue, giving stockholders better net returns than they
would have received otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a great believer in stock options,'' said Dennis Powell,
the controller of Cisco, one of the stock market's best performers
over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, companies publish their level of ``overhang'' _ the
percentage of the company that options would represent if all were
exercised _ allowing investors to factor it into their decisions.
And widely published statistics on diluted earnings per share take
into account any options that currently have value.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of investors remain skittish. Fund managers
at TIAA-CREF, a $288 billion pension and mutual fund company, are
more often using their proxies to vote against executive pay plans.
Over all, the proportion of such plans that meet tough resistance
is up. And a New York Stock Exchange task force has recommended
tightening guidelines to force companies to seek shareholder
approval of almost all options plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, you're starting to see mainstream
institutional investors become concerned that the decade-long
stock-option binge has left companies with serious, structural
earnings problems,'' said Patrick S. McGurn, the director of
corporate programs at Institutional Shareholder Services, a
Rockville, Md., group that advises large investors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the consultants paid to design executives'
contracts _ who have been some of the loudest defenders of the pay
explosion _ have grown concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're giving away more and more of the future value of the
company,'' said Richard H. Wagner, president of Strategic
Compensation Research Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate debt, rising in large part to pay for options plans,
``is the dirty little secret of corporate America,'' added Ira T.
Kay, the head of the pay practice at Watson Wyatt Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, boards of directors were hesitant to set
aside more than 1 percent of a company's equity for stock options
in any given year; they generally kept the overall level of
outstanding options below 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But just as technology companies have transformed attitudes
about stock price valuations and the track record that a company
should have before going public, so have they blown through the old
guidelines on options.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dot-com and new economy companies have rewritten all the
rules,'' said Gary Locke, head of Towers Perrin's executive
compensation practice.
</P>
<P>
   The rising use of stock options predates the Internet, but the
remarkable success of technology firms over the last five years has
helped to rapidly accelerate the trend. The number of millionaires,
and mega-millionaires, that technology companies have created has
put the rest of corporate America on the defensive. One response
has been to ply executives with even more options.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the nation's 200 largest public companies handed out
options that represented the equivalent of 2.1 percent of their
outstanding shares, up from 1.2 percent in 1994, according to Pearl
Meyer &AMP; Partners, a pay consulting firm in New York. As a result,
the average overhang reached 13.7 percent in 1999, well above the
old 10 percent ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has
required companies to include a footnote in their annual reports
disclosing what options would cost, using one or another widely
accepted formula, if they were charged as an employment expense.
</P>
<P>
   Why is there a cost? In granting options, companies are allowing
employees to buy stock in the future at today's (presumably lower)
price. To make up for the discount, the companies either forgo
issuing shares for which they could have received full price, or
they buy back existing shares and forfeit the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're buying high and selling low,'' McGurn said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if a company's stock price has fallen below the
exercise price when its executives become eligible to cash them in,
the executives will not exercise them, and other investors' shares
will not be diluted. But that is hardly a trade-off most companies
would welcome.
</P>
<P>
   When options are under water _ as is the case at so many
old-economy companies today _ many executives either flee or demand
other payments to make up for money they had expected to get.
</P>
<P>
   To date, few companies appear to have suffered from the options
boom. Strong profits have given many of them enough cash to pay for
their growth and to repurchase millions of shares. Among other
things, the buybacks have generally prevented options granted in
the early 1990s and exercised over the last few years from diluting
earnings per share _ though, of course, the money used to buy the
shares could have been deployed to other ends.
</P>
<P>
   From 1994 to 1998, the amount that companies in the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 spent each year on stock repurchases more than tripled,
to almost $150 billion, according to a Fed analysis of Compustat
data. Together, buybacks over that period accounted for about 2
percent of all outstanding shares.
</P>
<P>
   But the pace of option grants has accelerated rapidly in the
last few years, and the number of exercisable options will be far
greater in five years than it is now. As a result, the Fed study
found, companies would have no money for investments or dividends
if they tried to keep up their pace of buybacks. On the other hand,
the study's authors warned, slowing the pace of buybacks ``could
have a negative effect on equity valuations.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, companies could borrow to buy back stock _ a strategy
for which they have already shown a fondness. Corporate debt has
risen by 45 percent over the last five years, and much of the
increase is a result of share repurchases, said John Lonski, the
chief economist at Moody's Investor Services.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the current level of option grants point out that
the growth of the stock market has kept debt-to-equity ratios at
levels that are of little concern. Skeptics note that the ratios
have risen in recent years despite the long bull market, leaving
companies vulnerable to a correction.
</P>
<P>
   The central question, though, may be whether investors have
taken into account the rising level of overhang when valuing
today's market.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, the footnotes in companies' annual reports tell
investors the degree to which options could dilute their shares and
offer an estimate of the options' cost. ``There is full
disclosure,'' said Rick Escherich, a managing director at J.P.
Morgan, ``and I assume it is something that gets factored into
every company.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the information is buried inside a document
issued once a year, in an era when the smallest bit of news about a
company can instantly alter its stock price. ``We all know
companies' stock price moves on quarterly earnings numbers, not
annual reports,'' said Pat McConnell, a senior managing director at
Bear Stearns and one of the authors of the study that found
options' true effect on earnings to be rising (though still smaller
than in some earlier estimates).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts are not even sure that individual investors find
the annual footnotes. ``You've got to be pretty sophisticated to
sort it all out,'' said Paula Todd, who manages the executive
compensation research division at Towers Perrin. ``My grandmother
isn't going to figure out the overhang.''
</P>
<P>
   A further question is what companies are getting for their
largess. Numerous studies in recent years have shown that companies
with high levels of executive stock ownership have outperformed
companies with low levels. Few of the studies, however, asked what
the ideal level of ownership was: Do companies get an extra bang
from making their chief executives centimillionaires, for instance,
rather than mere decimillionaires?
</P>
<P>
   Noting the void, three Columbia Business School professors
undertook a study of 600 companies, examining their performance
over the last 20 years. Their results, published late last year in
the Journal of Financial Economics, showed that increasing an
executive's stakes in a company did not cause stronger earnings or
a higher stock price. Instead, it appears to be other factors, like
research spending, that cause a company to perform well.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the evidence people have cited for the link between
ownership and performance is flawed,'' said Charles P. Himmelberg,
one of the authors.
</P>
<P>
   Another, R. Glenn Hubbard, added, ``There's not much extra kick
from higher managerial ownership.'' The ideal level of ownership
appears to vary by company, they said.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Salomon Smith Barney study, meanwhile, found that most
of the heaviest users of options in the S&AMP;P 500 actually
underperformed the index.
</P>
<P>
   Such findings can only fuel the skepticism that already has
companies working harder to win shareholder approval of proposals
for new option plans. Fourteen such proposals, including one at Ben
&AMP; Jerry's, the ice cream maker, failed last year.
</P>
<P>
   More significant, one out of every seven proposals received at
least 30 percent negative votes last year, according to Strategic
Compensation Research Associates, which advises companies on
getting such plans approved. Three years ago, only one of every 12
plans met that level of opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Because many of the yes votes represent bulk votes by brokers,
on behalf of individuals who do not return their ballots, anything
but a landslide often means that executives had to lobby large
investors or revise parts of their proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that you just put your plan in your proxy,''
Todd said. ``Now that period when the proxy is out on the street is
hell for a lot of companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Microsoft, with years of stellar returns, saw 27 percent of
its shares vote against a small option plan for board members in
November.
</P>
<P>
   It would be an exaggeration, however, to suggest that investors
no longer believe in options, analysts say. ``There's a general
consensus that stock options have been very beneficial to the
performance of U.S. companies,'' said Escherich of J.P. Morgan.
``The question is: What is the right level?''

WHAT THE NUMBERS MEAN, AND HOW THEY WERE CALCULATED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 2) 
</HEADLINE>

graphics.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   In examining executive compensation, Money &AMP; Business sought
this year to capture the differences between the pay practices of
companies in the old economy of industrial, service and financial
concerns and those in the new economy of Internet and related
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   After all, one of the biggest worries today of managers at
established companies is the flight of workers to Internet jobs
that promise unprecedented wealth. And one of the great concerns of
economists and market watchers is that the new economy's pay
practices _ especially its generosity with stock options _ may be
contributing to a casino mentality, blind to business fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   To gauge the divide, Executive Compensation Advisory Services,
an Alexandria, Va., division of Harcourt Inc. that collects,
analyzes and sells information on executive pay, collected data on
pay at 160 companies among the early filers of proxies for 1999,
the documents in which compensation details are reported.
</P>
<P>
   Representing the old economy in the survey were 100 of the
largest nontechnology companies (as measured by sales) that had
filed their proxies by March 23.
</P>
<P>
   The 60 new-economy companies had the same proxy deadline and
appeared on one of 10 widely watched indexes of technology stocks:
the Dow Jones Internet composite index; the Fortune e-50; the
Interactive Week Internet index; the USA Today Internet 100;
internet.com's Internet Stock List and ISDEX Internet Stock index;
the Wall Street Research Net e-tailers index; and TheStreet.com's
Internet Sector, e-commerce and e-finance indexes.
</P>
<P>
   (A company in one of these indexes that would also have
qualified, by size, for inclusion in the old-economy list _
Microsoft, for example, or IBM _ was considered part of the new
economy in the study.)
</P>
<P>
   All 160 chief executives had to hold the job for their company's
entire 1999 fiscal year. (That period varied widely, with the
fiscal year for a few companies ending as early as March 1999.)
Several of those listed _ like Bill Gates of Microsoft and Dale F.
Morrison of Campbell Soup _ are no longer chief executive today.
</P>
<P>
   Pay can be added up any number of ways. Pay critics _ and
corporate recruiters _ tend to cite the biggest possible numbers,
while executives and company directors may have an interest in
minimizing the size of pay packages. In any event, the biggest
differences stem from the way stock options are valued.
</P>
<P>
   Any value assigned to an option is a guess; the real worth of a
chance to buy a stock four years from now at, say, $10 a share
depends on the trading price of that stock in four years. The data
in the tables on these two pages represents an attempt to recognize
this uncertainty, and to take into account how people think about
options in real life.
</P>
<P>
   Options granted in 1999 are valued two different ways. One
method, using a widely accepted guideline of 33 percent of the
price at which the options were granted, takes into account the
volatility of stock prices. The other method estimates the value of
options based on recent prices for each company's stock _ the value
that an executive would have in mind if he was keeping one eye on
the stock ticker.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these numbers appears in corporate proxy statements,
which use one of two other methods for valuing options. Simply
using the companies' values would make it impossible to compare
various executives' options grants.
</P>
<P>
   Given the complications, the tables do not try to total cash and
options pay into a single number. Income from exercising options
granted in past years is also reported separately, as it can be
viewed as compensation for previous years' work.
</P>
<P>
   Here are definitions for the columns in the tables. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Direct Compensation &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SALARY Base annual pay that does not directly depend on company
results.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BONUS A cash payment that can very widely depending on the
company's performance. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AND OTHER A combination of two categories.
The first covers incentive payments that most companies set
approximately three years in advance and pay out depending on the
company's performance. The second includes miscellaneous items like
moving expenses, insurance payments or fees covering personal use
of a corporate jet. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TOTAL DIRECT COMPENSATION The sum of the three previous
categories. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At-Risk Compensation &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RESTRICTED STOCK The value, as reported by the company, of
shares conditionally granted to an executive. Typically, executives
get to keep these shares only if they remain with the company for a
predetermined period.
</P>
<P>
   Values are shown only for executives who received restricted
stock. None of the new-economy executives in the study received
restricted stock, so the column does not appear on the new-economy
table. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1999 OPTIONS, GRANT-DATE VALUE An estimate of the value of the
stock options granted to an executive in 1999, based on the price
of the company's stock when the options were granted. (The exercise
price of all options in the study is the same as the market price
on the grant date.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the most common methods for valuing options is the
Black-Scholes formula, which takes into account the exercise price
of the option, the time before it can be exercised, the time before
it expires and the volatility of the company's stock. A widely used
approximation of the formula simply takes one-third of the exercise
price. This is the method that Money &AMP; Business used.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if an executive received 100,000 options on a stock
that was trading at $30, the study estimated the grant to be worth
100,000 multiplied by $10, or $1 million. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1999 OPTIONS, ESTIMATED CURRENT VALUE An estimate of the value
of the stock options an executive received in 1999, based on recent
prices of the stock.
</P>
<P>
   The study found the average of the company's closing stock
prices at the end of December, January and February. The exercise
price of the option was then subtracted from that average to arrive
at a current value for the option.
</P>
<P>
   Consider again the executive who received 100,000 options on a
stock that was trading, on the grant date, at $30. If the average
recent stock price was $50, each option would be valued at $20, and
the 100,000 options would be worth $2 million. If the stock was
trading at $29, the options would have no current value. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Accumulated Wealth  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONS PROFITS REALIZED IN F.Y. 1999 The gain that executives
saw in the 1999 fiscal year by exercising options from previous
years. For each option, this number is the difference between the
price of the stock when the executive exercised the option and the
price at which the option was granted. In some cases, executives
immediately sell the underlying shares, and in other cases they
hold onto the stock. Values are shown only for executives who
realized profits during the fiscal year. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VALUE OF STOCK BENEFICIALLY HELD The value of shares held
outright by an executive, based on the closing stock price at the
end of the company's fiscal year. In some cases _ because, for
instance, shares are held in trust for a child _ executives may
disclaim beneficial ownership of a portion of the shares they are
reported as owning. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VALUE OF OPTIONS, F.Y. END Value, at the end of acompany's
fiscal year, of both exercisable and nonexercisable options held by
the executive. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TOTAL VALUE OF EQUITY The sum of the previous two numbers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OWNERSHIP STAKE Beneficial stock holdings, plus exercisable
options and options exercisable within 60 days, as a percentage of
the company's total shares outstanding, as reported in the
company's proxy.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Performance &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STOCK PERFORMANCE VS. S&AMP;P 500 The amount, in percentage points,
by which the company's performance trailed or exceeded the stock
index during the period through the end of the company's 1999
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Performance comparisons are for a one-year period for
new-economy companies and a three-year period for old-economy
companies.
</P>
<P>
   For those new-economy companies that went public during the 1999
fiscal year, performance is measured against the index for the
portion of the year that they were publicly traded.
</P>
<P>
   Some new-economy companies went public after the end of the
fiscal year; they are shown as N.A. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Averages and Medians &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For each column, these figures take into account only executives
for whom values were reported. For example, the averages for
restricted stock grants to old-economy executives include only the
34 executives who received restricted stock. ``Average'' is the
arithmetic mean; ``median'' is the figure in the middle of the
series of numbers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The performance statistics were calculated by Money &AMP; Business,
based on data provided by Factset Research Systems, a research firm
in Greenwich, Conn., and Bloomberg Financial Markets. All other
data was calculated by Executive Compensation Advisory Services.

CISCO AND PENNEY: 2 COMPANIES' EXPERIENCE WITH STOCK COMPENSATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 2)  
 (sidebar with EXECS-PAY)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AT CISCO, OPTIONS MACHINE CHURNS UNFETTERED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Warren Buffett has made the point succinctly: if a company has a
choice between paying its employees with a currency that counts
against its earnings and another currency that does not, there is
not a lot of mystery about which one it will pick.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, the Internet equipment maker that is one of the
three most valuable companies in the world, is a good case study.
</P>
<P>
   The company is a heavy user of stock options, the form of pay
that accounting rules say does not have to be counted against
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, Cisco's employees held some 439 million outstanding
options.
</P>
<P>
   And for 1999, the company granted its chief executive, John T.
Chambers, options conservatively valued at $44 million. Valued at
recent stock prices for Cisco, the options are worth a stunning
$159 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco says that giving large option grants to managers ties
their pay to the company's performance _ and few investors would
argue with Cisco's performance.
</P>
<P>
   But some institutional investors and management experts are
worried about the long-term cost of giving employees large,
discounted stakes in their companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Option plans are redistributing corporate ownership,'' Eric D.
Roiter, a general counsel at Fidelity Investments, wrote recently.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco reported $2.1 billion in net income in 1999, but
accounting for options would have erased $500 million of that,
according to a footnote in the annual report. That would amount to
a 24 percent reduction in earnings per share.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Powell, the company's controller, notes that all this
information is available to investors. And, he points out, the $500
million is no more than an estimate, based on one of many economic
formulas for valuing options.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a what-if calculation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. PENNEY BOSSES IN STOCK BIND
</P>
<P>
   Management experts and institutional investors constantly lobby
American executives to own more stock in the companies they run.
Unlike options _ which, at worst, are worth nothing _ ownership of
actual shares brings a downside. When investors lose money, so do
the people running the company.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when many old-economy stocks declined, that danger
became real for top executives. Few lost as much as the bosses at
J.C. Penney, the giant retailer, whose stock lost more than half
its value during 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies require their chief executives to own stock worth
three to five times their annual salary, said James A. Hatch, an
executive vice president at the Compensation Resource Group, a pay
consulting firm in New York. Penney is more aggressive. Its chief
executive, James E. Oesterreicher, must own seven times his annual
salary, according to the company's most recent proxy. The ratio
declines for lower-level executives, down to one and a half times
salary for store managers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the most recent year's proxy available for Penney,
Oesterreicher made $612,000. He did not own quite seven times that
in early 1999, but he did hold about 80,000 shares, worth about $3
million at the time. (The shares had been worth about $4 million
only a few months before.)
</P>
<P>
   Friday, however, with J.C. Penney's stock trading at $14.875,
80,000 shares would be worth just $1.19 million. If Oesterreicher
received no raise last year and still holds 80,000 shares today, he
would have to buy an additional 200,000 to comply with the
company's policy. Through a spokeswoman, he declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Many other chief executives find themselves in similar
predicaments. Coca-Cola, Eastman Kodak, Sara Lee and Sears, Roebuck
all have stock ownership policies, and all saw their price drop in
1999. To follow their own rules, executives there would have to do
some serious value investing _ or persuade their boards to hand
over thousands of free shares.

MONDESI SETTLES IN THIRD SPOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Before trading Raul Mondesi to Toronto in November,
Dodgers managing partner and CEO Bob Daly made one last call to
make sure this is what the Dodgers right fielder wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, in fact, was dead set on leaving Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in his Blue Jays duds, Mondesi sports a smile that spreads
from one diamond stud earring to the other. He said he'll miss the
Los Angeles fans and the friends he made along the way, but he
couldn't be happier about the way things worked out.
</P>
<P>
   After lobbying for years for a change, Mondesi is delighted
because he's hitting third in the Blue Jays' lineup. And Toronto
manager Jim Fregosi said he doesn't plan on that changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more bull(stuff), man,'' Mondesi said before the Dodgers'
exhibition game Friday night in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, they told me I'm hitting third all year. Now, I don't
have to worry if I go 0 for 4 a couple times, or go 0 for 10. I
know I'm going to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Dodgers, you had that pressure, because you never
knew what was going to happen. Anything can happen. If you go 0 for
10, the next day you're hitting fifth or sixth, or you're out.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Mondesi had a chance to show up his old team.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he was hit with a pair of pitches, the second of which
sent him to Mt. Sinai Hospital for X-rays on his left little
finger. The X-rays were negative, but Mondesi said he'll sit out
today's game because he doesn't want to risk injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say they were trying (to hit him), but why did
they have to hit me twice?'' asked Mondesi, who left the clubhouse
with ice wrapped on his left hand. ``I don't want to make it a big
deal, but why?''
</P>
<P>
   To Mondesi, it's just another way the Dodgers are playing with
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi said he thought about his place in the batting order
nearly every day last season and it weighed heavily on him. He
batted first, third, fourth, fifth and sixth. He was particularly
annoyed when he was dropped from fourth to fifth in the batting
order in late April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please set the record straight,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``Mondi and I didn't have a problem. He was never a
problem for me. He played well for me. I think that Mondi was a
little sensitive to all the expectations put on this ballclub and
put on him.''
</P>
<P>
   The third position in the lineup is where Mondesi always wanted
to hit, and nearly every spring the experiment would take place.
Mondesi would hit third, managers would ask him to be more patient,
and by the second week he'd be hitting somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is different, completely different,'' said the 29-
year-old Mondesi, who spent seven seasons with the Dodgers. ``They
let you play. Everybody's happy. To me, it's the best thing to
happen, to get out of L.A. I still love the fans and everything,
you know, but that's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi and those around him said it was simply time for change.
That's why he never went back on his request to be traded, part of
an obscenity-laced tirade aimed at Johnson and Dodgers general
manager Kevin Malone last season.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi failed to understand Johnson's philosophy about a
batting order and thought he was singled out when things began
going bad last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me, Malone and Johnson, that they wanted me to stay
there,'' Mondesi said. ``I said, `It's over. Get somebody else in.
I don't want to play for you guys anymore.' I appreciate everything
they did for me, but that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in the deal that brought Shawn Green to the Dodgers and
sent Mondesi to Canada was left-handed relief pitcher Pedro Borbon,
who said the difference in Mondesi between last season and this
spring is eye-popping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mondi's like a kid in Disney World right now,'' Borbon said.
``You can see the way he plays. He's always been intense, but now
he's comfortable. He's real happy to be here and sometimes you need
a change. I was real happy to get away from the Braves. I don't
think he was thrilled about it, but he knew he needed a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing in baseball, you have to be happy. If you're happy,
you're able to perform better. I feel this is the year he's going
to do the 40-40 thing. He's capable of doing that. It shows on the
field and off the field how happy he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi was a Gold Glove winner with the Dodgers and is one of
eight players to hit at least 30 homers and steal 30 bases in a
season twice. Even during the tumultuous 1999 season, Mondesi set
career highs in homers (33), RBI (99), stolen bases (36) and walks
(71).
</P>
<P>
   But he felt underappreciated and that was compounded by his
constant moving in the batting order. Always wanting to hit third,
Mondesi didn't get much a chance. In the past three seasons, he
batted .271 (113 for 417) with 20 homers and 61 RBI from the third
spot.
</P>
<P>
   In Toronto, Mondesi will hit third, in front of lefty Carlos
Delgado, who hit 44 homers and drove in 134 runs last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no perfect world, but I think he fits all the things
you want in a No. 3 hitter,'' Fregosi said. ``He runs well, he can
steal a base, he hits for power, HE can drive in runs. The
strikeouts don't bother me because, God knows, I used to do it
enough.''

LAKERS CAN PLAY BETTER, SAYS JACKSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Lakers are on pace for 68 wins, a
total that would rank second in franchise history, but coach Phil
Jackson is stressing to anyone who will listen that they are far
from playing their best basketball of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, he called his team ``cocky'' and mused that
a loss at Sacramento might have been helpful. Jackson is looking
for improvement in the final 10 games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just sometimes step up to the level of competition,'' he
said. ``They can play a quarter and feel like they've got the game
in control and they can just hold people off. There's that tendency
to find a way to get a lead and then play at a level where you
bring it back up again and the team comes close . . . (instead of
playing hard to) break the game open.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking prior to Friday's tipoff against the Philadelphia 76ers
at the Staples Center, Jackson said the Lakers' last ``real good
game'' was the 110-82 victory at Detroit on March 17, the last
victory of the 19-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've really played well for a couple of
weeks,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   And though the Lakers' gaudy record, numerous winning streaks
and insurmountable lead in the standings are Bulls-like, Jackson
said there was no comparison to his former Chicago teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``None,'' he said. ``The only thing they can do is they can find
a way to win. Like I said, that's the key to any team that's really
good, is being able to bring a game out of the fire or find a way
to fight back and win, and build momentum, and this is a team
that's really lived on the momentum of being better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think their community feel toward each other _ and winning
breeds that _ is very high. So that's very similar. But as far as
the way they play and the style of game, outside shooting vs.
inside game, they're all different. It's a completely different
mindset.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Peerless: The Seattle SuperSonics and Sacramento Kings
continue to jostle for the seventh and eighth seeds in the West,
but the Lakers _ who get a first-round meeting with the eighth seed
_ aren't concerned with who they'll get.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked a little bit about who our matchup may be,'' said
Derek Fisher. ``But at this point, even in that discussion we
really don't favor one team or the other. We really feel like there
aren't many teams, or any at all, that in a playoff series can beat
us.''

 UNRUFFLED SYMINGTON (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 BY JERRY KAMMER 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Attorney Michael Man ning charged into his Friday
con frontation with Fife Symington like a boxer at the opening
bell, demanding to know what the former governor knew about his
ill-fated real estate business and when he knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You told me that the real estate depression was not affecting
your properties in 1989 or 1990,'' Man ning said, launching his
attack on the 10th day of Symington's trial in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Manning's indignation made an ac cusation out of the reference
to a sworn statement by Symington, who filed for personal
bankruptcy in 1995 during his second term as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Symington kept his Harvard-culti vated manners as impeccable as
his charcoal-brown suit, parrying deftly in the opening round of a
battle that will resume Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going a little fast for me, Mr. Manning,'' said
Symington, who was not about to let Manning set the pace of the
inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The two have become intense adver saries, clashing twice in
sworn depo sitions.
</P>
<P>
   Manning's lawsuit, filed on behalf of a consortium of six union
pension funds that lent Symington $10 mil lion in 1990, claims that
Symington lied not only to get financing but also to get elected
governor in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Symington flatly denies he sought to deceive anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart of hearts, I know I didn't do anything wrong,''
Syming ton said after court Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Symington, who at 54 has launched a career as an apprentice chef
in Scottsdale, acknowledges errors on his financial statements, but
he says they were the result either of compu tational failures or
his optimistic belief in the soundness of his long-term prospects.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, Rob Shull, helped fend off Friday's assault,
objecting 16 times during Symington's 57 minutes of testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Shull's most common complaint was that Manning was being
argumenta tive. He was particularly indignant when Manning tried to
press Sy mington on an unfavorable appraisal of the Ritz-Carlton,
one of Syming ton's former properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want you to slip away on this one,'' Manning said,
prompting Shull to leap to his feet in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Judge George Nielsen, a veteran of unfailingly even temper,
admonished Manning at one point with patient drollness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's rephrase the question in the usual neutral fashion,''
the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Manning repeatedly tried to pin Symington on his sworn claim
that he believed his business had been thriving until 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Symington said it was only then, a few months after he became
gover nor, that he realized he was being swept away by the riptide
of a Phoenix area real estate recession.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Symington testified, his properties ``were doing
fairly well in a tough market, and I didn't think I was going to
lose them.''
</P>
<P>
   Timing is everything in this trial of Arizona's former chief
executive, convicted in 1997 of federal criminal charges of lying
to lenders.
</P>
<P>
   That conviction was overturned last year on appeal, and
prosecutors are weighing whether to retry the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Symington is con fronting the pension funds,
which have the burden of proof in the bankruptcy trial.
</P>
<P>
   The funds are attempting to prove that they acted reasonably
when they accepted a 1990 financial statement from Symington, who
was seeking the governorship as a successful developer who would
bring his hard-nosed business sense and so phistication to
government.
</P>
<P>
   Symington told the pension funds that he had a net worth of $12
mil lion, based on his share of 16 commercial properties.
</P>
<P>
   Manning claims that Symington erected a gaudy and fraudulent
facade as project after project crum bled under debt.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Manning grilled Syming ton about two appraisals on
the Ritz-Carlton at 24th Street and Camelback Road, Symington's pre
mier development.
</P>
<P>
   In his financial statement to the pension funds, Symington said
the hotel was worth $62.9 million, even though an up-to-date
appraisal had put its value at $57.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Manning says Symington's use of his own appraisals was part of a
much broader pattern of deceit. Symington countered Friday that it
showed nothing more than a difference of opinion.
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't use the lower appraisal ``because I didn't
agree with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I built the project,'' Symington added. ``I felt I was the
better judge of its value.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting afterward with reporters, Symington said he had provided
the pension funds with all the financial information called for
under a previ ous loan commitment. He again insisted that the
pension funds failed to ask a single question about his financial
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't really interested in what was going on,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The pension funds were depending on the loan's collateral, the
down town Phoenix Mercado, which the loan financed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Manning told reporters that the pension funds had a right to
believe that Symington's financial statement was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were the pension funds supposed to ask, `Were you lying to me,
Mr. Symington?' '' the lawyer said. ``He should have told us the
truth. He should have told us he was broke.''

<P>
   (Phoenix) - Attorney Michael Man ning charged into his Friday
con frontation with Fife Symington like a boxer at the opening
bell, demanding to know what the former governor knew about his
ill-fated real estate business and when he knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You told me that the real estate depression was not affecting
your properties in 1989 or 1990,'' Man ning said, launching his
attack on the 10th day of Symington's trial in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Manning's indignation made an ac cusation out of the reference
to a sworn statement by Symington, who filed for personal
bankruptcy in 1995 during his second term as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Symington kept his Harvard-culti vated manners as impeccable as
his charcoal-brown suit, parrying deftly in the opening round of a
battle that will resume Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going a little fast for me, Mr. Manning,'' said
Symington, who was not about to let Manning set the pace of the
inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The two have become intense adver saries, clashing twice in
sworn depo sitions.
</P>
<P>
   Manning's lawsuit, filed on behalf of a consortium of six union
pension funds that lent Symington $10 mil lion in 1990, claims that
Symington lied not only to get financing but also to get elected
governor in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Symington flatly denies he sought to deceive anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart of hearts, I know I didn't do anything wrong,''
Syming ton said after court Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Symington, who at 54 has launched a career as an apprentice chef
in Scottsdale, acknowledges errors on his financial statements, but
he says they were the result either of compu tational failures or
his optimistic belief in the soundness of his long-term prospects.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, Rob Shull, helped fend off Friday's assault,
objecting 16 times during Symington's 57 minutes of testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Shull's most common complaint was that Manning was being
argumenta tive. He was particularly indignant when Manning tried to
press Sy mington on an unfavorable appraisal of the Ritz-Carlton,
one of Syming ton's former properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want you to slip away on this one,'' Manning said,
prompting Shull to leap to his feet in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Judge George Nielsen, a veteran of unfailingly even temper,
admonished Manning at one point with patient drollness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's rephrase the question in the usual neutral fashion,''
the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Manning repeatedly tried to pin Symington on his sworn claim
that he believed his business had been thriving until 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Symington said it was only then, a few months after he became
gover nor, that he realized he was being swept away by the riptide
of a Phoenix area real estate recession.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Symington testified, his properties ``were doing
fairly well in a tough market, and I didn't think I was going to
lose them.''
</P>
<P>
   Timing is everything in this trial of Arizona's former chief
executive, convicted in 1997 of federal criminal charges of lying
to lenders.
</P>
<P>
   That conviction was overturned last year on appeal, and
prosecutors are weighing whether to retry the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Symington is con fronting the pension funds,
which have the burden of proof in the bankruptcy trial.
</P>
<P>
   The funds are attempting to prove that they acted reasonably
when they accepted a 1990 financial statement from Symington, who
was seeking the governorship as a successful developer who would
bring his hard-nosed business sense and so phistication to
government.
</P>
<P>
   Symington told the pension funds that he had a net worth of $12
mil lion, based on his share of 16 commercial properties.
</P>
<P>
   Manning claims that Symington erected a gaudy and fraudulent
facade as project after project crum bled under debt.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Manning grilled Syming ton about two appraisals on
the Ritz-Carlton at 24th Street and Camelback Road, Symington's pre
mier development.
</P>
<P>
   In his financial statement to the pension funds, Symington said
the hotel was worth $62.9 million, even though an up-to-date
appraisal had put its value at $57.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Manning says Symington's use of his own appraisals was part of a
much broader pattern of deceit. Symington countered Friday that it
showed nothing more than a difference of opinion.
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't use the lower appraisal ``because I didn't
agree with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I built the project,'' Symington added. ``I felt I was the
better judge of its value.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting afterward with reporters, Symington said he had provided
the pension funds with all the financial information called for
under a previ ous loan commitment. He again insisted that the
pension funds failed to ask a single question about his financial
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't really interested in what was going on,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The pension funds were depending on the loan's collateral, the
down town Phoenix Mercado, which the loan financed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Manning told reporters that the pension funds had a right to
believe that Symington's financial statement was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were the pension funds supposed to ask, `Were you lying to me,
Mr. Symington?' '' the lawyer said. ``He should have told us the
truth. He should have told us he was broke.''

FIRST BRUSH FIRE OF SPRING SPREAD BY HOT, DRY WINDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

(Also moving in the ``a'' national news file.) 
By   ROBERT MONROE

<P>
   Sunland, Calif. _ The first Santa Ana winds of spring fueld a
small brush fire Friday in Sunland, hinting at what promises to be
a severe wildfire season, with rainfall more than three inches
below normal.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the La Nina paradox, however, state and city
water officials said Friday's last measurements of the year of the
Sierra Nevada's snowpack shows there will be ample water supply _
so higher water bills have been staved off.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, a high-wind warning will remain in effect today, with
winds ranging from 35 to 45 mph and gusts reaching 60 mph,
according to the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``By Sunday afternoon, pretty much we'll be back to normal,''
said weather service spokesman Stuart Seto.
</P>
<P>
   Low temperatures today and Sunday will be around 50 degrees. By
Monday, high temperatures should reach the low 80s in the Valley.
Low temperatures will be in the mid to upper 40s.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, 20 mph winds coupled with drying vegetation allowed
the Sunland wildfire to take off at about 10 a.m., charring nearly
5 acres of brush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks lush and green now, but you'll be amazed how quickly
it will dry up with winds like this,'' said Los Angeles city Fire
Marshal Jim Hill said during a news conference to announce brush
clearance inspections starting May 1. ``This could be a very tough
fire season. ... We did not have a lot of rain. It is imperative
that homeowners heed this warning and clear the brush.''
</P>
<P>
   About 130,000 property owners in the city reside in high fire
hazard areas. They face fines of as much as $532 if they do not
clear native brush, weeds and grass within 100 feet of any
buildings and trim brush within 200 feet, the prescribed standard.
</P>
<P>
   The La Nina global weather pattern pushed the storm-generating
jet stream away from Southern California, leaving the region
parched despite several weeks of rain last month. As of Friday,
10.08 inches fell on downtown Los Angeles _ a drop from 13.52
inches, the seasonal average to date.
</P>
<P>
   To the north, Los Angeles water officials reported that heavy
snowfall in February boosted water equivalent depths of snow to
exactly the same height, 43.3 inches, as the historical average.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lucked out,'' said Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power Water Works Engineer Fred Barker. ``If it had carried on the
way it was in December and the first few weeks of January, we were
looking at jumping right on top of the driest year on record.''
</P>
<P>
   State water officials, who also take measurements in the Sierra
Nevada, said the water supply from snowfall was about 95 percent of
average but that Sierra rainfall well above normal boosted runoff
forecasts to 105 percent of average.

UCONN TAKES THE EXPRESS TO REACH THE WOMEN'S FINAL
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Sue Bird is not simply a point guard. She is a
bus driver, the one who knows the lanes and gets her passengers
where they need to go, right on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut sophomore brought her team to the only
destination it had in mind at the beginning of the season, scoring
19 points Friday night in a dominating effort as the Huskies
defeated Penn State, 89-67, in the semifinal of the NCAA women's
basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Huskies will have to play the Lady Vols for the
right to claim their crown, as the two meet in the much-anticipated
final Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee handed UConn its only loss of the season in February,
the only glitch in an almost perfect season for the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Bird left Friday night's game with 1 minute 1 second left,
earning a warm handshake and hug from her coach, Geno Auriemma. He
smiled, knowing she was the difference.
</P>
<P>
   With less than five minutes remaining in Friday night's game,
the Huskies had taken a decisive 14-point lead. There was no doubt.
Not that there ever was with Bird in charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies (35-1) are going to the national championship game
for the first time since 1995, the first and only year they won the
title. That year they capped a perfect season by beating Tennessee
by six points in the final.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies played a near perfect game Friday night, never
trailing. But Penn State did not make it easy for the Huskies,
staying within single digits until late in the second half. When
Swintayla Cash hit a bank shot with six minutes remaining to give
the Huskies a 12-point lead, Connecticut could breathe easily.
</P>
<P>
   With Bird, they could do that all night.
</P>
<P>
   With nine minutes remaining, Bird stood at the top of the court,
dribbling to slow down the game while she collected instructions
from Auriemma, who had been named the national coach of the year by
The Associated Press on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bird was only an honorable mention selection, but her teammates
know her true worth. She called the play and seconds later, Cash
drove to the basket, giving the Huskies a nine-point lead. Bird did
not stop to smile, she had work to do at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't play in the tournament last year; she missed much of
the season, tearing an anterior cruciate ligament after just eight
games. And the Huskies were lost without her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just by watching us this year as compared to last year, you
can see the impact she has had on our team,'' Shea Ralph said
before the game. ``She is one of the main reasons for success this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies gladly accepted the pressure of being the best all
season, and the expectation to reach the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   They had Bird to carry such a burden on her back.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Penn State threatened, Bird simply stared down the
Lions, hitting the critical shots at every important intersection
in the second half. When Penn State was within five points with
less than 12 minutes left, she made an 8-footer; when Penn State
had moved within four points with 14:18 left, she knocked down a
3-pointer of her own.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bird who brought her team into the locker room at
halftime with a 37-28 lead, having scored 11 points and playing all
but one minute.
</P>
<P>
   The score was tied at 8-8 five minutes into the first half, when
the Huskies sophomore Asjha Jones hit a jumper. On the next play,
the sophomore Tamika Williams grabbed the rebound and the Huskies
hit the fast break hard, with Williams racing back down court to
convert the give-and-go layup from Svetlana Abrosimova.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Bird's back-to-back 3-pointers that capped the 10-2
run for the Huskies and broke the tension, if not the game, to give
them an 18-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   When Penn State pulled within five points, Bird calmly answered
the 3-pointer from Penn State's Katrena Carr with another
long-range bomb. Again, the Huskies led by eight.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their previous meeting this season, on Dec. 5 in Orlando,
Fla., when the Huskies had roared to a 19-4 lead, the Lions stayed
within single digits. They twice got to within four points, but
UConn kept the press and Bird kept the distance.
</P>
<P>
   The game figured to focus on the team's point guards _ the
senior Helen Darling was the reason the Lions were in the Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   She had averaged 17 points in the last three NCAA tournament
games for the Lions, including hitting the winning shot in the
Midwest Regional semifinal against Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   But Darling scored no points in the first half Friday night. Her
senior teammate Andrea Garner led the Lions with seven points and
Carr, a sophomore reserve, scored seven points.
</P>
<P>
   For the Huskies, Abrosimova scored a quick eight points, but it
was Bird who made the biggest impact in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   She had averaged 10.9 points and 8.7 assists in UConn's 35
games, but 15.3 points in the last three tournament games. ``That's
who hurt us the most the first time,'' Penn State coach Rene
Portland said. ``You're always going to have Shea and Svet doing
their thing, but Bird really has a peace about her.''
</P>
<P>
   So do the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Without Bird last season, and with four of her freshman
teammates trying to find their chemistry, UConn lacked direction.
``Last year we worked and worked and we never really got anything
done,'' Ralph said before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this year, it's almost like, when you're driving down the
highway and you're just going and you're listening to music and you
have a good time and you look at the speedometer and you're going
90 miles an hour and you're like, `Woah, we were going that fast?'
We're steam-rolling right now.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bird is driving.

DAVEY ORDERS A DOZEN

<P>
   TORONTO _ It was only an exhibition game, but it confirmed
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson's fears. The Dodgers' 10-4 loss to
Toronto also put an end to the discussion about carrying 11 or 12
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be 12 for the first series in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   That came after Orel Hershiser allowed six runs in three
innings. The aid came from long-man Matt Herges, a surprise to be
on the opening-day 25-man roster. Herges allowed four runs in 2
innings, but in this fire drill of a night he did his job in
providing innings and keeping the bullpen fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get innings out of my pen,'' Johnson said.
``Whether it's (Onan) Masaoka or (Alan) Mills, I've given them a
little more work just to be protected. I'd like to have that first
series protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson thought about using one of the Dodgers' young starters _
i.e., Mike Judd, Jeff Williams or Eric Gagne _ but decided it would
be more beneficial to everyone to use the 30-year-old Herges.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what's better, taking one of the young starters and using
them in relief up here or let them stay down and stretch out (their
arms)?'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Once Johnson feels comfortable with 11 pitchers, it's likely
Herges will be sent to Triple-A Albuquerque to close games. And at
that point, outfielder Geronimo Berroa, who accompanied the Dodgers
to Toronto, would have his contract purchased and join the club.
</P>
<P>
   Berroa's addition would give Johnson the right-handed power
hitter off the bench he's seeking. Berroa also offers flexibility
in that he can play left or right field and first base.
</P>
<P>
   A deal between the Dodgers and Berroa is worked out so Berroa
will remain off the roster for the first few games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   __ White feels right: Dodgers center fielder Devon White, who's
shied away from interviews for most of the spring, said he feels
ready for opening day and has no problem batting leadoff.
</P>
<P>
   Without a prototypical leadoff hitter on the team, White's being
asked to fill that role. He's hit .261 with a .306 on-base
percentage in the Grapefruit League, and he took more pitches than
normal. However, White said not to read too much into how he's
approached the spring.
</P>
<P>
   But White has experience hitting first. He batted leadoff for
Toronto when the Blue Jays won back-to-back World Series in the
early `90s. However, in the last three years, White has hit .261
with a .306 on-base percentage in 450 at-bats from the leadoff
spot. He's also scored 60 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leadoff, it's a job,'' White said before the club left
Dodgertown. ``The season may start and I may swing at the first
pitch every time. Who knows? It depends on each pitcher. They're
going to work me differently in spring training and I'm going to
approach the game differently when the season starts, so we'll see
what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: In his first trip to SkyDome since the
November trade, Dodgers right fielder Shawn Green was jeered by the
sparse crowd. An outfield banner read ``$hawn Greed'' and yells of
``Traitor'' echoed throughthe cavernous `Dome. . . . Dodgers
infielder Juan Castro accepted his assignment to Triple-A
Albuquerque and will report with the club Sunday. . . .
Right-hander Antonio Osuna was placed on the 15-day disabled list,
which was expected. He's recovering from surgery performed last
September. He could return in early May. . . . Lefty Pedro Borbon,
who led Dodgers pitchers by appearing in 70 games last season, is
close to signing a two-year contract extension with Toronto.

   MIAMI _ The last time Floridians spoke fiercely about rebellion
and secession, they left the union. Now rebellion is happening
again, as political leaders in Miami-Dade County say they plan to
defy federal authority in the international custody case of Elian
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   But secession, say all manner of people here, has been going on
for a long time. The battle over Elian merely shows how far it has
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country is going to see now what we're all about,''
shouted Jose Ramos, an elderly Cuban American who considers himself
Cuban, period, outside the house where Elian lives in Little
Havana. He is ready to give his life to stop the federal government
from taking Elian away, one of the many exiles in South Florida
whose hatred for Cuban President Fidel Castro defines his past,
present and future.
</P>
<P>
   Such passion is expected at the house, ground zero in the
four-month confrontation between an overwhelming majority of Cuban
exiles here and U.S. government officials who want to return Elian
to his father and to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, when 20 elected officials in Miami-Dade said
they would not allow their police to aid federal authorities, it
proved that the politicians here would choose their own,
independent foreign policy over the rule of law, say legal,
political and immigration experts who have followed the Elian saga.
</P>
<P>
   To many people here, some who cheered and some who shuddered, it
was a declaration of independence for a part of the country that
is, increasingly, a nation apart. People have even begun to greet
each other with: ``Welcome to the Independent Republic of Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a city that is separate,'' said Lisandro Perez, the
director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International
University. ``We now have our own local foreign policy. It shows
how much the Cuban community has viewed the city with its own
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban Americans make up some 800,000 of the county's 2 million
people. Latin Americans make up the overwhelming majority, and
English has faded from homes, offices and stores. But, it is the
Cuban exiles who drive the county's economy, politics and culture,
and it is Cuba's flag, not the United States', in the windows of
shops, on car antennas and on the mural behind the Chevrolet
dealership on Le Jeune Road.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban Americans believe they have been strong-armed by the
government, and that its leaders have no compassion for Elian or
for their view, said Luis Aguilar Leon, Cuba scholar and historian
at the University of Miami. ``They are thinking of justice,'' Leon
said. ``But justice is not only the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for them not to get passionate,'' he said.
``Everyone has a brother, sister or family member who has suffered,
because of a totalitarian regime.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, said political experts, is what drove Miami-Dade Mayor
Alex Penelas to say that he would not use the county's resources to
assist federal officials if they come for the boy, and to say he
would hold Attorney General Janet Reno responsible if blood was
shed.
</P>
<P>
   His language, said both experts on exiles and people on the
street, reminded them of the way Southern governors talked during
the civil rights movement decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Oct. 15, 1996, Penelas executed his solemn oath as Dade
County's mayor to `support, protect and defend the Constitution of
the United States,''' said William P. Harris Jr., a lawyer in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But what Penelas and others did in front of the federal
courthouse Wednesday afternoon reminded him of George Wallace on
the steps of the Alabama state Capitol in Montgomery in 1963, when
``in the face of a federalized force, he violated his oath and
disgraced himself,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still angry,'' he said. ``Everyone refers to Miami as that
`Banana Republic.' First all the corruption we've had over the
years and now this? My God.''
</P>
<P>
   Penelas said he never meant that police would stand by if
violence broke out. ``It's unfortunate that my statements were
interpreted that way,'' he said. What he meant, he said, was that
police would play no role in taking the boy from the home. ``If
they think our swat team is going in there and take him out,
yelling and screaming'' he said, federal officials are mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   But local police often help federal officers in such tense
situations, and in choosing not to let his officers do that,
Penelas, and those mayors who backed him, are siding against an
unpopular but legal process, say experts on police actions and
crowd control.
</P>
<P>
   Penelas described the government's actions as ``provocations''
and ``unjustified threats.'' In Little Havana, exiles applauded
Penelas' words, and took them to mean that he is behind them in
their fight to keep Elian in the freedom of the United States, at
all costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country is the land of laws,'' said Miguel Saavedra,
president of Vigilia Mambisa, an exile group here. ``But not today.
Not with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Castro, a senior research associate at the North-South
Center at the University of Miami, which focuses on immigration and
Cuban issues, also said the unrest echoes ``state and federal
confrontations in the civil rights era. They had the same
elements.''
</P>
<P>
   But like the people on both sides of that issue, ``Cubans are
polarized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of his stand said the myor's comments, and the comments
of others, seemed to excuse disobedience if not invite it. What it
shows, said David Abraham, professor of immigration law at the
University of Miami, is that ``the local political elite said they
feel the laws of the United States do not apply to them, when they
feel otherwise. People who believe in the rule of law are mystified
by this.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't like some of the other things South Florida has
done,'' he said, referring to more than a decade of massive
political corruption, police scandal, a Miami airport that has
become a vehicle to reward political favors, and legendary drug
trafficking _ Miami officials once named a street after a drug
dealer, a mistake they corrected.
</P>
<P>
   But this, said Abraham, ``is the the most defiant position a
public official has taken since the days of Orville Faubus.''
Faubus was Arkansas' governor who defied federal orders to
integrate schools in 1957, leading to violent confrontations in the
streets, and public dismay.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as President Eisenhower found that only an overwhelming
display of force could make clear that the law of land also applied
in Arkansas,'' Abraham said, ``it may regrettably take an
overwhelming display to prove South Florida is part of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, said many Cuban Americans here, they do not mind
if they are seen as a separate country. Not only do they not want
to be part of middle America, they do not care very much what
middle America thinks of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand this country,'' said Marta Santana, who
came to the United States 40 years ago. She was a teacher in Cuba,
then worked at a day care center here. ``Castro is the devil, and
now so is Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miami's national image does matter, to the lenders and
corporate decision makers who would invest in a region where bond
ratings seem to sink with every corruption scandal or sensational
headline.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to look down at them around the country after
this one,'' said Perez, who is Cuban himself. ``It will have a
negative implication to those sitting in middle America.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Cuban Americans want the boy returned, and even some of
those who do want him returned do not approve of the tactics. But
they are shouted down.
</P>
<P>
   Most support the hard-line against the federal government, even
if quietly. ``If we were African American, no one would be
questioning us,'' said Mazaro Menendez, a salesman who came from
Cuba 27 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even as exiles vowed to use any means possible to stop the boy
from being taken, Miami Mayor Joe Carollo said the Cuban community
will not _ even as his own constituents talk of violence _ become
violent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cuban American community has never been involved in
riots,'' he said. ``We have no history of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   If the exiles somehow win, and keep Elian here in defiance of
the law, it would dismay many people here _ the anglos, blacks and
non-Cuban Hispanics, said political experts. ``They would find
someplace else to live,'' said Abraham.

FOLLOW THE STEPS FOR REFORMATTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(ATTN: California Valley Press) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: For reformatting a hard drive, I have been told
that a CD of Windows 95 or 98 is needed, as well as a floppy with a
CD-ROM driver that's loaded first. Is this true? What is your
reformat procedure?
</P>
<P>
   _ Clean Sweep
</P>
<P>
   DEAR CLEAN: First, I prepare a very large pitcher of extra-dry
martinis, because I know it's going to be an extremely long and
frustrating day. In fact, I've found that _ on more than one
occasion _ this approach results in me forgetting why reformatting
seemed like such a good idea to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Nuking your drive is a major undertaking, and you'd better be
prepared. Not only will you be wiping everything off your disk,
you'll have to reinstall Windows, then reload any application
programs, then hope you remembered to back up your data files so
you can stick them back on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   I usually start by making a big, long list of all the programs
I'm going to have to reload, and I make sure I have the
installation CDs or floppies in a safe place that I can find after
two martinis. My work space tends to degenerate into unfathomable
disarray the minute I start one of these jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I start backing up installation files and data that exist
only on my hard drive. This is where a CD burner, a Zip drive or
tape backup comes in handy. In my case, I make a CD with everything
I could possibly need during the reinstallation process. Oh, I know
I'll probably forget something, but at least it's all in one spot.
If I can still find my Sharpie after martini No. 3, I label the CD
and stick it with my other installation materials.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the fun part. You'll be wiping out everything on the
hard drive, which includes the drivers that make your CD drive
work. Without those, you won't be able to reload Windows from the
CD. Luckily, Windows 98's Setup Disk utility (in Add/Remove
Programs in the Control Panel) will make a bootable floppy with
generic CD drivers on it. You'll also need to copy the file
Format.com to the floppy.
</P>
<P>
   Boot with the floppy, and make sure the CD drive is working.
About now, I'd freshen my martini, because there's no turning back.
At the A: prompt, type in Format C: /u and let 'er rip. Say so long
to everything on the drive.
</P>
<P>
   When the format finishes, you'll have a machine that's capable
of almost nothing. You still need to load the operating system,
Windows. Aren't you glad you made sure the CD drive was working?
</P>
<P>
   You'll need the full version of Windows, too, not just the
upgrade. If you didn't get one, your manufacturer may have included
a restoration CD (it's supposed to make things just like they were
when you bought the computer) or some sort of utility that will
build a set of installation floppies.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Windows has finished installing itself, I'm usually
ready for a nice, long nap. Not because of that second pitcher of
martinis, of course. I simply realize that after I get my Internet
and network stuff working again I'll be spending about a day
downloading and installing Windows updates and the latest drivers
for all my hardware.
</P>
<P>
   At long last, it's time to start reloading all my programs and
data. I think that calls for another martini. I know what you're
thinking, but I can quit reformatting any time I want to.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: BENEATH THE SPRING GARDEN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By VERLYN KLINKENBORG  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, April 1:
</P>
<P>
   If you let a leek winter over in the ground _ winter over all
the way till spring _ it grows into a monster, a pale,
thick-necked, grasping Medusa. The leaves will have dwindled to a
few dry rasps. They may even have rotted away. But that
white-haired leek-head, thrust so obdurately crown-downward into
the loam, will not come up without the soil it has annexed over the
winter. Shake it like a chunk of sod, to dislodge the dirt, and the
garden fills with white rootlets and the powerful, lingering odor
of the leek that would not let go. To eat leeks young is a kindness
to them.
</P>
<P>
   A few leeks remained in the ground from last fall, along with a
clump of unbulbed Florence fennel and a broken row of carrots, one
or two of them firm, the rest top-rotted. I had forgotten them, and
the January frost had heaved them. I dug them all up. I also dug up
hickory nuts and old plant labels. The garden fork drove tine-deep,
and the soft ground was a surprise. I had planned to do a little
probing in the warm spring sunshine last weekend, but I ended up
turning over the whole of the upper vegetable garden, laying a clod
on its side and breaking it up with the edge of the fork. Soon I
was in shirtsleeves, reaching down to uproot deadnettles, which
were already crimson with new growth. It was an old relationship
being worked out all over again, the annual weed and the perennial
weeder.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the hard freeze in mid-January, we replaced a
200-foot section of post and rail fence. The posts had rotted, but
the cedar rails were in good condition. They had turned gray over
the years, and a lichen like the discolorations on a whale's back
had taken root on some of them. This is the sort of gift that an
old farmhouse will sometimes give you _ 57 nine-foot cedar rails
that look like something out of a poem by Robert Frost or James
Whitcomb Riley. I laid out raised beds 4{ by 9 feet in the
vegetable garden using some of them, and now that patch of earth
has become a place of definition. At the moment, the ground is
still bare and mounded. It looks as though I had slain and interred
five giants all in a row and not yet erected the markers _ so
fearsome is the early gardener.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday evening, the sun seemed to have come to rest among the
birches beyond the pasture. I stood in its prolonged light and
considered the beds. I was impressed by their symmetry, their
intent. Their geometry exposed the rise in that stretch of the
garden, making the land look as if it were bowing to the southeast.
The illusion of mastery was nearly perfect, except that instead of
controlling a deep vertical column of earth, all I had done was to
box in the top few inches of the earth's surface. A spade blade's
depth beneath the corner of one bed, I knew, there was a rock as
big as a subway grate. I could only hope that I had eradicated the
deadnettles.
</P>
<P>
   The earthworms and microbial life forms commingled as always in
the soil beneath the pathways I had made, making pathways of their
own under the rails, dutiful to their own purposes, inattentive to
any of my superficial doings except when the garden fork appeared
among them. Those creatures are not about to be herded into my
corrals.

 CROWD TURNS OUT FOR UNVEILING OF `SAY HEY' WILLIE MAYS STATUE  &HT;     By STEVE RUBENSTEIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The greatest center fielder in history gazed
upon the 23-ton bronze statue of himself Friday and said something
that Willie Mays does not say often.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scares me,'' Mays said with a smile, and he grabbed the
giant right foot that seemed already halfway to first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too real. When I come to the ballpark, I'm not coming in
this way. I'm going to go in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Mays, the real one, was guest of honor at the ceremony to unveil
the colossal sculpture before the first game at Pac Bell Park. More
than 1,000 guests and fans filled Third Street at the park's front
gate and rose as one to applaud when a giant black velvet curtain
surrounding the statue in front of the ballpark was peeled back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the luckiest man in the world,'' Mays said. ``I don't want
to talk too long because the tears begin to flow.''
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of tears, along with sunshine, autograph
hounds, big shots, limousines, heroes, shutterbugs and a healthy,
uninvited breeze left over from Candlestick Park. The breeze
crashed the party and wafted through the fronds of the 24
ever-incongruous palm trees.
</P>
<P>
   Mays was preceded to the microphone by a half dozen former
Giants, two former managers, one baseball commissioner, one mayor,
two clergymen, the team president, several living legends and any
number of other people who could not have made that catch in 1954
except in their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the living legends had gray hair and some had none. They
clutched the handrail as they gingerly ascended the steps to the
podium, as living legends must eventually do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I'm glad they decided to do this while you were living
and you could hear some of this,'' said Bill Greason, Mays' former
teammate from the Birmingham Barons minor league team. Mays,
sitting in the front row of spectators with a folded sports page
tucked between his legs, laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie, you were the greatest and it was an honor to have
played with you,'' said Bobby Thomson, who hit the home run to win
the 1951 pennant for the then-New York Giants. ``Sitting down
there, you look like you own the world _ and you do, today.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds, an outfielder of some ability, was one of those who
wiped away a tear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie, say hey, Mr. Mays, godfather,'' he said, and he paused
to dab at his eyes. ``You're the greatest athlete I've ever seen in
my life. It's an honor to play in the house named for Willie.''
</P>
<P>
   In return, Mays teased Bonds that he had better plan on hitting
50 home runs this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fence is only 309 feet,'' he said, and he gazed over at
Giants president Peter Magowan. ``If he can't hit 50, get him a pay
cut, Peter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be playing here,'' Mays said in a voice that did
not sound like he was kidding. ``I think I could get 10 or 20 more
home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans, cheering behind the police barricade behind the rows
of dignitaries, clearly thought so, too.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody who came to the microphone, and there seemed to be
dozens, said that Mays was the greatest and that all lesser
ballplayers, Hall of Famers and all-stars were the merest of
mortals by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   There were so many former heroes that the the current ones, the
San Francisco Giants of 2000, were not even sitting in the front
row. They were one row back and they stood en masse when
introduced, like any other bunch of Mays fans.
</P>
<P>
   The chestnuts roasted in the noontime sun. Announcer Lon Simmons
rattled off the one about how God didn't gave Mays a halo because
it would have fallen off when he went after a fly ball. Someone
told how Chronicle sportswriter Bob Stevens once described a
hapless fielder unable to snag a Mays blast _ ``the man who hit it
is the only man who could have caught it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball commissioner Bud Selig recalled watching Mays win a
game with a home run in the 16th inning. Giants president Magowan
recalled watching Mays fire throw after throw to third base from
the outfield, always on target. Giants vice president Larry Baer
recalled taking the bus to Candlestick and watching Mays as a kid.
</P>
<P>
   The statue, by sculptor Will Behrends, shows the gargantuan Mays
gazing westward with his bat in hand, trying to follow the arc of
an imaginary ball that he has just swatted as it sails over Sutro
Tower three miles away. Behrends smiled when Mays said the statue
scared him and said he didn't take it as an insult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I know what he means,'' he said. ``I never did a
self-portrait, so I can't really say.''
</P>
<P>
   All around the intersection of Third and King streets, behind
the rows of seats for dignitaries, ordinary fans waited in the sun
for hours to pay tribute to the great Mays. Workers in hard hats,
still on the job to apply the finishing touches, stood atop the
stadium walls and gazed down to watch. The man welding the neon
sign above the souvenir store put down his torch to listen to the
tributes.
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Williams drove all night from San Luis Obispo, Calif.,
to arrive early enough to claim a prime spot against the barricade.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the palm trees are stupid,'' she said. ``But Willie Mays
walked on water and he still does.''
</P>
<P>
   John Maier, 13, of Grass Valley, Calif., said he cut
eighth-grade science class to attend the ceremony. He was standing
beside his father, Ron, who understands that some things are worth
playing hooky for.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we would have been doing in class is dissecting
worms,''John said. ``This is a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the statue is situated at 24 Willie Mays Plaza, but
nobody seemed to know exactly where that was. A street sign said
that King Street was Willie Mays Plaza. Magowan said it was Willie
Mays Street. Someone from the city said plazas are plazas and
cannot have numbers. Someone else pointed out that the stadium is
on the south side of the street and would therefore have to have an
odd number, not 24. Nobody cared.
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, the invited guests ate a catered box lunch
of garbanzo bean salad and sandwiches from the luxury boxes and put
on their souvenir Willie Mays Plaza hats.
</P>
<P>
   They gazed down on the field, where workers were doing the final
bits of fussing in preparation for last night's first-ever
exhibition game. The outfield fence, which zigs and zags, was the
subject of much discussion. Of late, lesser fielders than Mays have
been pondering how, exactly, to cope with the various caroms and
angles and fence surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Mays is not one of those kind of fielders. Asked how he would
handle such an irregularly shaped fence, he smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had any problem with a ballpark,'' Mays said. ``You
play the hitter, not the ballpark. The ballpark is just there. You
can be playing in the Grand Canyon and if the batter can't hit, you
play shallow.''

EDITORIAL: CIVIC DUTY AND THE CENSUS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, April 1:
</P>
<P>
   Some congressional Republicans are seriously undermining the
2000 census by suggesting that the national headcount, which
officially takes place Saturday, is an invasion of privacy. That
bizarre complaint could discourage the public from participating in
a project that is crucial to the functioning of state and federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   The questions on this year's long census form _ including
questions on household income, plumbing facilities and physical
disabilities _ have been part of the census for decades. The only
new question asks for information on grandparents who are
caregivers for children. In fact, this year's long form is the
shortest one in 60 years. All answers on census forms are kept
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska has suggested in recent days
that people can simply ignore questions on the long form _ which
goes to one out of six American households _ that they find
intrusive. A spokesman for Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader,
has made similarly inappropriate suggestions. Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas has said that people should fill out the forms, but that
if he received a long form, he was not sure he would want to fill
it out either.
</P>
<P>
   These comments are irresponsible. Completing the census form
fully and accurately is not optional; it is a civic duty that is
required by law. Hagel now says that he does not want to encourage
people to break the law, but will introduce legislation to make
most of the questions on the long form voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has spent billions of dollars trying to
produce an accurate count as response rates have continued to
decline with each decennial count. Accuracy is critical because the
census is used to apportion seats in Congress, draw legislative
districts within the states and distribute more than $185 billion
in federal funds. The government uses information from the long
form of the census to allocate money to communities for housing,
school aid, transportation, services for the elderly and the
disabled and scores of other programs. The data are also necessary
to calculate the consumer price index and cost of living increases
in government benefits.
</P>
<P>
   When individuals fail to give complete information about their
households, they risk shortchanging their communities of government
aid that they may be entitled to. That is why many state and local
government officials are working hard to increase census response
rates in their communities. The mindless complaints of some
politicians could well sabotage those efforts.

   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, April 1:
</P>
<P>
   Some of the world's most dedicated human rights activists have
started as campaigners for the environment. Ken Saro-Wiwa's initial
cause, for example, was the devastation that Royal Dutch/Shell's
oil spills inflicted on Ogoni land in Nigeria's delta region. As
the dictatorship fought back, he found himself taking on more
traditional human rights battles _ for the rights of the Ogoni,
against the military's burning of delta villages and its shooting
of protesters and, finally, against the sham judicial process that
led to his execution in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In many countries, environmental activists are finding that the
line between their causes and human rights has blurred. To protect
the environment, they need both the right to speak out and fair
enforcement of the law. Many are enduring the harassment that human
rights activists have long experienced.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known examples are in Russia. The domestic intelligence
service _ the heir to the KGB _ has tried to silence scientists and
naval officers who document the radioactive pollution emitted by
decommissioned nuclear submarines. The service has spent years
harassing Aleksandr Nikitin, a former Soviet submarine captain who
wrote about the problem. Although Nikitin apparently used entirely
public sources and has been acquitted of espionage, he could still
face more prosecutions. His case goes to Russia's supreme court
later this month. Acting President Vladimir Putin has supported the
crackdown on environmentalists, whom he has accused of spying for
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   In other countries, the activities most likely to incur the
wrath of governments or powerful groups are protests aimed at
against large, lucrative projects _ such as oil production in
Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and Ecuador, toxic waste dumping in
Cambodia, logging in Kenya and Mexico and new dam construction in
China and India.
</P>
<P>
   The activists tend to emerge from the same isolated communities
that suffer most from pollution. Typical is Rodolfo Montiel, a
peasant who organized small farmers in rural Guerrero, Mexico,
against the clear-cutting of local forests, which was threatening
their harvests and way of life. In May, he and a bystander were
arrested and charged with weapons possession and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International and the Sierra Club, which have begun a
joint campaign to draw attention to the persecution of
environmentalists, say the two men were tortured into confessing.
The arrests are part of a pattern in Guerrero. Five years ago, 17
unarmed peasants protesting logging were shot by the state's
judicial police. Another member of the peasant organization was
reportedly abducted at gunpoint last month.
</P>
<P>
   The interest and intervention of large environmental
organizations is especially helpful to rural activists, who usually
lack the connections enjoyed by their urban counterparts. What
makes the rural activists particularly vulnerable is that they live
in out-of-the-way places that happen to be rich in the very
resources that governments and powerful interests hope to exploit.
For that reason, they can get in the way of a lot of money. To most
developing nations, the economic promise of forests, mineral
deposits or oil and gas outweighs environmental concerns. Such
projects can also produce a river of graft for government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   European and American groups like Amnesty International and the
Sierra Club can also play an important supporting role. Many of the
oil and gas companies, as well as the big customers for foreign
timber and minerals, are based in the industrialized world. These
companies, in turn, can influence how the governments they work
with treat environmental dissidents. The worldwide opprobrium
heaped on Shell for its failure to help Saro-Wiwa has sensitized
corporations to the public relations costs of silence.
</P>
<P>
   The next test is in Chad, where a consortium led by Exxon Mobil
is about to drill, and Cameroon, where the pipeline will lead.
Amnesty International and the Sierra Club say that several people
who have raised environmental concerns have been threatened and
silenced, even though digging has not yet begun.

IMAGINE _ A BALLPARK FIT FOR BALL
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ I'm so proud. I earned my Croix de Croissant.
<P>
   Years ago, the Giants gave out medals to folks who survived an
extra-inning night game in the Arctic blasts of Candlestick Park,
and the medals were named the Croix de Candlestick.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a different standard of toughness at the new Pac
Bell Park, which the Giants opened last night.
</P>
<P>
   This place is going to take some getting used to for Giants'
fans. The big change: No more Mr. Tough Guy.
</P>
<P>
   Giants' fans always prided themselves on being hardier than
thou. It took extreme loyalty and courage to watch baseball when
your beer froze to your mustache.
</P>
<P>
   At one game last year, I was enormously proud of my teenage son,
who was the only person in the ballpark in short sleeves. Then we
saw a guy with no shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Giants' fans always looked down on other baseball fans as
effete, pampered, wimpy dilettantes. But what now?
</P>
<P>
   Now the Giants fans' have the cushiest, cutest, coziest ballpark
in the big leagues, at least outside of Fenway and Wrigley, and
though last night was a weather aberration, it looks like the
extreme cold and wind are things of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Now anybody can watch a Giants' game.
</P>
<P>
   How will the fans handle the change? Will they brag, ``We're so
tough, in our luxury suite we use the same fork for our salad
 &UR; and  &LR; for our entree''?
</P>
<P>
   And what about the ballplayers? They used to say the old
ballpark gave them a psychological edge, because visiting players
always griped and whined about the wind and weather, while the
Giants didn't, except for Will Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Now? Now the players don't even need ski parkas in the dugout.
They saunter into a (relatively) balmy ballpark, and they dress in
a clubhouse that is big enough to host a polo match with midgets on
Shetland ponies.
</P>
<P>
   Their locker stalls are made of rosewood. Rosewood! Hearing that
news, Babe Ruth snorted beer out his nose.
</P>
<P>
   Each player each sits on a nicely padded folding chair, except
for Barry Bonds, who has an enormous leather recliner at his
cubicle, and it's plugged in, so I assume it vibrates and massages.
</P>
<P>
   ``He bought it,'' shrugged a club exec.
</P>
<P>
   What the hell, if it weren't for Barry, there might not be a new
ballpark. And you have to admire that kind of style. It's pure
Barry.
</P>
<P>
   The dugouts are monstrous, with two rows of benches and about 15
feet of open space between 'em. Apparently the architects,
anticipating everything, figured Barry might want to bring his
lounger down to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe Barry will park his Porsche there.
</P>
<P>
   But few would begrudge Barrisimo his eccentricities. Remember,
before the new ballpark, he was the No. 1 reason people came to see
the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   And he's still a strong No. 2, as long as he hits a couple
dingers into the dinghies every week.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the park is the draw. Forty thousand to watch the
Brewers in a practice game? Watching the Brewers is as exciting as
watching paint dry, if the paint is an interesting color.
</P>
<P>
   By now, you're probably sick of hearing how charming the new
park is, but it's true. Where else in major league baseball can you
watch yachts shagging fly balls?
</P>
<P>
   Boats prowl China Basin just beyond the wall and promenade, and
last night, when a batting practice homer plunked into the drink,
two guys in a 45-foot schooner tried to jockey their two-masted
craft so they could pick up the bobbing souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   Finally one of the guys stripped to his Levi's and dived in, to
hearty cheers.
</P>
<P>
   There will be plenty of souvenirs at the new park, and maybe a
few casualties. The seats are very close to the field, so there is
some fear that screaming foul balls might wind up embedded in fans'
foreheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want fans to be aware they need to pay attention,`` said
Dusty Baker, the Giants' manager.
</P>
<P>
   Better make the games interesting, Dusty.
</P>
<P>
   The seats are so close, fans in the front row are in danger of
being hit in the eye with sunflower seeds spit by the on-deck
batter.
</P>
<P>
   One reason so few fans were hurt by foul balls at Candlestick
was that there were so few fans.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sellouts every night. We're going to start running into
Yogi Berra syndrome, where if you ask someone if they go to Giants
games, they'll reply, ``Nah, nobody goes there anymore, it's always
too crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   It's nutty. The weather is so mellow, the Giants might bring Stu
Miller out of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Stu was the little lefty who gained immortality by being blown
off the mound at Candlestick during the '61 All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants used to require pitchers with ballast, a substantial
caboose. Now ... Calling Stu. It doesn't matter if you're
60-something.
</P>
<P>
   We'll send a yacht for you.

CITY CONTROLLER RECOMMENDS SHUTDOWN OF ANTI_GANG PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By   RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles _ City Controller Rick Tuttle called Friday for a
halt in any further funding of the $10 million anti-gang L.A.
Bridges program, saying it was an ``overly ambitious'' effort that
had been expanded because of political considerations and failed to
achieve its goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that this program is relatively new and that
usually they need three to five years to prove themselves, but we
think action is needed now in the interest of saving taxpayer
dollars,'' Tuttle said at a City Hall news conference where he
released an audit - more than 500 pages long - of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle said he believed the money could be better spent on
after-school tutoring programs.
</P>
<P>
   But some officials urged the city to be cautious about
disbanding the anti-gang program despite Tuttle's recommendation -
which coincidentally came exactly four weeks after Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks ordered the Los Angeles Police Department's
anti-gang CRASH units disbanded citywide as a result of the Rampart
Division corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This strikes me as premature until we get a full evaluation of
the programs,'' Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said. ``It seems to
me he's jumping the gun until we know how effective the programs
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also strikes me that he is calling for an end to the only
anti-gang program we have in the city at a time when we have
disbanded the CRASH units because of Rampart and we have a threat
of gangs growing. I'm not sure we should stop Bridges when the
problem might be with the Community Development Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle also said that if the program is to continue, it should
be scaled down from its present 26 sites to five or 10 so the
programs could be more fully developed, then expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, they were talking about 10 to 15 sites, but it was
expanded to other areas because of the pressures from the City
Council,'' Tuttle said. ``I would have to say this was an overly
ambitious effort and it is better to take action now rather than
wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle's audit was greeted with some skepticism by other city
officials as well.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Hernandez said he wanted to review the Tuttle
audit, but was concerned about stopping all the programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should look at what is working and what isn't before ending
the entire program,'' Hernandez said. ``There are some (areas)
where there have been successes. We should look at those and use
them for the rest of the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Mayor Richard Riordan said he has long been concerned
about the program's operation, but would not comment on Tuttle's
audit until it has been more thoroughly reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. Bridges was funded in 1997 and designed to serve as an
effort to keep young people from joining gangs as well as working
with hard-core gang members to get them to return to school. It did
not begin operations until 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Even with such a new program, Tuttle said there were serious
deficiencies in monitoring the programs and in record-keeping to
track the effectiveness of its efforts. Also, he said there was a
lack of collaboration with either the LAPD or the Los Angeles
Unified School District even though it operated out of local
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the Bridges programs contain many of the important
components needed for an anti-gang program, for the program to
truly address the issues of gangs, it must be refocused to include
the missing elements and management of the program must be
improved,'' the audit said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a significant lack of management attention to the
various sources of information.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle said the program needed to do more than provide
after-school tutoring, counseling and sports activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than after-school activities or even individual
counseling, formalized training in social skills, anger management,
impulse control and conflict resolution are considered to be the
most promising strategies for both gang and delinquency
prevention,'' Tuttle said. ``That's where we should be putting our
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Tuttle noted that one of the key aspects of the program
was to work with neighborhood advisory councils, and only 20
percent of those were operating as intended.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is the absence of an overall anti-gang
strategy, Tuttle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are to continue this program, I would recommend we have
an anti-gang czar to coordinate these programs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Tuttle said he had some concerns over the
management of funds. His office estimated that some $500,000 was
unaccounted for, but officials with the Community Development
Department said the funds were kept track of and can be accounted
for.

SBA HELPS SEND FILMMAKERS TO HOLLYWOOD WITH BACKING
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Glendale, Calif. _ I'm ready for my close-up, Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   In the first deal of its kind, two local filmmakers have
bankrolled their film with taxpayer money through a loan from the
Small Business Administration, rather than seeking studio backing.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, ``Gristle,'' is a comedy about stereotypical
perceptions. It's being made by producers Mychal Wilson and Eugene
Taylor of Los Angeles-based Gristle Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SBA was a way to achieve financing for our film when the
studios wouldn't,'' Wilson said. ``We are already shooting the film
and will wrap up production in a couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   They got the loan approval a couple of months ago but decided to
announce it Friday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The loan was arranged through the SBA's Glendale office, but the
amount is not being disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under federal law, the terms and the amount of the loan will
be kept private,'' said John Tumpak, director of public affairs for
the SBA.
</P>
<P>
   Tumpak described the loan as a ``milestone'' and predicted the
agency would make additional loans to the film industry, which
generates a large number of jobs in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to be very active in making these types of
loans,'' Tumpak said. ``Hopefully, it encourages other filmmakers
to do business with the Small Business Administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that Wilson and Taylor are the first to receive this
kind of assistance because they are the first to ask.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the agency has made loans to entertainment-related
businesses, such as production companies that need equipment and
catering firms that supply food to the various studios, Tumpak
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who also co-produced the 1996 short film ``Spartans,''
said his company is working with the SBA to ``facilitate these
types of loans to help other filmmakers.''
</P>
<P>
   The SBA loan for this movie comes through Valley Bank's main
headquarters in Moreno Valley, Tumpak said.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Glendale, the Los Angeles district office is the
agency's largest, making small-business loans to companies in Los
Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, he said.

FEDERAL AGENCIES RIPPED IN AUDIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``a'' national news file.) 
By   BILL HILLBURG 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Government numbers crunchers told Congress on
Friday that many federal agencies, including the Internal Revenue
Service and the Pentagon, have only a sketchy idea of how they are
handling billions of taxpayer dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Comptroller General David M. Walker, who released the General
Accounting Office's audit of the 1998-99 fiscal year that ended
Sept. 30, said his agency found ``serious deficiencies in the
government's systems, record keeping, documentation and controls''
in financial reports received from 24 major departments.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Walker said, the GAO declined to verify the
reliability of the government's ledgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should be outraged by this,'' said Rep. Stephen Horn,
R-Long Beach, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Government
Management, Information and Technology. He noted that millions of
Americans will be required to have their financial records in order
by the April 15 income tax deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Horn's panel issued its own accounting report card Friday,
giving the government's 24 major agencies an overall grade of
D-plus.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO and Horn's report card gave their highest marks to NASA,
the National Science Foundation, the Social Security
Administration, the General Services Administration and the
departments of Labor and Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Flunking grades were issued to the departments of Defense,
Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, Interior and State, as
well as the Agency for International Development, which handles
foreign aid, and to the Office of Personnel Management.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department and its IRS collection arm were given a
D-minus.
</P>
<P>
   While stressing that the government was in no danger of
financial ruin, Walker said that sloppy bookkeeping had cast doubt
on the accuracy of such benchmark figures as the $1.76 trillion
total federal budget and the current budget surplus of $124
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have consistent information so we don't confuse
people,'' said Walker.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Defense, which accounts for nearly one-fourth
of all government spending, was faulted for not being able to
document or inventory the billions of dollars worth of land,
equipment and buildings under its control.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS was criticized for failing to track income and refunds.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report cited an IRS check of tax returns in 1999 that
turned up $1 billion in fraudulent claims for the earned income tax
credit, which gives relief to low-income workers. But an audit of
the IRS' books turned up no record of whether the agency had paid
out $1 billion in refunds on those claims.
</P>
<P>
   Horn cited another 1999 IRS gaffe in which the agency paid a
$15,000 refund to a man who actually owed the government $350,000
in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Gotbaum, controller of the White House's Office of
Management and Budget, and Assistant Treasury Secretary Donald V.
Hammond admitted that the government's books were in disarray and
both promised improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Gotbaum and Hammond noted that government accounting has
improved since the 1995-96 fiscal year, when only six of 24
departments compiled reports deemed accurate by the GAO.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998-99, they said, 13 department reports were judged to be
accurate.

Rugby Road in Brooklyn. Their target was Jose Sierra, suspected of
selling heroin from the lobby of his building. They pursued Sierra
aggressively. Two weeks ago, a raid on Sierra's apartment turned up
heroin worth $120. It was, police officials said, an effective
example of Operation Condor, the city's massive narcotics sweep
that has resulted in more than 21,000 arrests. But victory came
with a price. Many there say that the aggressive tactics used
against Sierra and others have too often swept up innocent
bystanders and too often increased neighborhood tensions. By David

FEDERAL AGENCIES RIPPED IN AUDIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``a'' national news file.) 
By   BILL HILLBURG 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Government numbers crunchers told Congress on
Friday that many federal agencies, including the Internal Revenue
Service and the Pentagon, have only a sketchy idea of how they are
handling billions of taxpayer dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Comptroller General David M. Walker, who released the General
Accounting Office's audit of the 1998-99 fiscal year that ended
Sept. 30, said his agency found ``serious deficiencies in the
government's systems, record keeping, documentation and controls''
in financial reports received from 24 major departments.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Walker said, the GAO declined to verify the
reliability of the government's ledgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should be outraged by this,'' said Rep. Stephen Horn,
R-Long Beach, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Government
Management, Information and Technology. He noted that millions of
Americans will be required to have their financial records in order
by the April 15 income tax deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Horn's panel issued its own accounting report card Friday,
giving the government's 24 major agencies an overall grade of
D-plus.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO and Horn's report card gave their highest marks to NASA,
the National Science Foundation, the Social Security
Administration, the General Services Administration and the
departments of Labor and Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Flunking grades were issued to the departments of Defense,
Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, Interior and State, as
well as the Agency for International Development, which handles
foreign aid, and to the Office of Personnel Management.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department and its IRS collection arm were given a
D-minus.
</P>
<P>
   While stressing that the government was in no danger of
financial ruin, Walker said that sloppy bookkeeping had cast doubt
on the accuracy of such benchmark figures as the $1.76 trillion
total federal budget and the current budget surplus of $124
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have consistent information so we don't confuse
people,'' said Walker.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Defense, which accounts for nearly one-fourth
of all government spending, was faulted for not being able to
document or inventory the billions of dollars worth of land,
equipment and buildings under its control.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS was criticized for failing to track income and refunds.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report cited an IRS check of tax returns in 1999 that
turned up $1 billion in fraudulent claims for the earned income tax
credit, which gives relief to low-income workers. But an audit of
the IRS' books turned up no record of whether the agency had paid
out $1 billion in refunds on those claims.
</P>
<P>
   Horn cited another 1999 IRS gaffe in which the agency paid a
$15,000 refund to a man who actually owed the government $350,000
in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Gotbaum, controller of the White House's Office of
Management and Budget, and Assistant Treasury Secretary Donald V.
Hammond admitted that the government's books were in disarray and
both promised improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Gotbaum and Hammond noted that government accounting has
improved since the 1995-96 fiscal year, when only six of 24
departments compiled reports deemed accurate by the GAO.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998-99, they said, 13 department reports were judged to be
accurate.

WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF, THE KNICKS MOVE ON
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ There were exasperating moments
when the whip-quick Michael Dickerson left Knicks coach Jeff Van
Gundy slinging his fist into the scorer's table.
</P>
<P>
   As each arching jumper by the Grizzlies' phenom splashed into
the net, the threat of embarrassment for the Knicks increased and
the potential for a road-trip collapse loomed greater. But these
were the Grizzlies. They created their own undoing Friday night.
After Dickerson helped the Grizzlies pull within one point with two
minutes left, a turnover and a technical foul opened the way for
Patrick Ewing to end the tension.
</P>
<P>
   He was not a factor for most of the night, but Ewing hit two
free throws and a runner in the closing 1 minute 3 seconds to put
the Knicks in position for an 89-83 sigh of relief at General
Motors Place. Instead of having their trip ruined, the Knicks
improved to 3-1 on their West Coast swing, ensuring them of a
winning trip with the Lakers left to play. Instead of having their
spirits crushed, the Knicks (45-27) are within a half-game of the
Miami Heat at the top of the Atlantic Division.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were led by Latrell Sprewell's 23 points and 24 from
Allan Houston. Marcus Camby added 18 off the bench, and Ewing
finished with 11 points. With the Knicks' frontcourt struggling,
the Grizzlies had a chance. Dickerson, who scored 28 points, gave
them that chance. The Knicks led by nine points early in the fourth
quarter, but a 13-point binge by Dickerson pulled the game tighter.
Dickerson sent the Grizzlies on an 8-2 run to cut the Knicks' lead
to 73-70 with 6:59 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson was everywhere. He put his body on Sprewell, forced
him to turn into traffic on his drive and forced him into a
turnover. The play gave Dickerson a chance to tie the game, but his
pull-up 3-pointer on the fast break cracked off the rim with 4:30
left. Two minutes later, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, who had been held
silent by Sprewell, lined up a 21-footer and pulled the Grizzlies
within 81-80. From there, Ewing took over and saved face for the
Knicks with two free throws with 1:03 remaining and a runner with
43 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy did not issue any warnings about a letdown, not even a
cautionary tale concerning the Knicks' pattern of giving the
league's lowliest team (19-52) a reprieve from its depressing
existence.
</P>
<P>
   But midway through the third quarter, the Knicks' frontcourt of
Ewing and Larry Johnson was 2 for 11 and both Houston and Sprewell
were getting burned by Dickerson. They were keeping up with the
error-prone Grizzlies _ and took a 61-56 lead when a turnover by
Abdur-Rahim gave Houston a dunk on the other end _ but every
possession was a struggle in the fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that saved the Knicks was the Grizzlies'
ineptitude. More of their own making than forced by good defense,
the Grizzlies' had 16 turnovers through three quarters. Despite
outshooting the Knicks, 47 percent to 43.9, the Grizzlies were
down, 65-58.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't exactly an emphatic stand. The early indications
were the Knicks were not mentally prepared for the game. Eight
minutes into the game, a distressed Van Gundy called a timeout
after his team fell behind, 15-6. The only starter on the floor who
showed up was Sprewell. He was focused on his defense of
Abdur-Rahim and hit three of his first four shots. Houston,
Johnson, Ewing and Charlie Ward combined to go 0 for 13.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Knicks did in Seattle, they started the recovery
process. It came with a few frustrations _ which was revealed in
the technical fouls that Camby and Chris Childs picked up _ but the
Knicks went on a 22-9 run.

2 KILLED TRYING TO ROB OFFICERS, AUTHORITIES SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR and JULIAN BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two men were killed in Brooklyn Friday night by
undercover narcotics police officers who said the men were trying
to rob them, using what turned out to be toy guns, the authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the shootings in Bushwick were sketchy, but
senior police officials said that two plainclothes officers
arrested three men on charges of selling marijuana in an apartment
on Cooper Street about 9:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after making the arrests, the two officers were
approached on Cooper Street by five men who pulled out what
appeared to be handguns. The men took a gold chain from one
officer, and a cell phone and a wallet the other, the authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Ahlee Jr., the Police Department's chief of
detectives, said Friday night that during the attempted robbery,
``a struggle ensued, during which both officers fired their
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The police did not release the names of the officers or the men
who were killed. The shootings occurred outside a building at 36
Cooper Street, near Bushwick Avenue, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   One man was taken to Woodhull Hospital and pronounced dead at
9:45 p.m., officials said. The other man died at the scene, the
police said. The other three men in the group that approached the
police fled, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday night, senior police commanders held
up the toy guns, which were wrapped in black plastic, to emphasize
how realistic they looked in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look very real, believe me,'' Detective John Giamarino, a
police spokesman, said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the officers were conducting drug sweeps as
part of Operation Condor, started by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to
combat low-level drug crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Some public officials and police commanders have criticized the
operation, which is financed by special overtime funds, for
focusing too many resources on minor crimes and heightening
tensions between the police and members of minority groups. Earlier
this week, police officials said that the operation had resulted in
more than 21,000 arrests _ three-quarters of them for minor
offenses _ since it began in January.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal shootings were the third and fourth in the last five
weeks by members of plainclothes New York City narcotics units,
which have come under scrutiny since the fatal shooting two weeks
ago of Patrick Dorismond, an unarmed security guard, who was killed
in a scuffle outside a Manhattan bar.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a decline in the number of people killed by New York
police officers over the last two years, the recent shootings have
raised questions about Police Department policies.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Police Commissioner Howard Safir announced plans to
review the department's policy on when officers can unholster their
guns. The announcement came the day after an undercover narcotics
detective was reassigned because he chased a drug suspect through a
crowded schoolyard with his gun drawn.
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, a plainclothes officer shot another unarmed man,
Malcolm Ferguson, in Soundview, two blocks from the doorway where
an unarmed West African immigrant, Amadou Diallo, was killed by
officers from the Street Crime Unit in a hail of 41 bullets.

CELTICS LOSE AGAIN AT BUZZER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Tony Battie in his face and flirting dangerously close to a
foul, Washington guard Mitch Richmond gathered himself for one last
jump shot. He knew time was running out. He knew Battie was a solid
shot-blocker. So when he saw the slightest of openings, he let
loose a high-arcing, 19-footer. The ball sailed over outstretched
arms and safely through the net, leaving just two-10ths of a second
on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   There would not be time for Boston to get another shot off. As a
result, the Wizards went home with a stunning 104-102 victory
Friday night at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it left my hands, it felt pretty good,'' said Richmond.
``It's great to get that here because a couple times I've been on
the bad end of that leprechaun.''
</P>
<P>
   As coach Rick Pitino gathered his team for one last timeout, all
the Celtics could do was shake their heads. Try as they might, the
Boston players could not shake the image of yet another last-second
buzzer-beater from their minds.
</P>
<P>
   They did not have the time or energy to point fingers or pick on
the weak, as they had during second-half timeouts of their
embarrassing loss to Orlando last Tuesday. Although Pitino had
threatened suspensions after the team's graceless display in
Florida, the players convinced their coach not to take such drastic
action.
</P>
<P>
   So Friday night, the Celtics were united in their disbelief and
disappointment as they squandered a 16-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another difficult loss for us,'' said Pitino. ``We played
the play at the end of the game very well. Tony Battie did an
outstanding job switching out, challenging the shot, getting as
high as he could. As has happened to us so many times in recent
weeks, the difficult shot has gone in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the fourth or fifth game this year where
someone's made a shot at the buzzer. So we can't hang our heads
about it. That's the game of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult right now because it's back-to-back games
and sooner or later discouragement sets in, and we can't let that
happen. If we finish up the season playing as hard as we have been
playing and not get discouraged, it will be a credit to their
character.''
</P>
<P>
   The defeat extended Boston's losing streak to six games and
sustained its frustration. The Celtics have lost three games in
four weeks at home on the last possession, and now trail Orlando by
6 1/2 games for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the last time Boston played on the parquet floor,
Minnesota's Anthony Peeler sank a buzzer-beater from almost the
same spot as Richmond's last-second winner. Emotionally, the
Celtics have struggled since a double-overtime loss at Philadelphia
a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Washington may be holding down last place in the Atlantic
Division, but Boston still could not reverse its fortunes. Lately,
all the luck has rested with the Celtics' opponents. Postgame in a
virtually empty locker room, the few players who were left pondered
the Celtics' recent run of bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have no answers, no formulas, no reasons,'' said
Antoine Walker, who scored a team-high 21 points. ``(Richmond) just
hit a tough shot. We've just got to keep playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics had a excellent chance of coming out on the positive
side Friday night, but let their early 16-point cushion slip away.
</P>
<P>
   The good feeling that existed during the early portion of the
contest disappeared. As the fourth quarter got under way, the
Celtics were greeted by a smattering of boos. Dana Barros and
Calbert Cheaney got hot from the perimeter to keep Boston out front
early, but Washington was also making shots from the outside. A
3-pointer by Tracy Murray with 7:15 left produced the first tie of
the contest at 91-91. Barros answered with a 3-pointer, but the
Wizards would not go away.
</P>
<P>
   When Barros had a jumper blocked and Walker missed a wide-open
3-pointer after the ball bounced into his hands, the Wizards took
the lead for the first time, 95-94, on their next possession with
an Aaron Williams dunk with 5:53 left. The two teams battled back
and fourth to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 100-99, Juwan Howard's jump shot put the Wizards ahead
with less than a minute to play. Kenny Anderson missed a shot that
would have returned the lead to the Celtics, but they lucked out on
the other end when Don Reid made only one of two free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Vitaly Potapenko, who failed to make a last-second shot against
Philadelphia that would have sent the game to triple overtime, came
through with a jumper that tied it at 102-102 with 14 seconds left.
Then, Richmond, who scored a game-high 30 points, did his damage.
</P>
<P>
   But it was hard to feel sorry for the Celtics. They finished the
first quarter ahead, 34-21. Boston built on its lead at the start
of the second. A driving layup by Walker gave the home team a
16-point advantage (48-32) for the third time with 7:04 left in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into halftime, Washington mounted a comeback behind its
defense. The visitors closed the gap to 5 points (62-57) at
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, Boston's lead dwindled to 1 after UConn
alum Richard Hamilton sank a 16-foot jump shot. And from there, the
Celtics traveled down an all-too-familiar path to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to use bad luck, but come on, our luck is not
great right now,'' said Anderson. ``We've got 10 more games. We
can't tank it. We've got to keep playing hard and staying together,
work out things for next year. We've got to try to finish out the
season strong.''

LAKERS KEEP IVERSON QUIET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Allen Iverson might yet defeat Shaquille O'Neal in
the NBA's scoring race, but he's lagging significantly in the
head-to-head matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson was again a nonfactor against the Los Angeles Lakers.
O'Neal was again unstoppable against the Philadelphia 76ers, and
the Lakers are again looking like a team that can't be beat.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal bullied the Sixers for 37 points and 14 rebounds and
abused them with a season-high-tying eight blocked shots, leading
the Lakers to a 100-88 victory Friday before a star-studded 18,997
fans at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers swept the season series from Philadelphia, extended
their winning streak to eight games and, more importantly, knocked
their magic number for clinching the league's best record down to
three. Any combination of Lakers victories and/or Portland losses
adding up to three will ensure the Lakers home-court advantage
throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's nonstop assault at both ends of the court was enough to
make the Sixers see stars (and there were plenty, from Oscar winner
Michael Caine to Oscar nominee Michael Clark Duncan to Pamela
Anderson to Sylvester Stallone).
</P>
<P>
   Iverson entered the game just tenths of a point ahead of O'Neal
in the scoring race, but he barely got half of his average, scoring
15 points on 6-of-20 shooting. That, despite Kobe Bryant getting
into early foul trouble that limited his time defending Iverson.
Bryant also settled for a quiet offensive night, scoring just 10
points on 4-of-12 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper picked up the slack with 16 points and the Lakers got
additional help from A.C. Green (11 points, eight rebounds) and
Rick Fox (13 points).
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers won their 13th in a row at home and overall have won
27 of their last 28 games. They also improved to 28-3 against the
Eastern Conference, with one game left to play. If they beat the
New York Knicks on Sunday, the Lakers will post the best winning
percentage (.900) by a Western Conference team against the East in
NBA history.
</P>
<P>
   Although they never surrendered the lead after the opening
minutes of the game, the Lakers had difficulty putting the Sixers
away until the opening minutes of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite 13 turnovers, Bryant's early foul trouble and a 15-point
burst from Kukoc, the Lakers took a 51-46 lead into halftime. They
owed much of it to O'Neal's defense, which produced six blocked
shots in the half, and the Lakers held the Sixers to 42.9 percent
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc, alternately guarded by Rice and Fox, made 7 of 11 shots
in the half and posed much more of a problem than Iverson (eight
points, 3 for 11).
</P>
<P>
   When the Lakers pulled out an 87-84 victory at Philadelphia in
February, Kukoc had played only one game with his new teammates,
having just been acquired from Chicago. But the former Jackson
pupil has become acclimated since then and was a key part of their
recent seven-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're a different team,'' Jackson said. ``Obviously
they're a lanky, longer team with him out there. Offensively they
have another option to go to. He's a good playmaker, he's a scorer
. . . and a very good shooter, so you have to play on him, and he
can post up.
</P>
<P>
   ``So there's a variety of ways they can use him and I think it
aids their offense. Defensively, George (Lynch) is a real fine
player. I'm sure they're waiting to get him back off the (injured)
list because he's a gooddefender. . . . The combinatoin of those
two guys coming back . . . will make them a better team in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant picked up two quick fouls guarding Iverson and played
just four minutes in the first quarter. He didn't score until
midway through the second, but finished the half with eight points.
</P>
<P>
   Rice also got into early foul trouble against Kukoc and Fox came
off the bench to make all four of his shots for nine points.

USC RIGHT ON SCHEDULE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC conducted its first official scrimmage Friday
evening, although it was the second-string players who played most
of the key roles.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans were without six players _ including starting wide
receivers Kareem Kelly and Marcell Allmond and tailback Sultan
McCullough _ who were preparing for today's Centennial Invitational
track meet at USC.
</P>
<P>
   That gave several other skill players a chance, and walk-on wide
receiver Matt Nickels made the most of his opportunity, with three
receptions for 63 yards in the 50-play scrimmage at Howard Jones
Field. Fullback Chad Pierson scored the only touchdown on a 47-yard
run.
</P>
<P>
   Kicker David Bell made two of five field goals, converting from
40 and 39 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a lot of our guys, so it didn't go the way we
wanted,'' said quarterback Carson Palmer. ``At times we looked good
and at times shaky.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer completed four of nine passes for 28 yards and Mike Van
Raaphorst completed nine of 16 passes for 104 yards. Tailback
Malaefou MacKenzie had 25 yards in eight carries; Pierson finished
with 52 yards in two carries.
</P>
<P>
   `` The intention today was to give guys an opportunity,'' USC
coach Paul Hackett said. ``Matt Nickels made a move today for a
scholarship. I feel we're about where I thought we'd be at the
halfway mark. Now we have to make a move.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans had eight penalties, three less than in last week's
controlled scrimmage. Offensive lineman Brent McCaffrey sprained
his ankle during the scrimmage and his status next week is
questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Shamsud-Din Abdul-Shaheed, who hurt his shoulder
earlier in the week, will undergo surgery on Tuesday and miss the
remainder of spring practice. It's also likely offensive lineman
Lucais MacKay will skip the rest of practice to concentrate on
track.

HOPING FOR HEALTHY SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Angels returned to Anaheim Friday, scoring a 6-4
victory over the Padres in 10 innings in their one dress rehearsal
at home before they open the season Monday at Edison Field against
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   They came with a healthy attitude and, for the most part,
healthy bodies. That's a change on both counts from last season,
which will be remembered as much for injuries and clubhouse
backbiting as for the last-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels embark on this season relatively healthy. They'll
have the starting lineup intact, a far cry from last season when
Gary DiSarcina, Mo Vaughn, Tim Salmon and Jim Edmonds missed
considerable time due to injuries. In all, the Angels used the
disabled list 18 times.
</P>
<P>
   Other than injuries to pitchers Ramon Ortiz and Jarrod Washburn,
who are expected back within two weeks, the Angels are the picture
of health.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has a chance when it's healthy,'' said DiSarcina,
who missed half the season after he was hit a fungo bat and
suffered a broken bone in his hand. ``We had three or four everyday
players out of the lineup. Last year we were beaten up and I think
it showed from time to time with our body language.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, with 26 players on the roster, have only one more
move to make by Sunday to get down to the major-league limit for
opening day.
</P>
<P>
   The first decision the Angels must make is how many pitchers to
carry since they expect to get Ortiz back in less than two weeks.
The games Friday and Saturday with the Padres may help Scioscia and
his staff make those decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still some decisions to be made,'' he said. ``We'll
have some pretty high energy coaches meeting. Do we go with 11
(pitchers) and for how long. Who's going to help us now? It's been
a competitive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach State catcher Bryan Kennedy has emerged from an early
season slump to lift his batting average and older brother Adam,
ticketed for Triple-A with the Cardinals, was dealt to the Angels
just over a week ago in the Jim Edmonds trade. He'll open the
season Monday at second base and in the No. 2 slot in the batting
order.

BRUINS ROLL PAST CSUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The rowdies among the 1,062 in attendance called
UCLA's Ed Ratledge ``Shaggy,'' after the cartoon character. They
called Cameron Mount ``Headband'' after what he wore.
</P>
<P>
   A more appropriate moniker for either would be ``Matador
Killer.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men's volleyball players combined for 41 kills to help
fourth-ranked Bruins avoid a season sweep and beat No. 11 Cal State
Northridge 7-15, 15-3, 15-1, 15-12 in a Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation match Friday at Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (22-3, 12-3) lost in four games at the Wooden Center
on Feb. 17 for just the third time in 42 matches with the Matadors
(9-13, 5-11).
</P>
<P>
   Ratledge, who bears a resemblence to the Casey Kasem-voiced
character with his straight brown hair and goatee, had 19 kills
Friday. In the Feb. 17 match, he was the only one who hit the ball,
getting a career-best 46 kills.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you do with the hair I've been bestowed with?''
Ratledge said. ``I'm too lazy to shave. I like Shaggy. It's better
than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Ratledge said, if he wanted to, he could shave his
head, but then he would look like Bull Shannon from ``Night
Court.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the razzing that helped Ratledge but rather the small
Northridge block. Ratledge stands 6-foot-8 and often faced 6-3 John
Baxter or 6-2 Junior Mosones.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I like to hit at a small block,'' Ratledge said.
``I'm at an advantage.''|
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not as big as they are,'' Baxter said. ``Don't know if
that was the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helped Mount, a 6-8 freshman who had a team-high and
career-best 22 kills. He, too, heard it from the crowd, but that
wasn't make or break for him, either. In fact, Mount has been
climbing back after spending two years on his Mormon Mission.
</P>
<P>
   He said when he came back he felt strong, as if he had never
left. But two months in, he suddenly lost the ability and has been
battling back ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, now I'm out of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Al Scates hopes so, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cameron has been getting better. He's starting to play like we
knew he could,'' Scates said. ``He's starting to put it together.
His jump is getting better. He's getting more explosive. He's
hitting over the block. They moved Eckhard (Walter, CSUN's 6-10
hitter) on him and it didn't seem to bother him.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter led everyone with 23 kills, but Northridge didn't get
similar output from anyone else. Mosones was next with nine kills.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Burnham added 17 kills for UCLA.

GALAXY DEFENDER REGAINS SPOT IN LINEUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Joey Franchino followed D.C. United's Ben
Olsen like an annoying gnat last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy defender hounded and harassed United's U.S. national
team striker. The frustration evident on Olsen's face was also felt
by the rest of United, as the Galaxy routed the defending MLS
champions 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   For Franchino, it was just another step on the new path he has
forged for himself. But it also sent a message to United; Franchino
was on the bench when United defeated the Galaxy 2-0 last November
in Foxboro to claim its third MLS title in four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I sat there in Massachusetts and we lost, it was an
awful, awful feeling,'' said Franchino, preparing for tonight's
game with New England at the Rose Bowl. ``Starting last week
against D.C., I felt I had a lot to prove and we had a lot to
prove. We gave it to them pretty good, like we should have
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Franchino speak now, it's as if his career is
reborn.
</P>
<P>
   The Damien High School graduate enjoyed a lot of success as a
rookie in 1998, taking the starting left back position from Greg
Vanney. But in 1999, Vanney earned his job back from Franchino
after a rigorous postseason workout program. Franchino took the
demotion hard, allowing it to affect his personal life and training
habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough to watch those guys play everyday and not be out
there last year,'' Franchino said. ``But it was my own fault; I
didn't prepare myself. I didn't come in with the right attitude a
professional is supposed to have.''
</P>
<P>
   After the MLS championship, Franchino recommitted himself,
similar to the way Vanney had. He put soccer first and everything
else second.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Vanney occupying the middle defense with Robin Fraser,
Franchino is back in the picture at left back, starting the first
two games for the Galaxy this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to be a professional on and off the field, and it
started by making right choices,'' Franchino said. ``I'm in a
situation now, personally and professionally, that allows me to
feel and be more confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchino said his fitness was the first thing he worked on when
the season ended. He is also thinking more clearly after moving
into a new apartment in Huntington Beach, where he can unwind
without distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``My head is clear and my perception of the game and everything
around me is totally different,'' Franchino said. ``I'm having fun,
I'm smiling and we're winning games.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid said Franchino improved his
understanding of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a much better awareness, which means he's reading the
game much better, offensively and defensively,'' said Schmid. ``And
his positioning is much better. He has a better idea of what to do
with his first touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's also more relaxed. He's learned when he gets the ball and
things get tight and busy he doesn't have to fight through it. He's
learned to play away from trouble, reorganize and start again.''
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Danny Pena said he always knew Franchino was capable
of more, but it was up to Franchino to make the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``His overall game is night and day from last year,'' Pena said.
``But Joey's success and coming a long way has nothing to do with
anybody but himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one said, `Joey you have to do this.' He went out and did
what he did because he knows he has a future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was either now or never for him. If you look at his first
year when he took Vanney's job, he knew what that feeling was like.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came in here this year, he didn't care who's job he
was taking, but he was taking someone's job.'' &QL;

TEAM TURMOIL ROUTS KINGS TO END HOME SKID, CLINCHES PLAYOFF BERTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If it was safe to assume the Sonics had enough
frustration bottled to fill a winery, then the Sacramento Kings
left KeyArena feeling a little stomped.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, the Sonics opened up a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   What spilled out was a concentrated attack, and the Sonics
doused the Kings with a 123-108 victory _ their first win in two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the threat of big-time changes from Sonics coach
Paul Westphal if the team didn't show a better effort were heeded.
Not only did the Sonics snap a five-game home losing streak, they
clinched a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   And in a grander scheme, the Sonics moved to within a half-game
of the Kings, who hold the seventh seed in the Western Conference
playoff standings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the by-products of their first home win since beating
Vancouver March 16 didn't seem to matter as much as how the Sonics
performed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out and played hard,'' Westphal said. ``We played
together, hit the boards, moved the ball, moved ourselves, and it
was just a beautiful thing. We like to play that way. Sometimes we
get a little off track ... but the energy was there.''
</P>
<P>
   From start to finish. From end to end. From the top man to the
12th man. From those who weren't part of Westphal's wrath to those
who felt it immensely.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gary Payton guided the Sonics with a 35-point,
15-assist, six-steal performance, all eyes were on power forward
Vin Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Baker was the star of an unflattering film session used Thursday
to point out his weaknesses. Friday night, he received adulation
for best performance in a supporting role. Baker finished with 15
points and 14 rebounds _ his 16th double-double this season.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in 28 games that Baker had a double-digit
rebound performance.
</P>
<P>
   Baker obviously was not concerned with scoring. He concentrated
on rebounding and defense _ two areas of concern for Westphal.
There were at least two occasions when Baker planted himself under
the basket and forced the officials to whistle the Kings for a
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thing was not getting caught up in what was being said, but
how I was going to come out and help us win,'' said Baker, who
played 30 minutes. ``I understood defense and rebounding were going
to be more important than scoring. That's what we re-emphasized
(Thursday) in practice and talked about before the game.''
</P>
<P>
   When Baker fouled out with 2:43 left in the fourth quarter, he
did so to an ovation. Westphal even waved his arms, gesturing so
the crowd would get louder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played with high energy, he was going after shots to block,
he was rebounding,'' Westphal said. ``I was very happy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker may have been too overzealous because he played mostly in
foul trouble. He picked up his fifth foul with 9:40 left in the
game when he pushed off to grab a rebound. The Sonics led 101-81 at
that point, and Baker was doing what had been prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal's coaching style allows for players to make mistakes as
long as the miscues are born out of aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vin didn't want to let himself down or his teammates down,''
center Horace Grant said. ``He went out there and played great
basketball. When he took his first foul, when he didn't let
(Corliss Williamson) lay the ball up, I knew he was ready. He had a
bounce in his step. I'd say he left it on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics played with so much more pizzazz that Payton,
normally a nuts-and-bolts player, threw a pass between his legs
just before halftime. Jelani McCoy caught the assist and flipped in
a layup that put the Sonics ahead 68-49.
</P>
<P>
   They held a 69-49 advantage at halftime. It was the most points
the Sonics scored in a half this season. The team's final point
total was the second-highest next to a 127-91 rout of Orlando here
Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics led by as many as 23 points, and their advantage
never slipped below 15 points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst team to play is a team in turmoil,'' Sacramento's
Chris Webber said. ``It's almost like they look forward to games
because there's no pressure. What can get worse? When you're
playing like that, you have the wind at your back. We just have to
credit them for coming out and playing well while resolving
whatever issues they had.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time they beat a playoff-bound team since
Feb. 28 at Charlotte. Sacramento also was the first winning team
the Sonics dispatched at KeyArena since Phoenix played here Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   It came at perhaps the best possible time.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics are now 1-2 against the Kings with a chance to even
the season series when they meet April 18 _ a day before the
regular-season finale. If the Sonics can even the series with the
Kings, forcing a tie-breaker situation could mean the difference
between the seventh and eighth seeds.
</P>
<P>
   The situation could have been much uglier heading into a game at
Portland Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   To simply say the Sonics had more bounce in their step would be
an understatement. They stomped around KeyArena, playing
aggressively on defense and going after rebounds as if paychecks
were attached to them.
</P>
<P>
   That ignited the team's offense, which operated mostly in
transition to manufacture easy baskets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't compare this to winning a championship, but it's up
there,'' Grant said. ``Getting off that skid and guys sharing the
ball and guys coming off the bench doing a fantastic job was great.
It was one of the biggest wins of the season for us. It's like
putting an ingredient in the pot to make it sweet again.''

SHAQ STARS AGAIN FOR LAKERS; IVERSON SILENCED
</HEADLINE>
 ...WRITETHROUGH (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Allen Iverson might yet trump Shaquille O'Neal in
the NBA's scoring race, but in their last face-to-face meeting of
the season, he couldn't even see the basket.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers chased Iverson, harassed him and occasionally tackled
him when he dared fly toward the Staples Center rims, and in the
final tally, O'Neal got more blocked shots (eight) than Iverson got
field goals (six) Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's 37 points pulled him ahead of Iverson in the scoring
race, and pulled the defensive-minded Lakers past the Philadelphia
76ers 100-88 before 18,997 fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq dominated,'' coach Phil Jackson said after the Lakers'
eighth consecutive win. ``It took us a while to figure out how to
initiate our offense and get the ball to him at the best angle, but
once we did, he got it going.''
</P>
<P>
   And going, and going. O'Neal hit 17 of 28 shots and added 14
rebounds and five assists to his blocked-shot barrage, which
matched his season-high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to come out and be very active,'' O'Neal said.
``That team, they have a dangerous midrange game, so we kind of
wanted to either let them shoot the jumper or bring them all the
way. They brought them all the way to me, and I was just trying to
catch them all.''
</P>
<P>
   In the big-picture race, the Lakers knocked their magic number
for clinching the league's best record to three. Any combination of
Lakers victories and Portland losses adding up to three will ensure
the Lakers home-court advantage throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In the other race, O'Neal pushed his scoring average to 29.1
points, and Iverson _ who settled for 15 points on 6-of-20 shooting
_ slipped to No. 2, at 28.9 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq did a great job having them change up their shots,'' said
Ron Harper. ``He had a great game again tonight. He's for sure
carrying this basketball team and it's good to see. He keeps going
out and the way that he plays, it just feeds our whole team, I
think.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a night the Lakers needed O'Neal's best, because their
second and third options were nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant got in early foul trouble against Iverson and
struggled to a 10-point, 4-of-12, four-turnover night. Glen Rice,
returning from an illness, had his own foul trouble trying to
contain Toni Kukoc and finished with eight points in 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Harper picked up the slack, scoring 16 points, and the Lakers
got plenty of support from A.C. Green (11 points, nine rebounds)
and Rick Fox, who scored 13 points and helped contain Kukoc.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc's 19 points and Matt Geiger's 20 kept the Sixers in
striking range until the fourth quarter, but the Lakers' shutdown
of Iverson kept Philadelphia at bay.
</P>
<P>
   When they weren't blocking his shots, they were knocking him
down _ O'Neal and Harper each picked up flagrant fouls defending
against Iverson fast-break layup attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the game,'' Harper said. ``We just ain't giving up any
easy shots. We're trying to go up there and keep playing a
hard-nosed game. (The officials) made some good calls tonight and
they made some bad calls tonight, so we just keep playing.''

HATRED OF CASTRO COLORS DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The picture on their signs is of a little boy, but the
image seared on their souls is that of someone much older, a man
whose graying beard and military fatigues might as well be a pair
of horns and a tail.
</P>
<P>
   To most of the men, women, and children in the Cuban-American
community in South Florida, Fidel Castro is nothing less than the
devil. And there's no way to fully understand the extraordinary
events that have been unfolding here for more than four months
without grasping this fact.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, it helps explain why members of the Cuban
exile community insist _ contrary to many psychological studies,
common practice in other custody cases, and most other people's
instincts _ that it serves a 6-year-old boy's ``best interests'' to
remain severed from a father who, by all accounts, was loving and
devoted.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't with how Juan Miguel Gonzalez may treat his
son, but where he continues to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what the judges say, what the government
says, what anyone says. If we send Elian back to his father, we
will be sending an innocent child to a place ruled by the worst of
the worst there can be,'' explained Jose Barja, a 50-year-old
retailer who left Cuba in 1980 the same way Elian did, on a raft.
``We will be sending him to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to overstate the extent to which that belief shapes
the thinking and behavior of Barja and the other Cuban exiles who
stand vigil every day outside the simple, one-story stucco house in
which Elian has lived with his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, and
other relatives since fishermen found the boy off the Florida coast
last November.
</P>
<P>
   There certainly are many Cuban-Americans who have either put
their pasts behind them or don't hold such hard-line opinions of
their homeland and its communist ruler. But many, if not most, of
the exiles endured genuine hardships when they lived in Cuba,
despise the totalitarianism of the Castro regime, and sometimes
risked their lives to escape it and create new lives in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   A new life is what they want for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   To them, whatever psychic or developmental problems the boy may
sustain from the international tug of war over his fate pale
compared with the benefits he would derive from an upbringing in
the United States. These exiles' view of Castro is so viscerally,
intensely negative that many fear for the boy's safety if he
returns home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will hurt him, kill him, something like that,'' said
Doris Gonzalez, a cosmetologist who is not related to Elian. All
around the woman, who was interviewed outside Lazaro Gonzalez's
home, other Cuban-Americans of all ages shook their heads and
cheered in agreement. ``Sending anyone on purpose to the devil is
evil, and we are not evil,'' a teenage boy shouted.
</P>
<P>
   It is in this context that the boy's personal well-being has
been subsumed. In between their obviously heartfelt expressions of
care for Elian, the Cuban-Americans here frequently reveal their
broader agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Many do that by hesitating, or even refusing to answer, when
asked how they would feel if they still lived in Cuba and couldn't
retain custody of their own children. And their political leaders
have often been explicit about their resolve to achieve a victory,
this time, over their most reviled enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This boy cannot become a trophy for Fidel,'' Jorge Mas Santos,
who heads the Cuban American National Foundation, said when he
first learned that the US government intended to return Elian to
his father. But in their zeal to deprive Castro of his prize _ and
the Cuban leader has clearly indicated that he views Elian as one _
the exile community in Florida appears to risk turning the boy into
a prize for them.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, and probably more significant in the long term, the
intensity about Castro that has colored almost every aspect of the
Elian drama has also revealed a chasm between the section of South
Florida where Cuban-Americans, their families, and their supporters
dominate the culture and the politics, and the rest of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Polls everywhere else show a lopsided majority of Americans
believe that Cuba is an awful place to live, but that Elian
Gonzalez's father should get his son back. And politicians around
the nation strongly disagree with President Clinton on a host of
issues, but don't question his authority to carry out the duties of
his office.
</P>
<P>
   So it was stunning that the mayors of two dozen municipalities
in and around Miami this week not only declared that they will
refuse to send in their police forces if federal authorities
request help to gain custody of Elian, but essentially warned that
the administration would be responsible for inciting violence if it
tried to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how it's playing in Peoria . . . but I would
suspect Miami doesn't look like it belongs to the legal system and
the cultural system of the rest of the country throughout this
whole saga,'' said Bernard Perlmutter, director of the Children and
Youth Law Clinic at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not casting aspersions on any immigrants,'' he added,
``but the way it's played out makes it seem like we're an island
cut off from the rest of the United States and its deeply ingrained
legal traditions, simply because of how passionately a group of
people here feel about Fidel Castro.''

<P>
   Imagine a medical study in which researchers are tracking the
progress of HIV in 415 heterosexual American couples. One of the
partners is already infected. The doctors do not tell the
uninfected partner that the other has the virus. After receiving
intensive instruction on how to prevent transmission, and access to
free condoms, the couples are followed for more than two years.
Anti-viral drugs are withheld. When the study ends, 90 more people
are HIV infected.
</P>
<P>
   This is no idle scenario. While the study described above was
conducted mainly by Americans, the setting was rural Uganda. The
results of the study, which began in 1994 and ended in 1998, were
published last week by The New England Journal of Medicine. Even
before last week, many doctors have asked how such studies in the
developing world could be justified on moral grounds.
</P>
<P>
   It could be argued that the Uganda research, part of a larger
study of sexually transmitted diseases among 15,127 people, was an
opportunity for scientists to observe the progress and spread of a
deadly disease so they could better know how to prevent it in the
future. Withholding treatment, too, might offer the chance to study
when best to intervene. Still, how could American researchers stand
by silently while their subjects contracted the virus? How could
they simply watch as a potentially fatal infection took its natural
course?
</P>
<P>
   The editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Marcia
Angell, raised these questions in an editorial accompanying the
article. Saying that such a study could not have been ethically
conducted in the United States, she believes that it could not be
justified based upon its major research finding: that the more
virus a person carries the more likely he or she is to infect a
sexual partner. The conclusion is of little use to the Africans,
who have no access to therapy. It is more valuable to the developed
world.
</P>
<P>
   Even this finding was hardly surprising. Studies with similar
results involving monkey viruses related to HIV will soon be
published. While imperfect, such animal models can be substituted
when human studies raise moral concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In defense of the study, its leader, Dr. Thomas Quinn of Johns
Hopkins University, said that the research met a ``high ethical
standard.'' Ugandan authorities, he said, insisted that researchers
not inform study subjects that their partners had HIV; only the
infected person could do that. The study was ethical, Quinn said,
``because it provided the best medical care possible in remote
regions of rural Africa.'' The subjects with syphilis and
gonorrhea, which are easily treated, were given antibiotics. Johns
Hopkins approved the research, which was not designed for
therapeutic intervention against the AIDS virus, Quinn said. In
rural Uganda, he contended, there is no way to monitor the
anti-viral drugs, which can be toxic.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge about the natural history of a disease is the
underpinning of all medical decision-making, and serves as the
yardstick with which to measure the risks and benefits of
intervention. Sometimes a refined picture of a disease's history
has invalidated clinical practices based on apparently reasonable
assumptions. Questions still persist about AIDS treatment,
particularly therapy given early in the disease when the immune
system is intact. The assumption that AIDS researchers like myself
make is that it is best to treat early and hard, but this is not
yet proven. Drugs used too early might make patients resistant
later when they need treatment more.
</P>
<P>
   An example of this is found in cancer medicine, my specialty. I
examined a 62-year-old man who had enlarged lymph nodes in his
neck, underarms and groin. A biopsy showed a nonaggressive
lymphoma. He was shocked because he had no symptoms. After studying
laboratory tests, I advised him that treatment was not clearly
required at this stage of the illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have cancer and you are not going to treat me?'''' he asked
in disbelief. ``This is not some kind of experiment, is it?''
</P>
<P>
   For many years, the conventional wisdom had been to treat
lymphoma early. But in the 1970s, studies found that immediate
treatment for this kind of lymphoma was not always in the patient's
best interests because it neither extended survival nor improved
quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   Other disorders have now been shown to benefit from early
treatment. Initially, physicians had scant information on hepatitis
C, and many concluded that the hepatitis C virus was relatively
innocuous, because it seemed to damage the liver minimally. Few
advised their patients about the risk of sexual transmission;
therapy was not recommended. Recent studies show that early,
aggressive anti-viral therapy can protect the liver and sometimes
eradicate the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for medical data has included extremes in which humans
were treated as subhuman. Some of the most accurate information
about tissue damage and death due to exposure to cold comes from
Nazi experiments on concentration camp inmates. The myriad
manifestations of syphilis were meticulously charted in the
infamous Tuskegee study, in which black men were not treated with
penicillin so that researchers could continue collecting results.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the abominable Tuskegee trials and the
study in Uganda is that anti-HIV drugs were unavailable to rural
Ugandans. Treatment would also not be routinely provided after the
research ended. The absence of such drugs was consistent with the
status quo. Some would argue that although Uganda lacked the
resources to monitor drug safety in remote areas, all the subjects
in a clinical research study deserve to benefit fully from their
participation in it.
</P>
<P>
   If information were available showing that the Ugandans were of
early-stage infection, and not in clear need of drugs, a moral
argument could be better made to justify the failure to offer
anti-viral treatment. But these data are absent. ``I wish such
T-cell data could be gotten in rural Africa,'' Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   The issues here go well beyond this particular study and HIV.
Scientists are rapidly identifying disease-causing genes and new
microbes. The thirst for data on the natural history of an illness
need not divert researchers from moral standards. Medical
scientists can design studies that keep the developing world from
turning into a laboratory for experiments that they would not
perform in their own clinics.

   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan is among the most powerful men in
the world. As chairman of the Federal Reserve, he can alter the
course of the economy by moving interest rates up and down. His
pronouncements can send shudders through markets around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it seems as Greenspan tries, with little success so far,
to cool off an economy that is threatening to overheat and impose a
degree of temperance on Wall Street's long-running party.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just Greenspan whose clout is in question. Given that
companies, consumers and investors have proven largely impervious
to a series of rate hikes by the Fed, economists are wondering
whether monetary policy still works, or at least whether it works
the same way it used to.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has pushed interest rates up five times since June. In
the meantime, the economy has continued thundering along at a pace
well above what most economists think is sustainable over the long
run without generating inflation. The government reported last week
that the economy grew at a 7.3 percent annual rate in the last
quarter of 1999, its fastest pace in 16 years, and all the signs
are that growth has moderated only slightly so far in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although stock prices have taken to gyrating wildly, and the
high-flying technology stocks in the Nasdaq index have been hit
hard, the trend on Wall Street has remained upward. And long-term
interest rates have not risen nearly as much as would be expected
when the Fed is driving up the official short-term rates it
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates take time to filter through the economy,
and their full effect may not be felt until later this year. But
the economy and the markets are clearly absorbing the Fed's rate
hikes with a somewhat perplexing equanimity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monetary policy usually works with a lag of six to nine
months, so you shouldn't really expect the rate increases that
occurred starting in mid-1999 to have a noticeable impact on the
economy before the second quarter of this year,'' said L. Douglas
Lee of Economics from Washington, a consulting firm. ``Having said
that, the economy is not as sensitive to interest rate increases as
it used to be. This makes it tougher for the Fed to slow things
down by raising interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   In textbooks, monetary policy sounds pretty simple. Fed
officials make a judgment about how fast the economy can grow
without igniting inflation, based on the growth of the working
population and improvements in productivity. (Over the last few
years those estimates have risen to nearly 4 percent, from just
over 2 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   When growth exceeds that rate over a sustained period, the Fed
drives up the short-term interest rates it controls. Banks then
charge more for loans. The bond market pushes up corporate
borrowing rates. Stock prices come under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   With mortgages and auto loans more expensive, and people feeling
less wealthy, consumers buy fewer houses and cars. With their costs
rising and sales slowing, companies might choose to close a plant,
or not to open a new one. Jobs become less plentiful. The economy
slows and inflation fades.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, it is more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, although growth rates are well above what almost
anyone thinks is sustainable over the long run, there is almost no
inflation. Moreover, the economy and the markets are changing in
ways that tend to dampen the effect of rising rates.
</P>
<P>
   Take mortgages. Rates on traditional fixed-rate mortgages have
shot up over the last year. But homebuyers have learned to maintain
their purchasing power by shifting into adjustable rate mortgages,
which initially carry lower monthly payments. Lee said that at the
beginning of 1999, while rates were quite low, only about 10
percent of homebuyers were choosing adjustable mortgages. By the
end of last year 30 percent of homebuyers were choosing
adjustables. As a result, home sales, a key driver of economic
growth, have kept running at a brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, much of the economic growth in recent years has come
from advances in technology, and technology companies carry
relatively little debt compared with their ``old economy'' cousins
in capital-intensive fields like manufacturing. Companies with
little debt are less sensitive to rising rates than those with big
debt loads, and are therefore less likely to cut back as the Fed
tightens policy.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between old- and new-economy companies is just
one reason the financial markets have not reacted much to the Fed's
tighter monetary policy. Another is psychological: investors have
become so conditioned to Greenspan keeping the economy on an even
keel that they are concentrating not on the pain he is seeking to
inflict on them through rate increases but on the presumed outcome
of his efforts _ an economy that continues growing steadily with
little inflation. Greenspan is in some ways a victim of his own
success.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same phenomenon is at work in the bond market. Because
the government is running huge budget surpluses, the Treasury is
paying off the national debt. In doing so, the government is
creating a shortage of Treasury bonds, driving up the price of
those bonds and driving down the interest rate they carry. In
effect, the Treasury and the Fed are working at cross purposes.
</P>
<P>
   One result has been a call for the Fed to reexamine the tools it
uses. If the key to bringing the economy's growth down to a
sustainable level is reining in the stock market, as Greenspan
says, then perhaps he should consider aiming his fire directly at
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, pressure is mounting on Greenspan to tighten the
rules on buying stocks with borrowed money. But Greenspan has
repeatedly replied that such a move could not be counted on to have
any effect on stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   So the Fed will no doubt continue using its imperfect though not
impotent interest rate tool. And Greenspan may find that he has to
raise rates further, and in bigger increments, than he would
prefer.

anyone thinks is sustainable over the long run, there is almost no
inflation. Moreover, the economy and the markets are changing in
ways that tend to dampen the effect of rising rates.
</P>
<P>
   Take mortgages. Rates on traditional fixed-rate mortgages have
shot up over the last year. But homebuyers have learned to maintain
their purchasing power by shifting into adjustable rate mortgages,
which initially carry lower monthly payments. Lee said that at the
beginning of 1999, while rates were quite low, only about 10
percent of homebuyers were choosing adjustable mortgages. By the
end of last year 30 percent of homebuyers were choosing
adjustables. As a result, home sales, a key driver of economic
growth, have kept running at a brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, much of the economic growth in recent years has come
from advances in technology, and technology companies carry
relatively little debt compared with their ``old economy'' cousins
in capital-intensive fields like manufacturing. Companies with
little debt are less sensitive to rising rates than those with big
debt loads, and are therefore less likely to cut back as the Fed
tightens policy.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between old- and new-economy companies is just
one reason the financial markets have not reacted much to the Fed's
tighter monetary policy. Another is psychological: investors have
become so conditioned to Greenspan keeping the economy on an even
keel that they are concentrating not on the pain he is seeking to
inflict on them through rate increases but on the presumed outcome
of his efforts _ an economy that continues growing steadily with
little inflation. Greenspan is in some ways a victim of his own
success.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same phenomenon is at work in the bond market. Because
the government is running huge budget surpluses, the Treasury is
paying off the national debt. In doing so, the government is
creating a shortage of Treasury bonds, driving up the price of
those bonds and driving down the interest rate they carry. In
effect, the Treasury and the Fed are working at cross purposes.
</P>
<P>
   One result has been a call for the Fed to reexamine the tools it
uses. If the key to bringing the economy's growth down to a
sustainable level is reining in the stock market, as Greenspan
says, then perhaps he should consider aiming his fire directly at
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, pressure is mounting on Greenspan to tighten the
rules on buying stocks with borrowed money. But Greenspan has
repeatedly replied that such a move could not be counted on to have
any effect on stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   So the Fed will no doubt continue using its imperfect though not
impotent interest rate tool. And Greenspan may find that he has to
raise rates further, and in bigger increments, than he would
prefer.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ With a clickety-click and a Zen Buddhist gong
punctuating the ceremony, some of the people most associated with
the dizzying acceleration of the culture ushered in slowness as the
new frontier. They activated the prototype of The Clock of the Long
Now, the tool designed to measure the next 10,000 years and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hours are an arbitrary artifact of our culture,'' said Danny
Hillis, the clock's inventor and the scientist who pioneered the
concept of parallel computers that is now the basis of most
supercomputers. ``The chance of people using hours 10,000 years
from now is probably pretty low.''
</P>
<P>
   Its spiraling pendulum now slowly twisting, the prototype, an
exquisite 9-foot-tall object that first began keeping time
welcoming that millennial New Year's Eve, has been called the
world's slowest-moving computer. Constructed of brass and monel, a
nickel and copper alloy, the clock slightly resembles a futuristic
jukebox that computes using mechanics instead of electronic
circuitry to calculate extremely slow increments of time. The
prototype _ which will travel to the London Science Museum this
summer _ tracks the moon's position and phase, local rising and
setting times of sun and moon, equinoxes, solstices and the
Gregorian calendar up to 10,000 years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Nahum, project director of ``The Making of the Modern
World,'' the exhibit on the history of technology in London, called
the clock ``an example of sublime technology,'' not only because of
its ingenious mechanics but also because of its ``moral
reflection.''
</P>
<P>
   After three years in a Sausalito machine shop, the prototype
made its public debut recently at the TED Conference, the annual
powwow for the New Economy's power elite in Monterey. Part
latter-day ``magic box,'' as John Harrison's 18th-century
longitude-tracking chronometer was called, part conceptual art, the
clock has become the cause celebre of a heady cadre of Bay Area
thinkers and futurists, among them Esther Dyson, the author;
Douglas G. Carlston, the co-founder of Broderbund software; Kevin
Kelly, founding editor of Wired, and Stewart Brand, creator of The
Whole Earth catalog and the early online community the Well. Ever
the phrase-coiner, Brand calls the clock ``a patience machine'' and
``a steam engine for the information age.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with his cohorts, Brand started The Long Now Foundation
(``long now'' is a reference to deep time coined by the British
musician Brian Eno) to raise money for the project, which is to
include a separate digital linguistic archive with the Book of
Genesis in a thousand languages. The long-term plan is to build an
80- to 90-foot version of the clock and ensconce it among the
bristle-cone-pine forested limestone cliffs of White Pine County,
Nev., literally the middle of nowhere. The foundation has already
bought 186 acres adjoining Great Basin National Park. The idea is
to do for thinking about time what photographs of Earth from space
did for thinking about the environment, to ``reframe human
endeavor,'' Brand said, ``not with a thesis but a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's quite a thing. Its fastest dial moves once a day; the
slowest, once every 10,000 years and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   As an artifact projected to be accurate to within one day every
20,000 years, the clock may be seen as a grandiose atonement for
the sins of Internet time, or perhaps the ultimate boy-toy. The
prototype, now sitting at the foundation's headquarters in The
Presidio, an old general store building with creaking stairs and
lumpy plaster, breaks new technical ground.
</P>
<P>
   Its most riveting feature may be the ``Equation of Time'' cam,
which looks like a sculptured torso but is actually a mathematical
calculation rendered in three-dimensional form. It measures the
26,000-year precession of the equinoxes, Hillis said, accounting
precisely for elliptical eccentricities in the Earth's orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The most heavenly looking element is the face, a rotating black
sphere that charts the paths of the stars, one of the oldest forms
of telling time. A measuring device called a rete traces the stars'
positions over millennia. (For instance, 13,000 years from now,
Vega will be where Polaris is _ in the center of the clock's star
field.)
</P>
<P>
   In designing his antidote to civilization's ``pathologically
short attention span,'' as the Long Now literature puts it, Hillis
(who once made a computer out of Tinkertoys) has tried to learn
from the mistakes of previous long-range messages like the Phaistos
disc unearthed in Crete in 1908, which features 241 symbols in an
ancient form of Greek that predates Homer. Instead, he looked to
Big Ben, the work of an inspired amateur named C.B. Denison, and
places like New College, Oxford, where a 19th-century
reconstruction of the main hall used 14th-century oak trees planted
in anticipation of a day hundreds of years in the future when the
beams might need replacing.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial philosophical conceit of the clock may be
that it was deliberately designed to require human winding, an idea
meant to foster the idea of responsibility. How it would be wound
and by whom has yet to be determined. Maybe a ritual, like
Stairmasters, offered Brand.
</P>
<P>
   To Dr. Gregory Benford, a professor of physics at the University
of California at Irvine and author of ``Deep Time: How Humanity
Communicates Across Millennia'' (Avon, 1999), the clock is noble
but flawed. ``It's too pretty,'' he said. ``The first biker gang to
come along is going to trash this thing. If they made it rugged and
ugly, it might last.''
</P>
<P>
   At the foundation's offices in the Presidio, a 22-pound tungsten
pendulum bob lay on a table _ the ultimate geek paperweight. Donors
of $50,000 or more can get one of their very own with an unusual
set of instructions: Care and maintenance of your pendulum bob
mostly involves preventing people from dropping it on their toes.
With proper care, it should outlast your civilization.
</P>
<P>
   In a profound sense, the clock, a jewel-like gesture toward the
infinite, reflects deep anxiety about time in an increasingly
whirlwindish culture. ``It's about the coming of age of the kids
who were going to save the world,'' Benford observed. ``And like
all deep-time monoliths, it's a mirror.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1980, a race riot in Miami confronted Janet Reno
with the first crisis of her public life. As state attorney of
Miami-Dade County, Reno had failed to win the convictions of four
white police officers charged with the beating death of a black
insurance salesman. In the streets below her office window, an
angry mob chanted, ``Reno! Reno! Reno!''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, the specter of another public disturbance in
her hometown has shaped Reno's response to the escalating Elian
Gonzalez immigration drama. In a series of emotional and personal
remarks last week, U.S. Attorney General Reno appealed to Miami's
Cuban-American community to peacefully accept the return of
6-year-old Elian to his Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case has been heartbreaking for everybody involved,''
Reno said. ``But we believe that the law is clear. Elian should be
reunited with his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1980 riots, Reno has always been cautious in assessing
and responding to a potential confrontation. She has kept her own
counsel (one friend said Reno ``uses three words when five would be
all right''), and been criticized for it. In 1993, for example,
during the long standoff at Waco, Texas, which began just weeks
after she was sworn in as attorney general, Reno said very little
publicly and is still considered by some to be hiding the truth of
that fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   As Reno grapples with the Elian case, she is again being
criticized for her deliberate approach to an emotionally and
politically charged case and is even being blamed for worsening the
conflict. This time, however, she is being uncharacteristically
talkative.
</P>
<P>
   Her friends and associates say she is convinced that
communication with her former neighbors in Miami. They also say
that the Elian case has been especially difficult for her because
it is roiling the city where she was born, grew up and served for
15 years as an immensely popular state attorney. She is also
convinced it is the best way to ensure that the international
tug-of-war over a small boy does not end in ugliness.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, relatives of Elian said they would not turn the boy
over to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, even if he comes for a
visit, and suggested that they may not hand him over to the
authorities, even if they lose their custody case in court. The
lawyers also questioned the father's fitness as a parent.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials have said they would revoke the boy's
right to remain in the United States on Tuesday unless his
great-uncle signs an agreement to hand Elian over, peacefully and
painlessly, if the relatives lose their custody case after legal
appeals are exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's concern over events in the community intensified last
week, her friends say, after Mayor Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade
County said that local police authorities would not help the
federal government remove Elian from Miami. The remarks were viewed
by some as an invitation to civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of the case, most immigration and
international law experts have criticized the attorney general for
not moving quickly enough to return Elian to his father. Jan Ting,
a former assistant commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said that it was ``an abject act of
spinelessness'' that the Justice Department has continued to engage
in lengthy negotiations with Elian's Miami relatives over the
conditions of the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every immigration authority I know of outside of Dade County,
Florida, agrees that the administration had legal authority to
return Elian to his father as soon as they confirmed the father's
identity and fitness,'' said Ting, who is a professor of law at
Temple University's Deasley School of Law. ``Ironically, the local
officials may be right in saying that President Clinton and
Attorney General Reno are responsible for any civil disorder in
Miami, not because of their action but because of their inaction.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand Reno's handling of this matter, one must look to
her long public career in Miami, where she presided over _ and
survived _ race riots, crime waves, drug cartels, massive influxes
of immigrants and brazen acts of political and judicial corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though this is an international and national issue, the
fact of the matter is all politics are local, and this is a local
issue and she's very sensitive to that,'' said Jeffrey Weiner, a
Miami defense lawyer who has known Reno for 26 years. ``Had this
been handled by an attorney general who was not from South Florida,
it would probably have ended a long time ago. She really felt the
pain of the riots here. I think it has contributed to her
insistence that this play out in the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Reno refuses to speculate about Miami's response to
Elian's departure _ ``I don't do what-ifs,'' she said _ friends say
her comments were intended to quell the community's intense anger.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's negotiations occurred at the home of Elian's Miami
relatives, which was often surrounded by a human chain of angry
Cuban-Americans who believe that the U.S. government is plotting to
drug Elian to expedite his swift return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, however, has thus far remained patient. When she was asked
about her reaction to last week's ABC interview with Elian, who
insisted that he did not want to return to Cuba, she replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people understand a 6-year-old. And I can
remember, I loved to go to my grandmother's house. She had such a
wonderful house, and she cooked us biscuits just right, and she
loved us. And she took us to the movies, and she got us French
vanilla ice cream. And she read to us, and she taught us to play
cards. She was a wonderful lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it came Sunday afternoon, and I'd run around behind the
house and hide because I didn't want to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said it is easy for her to understand why Elian wishes to
remain with his great-uncle in the United States. ``I think they
are his own feelings,'' she said. ``They were certainly my feelings
when I ran behind the house and cried and didn't want to go home.''

over to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, even if he comes for a
visit, and suggested that they may not hand him over to the
authorities, even if they lose their custody case in court. The
lawyers also questioned the father's fitness as a parent.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials have said they would revoke the boy's
right to remain in the United States on Tuesday unless his
great-uncle signs an agreement to hand Elian over, peacefully and
painlessly, if the relatives lose their custody case after legal
appeals are exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's concern over events in the community intensified last
week, her friends say, after Mayor Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade
County said that local police authorities would not help the
federal government remove Elian from Miami. The remarks were viewed
by some as an invitation to civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of the case, most immigration and
international law experts have criticized the attorney general for
not moving quickly enough to return Elian to his father. Jan Ting,
a former assistant commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said that it was ``an abject act of
spinelessness'' that the Justice Department has continued to engage
in lengthy negotiations with Elian's Miami relatives over the
conditions of the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every immigration authority I know of outside of Dade County,
Florida, agrees that the administration had legal authority to
return Elian to his father as soon as they confirmed the father's
identity and fitness,'' said Ting, who is a professor of law at
Temple University's Deasley School of Law. ``Ironically, the local
officials may be right in saying that President Clinton and
Attorney General Reno are responsible for any civil disorder in
Miami, not because of their action but because of their inaction.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand Reno's handling of this matter, one must look to
her long public career in Miami, where she presided over _ and
survived _ race riots, crime waves, drug cartels, massive influxes
of immigrants and brazen acts of political and judicial corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though this is an international and national issue, the
fact of the matter is all politics are local, and this is a local
issue and she's very sensitive to that,'' said Jeffrey Weiner, a
Miami defense lawyer who has known Reno for 26 years. ``Had this
been handled by an attorney general who was not from South Florida,
it would probably have ended a long time ago. She really felt the
pain of the riots here. I think it has contributed to her
insistence that this play out in the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Reno refuses to speculate about Miami's response to
Elian's departure _ ``I don't do what-ifs,'' she said _ friends say
her comments were intended to quell the community's intense anger.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's negotiations occurred at the home of Elian's Miami
relatives, which was often surrounded by a human chain of angry
Cuban-Americans who believe that the U.S. government is plotting to
drug Elian to expedite his swift return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, however, has thus far remained patient. When she was asked
about her reaction to last week's ABC interview with Elian, who
insisted that he did not want to return to Cuba, she replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people understand a 6-year-old. And I can
remember, I loved to go to my grandmother's house. She had such a
wonderful house, and she cooked us biscuits just right, and she
loved us. And she took us to the movies, and she got us French
vanilla ice cream. And she read to us, and she taught us to play
cards. She was a wonderful lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it came Sunday afternoon, and I'd run around behind the
house and hide because I didn't want to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said it is easy for her to understand why Elian wishes to
remain with his great-uncle in the United States. ``I think they
are his own feelings,'' she said. ``They were certainly my feelings
when I ran behind the house and cried and didn't want to go home.''

   ROME _ The true nuttiness of papal coverage hit me in the Old
City of Jerusalem, when members of the Vatican press corps
following the pope's historic pilgrimage to the Holy Land were
standing tensely outside a mosque behind a wall of Israeli police
officers, waiting for John Paul II to end his meeting with the
mufti of Jerusalem and pray at the Western Wall, Judaism's most
sacred place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a Lutheran! I finally found a Lutheran!'' my German
colleague, the correspondent for the Axel-Springer newspaper chain,
shouted exultantly. A first-rate reporter who closely monitors the
pope's moods and fading health with binoculars, a handheld
television set and a tape recorder equipped with a tiny video
camera, Andreas Englisch explained that his editors in Berlin were
constantly pressing him to find a local German angle to even the
most extraordinary moments of John Paul II's pontificate.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, traveling with the pope is a little like
covering the White House or a presidential campaign: long bus
rides, early wake-up calls, bunker camaraderie, cell phones,
laptops and an obsessive thirst for advance copies of his speeches
(homilies, in church parlance).
</P>
<P>
   But Vatican reporters, unlike their political colleagues, spend
a lot of time in church _ and are gently encouraged to spend even
more. On Sunday nights during a trip, a priest says Mass at a hotel
room for reporters who had to work through the pope's Mass earlier
in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Political reporters hit the road carrying their bible, the
Almanac of American Politics. Vatican reporters carry the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps to the envy of colleagues who spent the last five
months listening to Sen. John McCain, the pope isn't running for
anything and we never interview him.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, 79 and now very frail, rarely comes to the back of his
chartered plane to chat with reporters anymore. The only time he
has done it in the last two years was on the way to Mexico City and
St. Louis, Mo. Weak, his speech slurred, the pope grimly noted the
global triumph of unfettered American-style capitalism. ``For
better or worse, there is only one superpower left,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, like the Kremlin, has little sense of public
accountability. That means sparse disclosure of even basic
information about the pope's health, Vatican finances or shifts in
Curia policy. Spinning, an art form perfected by American political
advisers to shape reporters' coverage, is also limited. For
example, on trips, the Vatican spokesman, Dr. Joaquin
Navarro-Valls, will occasionally pop up after a Mass to brief the
press pack in three languages. (``The Holy Father was deeply moved,
but I did not see him weep, no.'')
</P>
<P>
   We rarely see the pope up close, relying on binoculars and
television to track his declining health. He travels with two
doctors. His chief physician, the tall, elegant Dr. Renato
Buzzonetti, answers all questions about the pontiff's health by
smiling silkily and saying, ``Bene, grazie.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, whose left hand trembles uncontrollably from
Parkinson's disease and who walks with a cane in a stiff, painful
shuffle, held up amazingly well throughout the six-day pilgrimage
to the Holy Land. But in Georgia last November, he was shaking so
badly in a cold, damp Orthodox church that Italian reporters,
receiving cell phone reports from their editors in Rome watching
him on television, wrote alarmist stories about his endangered
health. I was in the church, 10 feet away from him, but hemmed in
by hundreds of jostling Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic
believers, saw nothing. Just as well, since by the next morning, he
looked and sounded fine.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro-Valls tells reporters that when aides implore their boss
to take it easy, the pope retorts, ``I'll have all eternity to
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverage of the pope is respectful, a tribute to his position,
and also to his extraordinary personality and will power. But those
of us who work for mainstream, secular news organizations generally
focus on the broad political and social ramifications of this
pope's words and actions (as well as Vatican intrigue) more closely
than on his purely religious message. Many of the reporters in the
press corps, however, work for Catholic newspapers and magazines,
with inevitably different notions of what their readers need to
know and what they are likely to find interesting.
</P>
<P>
   When the pope was scolded in Poland last summer by the grand
rabbi of Warsaw, who called him ``pope'' and demanded that the
Catholic Church remove the last cross from Auschwitz, the
unscripted moment became a front page story for mainstream news
publications. But French and Italian religion reporters shrugged it
off as a ``provincial issue,'' and focused instead on the spiritual
significance of the Black Madonna of Czestochowa.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bus chatter often varies along the same lines. Just as political
reporters give odds on primaries and polls, the papal pack
handicaps cardinals.  &UR;  &LR;  After a Mass in Austria attended by many
European cardinals, I recall sitting with Victor Simpson of the
Associated Press, weighing the papal chances of Cardinal Jean Marie
Lustiger, archbishop of Paris (too old, too brainy, too French but
a favorite long shot of the press corps because he is a convert.
The headlines would read, ``Conclave Selects First Jewish Pope.'')
 &UR;  &LR;  Behind us, Guillaume Goubert, the correspondent for the French
Catholic newspaper, La Croix, was deep in a theological debate with
Caroline Bouan, the correspondent for I. Media, another Catholic
publication.
</P>
<P>
   They, too, sometimes display a sense of worldliness. Asked by
ELCI, a French version of CNN, for commentary on the pope's sermon
on the Mount of Beatitudes, Goubert shrugged. ``OK, but it's a
little spi, '' he replied, using French slang for ``spiritual.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of their publication, different nationalities have
different working styles. The Americans and Germans, true to type A
stereotype, attend every event, record every utterance, and
conscientiously deliver pool reports to their colleagues. The
Italian vaticanisti, who are close in spirit to British royal
watchers, rely more on their own richly intuitive insights and
unnamed sources in the Curia. They skip the Masses and reserve
their energy for uncovering the one good restaurant with decent
local wines.
</P>
<P>
   Most cardinals and bishops have limited experience talking to
reporters and, in chance encounters, sometimes speak quite freely.
During the pope's visit, Israeli officials were nervous about his
trip on Friday to the Sea of Galilee, which would force his
entourage _ and hundreds of Israeli security officers _ to work on
the Sabbath, offending Orthodox rabbis. The pope flew by helicopter
to Jerusalem that night. To spare Orthodox sensitivities, the
bishops, with the rest of the entourage, flew to Tel Aviv and then
traveled by car to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   As evening fell on Capernaum, where the pope was praying at the
ruins of the house that tradition says belonged to St. Peter, I
sidled up to two bishops and, remarking on the late hour, asked
them if they were worried about breaking the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, a local bishop, gave me a long look and replied,
``Funny, you don't look observant.'' They both laughed heartily.

BASEBALL 2000: RED SOX PICKED TO DETHRONE YANKS IN EAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this preview  &UR;  &LR; teams are listed in predicted order of finish.
</P>
<P>
   AL EAST
</P>
<P>
   1. Boston Red Sox
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams, fourth year 1999: 94-68, second
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Red Sox have never overcome the loss of Babe Ruth, but
they sure didn't let Mo Vaughn's defection bother them. The Red Sox
played in a second successive post-season, albeit as the wild-card
team, for the first time in 83 years, and now they can make it
three in a row for the first time in their star-crossed history.
</P>
<P>
   It would come as no surprise if they did it as a division
champion. The Red Sox have what it takes to make up their four-game
deficit with the Yankees last season. They have a manager who has
turned into some sort of magician. They have a potentially strong
starting pitching rotation, headed by the inimitable Pedro Martinez
and including his brother Ramon and possibly a pair of youngsters,
Brian Rose and Juan Pena.
</P>
<P>
   They also have Carl Everett (.325, 25 HR, 108 RBI) and Troy
O'Leary (.280-28-103), two emerging sluggers, who could make Vaughn
a faint memory.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Carl Everett, Jeff Fassero.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSS: Tom Gordon (right elbow).
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: Ramon Martinez and Fassero need to complement
Pedro Martinez, and Derek Lowe has to be effective as the closer in
place of Gordon, who is gone for the season.
</P>
<P>
   2. New York Yankees
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, fifth year 1999: 98-64, first
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting that the Yankees can't win yet again, but
if they don't, the reason very likely will be the demise of their
solid starting pitching. David Cone and Roger Clemens won't last
forever, and maybe that elusive fifth starter will become a
problem. And perish the thought, but Mariano Rivera might actually
give up a run, something he didn't do in his final 36 relief
appearances covering 30 and two-thirds innings in the regular
season and 12 and one-third in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, however, would have to collapse completely to miss
the playoffs, which they have made the past five seasons, and not
have a chance for their third consecutive World Series championship
and fourth in the last five seasons. The last team to win three
World Series in a row was the Oakland Athletics of 1972-74.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees have a weakness offensively, it most likely would
be the left field-designated hitter combination of Ricky Ledee and
Shane Spencer. But Derek Jeter, Bernie Williams et al. should
produce more than enough punch.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITION: Roberto Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Joe Girardi, Luis Sojo.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: The Yankees' strength has been pitching, and they
need it to continue to be.
</P>
<P>
   3. Toronto Blue Jays
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fregosi, second year 1999: 84-78, third
</P>
<P>
   Combined last season, Carlos Delgado and Shawn Green slugged 86
home runs and drove in 257 runs. Delgado and Raul Mondesi don't
figure to exceed those figures this season.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Blue Jays' problem, or one of their problems. They
need others to increase their contributions; a two-man team isn't
going to boost the Blue Jays any closer to contention. Jose Cruz
Jr. is one of the players who needs to produce more, but what he
has given before (.241 last season) may be all he can give. One
promising sign: he was the MVP of the Caribbean World Series,
hitting .385.
</P>
<P>
   Homer Bush (.320) was a pleasant surprise last year as the
regular second baseman. They need him to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITION: Raul Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Shawn Green, Pat Hentgen.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: No matter what the hitters do, the young pitching
trio of Chris Carpenter, Kelvim Escobar and Roy Halladay have to
become a factor in the team's improvement.
</P>
<P>
   4. Baltimore Orioles
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hargrove, first year 1999: 78-84, fourth
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove brings with him five consecutive division championships
as a manager, but the dysfunctional Orioles may pose too serious a
problem for even him to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   No team has wasted as much money in a two-season span as the
Orioles have, and they didn't do much in the winter to improve
their position. Rather, they are an aging team with only one
starter, catcher Charles Johnson, under 31. The average age of
their everyday players is 35. Cal Ripken, who needs nine hits for
3,000, is one of their oldest, and this very likely will be his
finale. It's time to start breaking up the old gang.
</P>
<P>
   The starting rotation is a mess. It includes the journeyman Pat
Rapp and two pitchers signed as minor league free agents, Calvin
Maduro and Jose Mercedes. KEY ADDITION: Mike Hargrove.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSS: Arthur Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: Maybe Albert Belle can have a good start and
ignite a spark that catapults the Orioles out of their rocking
chairs and into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   5. Tampa Bay Devil Rays
</P>
<P>
   Larry Rothschild, third year 1999: 69-93, fifth
</P>
<P>
   Shaken by the loss of 700,000 fans, nearly a third of their
first-year attendance, the Devil Rays bulked up. If it's offense
the fans want, it's offense they'll get. Or so the Devil Rays hope.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Vaughn and Vinny Castilla, newcomers, and Jose Canseco and
Fred McGriff, incumbents, hit a total of 144 home runs last season,
and that with Canseco missing nearly 50 games. Gerald Williams will
be important to the offense, too. He did a good job once he became
Atlanta's leadoff hitter last season.
</P>
<P>
   While their hitters are trying to hit the ball over the fence,
the Rays' pitchers will try to throw it over the plate. They led
the league in walks, averaging 4.3 a game.

<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Greg Vaughn, Vinny Castilla, Gerald Williams,
Juan Guzman.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSS: Rolando Arrojo, Wade Boggs.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: If nothing else, the Devil Rays want to be
interesting losers so the fans will return.

   AL CENTRAL
</P>
<P>
   1. Cleveland Indians
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Manuel, first year 1999: 97-65, first
</P>
<P>
   The next voice the Indians hear will be Charlie Manuel's. His is
the one that is supposed to take the Indians to the World Series
championship Mike Hargrove did not get and therefore paid the
price. In making the change, General Manager John Hart said the
Indians needed a new voice. Catcher Sandy Alomar Jr. said he didn't
know what that meant.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel, a member of the team's coaching staff the past six
seasons, has what Hargrove had _ easily the best team in the
division. The six months of the season haven't presented a problem
for the Indians; they have stumbled in October. To try to correct
that shortcoming, Hart signed Chuck Finley, the veteran
left-hander, who has a 16-9 career record against the Yankees, the
best of any active pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing pitchers have to be wary of Richie Sexson, as if they
didn't have enough trouble with Manny Ramirez (44 HR, 165 RBI).
Sexson is an emerging young hitter who last season hit 31 home runs
and drove in 116 runs.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITION: Chuck Finley.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSS: Mike Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: The new manager is on the spot to show he can
talk the Indians through to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   2. Chicago White Sox
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Manuel, third year 1999: 75-86, second
</P>
<P>
   If they can solve the mysterious disappearance of Frank Thomas,
the White Sox could have an interesting team this season. For seven
seasons, the league had no better, more consistent hitter than
Thomas. But it's as if an impostor took his place the past two
years. Thomas did raise his batting average 40 points to .305 last
season, but he plummeted to career lows in home runs (15) and RBI
(77).
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad because the White Sox have found some good young
hitters in their outfield: Magglio Ordonez (.301, 30, 117), Chris
Singleton (.300) and Carlos Lee (.293).
</P>
<P>
   They hope to have an upgraded left side of the infield, where
Mike Caruso and Greg Norton made 49 errors last season. But Jose
Valentin, the new shortstop, made 22 errors in 349 chances for
Milwaukee while Caruso was committing 24 in 555.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITION: Jose Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSS: Jaime Navarro.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: The White Sox need a resurgent Thomas and a
vastly improved defense to maintain their position as the best team
in the rest of the division.
</P>
<P>
   3. Detroit Tigers
</P>
<P>
   Phil Garner, first year 1999: 69-92, third
</P>
<P>
   Straight from seven successive losing seasons in Milwaukee, Phil
Garner lands in the Detroit dugout with a $1.2 million-a-year
salary. Nice work if you can get it.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Garner, though, the Tigers brought in Juan Gonzalez
as the centerpiece for their debut in Comerica Park, their new
40,000-seat playground. Club officials only hope that Gonzalez is
more successful at his job than they have been in inducing him to
sign a $140 million contract. Could be a case of here now, gone in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, whom Texas traded when it determined it couldn't sign
him, will lead what could be a potent offense, but the Tigers need
an outpouring of talent from their pitching staff, one of the
league's worst last year. Hideo Nomo, who compiled a 12-8 record
for Garner last season after the Mets released him, has become the
Tigers' No. 1 starter.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITION: Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSS: Justin Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: The pitchers have to give the hitters a chance so
they don't have to score 10 or 12 runs every game.
</P>
<P>
   4. Kansas City Royals
</P>
<P>
   Tony Muser, fourth year 1999: 64-97, fourth
</P>
<P>
   Fallen far from their contending status, the Royals have
actually developed some impressive young players. Right now they
are all on the position side, leaving much to be desired from the
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Damon (.307, 14, 77), Carlos Beltran (.293, 22, 108) and
Jermaine Dye (.294, 27, 119) have formed such a strong outfield
trio that there's no room for Mark Quinn, who after winning his
second consecutive minor league batting title hit six home runs and
knocked in 18 runs in 60 late-season at-bats for the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sweeney, moving from catching to first base, is another
reason (.322, 22, 102) the Royals had one of the best-hitting teams
in the league last season. They could use more home runs, though.
They were 12th in that category.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITION: Ricky Bottalico.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSS: Jeff Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: Their pitchers gave up the most runs and had the
fewest strikeouts. They won't climb far if that record doesn't
improve.
</P>
<P>
   5. Minnesota Twins
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kelly, 14th year 1999: 63-97, fifth
</P>
<P>
   If this bunch of kids doesn't work, try that bunch. Tom Kelly's
kindergarten goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Allen played 133 games in the outfield for the Twins last
season, Doug Mientkiewicz 110 games at first base and Javier
Valentin 76 games as the catcher. All will begin this season in the
minor leagues. Kelly was dissatisfied with the attitude and work
habits of some of his young players and sent a shrill message
throughout the organization.
</P>
<P>
   In their place are more youngsters. Matt LeCroy, for example.
After only two years in the minor league system, he finds himself
the team's starting catcher, or one of the starting catchers. One
of the pitchers he will catch is Brad Radke, whom the Twins have
resisted trading.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITION: Butch Huskey.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSS: Terry Steinbach.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: On-the-job training continues.
</P>
<P>
   AL WEST
</P>
<P>
   1. Seattle Mariners
</P>
<P>
   Lou Piniella, eighth year 1999: 79-83, third
</P>
<P>
   If the Mariners had handled the matter more diplomatically, they
could still have Ken Griffey Jr. in their lineup and would have
left no question as to the identity of the division champion. As it
is, they look strong enough to win because they have the best
pitching rotation in their history.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't win this year, who knows when they might because
this is most likely the last season they will have Alex Rodriguez,
who can be a free agent seven months from now. Not many players
become available after winning the M.V.P. award.
</P>
<P>
   Four players expected to be in the opening-day lineup were not
there a year ago. A fifth, Carlos Guillen, was at second base, not
third, and he played only five games before a knee injury ended his
season.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITION: John Olerud, Aaron Sele, Mike Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSS: Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: Jay Buhner, who missed the equivalent of a full
season in the past two years, needs to stay healthy and provide the
production he did in the previous three years (124 HR, 368 RBI).
</P>
<P>
   2. Oakland Athletics
</P>
<P>
   Art Howe, fifth year 1999: 87-75, second
</P>
<P>
   If the laws of mathematical progression work for the Athletics,
they will win enough games to win the division title. Showing
remarkable progress, they have improved in the past two seasons
from 65 victories to 74 to 87.
</P>
<P>
   A low-revenue team, the A's decided they had advanced far enough
to spend some money and retained three key players, pitchers Kevin
Appier and Omar Olivares and second baseman Randy Velarde, all
acquired last season.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde became a catalyst for an offense that produced the
league's second lowest-batting average but the fourth-best on-base
percentage and the fourth highest total of runs. Jason Giambi, John
Jaha and Matt Stairs form the lusty part of the lineup, combining
for 106 homers and 336 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITION: None.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSS: None.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: They can't let higher expectations throw them off
the game they played so well last year.
</P>
<P>
   3. Texas Rangers
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates, sixth year 1999: 95-67, first
</P>
<P>
   Finishing first isn't enough anymore. Not if you score a total
of two runs in six playoff games with the Yankees over two seasons.
So what do you do? You trade the player who scored both of those
runs.
</P>
<P>
   That's not why the Rangers traded Juan Gonzalez; they determined
they wouldn't be able to sign him to a contract extension. But
without Gonzalez and Todd Zeile, whom they lost unexpectedly as a
free agent, the Rangers are lacking a significant segment of their
offense. They're counting on two young outfielders, Ruben Mateo and
Gabe Kapler, to match their clippings and replace many of the lost
runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have also now pronounced themselves a pitching team
after bringing back Kenny Rogers and Darren Oliver as free agents.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Kenny Rogers, Darren Oliver, Gabe Kapler.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Juan Gonzalez, Todd Zeile, Aaron Sele.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: If the Rangers want to get a chance to score
against the Yankees in October, their pitchers have to be at least
as good as they hope they can be.
</P>
<P>
   4. Anaheim Angels
</P>
<P>
   Mike Scioscia, first year 1999: 70-92, fourth
</P>
<P>
   This was an even more dysfunctional team than the Orioles in
1999. The manager and general manager are new, and they can only
hope the attitude in the clubhouse is.
</P>
<P>
   A bat-rackful of question marks surrounds the team, but some of
them could be answered with a healthy Mo Vaughn, Tim Salmon and
Gary DiSarcina, all of whom missed significant time or were
hampered by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels seem to be short on starting pitching, especially
with Tim Belcher opening on the disabled list. That's why they
acquired Kent Bottenfield, an 18-game winner, from St. Louis in a
late trade. They need development from a group that includes Jason
Dickson, Ramon Ortiz, Jarrod Washburn and Scott Schoeneweis.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITION: Kent Bottenfield.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSS: Jim Edmonds, Chuck Finley.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: First, they have to learn togetherness. Then,
they need to build a respectable pitching staff.

   Stealing Each Other's Thunder &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One major-party presidential candidate proposed a
multibillion-dollar package of education reforms last week. The
other asserted that a 6-year-old Cuban boy, rescued offshore
Florida, should be made a permanent resident of the United States
and his father should be lured to the United States with a similar
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Which candidate was the Democrat, and which the Republican?
</P>
<P>
   At this early juncture of the general election campaign, Gov.
George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive
nominees, are staking claims to positions that belie political
stereotypes. It was the Republican, Bush, who sought to make a
traditional Democratic issue, education, his own, by unveiling an
education plan that included a $5-billion proposal to fight
childhood illiteracy and a five-year, $2.9 billion initiative to
improve teacher training.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the Democrat, Gore, who, backing away from the
Clinton administration on one of the most politically sensitive
issues of the year, announced his belief that Elian Gonzalez should
be granted permanent residency status in the United States and that
his father should be offered the same, rather than leaving a return
to Cuba as the only way to reunite them.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's move so startled Democratic allies _ ``Oh my God, it's
unbelievable!'' declared one official _ that some, like Rep. Maxine
Waters of California, said that they might have to reconsider their
support for Gore. While some liberal Democrats said he was making
an irresponsible vote grab that played politics with a little boy's
emotional state, there was no denying how important those votes, in
the pivotal state of Florida, might be to him in November.
</P>
<P>
   In embracing these positions, Bush and Gore appeared to be
inching closer to each other ideologically: Gore, after all, has
also offered an education program, amounting to $115 billion in aid
over 10 years. And Bush has long been arguing that Elian's father
should leave Cuba and be with his son in the United States, rather
than having the boy sent back to Havana.
</P>
<P>
   And both found ways to demonstrate how in sync they are with the
popular Sen. John McCain. Included in Bush's education proposals,
for instance, was money for one of McCain's favored projects,
enlisting military retirees as teachers. Gore, meanwhile, announced
his desire to raise $7.1 billion as an endowment fund for the
underwriting of House and Senate races beginning in 2008, even if
he did acknowledge that he was ``an imperfect messenger'' for
campaign finance reform.

   The Art War Guns Fall Silent &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When it began last fall, it was the political equivalent of holy
war. New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani denounced the Brooklyn
Museum of Art's ``Sensation'' exhibit as sacrilege. The museum's
defenders denounced the mayor as an enemy of freedom. The mayor cut
off the museum's funding. The museum took the city to federal
court. For a while it looked as if neither would ever bend.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. This is New York, where politics (almost) always bends to
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Giuliani agreed to abandon his campaign against the
museum, which had provoked his notorious ire with its exhibition of
young British artists that featured a portrait of the Virgin Mary
adorned with elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   Under a settlement agreement, Giuliani dismissed his state
lawsuit seeking to remove the museum's board of directors and to
evict the museum from its city-owned building. The museum, in turn,
dropped its federal lawsuit, which accused Giuliani of violating
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, of course, Giuliani retained his right to call
the exhibition offensive and anti-Catholic, an ``abominable use of
public funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials took the settlement more quietly. ``We're
stronger,'' said Robert S. Rubin, the chairman.

   OPEC Votes to Raise Oil Production
</P>
<P>
   After one of its most raucous meetings in years, the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to pump a
modest additional amount of oil, a move that should at least slow
the recent surge in oil and gasoline prices. Iran tried to rebel,
arguing that OPEC was caving in to political pressure from the
United States. But Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest producer by
far, ultimately forced it and all the other countries to raise
their official quotas by 1.7 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   That probably will not lead to a big reduction in prices; Saudi
Arabia is determined to keep prices at about $25 a barrel and will
cut production if prices slip much below that.

   A Blow to Tobacco
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette makers had long relied on package warning labels as a
defense from lawsuits by smokers who claimed they were not told
about tobacco hazards. But a San Francisco jury ordered two
manufacturers to pay a total of $20 million in punitive damages to
a California woman who began smoking after strong warning labels
appeared in 1969.

   No New Syria-Israel Talks
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton sat down with President Hafez Assad of Syria
in an effort to restart the Syrian-Israeli peace talks that broke
off in January. The effort failed, leaving it an open question when
the talks might resume.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was carrying proposals from Prime Minister Ehud Barak of
Israel, but none of his own, when he and the Syrian leader met for
three hours in Geneva as Clinton was returning from a six-day tour
of South Asia.

   A Film Triumph Is Born
</P>
<P>
   What began as one of the tightest and least predictable Oscar
races in years ended up as a fairly predictable love fest for
``American Beauty,'' a comedy about suburban dysfunction that
quietly grew in the weeks since the nominations were announced to
become the obvious favorite. The film won awards for best picture,
Kevin Spacey's lead performance, for the first-time director Sam
Mendes, for the veteran cinematographer Conrad L. Hall and for the
first-time screenwriter Alan Ball.
</P>
<P>
   Many thought it would also win best actress for Annette Bening,
but that award went to a relative newcomer, Hilary Swank, for her
widely praised performance in ``Boys Don't Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   The film that was expected to give ``American Beauty'' its
biggest competition, Lasse Hallstrom's ``The Cider House Rules,''
came away with two awards for Michael Caine's supporting
performance and for John Irving's adapted screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider,'' which came into the awards with seven
nominations, and ``The Sixth Sense,'' which came in with six, both
went home empty-handed.

   Agent Orange Link Suggested
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon came closer to acknowledging what some Vietnam
veterans have alleged for years: that they were made sick by
exposure to Agent Orange, a herbicide used to destroy the forest
camouflage of the Vietnamese communists.
</P>
<P>
   A new Air Force study showed that airmen involved in the aerial
spraying operation were far more likely to suffer from diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   While the Air Force described evidence of a link as
``particularly strong,'' some scientists said it was too early to

   Failure Is Reported For Clean Air Act
</P>
<P>
   When Congress enacted amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1990,
environmentalists hailed them as powerful weapons in the fight to
reduce acid rain. But a new federal report showed that many lakes,
ponds and streams in the Northeast, particularly in the Adirondack
Mountains, are continuing to turn acidic and are in increasing
danger of becoming lifeless.
</P>
<P>
   The report suggests that even tougher restrictions on nitrogen
emissions from upwind power plants may be needed to stem to trend.

   Putin Gets the Votes To Take Charge of Russia
</P>
<P>
   When the votes were counted from the balloting Sunday, Vladimir
Putin, who has been acting president since Boris Yeltsin resigned
the presidency on New Year's Eve, had won a narrow majority and
gained outright victory to become Russia's next democratically
elected president. Meanwhile, he remains in the office of acting
president, laying the groundwork for his new administration. He
lost no time in that role, telling his new cabinet on Monday that
it now needed to put all its work into presenting the country with
one comprehensive economic blueprint by the time he is sworn in in
May.

   Reform Rabbis Approve Gay Union Ceremonies
</P>
<P>
   Rabbis in Judaism's Reform movement who decide to officiate at
gay unions will now do with the full support of the movement's
rabbinic organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Conference of American Rabbis voted Wednesday to
declare same-sex unions among Jews ``worthy of affirmation''
through Jewish ritual. It became the largest clergy body to take
such a stand.
</P>
<P>
   The type of ritual is left up to individual rabbis, and those
who chose not officiate will also have the conference's support.

   Rising Death Toll in Uganda
</P>
<P>
   The death toll in Uganda rose day after day, as investigators
turned from a theory of mass suicide to mass murder, one of the
largest in history.
</P>
<P>
   In all, at least 725 bodies have been unearthed at four sites,
all members of a doomsday cult called the Movement for the
Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God. Many were strangled.
But many show no wounds, which investigators say may suggest
poison.
</P>
<P>
   The discoveries may not be over: the nation's president, Yoweri
Museveni, said he feared the final count could reach 5,000, which
appears to have been the cult's membership.

   A Film Triumph Is Born
</P>
<P>
   What began as one of the tightest and least predictable Oscar
races in years ended up as a fairly predictable love fest for
``American Beauty,'' a comedy about suburban dysfunction that
quietly grew in the weeks since the nominations were announced to
become the obvious favorite. The film won awards for best picture,
Kevin Spacey's lead performance, for the first-time director Sam
Mendes, for the veteran cinematographer Conrad L. Hall and for the
first-time screenwriter Alan Ball.
</P>
<P>
   Many thought it would also win best actress for Annette Bening,
but that award went to a relative newcomer, Hilary Swank, for her
widely praised performance in ``Boys Don't Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   The film that was expected to give ``American Beauty'' its
biggest competition, Lasse Hallstrom's ``The Cider House Rules,''
came away with two awards for Michael Caine's supporting
performance and for John Irving's adapted screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider,'' which came into the awards with seven
nominations, and ``The Sixth Sense,'' which came in with six, both
went home empty-handed.

   Agent Orange Link Suggested
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon came closer to acknowledging what some Vietnam
veterans have alleged for years: that they were made sick by
exposure to Agent Orange, a herbicide used to destroy the forest
camouflage of the Vietnamese communists.
</P>
<P>
   A new Air Force study showed that airmen involved in the aerial
spraying operation were far more likely to suffer from diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   While the Air Force described evidence of a link as
``particularly strong,'' some scientists said it was too early to
draw conclusions.

BASEBALL 2000: BRAVES, REDS AND DIAMONDBACKS PICKED TO WIN
DIVISIONS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this preview &UR;  &LR; teams are listed in predicted order of finish.
</P>
<P>
   N.L. EAST
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA BRAVES
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cox, 11th year 1999: 103-59, first
</P>
<P>
   An executive of another team was talking this spring about how
impressed he was with the way the Braves shuffle their personnel
every year and keep winning. Let a player go as a free agent, sign
a free agent; trade this one for that one. They have done it again
in preparation for their ninth consecutive division title.
</P>
<P>
   This year they have changed left fielders and second basemen.
They also have a different first baseman, though he's not new.
Andres Galarraga is back, incredibly, from his cancer setback, and
if he can't take the daily grind, Wally Joyner, another newcomer,
will be there to spell him.
</P>
<P>
   Someone will have to spell John Rocker for the first two weeks
while he serves his suspension for boorish behavior. Another
pitcher, John Smoltz, will miss the entire season while he recovers
from elbow surgery.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Quilvio Veras, Reggie Sanders, Wally Joyner.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Ryan Klesko, Bret Boone, Gerald Williams.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: If the other pitchers pick up Smoltz's usual
load, all will be right in the Braves' new world.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK METS
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine, fourth year 1999: 97-66, second
</P>
<P>
   We know the Mets won't win all 162 games. But will they win
enough games to reach the playoffs again? Last year they had to
play an extra game to get there. They think this is the year they
will beat the Braves, but they might have another thought coming.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, at least, Todd Zeile and Derek Bell are not sufficient
replacements for John Olerud and Roger Cedeno. Mike Hampton (22-4
last year) should be better than any of the departed starting
pitchers, but the rotation doesn't look as deep. Glendon Rusch,
starter No. 5, does not appear to have the potential of Octavio
Dotel or Masato Yoshii.
</P>
<P>
   And can Rickey Henderson, 41-year-old Rickey Henderson, be as
spry and as productive as he was last year?
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Mike Hampton, Todd Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: John Olerud, Roger Cedeno, Kenny Rogers, Masato
Yoshii.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: Pitching and defense win pennants. The defense is
there; will the pitching be there, too?
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL EXPOS
</P>
<P>
   Felipe Alou, ninth year 1999: 68-94, fourth
</P>
<P>
   When the players struck with less than two months to go in the
1994 season, the Expos were in first place. That was their year,
they believed. Now they believe this could be their year. For what
exactly, they aren't sure, but they will play with new enthusiasm.
The new managing owner, Jeffrey Loria, has instilled that feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Felipe Alou is so good that he can take whatever edge he
has and translate it into a surprising number of victories. Besides
the new outlook, Alou has Vladimir Guerrero on his side (.316, 42
HR, 131 RBI), and he is worth a certain number of victories
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The team is still young, with Peter Bergeron, the rookie center
fielder, joining five other starting position players and all five
starting pitchers with less than four years of major league
service.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Hideki Irabu, Graeme Lloyd, Lee Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSS: Brad Fullmer.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: If the young pitchers, bolstered by a newly
comfortable Irabu, are ready to blossom, the Expos could be a
highly interesting team.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES
</P>
<P>
   Terry Francona, fourth year 1999: 77-85, third
</P>
<P>
   The good young players the Phillies have collected show signs of
turning the team into a contender, but the Phillies' fate seems to
be linked to the health of Curt Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   With Schilling in good health and winning, the Phillies were
only five and a half games out of first place one week into August
last season. Then Schilling went on the disabled list because of a
sore shoulder and the team plummeted in the standing. By the time
he pitched again, about four weeks later, the Phillies were 17
games from first.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling will open the season on the disabled list, working his
way back from surgery. The young players will be on their own until
he returns.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Andy Ashby, Mike Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSS: Steve Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: Ashby was acquired to bolster the starting
rotation, but it needs needs more for the team to challenge the
superior teams.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA MARLINS
</P>
<P>
   John Boles, second year 1999: 64-98, fifth
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins just have to keep showing up until their young
players, especially their pitchers, are ready to win in the majors.
Until then, this will be a last-place team.
</P>
<P>
   Youth? The Marlins are full of it. Except for Alex Fernandez and
Cliff Floyd, no starter or potential starter, no starting pitcher,
no closer has played in the majors for as much as two and a half
years. Nine players in this group of 13 don't have two years in the
majors. With nine years to his credit, Fernandez has more service
time than five other starters and the closer combined.
</P>
<P>
   And if this bunch isn't inexperienced enough, the Marlins have
another platoon or two coming up behind them.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITION: None.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSS: Brian Meadows.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: Patience, patience, patience.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   NL CENTRAL
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI REDS
</P>
<P>
   Jack McKeon, fourth year 1999: 96-67, second
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Jim Bowden has already won the executive of the
year award for securing Ken Griffey Jr. for relatively little, in
both players and money. Now his team has to reward his efforts by
toppling Houston from the top of the division.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Reds fell two victories short of the division
championship and one victory short of the playoffs. They willingly
lost Greg Vaughn, their big power hitter, but added Griffey and
Dante Bichette. They also retained Pokey Reese, the player Bowden
would not give to Seattle in the Griffey trade.
</P>
<P>
   Jack McKeon, whose slight raise on a one-year contract was not
an appropriate reward for the team's play in 1999, should
nevertheless have fun again this time around.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Ken Griffey Jr., Dante Bichette.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Greg Vaughn, Mike Cameron, Brett Tomko.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: For all that Griffey brings, he cannot pitch. The
starters have to do that, and the rotation may be a little thin.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON ASTROS
</P>
<P>
   Larry Dierker, fourth year 1999: 97-65, first
</P>
<P>
   With the loss of Mike Hampton's 22-victory arm and Carl
Everett's burgeoning bat, the Astros will be hard pressed to finish
first for the fourth year in a row. On the other hand, they will
have Moises Alou's battering bat, which they didn't have last year
because of Alou's torn knee ligament.
</P>
<P>
   So where does that leave the Astros in their first season in
their new park, Enron Field? Most likely right in the middle of the
division race. Any lineup that has Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell
has to be taken seriously. Roger Cedeno, who came from the Mets
with Octavio Dotel for Hampton, adds stolen bases to the lineup (66
last year), and Daryle Ward brings a potentially explosive bat for
what should be his first full major league season.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Roger Cedeno, Octavio Dotel.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Mike Hampton, Carl Everett.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: The pitching puzzle: Will Dotel and Scott Elarton
ease Hampton's loss? And is the Jose Lima who won 21 games for
real?
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS CARDINALS
</P>
<P>
   Tony La Russa, fifth year 1999: 75-86, fourth
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Walt Jocketty spent an exhausting off-season,
scurrying hither and yon to fill this hole, bolster that position.
The result should be a contender, something St. Louis hasn't been
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Jocketty made over the pitching staff, bringing in Pat Hentgen,
a former Cy Young award winner; Darryl Kile, once a 19-game winner;
and Andy Benes, once an 18-game winner for the Cardinals, for the
rotation, and Dave Veres, who had 31 saves for Colorado last year,
to be the closer.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Vina came from Milwaukee to be the second baseman, and
Jim Edmonds, in a late move, arrived from Anaheim to be the center
fielder. Edmonds' presence means that J.D. Drew, whose rookie
season (.242) was disappointing, has to produce or the veteran Eric
Davis will bump him to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Jim Edmonds, Pat Hentgen, Darryl Kile, Andy
Benes, Dave Veres, Fernando Vina.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Kent Bottenfield, Darren Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: If the newly arrived veteran pitchers rediscover
the talent that enabled them to be top-notch pitchers once upon a
time, the home runs Mark McGwire hits may lead to victories.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH PIRATES
</P>
<P>
   Gene Lamont, fourth year 1999: 78-83, third
</P>
<P>
   All but a few teams have enough starting pitching, which means
all but a few teams relentlessly pursued some of the Pirates'
starting pitchers throughout the winter. Jason Schmidt and Kris
Benson were the primary players sought by the multitudes, but the
season, that is, the American League season, begins tomorrow, and
Schmidt and Benson will wear Pittsburgh uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   As they try to claw their way up in the standing, the Pirates
are not just about pitching. Brian Giles (.315, 39 HR, 115 RBI) and
Kevin Young (.298, 26, 106) provide punch, and they hope to be
joined by the team's rookie center fielder, Chad Hermansen, who
posted minor league career highs in homers (32) and RBI (97) last
season.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITION: Wil Cordero.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSS: Albert Martin.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: Continued development by the pitchers, a solid
rookie season by Hermansen and a successful comeback by catcher
Jason Kendall, who sustained a season-ending ankle injury at
midseason, could make the Pirates worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO CUBS
</P>
<P>
   Don Baylor, first season 1999: 67-95, sixth
</P>
<P>
   Coveted by the Cubs, as well as other teams, Don Baylor told his
Chicago recruiters that for him to consider taking their job, they
would have to make moves to improve the team that had the league's
second-worst record last season. The Cubs have not presented Baylor
with a pennant winner, but they have made the team better. And it
will be even better when Kerry Wood returns to the Wrigley Field
mound.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Girardi gives Baylor a solid man behind the plate, and Eric
Young gives him an infusion of stolen bases into the offense.
Ismael Valdes, when healthy, should give him a solid starting
pitcher. Another newcomer, center fielder Damon Buford, gained the
first hit and run batted in of the new century.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa isn't new, but his home run act never gets old.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Don Baylor, Ismael Valdes, Joe Girardi, Eric
Young.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSS: Terry Adams.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: The division race may be open, but not open
enough for the Cubs unless Wood performs as he did two years ago
and takes the rest of the staff with him.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE BREWERS
</P>
<P>
   Davey Lopes, first year 1999: 74-87, fifth
</P>
<P>
   So the Brewers become part of this big four-team, nine-player
trade and emerge with the pitcher they want, Jamey Wright, but then
Wright suffers a small tear in his rotator cuff and is out for at
least the first month of the season. This is the kind of fortune
the Brewers have had over the years. Why should it change now?
</P>
<P>
   They have not had a season with a winning record since 1992,
which was the year their owner, Bud Selig, became acting
commissioner. But while Selig went on to do the job without acting,
his general manager, Sal Bando, and manager, Phil Garner, paid the
price for overseeing seven successive losing seasons. Dean Taylor
and Davey Lopes will be responsible for No. 8.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Jamey Wright, Henry Blanco.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Jeff Cirillo, David Nilsson, Hideo Nomo.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: Lopes has tried to change the losing attitude,
but a display of talent would help his effort immeasurably.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   NL WEST
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA DIAMONDBACKS
</P>
<P>
   Buck Showalter, third year 1999: 100-62, first
</P>
<P>
   The most successful two-year-old team in baseball history, the
Diamondbacks have room for improvement. They won 100 games and the
division title in their second season, but they lost the
franchise's first playoff series to the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   They featured an explosive lineup last year with surprising
production from Jay Bell (38 HR, 112 RBI) and Luis Gonzalez (.336,
111 RBI). The Diamondbacks also discovered a good-hitting first
baseman in Erubiel Durazo (.329). But they begin this season
without their No. 1 run producer, Matt Williams (35 HR, 142 RBI),
whose foul ball broke a bone in his foot last week. He is expected
back in about six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On a pitching staff headed by Randy Johnson, the Cy Young award
winner, Omar Daal (16-9) may be ready to take his place in the
upper echelon of pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITION: None.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSS: Andy Benes.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: They can't afford any offensive falloff and have
to find a way to offset Matt Williams' absence.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS
</P>
<P>
   Dusty Baker, eighth year 1999: 86-76, second
</P>
<P>
   Before the first pitch, the Giants are winners. They have sold a
franchise-record 28,000 season tickets for their first season at
Pacific Bell Park. Now they would like to entertain those fans with
a typical Dusty Baker team, that is, a team that does what it is
necessary to be in the division race.
</P>
<P>
   If they are to be in this race with the Diamondbacks, the Giants
have to find a way to make up 14 games. One way would be to have
Barry Bonds in their lineup every day. Bonds missed 60 games last
year with a series of injuries, playing the fewest games in his
14-year career. His .262 batting average was his lowest since 1989,
and his 83 RBI represented one of his lowest totals.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITION: None.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSS: None.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: Livan Hernandez and Shawn Estes have to carry
their load of the pitching with Russ Ortiz (18-9) and Kirk Rueter
(15-10).
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES DODGERS
</P>
<P>
   Davey Johnson, second year 1999: 77-85, third
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to correct the disaster they suffered last season,
the Dodgers swapped right fielders, a disgruntled Raul Mondesi for
an expensive Shawn Green (six years, $84 million); brought back
Orel Hershiser, a star pitcher from their past; moved Mark
Grudzielanek from shortstop to second base and resurrected Kevin
Elster to play short.
</P>
<P>
   They have also restored Carlos Perez to the starting rotation,
in which he performed so abysmally last season (2-10, 7.43 earned
run average) that he was sent to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not a good omen that the Dodgers were looking for
Alex Cora to win the shortstop job and Eric Gagne the spot Perez
got in the rotation, and both failed.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITION: Shawn Green.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Raul Mondesi, Ismael Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: The pitching staff has to restore itself to the
Dodgers' customary level of respectability, and Green has to put
fire into the offense.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO ROCKIES
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Bell, first year 1999: 72-90, fifth
</P>
<P>
   The reputation of Dan O'Dowd, the rookie general manager, will
rise or fall on the success or failure of the Rockies. Deciding a
transformation was needed from a team heading in reverse, O'Dowd
shed some of the heavy hitters in favor of those he thought could
produce a more varied way of scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are Dante Bichette and Vinny Castilla, who in the past five
years combined for 344 home runs. In their place are Jeffrey
Hammonds and Jeff Cirillo.
</P>
<P>
   O'Dowd also set out to find pitchers who could throw strikes and
pitch more intelligently than some of their predecessors. Rolando
Arrojo, Masato Yoshii and Scott Karl are the subjects if this part

<P>
   The year has been embarrassing for the Padres; now it can get
bad.
</P>
<P>
   They traded for Albert Martin to play left field and lead off,
thinking they had themselves a solid citizen, and then he becomes
embroiled in a nasty dispute with a woman who contends he is a
bigamist. But can he serve as a catalyst for their offense?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more important to the offense is Ruben Rivera,
Mariano's cousin, who has to be better than his .195 performance
last season for the Padres to be respectable. A healthy Tony Gwynn
(.338 in 111 games) would also help raise the level of an offense
that was just about the league's weakest last year.

<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Ryan Klesko, Bret Boone, Albert Martin.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Wally Joyner, Quilvio Veras, Andy Ashby.

TIMING RIGHT FOR WOMEN'S FINAL FOUR 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ There is a growing movement to shift the women's
Final Four to a weekend separate from the men's Final Four, which
would be the worst decision since women were forced to play six
against six, and midcourt was a forbidden border crossing in the
gender wars.
</P>
<P>
   Those who run the women's game have treated the national
tournament like a Christmas gift bought early, hiding it so no one
can find it. Last weekend's West Regional in Portland, Ore.,
featured Rutgers playing two games that started no earlier than
midnight in the East, guaranteeing a television audience smaller
than the list of Indiana players who claim never to have been
choked or punched by Bobby Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Caretakers of the women's game claim to want more visibility,
but they do everything to make the tournament more invisible. They
are so afraid of competing head-to-head against other sporting
events, so insecure about their own product, that they are forever
willing to appease, to acquiesce, to retreat, to accept the label
of second-rate.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the Final Four would diminish, not enhance, the women's
tournament. Right now, the women get two days of marquee billing on
what everyone has come to relish as championship weekend. Shifting
the Final Four would most likely produce less media coverage, not
more. A week later, and the women would be overtaken by the Masters
and the start of baseball. A week or two or three earlier, and the
women would be lost in the clutter of men's conference tournaments
and regional play. Equating the women's championship with the early
rounds of the men's tournament would be the ``Wayne's World''
equivalent of Wayne and Garth bowing before Alice Cooper and
saying: ``We're not worthy, we're not worthy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is time for women to stop apologizing for their perceived
shortcomings and to start praising their assets: engaging
basketball, accessibility, high graduation rates. This women's
Final Four is infinitely more compelling than the men's Final Four,
which has a feeling of consolation and mediocrity. With the
exception of Michigan State, the men's field of Wisconsin, Florida
and North Carolina seemed less like a championship bracket than a
short list for the Poulan/Weed Eater Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the tournament's at the right time,'' said Theresa
Grentz of Illinois, the president of the Women's College Basketball
Coaches Association. ``Maybe the men's tournament should move. Why
should we move?''
</P>
<P>
   Geno Auriemma, the Connecticut coach, favors moving the women's
tournament, but he recognizes that the biggest hindrance to the
women's game comes not from without _ i.e., insufficient media
coverage _ but from within. If women's basketball is to be taken
more seriously by others, it must first be taken more seriously by
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a commitment at every school to be good in women's
basketball,'' Auriemma said. ``A lot of schools still have women's
programs just to comply with Title IX. There's really no emotional
investment of, `We want to be really good at it.' Most of it is,
`How many women do we need on scholarship? Good. Let's have it and
be done with it. What do we have to pay them? Good. Just keep them
out of our hair.'''
</P>
<P>
   Women's basketball should do what women's soccer did last
summer, not go on the run like fugitives, but stand up and demand
to be placed in the best arenas and to been seen by the widest
television audiences. It did nothing for basketball to place the
West Regional in Portland's decrepit Memorial Coliseum, whose floor
had more dead spots than Donald Trump's comb-over.
</P>
<P>
   Women's soccer, figure skating, tennis and gymnastics do not
hide from their male counterparts, and neither should basketball.
What's to hide from? The men's game is shriveling from early
departures and academic fraud. Last year's men's tournament was the
lowest rated ever on CBS, while the women's championship game drew
the second-highest rating ever for a basketball game, male or
female, on ESPN. The problem with women's sports, said Julie Foudy,
the co-captain of the American soccer team, is that ``people are
afraid to take risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's basketball should also quash another proposal to move
first- and second-round games of the tournament away from the
campuses of the higher-seeded teams and onto predetermined or
neutral courts.
</P>
<P>
   The fan base won't support it. And, at this stage of its growth,
the women's game doesn't need more upsets, it needs fewer. It
doesn't need parity, it needs dynasties like Tennessee and
Connecticut, just as the men's game needed UCLA's marvelous
domination.
</P>
<P>
   The women's Final Four has been sold out for eight consecutive
years. The interest is there for women's basketball; the interest
is there. The tournament doesn't need to be moved, it needs to be
promoted and celebrated.

ARTISTS HOPE TO RESTORE LONGEST MURAL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The world's longest mural - a Los Angeles landmark
located in the suburban San Fernando Valley - is fading fast after
25 years of sun, rain and earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   Dismayed by the city's neglect of this important artwork, the
artists who painted it over six summers starting in 1975 now are
launching an ambitious plan to restore the Great Wall of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And they want City Hall's help raising an estimated $500,000 to
restore the mural, add to it, and build viewing kiosks in the
adjacent walking park, making it more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Los Angeles can't recognize this important monument, then
maybe we should take it down instead of letting it decay,'' said
world-renowned artist Judith Baca, the brains behind the
half-mile-long mural that depicts Los Angeles history.
</P>
<P>
   Adolfo Nodal, general manager of the city Cultural Affairs
Department, said Los Angeles cannot be expected to pay for the
entire restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Great Wall is an important part of the city's identity,
and we agree that we can't lose it,'' Nodal said. ``It's a sound
investment to work with kids and produce long-term art. If Judy
says it's time to restore it, then we need to take that
initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Nodal said the mural program has been shortchanged in recent
years, the result of the mayor and council prioritizing other
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Copen, a spokeswoman for Mayor Richard Riordan, said the
city has not received a formal proposal to restore the mural, but
would be willing to consider funding.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, Baca's Social and Public Arts Resource
Center has even asked the county for Proposition A money to restore
the mural, but she said the proposal was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   SAVING ART, KIDS
</P>
<P>
   Restoring the mural would save more than just an important piece
of art.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 at-risk high school students from Watts to East
Los Angeles to the East Valley completed the mural in 1983 along
Coldwater Canyon Avenue in Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   Now Baca wants to reach a new generation of artists.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Bernardo Munoz and Richard Aguilar, two inner-city
school kids with loads of artistic inclination but little
opportunity, both worked on the mural in the summer during its
first stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of the kids that got involved with this mural were at
the crossroads of getting into drugs and gangs,'' said Aguilar, now
a Los Angeles police officer who runs his own graphic arts
business. ``Judy and that mural changed our lives, it opened doors
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar, 43, has received awards from city, county and state
officials over the years for his work painting murals and giving
motivational talks to teen-agers at high schools around Los Angeles
County.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz, who also became a professional artist after a summer of
working on the mural as a teen-ager in the 1970s, says the program
experience helped many of the kids make a positive transition into
adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the kids were like butterflies coming out of their
inner-city cocoons,'' said Munoz, who at 43 owns a successful
commercial art production company, Art, Sculpture and Production
Inc., that also does special effects for the movie industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go from graffiti to doing something that the community
respects and appreciates, that's incredible,'' Munoz said. ``It
takes two people to change, not just the person themselves, but
also support from the community.''
</P>
<P>
   A RAINBOW COMMUNITY'S MURAL
</P>
<P>
   The mural program was about much more than painting, says Baca,
it was about bringing together kids from the city's diverse
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be teaching convivial spirit and civic pride, not
zero tolerance,'' Baca said. ``Reaching out to these kids today
will make them civic leaders tomorrow instead of statistics of
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The need for the program is especially timely, with approval by
state voters last month of Proposition 21, a
get-tough-on-juvenile-crime initiative the state estimates will
cost taxpayers some $1 billion next year and up to $500 million
annually for increased prosecution and incarceration of youthful
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the '70s, the muralists found an ally in Mayor Tom
Bradley, who rode into office on a coalition based on diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Baca said Bradley was a key force in lobbying for local and
state funds for city murals, but that City Hall has dropped the
ball on mural funding in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Riordan administration has a chance to save the mural,
Baca said. She hopes the city will make the funding a priority
during the upcoming budget process, which runs from April through
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spent $1 million last year on millennium celebrations
that flopped,'' she said. ``Here, we're talking about a permanent
piece of art that directly improves the lives of the artists and
the community.''
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Mike Feuer, chairman of the Budget and Finance
Committee, said the city should not allow the mural to fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would definitely be a good project to restore the mural,''
he said. ``These are the kinds of projects that give us a sense of
community.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Every few weeks, it seems, women in the U.S.
military smash through another glass ceiling. In December 1998,
female pilots flew into combat against Iraq for the first time from
the deck of an aircraft carrier. This week, in another first, a
woman is commanding a warship on its way to a combat zone in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   For the Pentagon, these milestones _ and the relative
nonchalance that accompany them _ are unequivocal signs of the
progress made over the last decade in improving the standing of
women in the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   Are they really?
</P>
<P>
   A provocative new book, ``The Kinder, Gentler Military''
(Scribner), challenges the sanguine image the Pentagon would like
to convey of equality in the military's increasing co-ed ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The author, Stephanie Gutmann, accuses the Pentagon's civilian
and military leaders of dangerously eroding U.S. militaty power in
a politically correct pursuit to expand women's opportunities. She
even suggests that the forced integration of men and women has
contributed to some of the sexual scandals that have buffeted the
services in recent years. Just last week, it was revealed that the
Army's highest-ranking woman, Lt. Gen. Claudia J. Kennedy, one of
only three three-star officers in the military, had filed a sexual
harassment complaint against another Army general, accusing him of
groping her in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gutmann, a journalist who often writes about sexual politics,
argues that what sounds great in theory _ equality _ fails when put
into practice in the unique world of military service. The efforts
Pentagon brass have made to integrate women have backfired, she
asserts, causing an erosion of standards and a weakening of the
overtly testosterone-laced mentality she and others believe is
essential to the act of killing other human beings in combat.
</P>
<P>
   To support her thesis, Gutmann dissects the Pentagon's policies
and exposes some of the more extreme efforts to weed out sexist
language or discriminatory practices. At the Army's boot camp for
men and women in Ft. Jackson, S.C., female recruits no longer have
to throw a hand grenade far enough to keep from killing themselves,
and they are allowed to run more slowly in ``ability groups''
rather than keep up with the pack. For a time, young women (and
men) at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center could hold up blue
cards when the stress of training became too much.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the women not driven to physical and mental
extremes, Gutmann contends, but the men are inevitably pushed less
as a result, leaving them unprepared for combat.
</P>
<P>
   Has the military really lowered its standards to accommodate
women? In short, yes, but the full answer is far more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Men headed into Army and Marine ground combat units, which
exclude women, still train at places like Fort Benning, Ga., and
Parris Island, S.C., without the distractions that Gutmann derides.
</P>
<P>
   At other bases, Pentagon officials acknowledge that the rigors
of boot camp are not what they once were, in part out of concern
that the physical stress is more punishing on women's bodies. ``The
presence of women causes us to ask why we do some things,'' said
Richard Danzig, the secretary of the Navy. That has meant changing
everything from the number of situps to the designs of ships.
</P>
<P>
   But he and other leaders also point out that the nature of
military service and warfare has changed. The Air Force, the most
technically focused service, has been putting male and female
enlistees through basic training together at Lackland Air Force
Base in San Antonio, Texas, for 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   As technology has advanced, brute force has become less and less
a priority. In these days of cruise-missile strikes and long-range
bombing, the distinctions between what men and women are asked to
do is blurring. Women can fly any Air Force or Navy warplane that
men do. During NATO's bombing in Kosovo, women flew combat raids
over Serbia while the overwhelmingly male ground combat forces sat
out the campaign in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``The muscle we use in combat today is between our ears,'' said
Capt. Barbara L. Brehm of the Navy, the military director of the
Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, though, some experts have warned that the
military is growing dangerously out of touch with society's values.
Others have argued that the Pentagon's warrior culture remains
hostile to women, as well as to gays, even as these groups make
strides in civilian society.
</P>
<P>
   Women in uniform say they have long had to endure unwanted
sexual attention, but for a woman of Gen. Kennedy's rank to have
filed a formal complaint suggests that the Pentagon still has a
long way to go to create a comfortable climate for the nearly
200,000 women in the armed services, who make up 14 percent of the
military.
</P>
<P>
   To Gutmann and many in uniform, however, there should be limits
to society's influence on the armed forces. After all, they argue,
the military has the unique responsibility to train people to fight
and die in war. Gutmann's basic question is whether the nation
really wants its fighting forces to look like the rest of
couch-potato America. ``Why shouldn't the military be like the
monastery on the hill?'' she asked in an interview. ``Why shouldn't
it be the institution that is part of us, but still different?''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, there is one thing people on both sides of the
argument agree on. And it was best expressed by none other than
Gen. Kennedy, whom Gutmann quotes in her book. ``This is not your
father's Army anymore,'' the general told cadets at West Point a
few years ago.

   The first telecopters used in the 1960s were rather limited in
range. In fact, they couldn't rise much more than 50 feet off the
ground - the length of the camera's cable.
</P>
<P>
   Camera operators once wore a harness, leaned out of the chopper
and held the camera on their shoulders, delivering a shaky picture
at best.
</P>
<P>
   Today, cameramen like Welk's partner Leyvas sit inside and
control the camera with a joystick for a picture that is
gyro-stabilized to adjust for the flight's bumps.
</P>
<P>
   After Pettee's chopper took a bullet during the Rodney King
riots, he recalled, his station bought the new technology, and
other stations followed.
</P>
<P>
   The industry was dealt a major wakeup call in 1998, when
stations went live to a man who had parked his pickup truck on an
overpass of the Harbor and Century freeways to protest health
maintenance organizations. The man suddenly committed suicide - on
live TV.
</P>
<P>
   At least one station was airing the drama live at a time when
children were watching TV after school, recalled KABC-AM (790)
radio traffic reporter Jorge Jarrin.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of the stations were on a tight close-up at the
moment he pulled out the shotgun, put it under his chin and pulled
the trigger. It was very graphic.''
</P>
<P>
   Stations said they would use a tape delay or pull back if
incidents could become too graphic - although how often they have
done so is open to question.
</P>
<P>
   Pettee said his station installed a button that allows him to
quickly switch cameras to one focused on him inside the chopper.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't used the button yet, he said, although in retrospect
he wishes he had last week when covering a story in Tarzana about a
man trapped in a trench. Thinking the man was still alive and had
been saved by firefighters, Pettee's cameraman panned down to the
man's body.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came back and it was obvious at that point the fire people
had given up, and I said, Pull back, pull back. I wasn't prepared
for that because I thought he he was alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the things that we grapple with in live
television.''
</P>
<P>
   SAFETY CONCERNS
</P>
<P>
   Following last Sunday's crash, the reporters union said it has
been struggling to give more control over flight decisions to
reporters and pilots, rather than news directors and helicopter
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The local American Federation of Television and Radio Artists
filed a grievance two weeks before the crash, requesting safety
information about Van Nuys-based Helinet Aviation, which provides
choppers for five L.A. stations.
</P>
<P>
   While KTTV-TV (Channel 11) officials said they agreed with the
concerns, and commissioned an independent safety audit, Helinet
officials said they have an excellent safety record and have never
before had an incident involving an electronic journalist. They
also said they don't pressure pilots to fly against their better
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line really is this: The helicopter company
management is never going to pressure a pilot to fly,'' said
Helinet Vice President Dave Corsello. ``A pilot getting in the
aircraft is going to make the decision. It's their decision to fly
or not fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the early days of helicopter journalism, there have been
crashes. They include Francis Gary Powers - the famed U-2 pilot
shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960 - who in 1977 died
returning from a story when his helicopter ran out of fuel,
crashing in Encino.
</P>
<P>
   Welk, who helped guide KTTV chopper pilot Kris Kelley back to
Van Nuys last Sunday night, said flying and reporting can be tricky
- and he's had a few close calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about news flying that makes it different is it's
easy for the pilot to get caught up in the story and forget to
concentrate on the flight,'' Welk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not hard for me, though, because I want to go home to my
kids every night. There's not a story in the world that's worth
risking that.''

   WASHINGTON _ Every few weeks, it seems, women in the U.S.
military smash through another glass ceiling. In December 1998,
female pilots flew into combat against Iraq for the first time from
the deck of an aircraft carrier. This week, in another first, a
woman is commanding a warship on its way to a combat zone in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   For the Pentagon, these milestones _ and the relative
nonchalance that accompany them _ are unequivocal signs of the
progress made over the last decade in improving the standing of
women in the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   Are they really?
</P>
<P>
   A provocative new book, ``The Kinder, Gentler Military''
(Scribner), challenges the sanguine image the Pentagon would like
to convey of equality in the military's increasing co-ed ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The author, Stephanie Gutmann, accuses the Pentagon's civilian
and military leaders of dangerously eroding U.S. militaty power in
a politically correct pursuit to expand women's opportunities. She
even suggests that the forced integration of men and women has
contributed to some of the sexual scandals that have buffeted the
services in recent years. Just last week, it was revealed that the
Army's highest-ranking woman, Lt. Gen. Claudia J. Kennedy, one of
only three three-star officers in the military, had filed a sexual
harassment complaint against another Army general, accusing him of
groping her in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gutmann, a journalist who often writes about sexual politics,
argues that what sounds great in theory _ equality _ fails when put
into practice in the unique world of military service. The efforts
Pentagon brass have made to integrate women have backfired, she
asserts, causing an erosion of standards and a weakening of the
overtly testosterone-laced mentality she and others believe is
essential to the act of killing other human beings in combat.
</P>
<P>
   To support her thesis, Gutmann dissects the Pentagon's policies
and exposes some of the more extreme efforts to weed out sexist
language or discriminatory practices. At the Army's boot camp for
men and women in Ft. Jackson, S.C., female recruits no longer have
to throw a hand grenade far enough to keep from killing themselves,
and they are allowed to run more slowly in ``ability groups''
rather than keep up with the pack. For a time, young women (and
men) at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center could hold up blue
cards when the stress of training became too much.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the women not driven to physical and mental
extremes, Gutmann contends, but the men are inevitably pushed less
as a result, leaving them unprepared for combat.
</P>
<P>
   Has the military really lowered its standards to accommodate
women? In short, yes, but the full answer is far more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Men headed into Army and Marine ground combat units, which
exclude women, still train at places like Fort Benning, Ga., and
Parris Island, S.C., without the distractions that Gutmann derides.
</P>
<P>
   At other bases, Pentagon officials acknowledge that the rigors
of boot camp are not what they once were, in part out of concern
that the physical stress is more punishing on women's bodies. ``The
presence of women causes us to ask why we do some things,'' said
Richard Danzig, the secretary of the Navy. That has meant changing
everything from the number of situps to the designs of ships.
</P>
<P>
   But he and other leaders also point out that the nature of
military service and warfare has changed. The Air Force, the most
technically focused service, has been putting male and female
enlistees through basic training together at Lackland Air Force
Base in San Antonio, Texas, for 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   As technology has advanced, brute force has become less and less
a priority. In these days of cruise-missile strikes and long-range
bombing, the distinctions between what men and women are asked to
do is blurring. Women can fly any Air Force or Navy warplane that
men do. During NATO's bombing in Kosovo, women flew combat raids
over Serbia while the overwhelmingly male ground combat forces sat
out the campaign in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``The muscle we use in combat today is between our ears,'' said
Capt. Barbara L. Brehm of the Navy, the military director of the
Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, though, some experts have warned that the
military is growing dangerously out of touch with society's values.
Others have argued that the Pentagon's warrior culture remains
hostile to women, as well as to gays, even as these groups make
strides in civilian society.
</P>
<P>
   Women in uniform say they have long had to endure unwanted
sexual attention, but for a woman of Gen. Kennedy's rank to have
filed a formal complaint suggests that the Pentagon still has a
long way to go to create a comfortable climate for the nearly
200,000 women in the armed services, who make up 14 percent of the
military.
</P>
<P>
   To Gutmann and many in uniform, however, there should be limits
to society's influence on the armed forces. After all, they argue,
the military has the unique responsibility to train people to fight
and die in war. Gutmann's basic question is whether the nation
really wants its fighting forces to look like the rest of
couch-potato America. ``Why shouldn't the military be like the
monastery on the hill?'' she asked in an interview. ``Why shouldn't
it be the institution that is part of us, but still different?''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, there is one thing people on both sides of the
argument agree on. And it was best expressed by none other than
Gen. Kennedy, whom Gutmann quotes in her book. ``This is not your
father's Army anymore,'' the general told cadets at West Point a
few years ago.

   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, April 2:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   UGANDA-CULT (Mbarara, Uganda) _ To the believers, the world was
to extinguish at the year 2000, so last December was a time for
forgiveness and, more practically, last-minute recruitment for the
world to come. By Ian Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-BLUEPRINT (Moscow) _ The victory of Vladimir Putin in
last Sunday's presidential elections has focused attention on an
opulent Moscow building known as Alexander House, where a team of
liberal-minded economists and other experts have been quietly
drafting Putin's blueprint for Russia. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   SERBIA-MONTENEGRO (Podgorica, Yugoslavia) _ For the last month,
in an eerie echo of tactics adopted by the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic, against Slovenia and other republics that broke
away from Belgrade in the early 1990s, Serbian authorities have
imposed a strict trade ban on goods passing between Montenegro and
Serbia. By Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   PERU-POLITICS (Lima, Peru) _ To those outside the Fujimori
administration, President Alberto Fujimori's intelligence chief,
Vladimiro Montesinos, is known as the Rasputin of Peru's politics.
His power in large part derives from his intimate knowledge of the
president's deepest personal secrets. Now, Montesinos is accused by
opponents of running a campaign of dirty tricks intended to assure
Fujimori's re-election on April 9, and Montesinos himself has
become a top issue in the race. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-MOB (Kobe, Japan) _ The authorities say that a besieged
Japanese yakuza, or mob, is now feeling the pinch of a weak economy
and an aggressive crackdown by police and community groups. This
accumulated threat to the mob's bread-and-butter businesses _
gambling, the sex trade, drug trafficking, protection rackets _ has
sparked a bitter and often violent struggle among rival gangs for
control of shrinking criminal enterprises. By Calvin Sims.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-U.S. (Washington) _ A broad look at U.S.-China policy. By
Joseph Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-DISSENT (Beijing) _ The widow of Edgar Snow, the American
journalist who was celebrated here as a ``friend of China'' for his
sympathetic portraits of the communist revolution, was prevented by
police Saturday from meeting a prominent critic of the 1989 army
crackdown on student democracy demonstrators. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   PEOPLE-TRADE (Washington) _ As many as 50,000 women and children
from Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe are brought to the
United States under false pretenses each year and forced to work as
prostitutes, abused laborers or servants, according to a Central
Intelligence Agency report that is the government's first
comprehensive assessment of the problem. By Joel Brinkley.
</P>
<P>
   ACHING-HEARTLAND (Tryon, Neb.) _ While most of the American
economy is going gangbusters, many rural areas are undergoing a
wrenching restructuring that is impoverishing small ranchers and
farmers, depopulating large chunks of rural America and changing
the way Americans get their food. The gains in farming and ranching
efficiency are staggering, but so too is the blow to the rural way
of life. A special report. By Nicholas D. Kristof.
</P>
<P>
   BORDER-PATROL (Sarita, Texas) _ After government vehicles ran
over and injured illegal immigrants on a vast cattle ranch here
twice in the past month, the ranch's owners notified the U.S.
Border Patrol that its agents could no longer pursue their quarry
on ranch property. The John G. and Marie Stella Kenedy Memorial
Foundation, which owns the Kenedy Ranch, made its decision because
it believes that the Border Patrol has been violating immigrants'
human rights. By Ross E. Milloy.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-GAS-PRICES (Los Angeles) _ Gas prices may have risen
across the nation in recent months, as a tight oil supply has
driven up the cost of crude oil. But nowhere in the country are the
increases more astounding than in California. By Christian
Berthelsen.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBS-IRS (Washington) _ Republicans in the House proposed
legislation Saturday to help taxpayers in their dealings with the
Internal Revenue Service, and called for hearings this month on
developing an entirely new tax system. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   LENDER-CRACKDOWN (Undated) _ After several years of inaction,
pressure is building in Washington to impose tighter rules on banks
and finance companies that specialize in lending money to
homeowners with blemished credit records. By Diana B. Henriques.
</P>
<P>
   TIME-CAPSULE (South Hadley, Mass.) _ Over the century, the box
sat quietly in the Mount Holyoke College library, then in the
comptroller's office, then on a shelf in the school archives, and
finally on the dorm room floor of Sara Hines, president of the
class of 2000. Hines had little idea what was in the oak cube,
which measured a little more than a foot on each side. A plaque on
its top described it is as a legacy from the class of 1900 to their
sisters in the class of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY (Miami) _ Developments in the Elian Gonzalez case.
</P>
<P>
   NIGHT-CHILDCARE (New York) _ In recent years _ particularly
after the 1996 welfare overhaul sent millions of parents into the
work force, many on shifts at odd hours _ dozens of cities and
states have taken steps to supply working parents with
round-the-clock child care. But New York City, perhaps the most
aggressive in the nation in reducing the welfare rolls and putting
people to work for their benefits, has until recently not been part
of the movement toward publicly financed, flexible-hour child care.
By Sarah Kershaw.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   SOFT-MONEY (Undated) _ George Gorton had not thought much about
Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code _ at least not until last
year. That was when Gorton started Shape the Debate, a nonprofit
political organization that, under Section 527, can raise and spend
unlimited amounts of money, with no disclosure requirements for
donors, as long as it does not expressly advocate the election or
defeat of any candidate. The group is among the latest entrants in
a growing field of independent campaign expenditure efforts,
spurred on by recent court rulings interpreting the tax law. By
Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Pennsylvania race sputters to a
close; A Bush loyalist in McCain country; Nader keeps running a bit
like a Corvair. By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The ritual was exasperating for Pete Mackanin. Every time his
21-year-old relief specialist did not pitch well, the manager of
the Class AA Bowie Baysox would have to talk him out of quitting.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Benitez did not fail often, and he was despondent when
he did. His postgame conversations with Mackanin in the manager's
office went like this:
</P>
<P>
   Benitez: ``I'm going home.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackanin: ``Come on, Armando. You don't mean that.''
</P>
<P>
   Benitez: ``Yes, I do!''
</P>
<P>
   Then Benitez would storm off, leaving Mackanin to hope that the
Baltimore Orioles' star prospect would not, in fact, catch the next
flight for the Dominican Republic. He never did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd always come back the next day and say, `Pete, I'm sorry,
I'm going to pitch, I'll be OK now,''' said Mackanin, now a coach
for the Montreal Expos. ``But the next time it'd happen, he'd be in
again.''
</P>
<P>
   It would continue happening after Benitez, who is now 27,
reached the majors later in that 1994 season.
</P>
<P>
   When Benitez was bothered by an injury in 1996, his agent, Mike
Powers, packed Benitez's bags and told him he would call the
airlines if he was serious about going home. Also that year, when
Benitez blew a save and cost the Orioles' ace, Mike Mussina, his
20th victory, he broke down in tears, saying he wanted to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates would challenge Benitez to make good on his threats.
``Get your luggage ready,'' the former Oriole Jesse Orosco
remembers hearing. ``There's a car waiting outside for you.''
</P>
<P>
   In the depths of his despair, New York was sometimes a beacon to
Benitez _ but not because of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of frustration,'' he said. ``I wasn't real
patient. I said I would rather drive a taxi in New York than be
here. I disappointed my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Benitez would have to drive a cab for centuries to make the kind
of money he is making now in New York. After a successful first
season with the Mets last year, Benitez signed a four-year, $22
million contract in February. It was the Mets' largest financial
commitment of the winter.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets acquired Benitez from Baltimore in December 1998,
in the three-way trade that sent catcher Todd Hundley to the Los
Angeles Dodgers, they were told Benitez was an intense competitor
who could improve his emotional control. He gave them everything
they wanted _ 77 games, a 1.85 earned run average and 22 saves in
28 chances _ without the theatrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He grew leaps and bounds last year,'' Mets General Manager
Steve Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez has been growing _ physically and emotionally _ since he
was signed at age 17. The Orioles scout Carlos Bernhardt had
watched him in the Dominican Republic, and although Benitez threw
only in the range of 80 miles an hour, he had an easy motion and a
6-foot-4-inch frame. Bernhardt had to fly to Florida, so he called
his wife, Janet, and asked her to bring a contract to Benitez's
home and sign him. She did.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez received only $2,000 that day, but it was his first step
in helping his mother escape poverty. The family had a home, but
Benitez spent most of his days in the streets while his mother
worked several jobs. Later, when Benitez's frustrations with
baseball seemed overwhelming, Bernhardt would remind him why he was
playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes that if you help your mother, God will pay you
back double,'' Bernhardt said. ``That's what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his mother speaks English, Benitez did not speak it when
he signed. The language barrier was the most difficult adjustment
to make, he said, and it isolated him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He heard a lot of things that bothered him,'' said the
Orioles' bullpen coach, Elrod Hendricks, ``because he didn't quite
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Benitez's radar-gun readings were impressive, but his reluctance
to throw anything but fastballs frustrated coaches and teammates.
Mackanin remembers having to call sliders from the bench, because
Benitez was so insistent on throwing fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to put it in his head that you're not going to live
with that fastball,'' said Orosco, a 21-year veteran who added he
has never seen a harder thrower than Benitez. ``I mean, `I wish I
had your fastball, but I'd like to have other pitches, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   After a year as a set-up man, Benitez became the Orioles' closer
in 1998. He converted 22 of 26 save chances, but never felt that
the job was his alone. The bullpen would stir when Benitez got in
trouble, and he did not sense confidence from Manager Ray Miller.
The Orioles signed Mike Timlin as their closer in November '98,
effectively giving up on Benitez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep down inside, I think that getting away from here was
probably the best thing that happened to him, because he had a lot
of scars over here,'' Hendricks said. ``There were a lot of people
that he didn't trust.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets wanted a right-handed power pitcher to set up for
closer John Franco, and they targeted Benitez. When they got him,
Powers was unsure how his client _ who he said generally does not
respond well to change _ would handle New York. But almost
immediately, Benitez liked the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez was best known in New York for drilling Tino Martinez in
the back earlier in 1998, inciting a brawl with the Yankees. Jay
Horwitz, the Mets' media relations director, told Benitez he would
be hearing questions about the incident and asked how he wanted to
respond. It was a simple gesture, but it made an impression on
Benitez: he was not being told what to do, and his opinion was
respected. He has not always felt that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give respect to people who give it back to me,'' said
Benitez, who has expressed remorse and apologized to Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Powers said that to Benitez, respect means something different
than it does to most athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much, `Jump when I say jump,' but, `Treat me like
you treat everybody else, and we'll be fine _ say whatever you want
to me, but say it to my face,''' Powers said. ``People look at him
and they're intimidated, but he's pretty much a gentle guy. If you
talk to him straight, he responds well.''

   Benitez's English is much better than it was when he signed, but
he is still wary of using it because he does not want to be
misunderstood. His impulse is to stay out of the way, and that is
what he did when he first came to the Mets. But the Mets' relievers
made him feel welcome, even after Benitez became the closer when
Franco was injured in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I was scared to talk to these people _ what did people
say about me, `He's got a bad attitude,''' Benitez said. ``But John
Franco's a great guy, he talked to me, he showed me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can do what he can do. Four hundred saves _ I don't
think I'll ever be close to that. He never showed me he was mad; he
was happy, glad to have me, glad we're together. I didn't come to
take a job from anybody. Whatever they want to put me in, I try to
do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after Franco's injury, Benitez came in to save a game
against Tampa Bay. He allowed a run to tie the game, but in the
dugout after the inning he told Manager Bobby Valentine he wanted
to stay in. He stayed, the Mets got the lead, and Benitez finished
off the Devil Rays in the 10th. It was a sign to Phillips that
Benitez ``didn't let his emotions control his performance.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, Benitez walked two Dodgers in the bottom of the
ninth in Los Angeles. He looked to the bullpen, expecting to see
activity, and saw none. Benitez struck out the side, and excitedly
called his agent in Baltimore after the game, at about 3 a.m. He
had gotten the respect he craved.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to stay with a guy,'' Valentine said. ``You have to
understand you're just dealing with people.''
</P>
<P>
   Benitez's performance down the stretch _ he allowed one run
after Aug. 22 _ persuaded the Mets to explore a long-term deal with
him. Benitez considered the idea, too, although he questioned the
Mets' commitment to him when his name came up in trade rumors
involving Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   According to an official with close knowledge of the
Mets-Mariners discussions, the Mets were willing to include Benitez
in a trade if Seattle sent a potential closer back in the deal. No
deal was ever consummated, of course, because Griffey would not
accept a trade to the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   It took them a while, but the Mets and Benitez agreed to a
contract extension on Feb. 17, just hours before a scheduled
arbitration hearing.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he signed, Benitez's thoughts turned to all the good
he could do with the money, including ideas for apartment complexes
and baseball fields. Powers was struck by the sincerity with which
Phillips spoke to Benitez about his plans. Benitez is happy with
his teammates and Valentine, and he speaks like a man finally more
interested in staying than going.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing in my career, in my life, is people
who believe what I can do,'' Benitez said. ``This team has showed
me what I have to do, and they believe what I can do. They tell me,
`We know that you can do the job. Someday, very soon, you'll be
like a superstar.''' &QL;

<P>
   Like an adoring mother, Boston right fielder Troy O'Leary
cherishes his favorite Louisville Slugger bats. Model P72, all
black. He owes his professional life to them and treats them well,
protects them. He would never subject them to a terrible fate _ an
awkward collision with the fastball of Yankees closer Mariano
Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary does not want his favorite bats splintered and dispersed
in pieces all over the infield. So he leaves them in the bat rack,
instead using his second-string bats when he faces Rivera, whose
cut fastball _ the name by which it is known _ is considered by
many in baseball as the most devastating pitch in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Ryan Klesko, the slugger who faced Rivera in the last inning
of the last game of last year's World Series. Three times, Klesko
was left holding nothing but a broken bat handle, having shattered
two bats fouling off Rivera's cutter before splitting a third as he
grounded out. Some of his Atlanta teammates, moments away from
losing the World Series, covered their faces to hide or stifle
their laughs, having found comic relief in Klesko's futility
against Rivera's cutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you expect?'' Klesko said recently. ``The guy throws
97-mile-an-hour cutters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best pitch in baseball,'' said Darrin Fletcher,
Toronto's All-Star catcher. ``To face his cut fastball is the
toughest assignment in baseball to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thome, Cleveland's slugger, said: ``If you had to pick one
guy with devastating stuff, it's him, because of that pitch. It's
obvious they've won the world championships they have because of
him.''
</P>
<P>
   When a representative from Louisville Slugger arrived at the
Yankee camp this spring, second baseman Chuck Knoblauch suggested
that Rivera deserved a contract with the company. After all,
Knoblauch postulated, Rivera has single-handedly increased the
demand for bats by breaking so many.
</P>
<P>
   Other great pitchers throw great pitches. Pedro Martinez, the
Boston ace, throws three exceptional pitches, his fastball,
changeup and curveball. Arizona's Randy Johnson throws hard and has
a sweeping slider. Kevin Brown of the Dodgers has a vicious,
hard-sinking fastball.
</P>
<P>
   But the effectiveness of Martinez's changeup and curveball is
helped because hitters must anticipate his fastball, and similarly,
batters often flail at Johnson's slider because they assume he will
throw a fastball. Rivera essentially throws just one pitch, a
four-seam fastball he can manipulate expertly _ particularly
against left-handed batters _ and he dominates with that one pitch.
Batters know Rivera is going to throw his cutter; he might as well
announce it to the world. They still cannot hit it. ``The ball just
explodes on you,'' said Carlos Delgado, Toronto's star first
baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera is a bane to all batters. He didn't allow a run after
July 21 of last season, and carries a streak of 30 and two-thirds
scoreless innings into this year. According to Steve Hirdt of the
Elias Sports Bureau, he and Houston's Billy Wagner were the only
pitchers who held opponents to an on-base percentage and slugging
percentage of under .250. (Opponents had an on-base percentage of
.239 and a slugging percentage of .237 against Rivera.)
</P>
<P>
   But he is especially effective against left-handed batters,
unusual because Rivera is right-handed. Last year, left-handed
batters in the American League averaged one extra-base hit for
every 10.8 at-bats. Against Rivera, left-handed batters had two
extra-base hits _ one double and one home run, the latter hit by
Detroit's Bobby Higginson _ in 140 at-bats, or one every 70
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera fared well in his first three years in the majors, but
late in the 1997 season, he began toying with the grip on his
four-seam fastball. ``I just grabbed the ball one day and started
playing with it,'' Rivera recalled.
</P>
<P>
   By cocking his wrist slightly _ almost imperceptibly _ and
applying pressure on the ball with his fingers, he caused the pitch
to veer sharply to his left, away from right-handed batters and
toward left-handed batters. And he started breaking bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always had a good fastball,'' Delgado said, ``but once he
had that, he became tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for left-handed batters is that it is virtually
impossible for them to identify the pitch, either through the spin
or some quirky giveaway in Rivera's delivery. He uses the bodies of
the hitters in establishing his target, and throws the ball about
thigh high and over the inner third of the plate _ down and in,
``where most left-handed hitters like the ball,'' Fletcher said.
</P>
<P>
   And then it breaks, the pitch too hard and the movement too
dramatic for the hitter to stop his swing, and the ball attacks
their bat handles, as if it has a radar lock on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just keeps following you,'' Fletcher said. ``It just keeps
coming at you. You think it's over the inner half of the plate, and
it comes after you. We have this saying that a pitcher `gets in
your kitchen.' Rivera's cutter continually gets in your kitchen,
and you cannot get it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Thome said, ``It's out of his hand and looks like a regular
fastball, over the plate, and boom, it's on your knuckles.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no official statistics for broken bats, but he
probably averages between one and two per appearance. The Yankees'
fielders have adapted to Rivera's dominance of left-handers. When
there is a matchup of a right-handed pitcher and a left-handed
batter, the fielders normally shift a couple of steps toward the
right-field foul line, owing to the tendency of the batter to pull
the ball, and those fielders on the right side _ the first baseman,
second baseman and right fielder _ will move back a couple of
steps.
</P>
<P>
   But Rivera overpowers left-handers to the degree that Tino
Martinez, the first baseman, will move in because the swing of a
left-handed batter so often results in an exploding, disintegrating
bat and a dribbling ground ball. Ricky Ledee, the left fielder,
shifts in dramatically toward the infield, in the way he might
position himself if a pitcher were batting for the other team.
``They don't hit the ball hard very often,'' Ledee said with a
smile and shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing hitters uniformly mention Rivera's easy, gliding
pitching motion as a significant factor in his dominance. Rivera
begins his delivery by drawing up his leg deliberately, that big,
slow leg kick, before he starts his arm motion and _ pow! There is
the deception, like a timid-looking data entry clerk who turns out
to be spy.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera ``almost kind of lulls you to sleep with his delivery,''
Fletcher said. ``It gives you a false sense of security, and then
the ball is on you and it's exploding.''
</P>
<P>
   The leisurely delivery masks all that is happening as Rivera
throws the baseball. He is relatively frail, by today's major
league standards, with an undeveloped torso, spaghetti arms and a
thin neck. But he has the legs of a sprinter _ when the Yankees'
pitchers run for conditioning early in spring training, they gasp
and gripe about how easy the exercise comes to Rivera _ and his
legs serve him well in his delivery, his left leg leading him, his
right leg driving his body toward the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera draws his arm back and throws, but David Cone, Andy
Pettitte and others believe that Rivera's greatness stems from what
happens right at the end of his delivery: his hand extends far out
in front of him and his wrist snaps and the ball is released, like
a buggy whip.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I call him Inspector Gadget,'' Cone said. ``It's
like his arm has an extra extension that pops out of his shoulder.
He gets lots of extension, and there is that great wrist action;
his wrist is like a blur at the end of the pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To throw a fastball, a pitcher must keep his arm, wrist and
fingers essentially in line, to propel the ball at its center, in
the same way a pool stick is used to strike the cue ball for
maximum velocity at the start of the game. To throw a breaking
ball, a curveball or slider or forkball, pitchers basically grip a
part of the ball, to create an unusual spin _ in the way you would
strike a pool ball on its edges to make it veer _ but the velocity
is decreased dramatically. Increased movement, decreased velocity.
</P>
<P>
   This is what distinguishes Rivera's cut fastball: It has
incredible velocity, 93 to 96 miles an hour, but also incredible
movement, darting and diving as much as a foot by the time it
reaches the plate, according to Yankee catcher Jorge Posada. ``It
moves in on you so late,'' Thome said. ``It's hard to make an
adjustment on him. And this game is all about adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many options for hitters. Sometimes they will move
toward the front of the batter's box, toward the pitcher, against
someone with dramatic late movement in a particular pitch. But
Rivera throws too hard to do that; the hitter, already left with
precious little reaction time, won't move closer to Rivera.
``Moving up in the box sounds great in theory,'' Yankee shortstop
Derek Jeter said, ``but if you're standing there, you couldn't talk
yourself into doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Batters might try to take a pitch or two, try to get ahead in
the count and force Rivera to throw a regular four-seam fastball
over the middle of the plate. But Rivera's control is impeccable.
He has refined his mastery of the pitch, Cone said, and knows how
to control the movement. Rivera went more than 14 months, for
example, without walking the first batter he faced upon entering a
game. ``He throws enough strikes so that you have to be
aggressive,'' Thome said.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher smiled in a self-deprecating way when he revealed his
own approach. ``The best way, like I've told myself every year, is
to try to make sure the ball is in the outer half of the strike
zone, and if it's not, then take it and take a walk,'' Fletcher
said.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to hit Rivera, then, might be to draw a walk. Some
other hitters mentioned O'Leary's approach as unique. He appeared
to step into the pitch as he batted against Rivera in the playoffs
last year, and he had a single and a double in two at-bats. But
when O'Leary was told that other players noted his method of
attacking Rivera, O'Leary was taken aback. He wasn't trying to do
anything special, he said. He usually gets his feet moving in every
at-bat. What he does against Rivera is battle, and save his best
bats.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera's cut fastball is not technically a cut fastball, at
least not as it is usually thrown. Pitchers throw cutters with a
different grip, a different motion. ``It's just a four-seam
fastball with unbelievable movement,'' said Mel Stottlemyre, the
Yankees' pitching coach.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre is persuaded that the size of Rivera's hands and
fingers _ not unusually large or small _ are somehow perfectly
suited to create the break on the ball. It might be his wrist
action, his arm extension. Robert Adair, a professor of physics at
Yale University and a baseball expert, quoted another physicist:
``There are two problems I really don't understand: What is the
fundamental theory of a universe, and the other is why a curveball
curves. In my lifetime, I can see my way to understanding the
first, but not the second.''
</P>
<P>
   Adair went on to offer a simplified explanation: air resistance
affects the movement, so that if the ball is thrown twice as fast,
the air resistance will be four times greater. And if a ball is
thrown 95 miles an hour, Adair said, the hitter must decide so
quickly whether to swing or not that ``their eyes might as well be
closed'' in the last 30 feet of its journey homeward.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Stanton, a Yankee reliever, has a more elementary
theory: ``It's a gift from God,'' he said, ``and he's a freak.'' &QL;

   Dr. Alex Comfort, who died on March 26, personified the sort of
tweedy English intellectual who could gracefully range from subject
to subject. He was a physician, poet, novelist, anarchist, pacifist
and a leading researcher on how people age.
</P>
<P>
   But to millions of people around the world, Comfort, who was 80,
will be remembered only for his book, ``The Joy of Sex: A Gourmet
Guide to Lovemaking'' (Crown, 1972). To his considerable chagrin,
his 50 other books, ranging from medical textbooks to metaphysical
poetry, were totally eclipsed by the graphically illustrated sex
book he knocked out in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Burgess may have compared his intellect with Machiavelli
and Voltaire, but Comfort rued that he would never escape the
``albatross'' of his $3 million best seller. He feared he would
forever be Dr. Sex.
</P>
<P>
   A glance at his oeuvre, however, reveals a multifaceted mind. In
his 1945 novel, ``The Power House'' (Viking Press), he argues for
life over abstract ideas:
</P>
<P>
   ``The lunatics either desire you or fear you, and I do not know
which kills you more rapidly. Banners are waved in your face, guns
are thrust in your ribs, grinning flat-footed gangs of citizens,
all mouthing the same bilge, push you and threaten to educate you
by cutting your throat. People ask, what is the use of life to a
slave? That's bilge _ what's the use of freedom to a corpse?''
</P>
<P>
   His 1948 essay, ``The Novel and Our Time'' (Alan Swallow),
advanced the theory that writers use their art as a means of
liberation. The writer, he said, ``does not learn to write so that
he can `write,' but because without the necessary tools he cannot
dig his way out of prison.''
</P>
<P>
   His 1949 novel, ``On This Side of Nothing'' (Viking), addressed
the meaning of being a Jew: ``There was something unnatural in his
assumption that the ghetto would shelter him _ he was taking a good
deal too much for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I had reached some conclusions of my own before that in
the earliest weeks of the siege, that Jews are not born, but made;
that everyone who runs, who disobeys, who prefers living to
obeying, is a Jew. Doesn't he carry his ghetto around with him, in
every country, at every time?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Comfort wrote ``Darwin and the Naked Lady'' (George
Braziller). He considered the relationship between Darwin and
Freud. ``Freud has had the greater effect on our understanding of
behavior, aesthetic behavior in particular, but Darwin provides the
groundwork for the understanding of Freud. We had better,
therefore, take them together.''
</P>
<P>
   As shown in his 1966 book, ``The Nature of Human Nature''
(Harper &AMP; Row), he did not believe in sugarcoating hard truths. ``
`Hell,' said a Sartre character, `is other people.' It can also be
ourselves. Man is the only animal which is inherently able,
corporately and individually, to be his own worst enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally dark was his view of old age, as presented in ``A Good
Age'' (Crown, 1976). At retirement age, he commented that people
are ``rendered unemployed, useless and, in some cases,
impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that transition, and in proportion to their
chronological age, they are prescribed to be unintelligent,
unemployable, crazy and asexual.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Sex? ``In the days of formal dancing one used to wish
that the girl had her breasts on her back where one could reach
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dr. Alex Comfort was more than that.

   Thinking about it even six months ago, Alex Rodriguez figured
that Ken Griffey Jr. would open the 2000 season in Seattle and that
he would begin it somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought I'd be the guy to go, and he would stay
because he was a franchise guy,'' Rodriguez said as he prepared for
what promises to be a tumultuous season for him, Griffey and other
members of the game's elite corps.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, as it turned out, had the locations reversed. He will
be in Seattle for the Mariners' opener Tuesday and Griffey will be
elsewhere _ in Cincinnati Monday afternoon playing center field for
the Reds, who were the only team he wanted to go to once the
Mariners decided they had to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   Before signing a discounted deal with the Reds, Griffey had been
eligible to be a free agent at the end of the 2000 season, just as
Rodriguez is. So are Juan Gonzalez and Mike Hampton, who were
traded, and Manny Ramirez, Chipper Jones, Mike Mussina, Brad Radke,
John Wetteland and Robb Nen, who were not. Like Griffey, Shawn
Green was traded and signed a new contract, forgoing his chance to
be a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Griffey and Green, the 2000 class of free agents
promises to be special. Not since the advent of eight-figure
salaries and nine-figure contracts has there been such a glittering
group of players who could make an impact on division races because
of their status as potential free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Their impending availability even made an impact on this past
winter's free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were looking ahead to next year's free-agent list,''
Doug Melvin, the Texas general manager, said, ``and didn't want to
overspend on this year's list when they thought they would have a
chance at next year's list.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, Gonzalez, Hampton and Green were traded because their
clubs determined they would not be able to sign them to contract
extensions. Those players, in effect, became advance free agents,
given a chance to secure a lucrative contract a year early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember this many guys being traded ahead of time the
way they were,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Tigers have tried to sign Gonzalez, offering him
$140 million for eight years, and the Mets talked with Hampton's
agent about a new contract. But neither has signed. Griffey signed
with the Reds and Green with Los Angeles because those were the
cities where they wanted to play.
</P>
<P>
   Of the others in the group, some have been offered contracts,
some not. Some could sign with their teams and not become free
agents, some could remain unsigned and become free agents, some
could be traded during the season if their teams decide they don't
want to lose them and get nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever they go, wherever they stay, at least some will have an
impact on the outcome of the races.
</P>
<P>
   With Griffey, the Mariners would be favored to finish first in
their division; without him, they may still win but not as handily.
The Reds, on the other hand, have been tagged generally as the team
most likely to win their division.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will miss Gonzalez's booming bat and, by extension,
the playoffs. The Tigers think he gives them a chance for
postseason play, but that thought might represent wishful thinking.
The Dodgers believe Green's left-handed hitting will make a big
difference in their season, but that difference won't necessarily
translate into extra October games.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton gives the Mets the legitimate No. 1 starting pitcher
they lacked. Some people think his presence puts the Mets in
position to topple the Atlanta Braves from their perennial
first-place perch. At the same time, Hampton's departure from
Houston leaves a huge void in the Astros' rotation and is expected
to help end their three-year reign as division champions.
</P>
<P>
   Of the potential free agents who remain with their teams,
Baltimore won't be trading Mussina because his contract gives him
the right to veto a trade, and Cleveland won't very likely trade
Ramirez or Atlanta Jones because they are players crucial to the
teams' postseason plans. Rodriguez is certainly that with the
Mariners, who have said they will not trade the power-hitting
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have offered to make Rodriguez wealthy, inviting
him last year to sign an eight-year, $128 million contract. Some
people have speculated, however, that Scott Boras, his agent, will
try to make him the first player to get a $200 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an attractive thing to me,'' Rodriguez said when
asked about being the highest-paid player in history. ``I do
realize as a union member I have a responsibility to try to get
whatever the market value is and then go from there because I feel
I'm one of the leaders in this venue of where we're going. It
affects other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York native actually seemed to find the stratosphere
that salaries have reached repulsive.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's sick,'' he said, talking about the money. ``I fear a
little bit for the fan. Where's the fan in all of this? Baseball
has some problems that have to be addressed soon. We can't let it
get out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who last season hit 42 home runs in only 502 times at
bat, or one every 12 at-bats, was adamant about leaving his future
for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' he said, ``I want to play in Seattle. I'm
focusing on this ball club. When the year is over, I'll give that a
lot more thought.''
</P>
<P>
   How far the Mariners go this year could influence his thinking,
Rodriguez said, but then he added: ``You may have one chance in
your life to be a free agent. I want to really make a smart
decision. I want to talk it over with my mom, my brothers and my
sister and my counselor and then make a wise decision. I don't want
to rush the biggest decision of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'm a little bit nervous. I've never been down this
road before. So I'm kind of going into a dark tunnel of
expectations. I don't know what I'm doing. It's not like I'm
sitting here and being a cool guy. This might come back and slap me
in the face. That's the chance I'm going to take.''

</P>
<P>
   With Rodriguez, Gonzalez, Ramirez and Jones free agents at the
same time, along with some other highly rated players, baseball's
capacity to find homes for all of them may be tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably more free agents than there are teams who
could sign these guys,'' the Rangers' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   But then no one ever thought the Reds would sign Griffey, even
if they did get a ``discount'' at $116.5 million for nine years.
The Mariners had offered Griffey $138 million for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect I don't really think it was a situation where
they picked me over him,'' Rodriguez said. ``I think it was more
like he wanted to go back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Lincoln, the Mariners' new chairman and chief executive
officer, let the players know, Rodriguez said, that if they didn't
want to be in Seattle, the Mariners didn't want them to be there.
How does that policy apply to him?
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't, because I want to be here,'' Rodriguez said. ``I
want to give it a chance. I signed a four-year deal, not a
seven-year deal, and I want to honor that. I had an option to sign
a seven-year deal, but I didn't want to do that. I want to finish
what I start. I want to go quietly about it. Contrary to what
people believe, I'm very happy with what I've got. I'm one of the
best-paid 24-year-olds around.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez had played in the major leagues less than two years
when he signed a four-year, $10.6 million contract in July 1996.
Five months earlier Griffey, with seven years in the majors, agreed
to a four-year, $34 million contract. Not that money had anything
to do with it, but Griffey and Rodriguez were not the best buddies
some people assumed they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I was the new kid on the block; he was a star,''
Rodriguez said of their relationship. ``It was never where we'd
take off together, visit each other in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, it got much better with time because we both gained a lot
of respect for each other. We were like brothers. Brothers are
always on each other, kind of jiving each other back and forth.
There was an unbelievable amount of respect from both sides. I
think it was mutual. But as we got playing with each other longer,
we both realized we cared about each other's careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Griffey is gone and Rodriguez reigns as the No. 1 player in
the Mariners' domain, at least for this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a guy who needs people to say he's the man,'' he said.
``I've felt to a degree I've been a leader on this ball club. I
just go about it in a little different way. I'm not real vocal
about anything. I don't raise the flag and tell everybody I'm a
leader. I'm not that type of guy. If the question is would I rather
play with Grif or without him, I'd rather play with him.
Absolutely. It's not like I'm here throwing a party because he's
gone. That couldn't be further from the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   What is true is Rodriguez's envy of his good friend, Derek
Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he said when asked if he was envious of Jeter's three
World Series rings. ``I would like to win the World Series. I would
love to be in that situation where I'm winning. That's what the
game is all about. Whether he has more home runs than me or he's a
better hitter than me and a better defender, I'm not jealous of
that. But the rings, that's what we play for.'' &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   She didn't want to visit Tampa for spring training. She doesn't
like packing for a trip, driving to the airport or squeezing into a
seat on a cramped plane. She wasn't going to go. But Joe calmly
asked her to reconsider. Visit us, it will relax you, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe made it sound so comforting, so appropriate, so she did it.
She went to Florida. He was right. It was serene. She stayed home
most of the time with Joe's wife, Ali, and their 4-year-old
daughter, Andrea. They ate together after Joe returned from the
ballpark, they rented movies, they talked about everything and
nothing. It was a soothing brand of fun.
</P>
<P>
   She watched her little brother come home with a Barbie dollhouse
one day, patiently put the massive pink structure together and
casually crawl inside it with Andrea. When Andrea invited her to
play in it, too, she told Andrea that she couldn't get down on the
floor because she might never get up again.
</P>
<P>
   She is Sister Marguerite Torre, 69, and Joe is Joe Torre. She is
the principal of Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary School in
Queens, N.Y., watching over 400 students. He is the manager of the
Yankees, watching over 25 players. She prays for him and prays with
him, always an older sister looking out for her younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I worry about him,'' she said. ``He's our baby.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been exhilarating for her to watch Joe, who she felt was
unfairly tagged as a lovable loser, manage the Yankees to three
World Series titles in the past four years. She has watched him
succeed through the death of a brother in 1996, through the heart
transplant of another brother five months later and through his own
ordeal with prostate cancer last year. When Sister Marguerite was
asked about the confluence of emotions, she spoke about Joe for
five minutes and barely stopped for a breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really found himself,'' she said. ``He feels good, he's
so happy and he's such a caring person. He really is a special
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people look at Torre and see a quiet, confident manager. He
is the man who has drastically changed the perception of his
career, who has figured out how to coexist with the Yankees'
principal owner, George Steinbrenner, and who will try to lead the
team to its third straight championship. Most people see Joe and
see a winner now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the perfect manager,'' Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter said.
``I think if someone gave me a notepad and asked me to draw up the
perfect manager, he'd be the one.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Marguerite looks at Joe and, occasionally, she still sees
a little boy. She still sees Joe as a mischievous kid trying to
emulate Rocco and Frank, his brothers. She gave Joe his first
expensive glove when he was 11 years old. She thought about giving
him rosary beads instead, but she gave him the glove and told him
to say one ``Our Father'' every time he slipped it on.
</P>
<P>
   But, beyond the boy, she also sees a 59-year-old man who has
matured. She sees patience and peacefulness that didn't always
exist, not when Joe was trudging through two unsuccessful
marriages. Sister Marguerite, along with her sister, Rae, looks at
Joe and marvels at the way he has endured and triumphed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a terrific amount of satisfaction about what's happened
and what he's done,'' she said after returning from her weeklong
trip to Tampa. ``Not only what he's done for the Yankees, but what
he's done for New York. He's a great role model.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe calls whenever he has something important to tell her, even
if it is 2:30 in the morning. The phone in the convent will ring
three times and, if she doesn't answer, he will call again in a few
hours. He won't leave a message. Joe called 13 months ago, didn't
even warn her and blurted out that he had prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not possible,'' she said. ``There's no cancer in our
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe firmly said, ``There is now.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day Joe called and for months afterward, she was numb.
She doesn't know how he stayed so strong through the surgery and
the treatment, but it has a lot to do with Ali, and, of course,
Andrea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awful,'' Sister Marguerite said. ``It was a nightmare.
I had an inner lump that I didn't think would ever go away. I just
hope he's better now and it doesn't come back.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not like to talk much about the cancer, she said. He
will answer one or two questions about his health, but it is not
something he wants to elaborate on so she does not pry. She is
amazed about his rigid diet. They went to a fancy Italian
restaurant and he ate spinach. He passed her his plate. He always
does that. She took a bite and it was so bland. There was no
seasoning, but he didn't mind. He doesn't complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people say, `Your poor family' to me,'' she said.
``But we're no different than anyone. We're a typical family. This
happens. This is what life is all about. Joe says that, too. Why
should we be any different?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. A family in Sister Marguerite's parish has an 8-year-old
with cancer. Why should the Torres be any different? Why should
they be absolved from pain and suffering?
</P>
<P>
   Truthfully, though, Joe is different for other reasons. He used
to be a regular Joe, a superb player but a manager with a record
under .500. Now fans feel as if the manager were their Uncle Joe,
an uncle with a golden touch, and Sister Marguerite loves it. When
someone writes to her about Joe, she always responds and includes
an autographed picture. Not a prepackaged 8-by-10, but family
pictures that she compels Joe to sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have such an admiration for him,'' she said. ``I've had
some people tell me they love him, people who don't even know
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe told her during spring training that Andrea's walk is like
hers, but she has a secret for him. When Sister Marguerite walks
across the schoolyard, the students snicker and tell her that she
looks like Joe walking to the mound to change pitchers. So, if
Andrea walks way she does, it's because Joe walks that way, too.
</P>
<P>
   Joe actually got Sister Marguerite to walk regularly in Tampa,
telling her that she would be healthier if she walked 30 minutes a
day. Again, Joe was right. She walked so often that she developed a
heel spur. Joe offered to send an exercise bicycle, but Sister
Marguerite has one and dislikes it, so she will resume walking when
her foot heals and the weather gets warmer.
</P>
<P>
   That will be soon. It is April, time for another baseball
season. She wants Joe to visit her elementary school again this
year. Joe persuaded her to visit Florida, so now Sister Marguerite
wants him to visit her students in Queens before he decides that he
no longer wants to manage the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't ever imagine what he will be like without baseball,''
she said. ``He's a perennial boy of summer. He comes to life with
it. It's a fulfillment. It's part of what he needs to be a person.
He's like a big kid.''

BASEBALL 2000: WITH A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY, THE EXPOS PONDER A
TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ A young man walked over to another man who was
sitting at a table, leaned over and embraced him, placing the side
of his face against the older man's back for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   The young man was Michael Barrett, the Montreal Expos' third
baseman. The man he hugged with obvious sincerity was his boss,
Jeffrey Loria, the Expos' new managing partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't rehearsed,'' Loria quickly said to a reporter as
they sat at the table outside the team's spring training clubhouse.
But the embrace was yet another sign that times have surely changed
with the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat in the sunshine before a recent exhibition game, Loria
was in the shadow of another sign, a row of 10 silver flagpoles
topped by flags that celebrated the native countries of the players
on the team's roster _ the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia,
the rest Latin American contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my gesture,'' Loria said. ``My way of saying we're all in
this together this year as family.''
</P>
<P>
   And there were the T-shirts the players wore under their
uniforms, the ones that sent an eloquent message in Japanese,
French, Spanish and English: ``Why not us?'' on the front, ``Why
not now?'' on the back.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in years, there is life in the Expos' midst.
Players go about their business with smiles on their faces,
determination in their hearts and belief in their minds. Why not
them? Why not now?
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was a very successful businessman,'' Felipe Alou,
the team's patient and loyal manager, said of the international art
dealer from New York. ``When he took over this club, I believed if
he led this club the way he did his business, this was going to be
a successful time. That was my impression. And so far so good. I
know that the feeling I'm expressing now is unanimous with the
players and the staff. He means business. The ultimate goal is to
win as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   When in his eight-year tenure with the Expos had Alou had that
feeling? ``Never,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since payrolls began escalating exponentially, the Expos
have been the epitome of a low-revenue club. Their $15 million
payroll was lowest in the major leagues last year, but four months
after Loria became chairman and chief executive officer, the
payroll has virtually doubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been the driving force behind it all,'' said Jim Beattie,
in his fifth year as the team's general manager. ``He's taking the
payroll to a point where you can acquire some players. You can take
a look at some of the avenues that we've not looked at in the past,
like free agency, and acquire in a few trades players that make a
couple million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The Expos have picked up first baseman Lee Stevens and pitcher
Hideki Irabu in trades. They signed Graeme Lloyd, a left-handed
relief specialist, as a free agent, luring him north for $9 million
over three years, a package uncharacteristic of the Expos that
prompted looks of disbelief from other clubs. But the Lloyd
signing, which took place 11 days after Loria assumed command of
the club, was a deliberate message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a surprise to me that I would come to Montreal,'' the
Australian reliever said. ``I wasn't expecting to come here in my
free agency year. I had 9 or 10 teams looking at me. It came down
to the owner bringing me down here, telling me about what has in
line for the future for baseball in Montreal. He really changed my
mind about how the team used to be, where once you got to
arbitration they'd lose their best players. I feel they have a
strong nucleus that has a chance to win. He really changed my mind
in that respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire environment has changed. ``I've talked to all the
guys here,'' Lloyd said. ``In the past few years, it's been let's
go out there and develop. Now it's let's go out there and win.''
</P>
<P>
   A New York native, the 59-year-old Loria is trying to salvage
the Expos for Montreal by producing a winning team that will bring
fans back to the ballpark, a new ballpark, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to put a lot of pieces together,'' Loria said,
speaking of the effort to get financing for a new park. ``It will
be resolved in the next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Life for the Expos, however, is not easy in Montreal. Besides
fighting to get a new place to play, Loria has been unable to
negotiate television and radio deals for the rights to the team's
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to give away the product, and I don't want to pay
for the right to be on the air,'' Loria said. ``It should be the
reverse. It's very difficult when a broadcaster comes to you and
says, `Here's my offer and you don't have any options.' The
broadcasters there feel it's a promotional tool that's needed. I
may have gone in there and saved the team, but I don't think it's
reasonable that I continuously have to do that year in and year
out, especially when you know to be competitive the salaries have
to go up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past the Expos have traded players or let them leave as
free agents because they couldn't pay the salaries other teams were
paying. During Alou's tenure as manager, the list of departed
players has included Larry Walker, Moises Alou, Marquis Grissom,
Henry Rodriguez, Mike Lansing, Pedro Martinez, John Wetteland and
Ken Hill.
</P>
<P>
   If Loria had come along five or six years ago, Felipe Alou was
asked, what did he think might have happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be managing right now,'' he said. ``We'd have
probably won two or three pennants. I'd be here with a necktie
watching this camp.'' &QL;

<P>
   When the Supreme Court upheld an ordinance last week banning
nude dancing in Erie, Pa., the American public was treated to the
spectacle of hearing Justice Sandra Day O'Connor somberly discuss
the protective qualities of pasties and G-strings, which the law
requires dancers to wear.
</P>
<P>
   The court has tackled such matters before. In 1991 the justices
upheld an Indiana public indecency law that also banned nude
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   And four years ago, in a case involving a similar statute in St.
John's County, Fla., the court refused to overturn lower-court
decisions that rejected the argument that the ban violated erotic
dancers' freedom of artistic expression.
</P>
<P>
   That case also provided an unusual insight into the legal mind
at work. It turns out the St. John's County law, which requires
that about one-third of a dancer's buttocks be covered, went to
great lengths _ 328 words, to be exact _ to define that unlikely
battleground for First Amendment rights:
</P>
<P>
   ``The area at the rear of the human body (sometimes referred to
as the glutaeus maximus) which lies between two imaginary lines
running parallel to the ground when a person is standing, the first
or top of such line being one-half inch below the top of the
vertical cleavage of the nates (i.e., the prominence formed by the
muscles running from the back of the hip to the back of the leg)
and the second or bottom line being one-half inch above the lowest
point of the curvature of the fleshy protuberance (sometimes
referred to as the gluteal fold), and between two imaginary lines,
one on each side of the body (the `outside lines'), which outside
lines are perpendicular to the ground and to the horizontal lines
described above and which perpendicular outside lines pass through
the outermost point(s) at which each nate meets the outer side of
each leg.

   ``Nothwithstanding the above, buttocks shall not include the
leg, the hamstring muscle below the gluteal fold, the tensor

human body that is between either the left inside perpendicular
line and the left outside perpendicular line or the right inside
perpendicular line and the right outside perpendicular line. For
the purpose of the previous sentence the left inside perpendicular
line shall be an imaginary line on the left side of the anus that

shall be an imaginary line on the right side of the anus that is

described as covering one-third of the buttocks centered over the
cleavage for the length of the cleavage.)''

SPORTS COLUMN: AN E-MAIL ADDRESS WITH A LOT OF LIP GIVING ADVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the initial public offering of TheLipsite, which will be
dedicated to dispensing advice (free, if necessary) to the
operating officers of sports organizations important enough to
deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, those honored are Steve Phillips of the Mets, Bill
Parcells of the Jets and whoever succeeds Neil Smith as president
and general manager of the Rangers. Good luck to all of you. Ignore
the following at your peril. Smith did. He was melted.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets returned from Tokyo last week, where they opened the
regular season by splitting two games with the Chicago Cubs, who
got to make the trip because the St. Louis Cardinals, the first
choice of Major League Baseball, voted not to go. The Cards' star,
Mark McGwire, the player whom the Japanese most wanted to see, had
persuaded his teammates that the globalization of the game was just
another exploitational, money-grubbing tactic by the owners and not
in the spirit of the national pastime. Also, as McGwire phrased it,
``To go play worldwide doesn't turn my crank.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, despite his home run record, is no Babe Ruth, who was
such a sensation in Japan that during World War II, when U.S.
troops cursed the emperor, Japanese troops cursed the Bambino.
Furthermore, McGwire's disdain for greed _ settling into St. Louis
three years ago he took less money than he would have earned by
becoming a free agent a year later _ makes him a truly dangerous
influence on the pastime, not to mention the nation. He says, ``I
take the game seriously,'' and we know that he has put his
supplements where his mouth is.
</P>
<P>
   Here is where Phillips can make a difference. To show that the
game has as much integrity as McGwire, its reigning diva, the Mets
must buy John Rocker, stash him in the bullpen and never give him
the ball. Eat his salary. Close the spigot on the bigot. To put a
man who saved 38 games last year, with a 2.49 earned run average,
on ice, would show the world that going to Japan wasn't just about
opening a new market, it was about embracing the world, that
big-hearted, bucolic baseball isn't taking its lessons from
in-your-face, mean street basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association _ which forfeited its
purpose as a game when it decided to become a catalog for gear _ is
losing television fans and blaming it on Tiger Woods, who is a more
upscale clothes and equipment model than Vince Carter or any of
hoopla's not-Michaels.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, TheLipsite has never given Coach Parcells any advice
because until now he hasn't needed it. But, like Phillips, he is
now in position to save his game.
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League has been frantically meeting of
late, supposedly to discuss what seems to be an escalating trend of
off-field violence among its players. This may not actually be the
case; two young men being accused of killing people is not exactly
a new story. And the league has made a convincing case that its
players _ college-educated millionaires _ have no higher a
percentage of felonies than the high school dropouts they left
behind in their farm communities and inner-city neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   What the NFL is really concerned about is the obvious; there is
simply not enough violence ON the field. Because players are not
allowed to fully express themselves with sack dances, touchdown
spikes, cheap shots, leg twists, helmet whacks (those pile-on
orgies are not enough), they have to trash bars, beat up
bystanders, wreck cars and abuse domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
   This will all become terribly clear when the so-called
``smash-mouth football'' of the World Wrestling Federation and the
National Broadcasting Co. conVinces America that McMahon, not
Lombardi, is our current spiritual coach. The XFL players will
satisfy their violent needs on the field and not have to endanger
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Parcells comes in. He is the only man who can
conVince his friend, Bob Knight, to leave his faltering college
basketball career and start fresh as the Jets' spiritual counselor.
Knight's crude language, abusive behavior and questionable
motivational tactics (he once placed a tampon in a player's locker)
obviously no longer works at Indiana, which yet again failed to
make the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for Knight to bring his bag of dirty tricks to pro
football, to fire up those surly meatmen, get them hurting each
other instead of us. The Jets could ignite the entire NFL and keep
death and destruction where it belongs, between the white lines.
</P>
<P>
   Which bring us to the National Hockey League, my personal fave.
Sure, there has been unusual cruelty lately, players viciously
attacking each other with their sticks, but it has been on the ice.
TheLipsite is concerned that restrictive new rules will so
frustrate goons, enforcers and mean streakers that they will begin
to take off the gloves, so to speak, outside the arena and fight
with their fans.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Neil Smith's replacement comes in. It's a little
touchy, because of a possible conflict of interest. The very best
person for the job, and you know who that is, would immediately
bring back the three most ferocious men who ever graced Ranger
blue: Mark Messier, Tie Domi and Coach Mike Keenan. One can only
imagine the fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Let any opposing player even breathe heavily on Messier in his
dotage, and think how Domi and Adam Graves would respond.
Meanwhile, Keenan's grasp of motivational psychology _ he makes
Knight seem decently straightforward _ would have the Rangers so
crazed they would be sharpening their skates into straight razors.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle for team control between Messier and Keenan would
have the Rangers using those razors on each others' throats.
Meanwhile, we fans would be safe for another season.
</P>
<P>
   If you have any problems with any of this, let me know at
TheLipsite(at)aol.com. It would really turn my crank.

LEGAL MINDS AT WORK: DEFINING NUDITY ON A FIRST AMENDMENT

<P>
   When the Supreme Court upheld an ordinance last week banning
nude dancing in Erie, Pa., the American public was treated to the
spectacle of hearing Justice Sandra Day O'Connor somberly discuss
the protective qualities of pasties and G-strings, which the law
requires dancers to wear.
</P>
<P>
   The court has tackled such matters before. In 1991 the justices
upheld an Indiana public indecency law that also banned nude
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   And four years ago, in a case involving a similar statute in St.
John's County, Fla., the court refused to overturn lower-court
decisions that rejected the argument that the ban violated erotic
dancers' freedom of artistic expression.
</P>
<P>
   That case also provided an unusual insight into the legal mind
at work. It turns out the St. John's County law, which requires
that about one-third of a dancer's buttocks be covered, went to
great lengths _ 328 words, to be exact _ to define that unlikely
battleground for First Amendment rights:
</P>
<P>
   ``The area at the rear of the human body (sometimes referred to
as the glutaeus maximus) which lies between two imaginary lines
running parallel to the ground when a person is standing, the first
or top of such line being one-half inch below the top of the
vertical cleavage of the nates (i.e., the prominence formed by the
muscles running from the back of the hip to the back of the leg)
and the second or bottom line being one-half inch above the lowest
point of the curvature of the fleshy protuberance (sometimes
referred to as the gluteal fold), and between two imaginary lines,
one on each side of the body (the `outside lines'), which outside
lines are perpendicular to the ground and to the horizontal lines
described above and which perpendicular outside lines pass through
the outermost point(s) at which each nate meets the outer side of
each leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothwithstanding the above, buttocks shall not include the
leg, the hamstring muscle below the gluteal fold, the tensor
fasciae latae muscle or any of the above-described portion of the
human body that is between either the left inside perpendicular
line and the left outside perpendicular line or the right inside
perpendicular line and the right outside perpendicular line. For
the purpose of the previous sentence the left inside perpendicular
line shall be an imaginary line on the left side of the anus that
is perpendicular to the ground and to the horizontal lines
described above and that is one-third the distance from the anus to
the left outside line, and the right inside perpendicular line
shall be an imaginary line on the right side of the anus that is
perpendicular to the ground and to the horizontal lines described
above and that is one-third of the distance from the anus to the
right outside line. (The above description can generally be
described as covering one-third of the buttocks centered over the
cleavage for the length of the cleavage.)''

LAKERS' HARMONY A CONTRAST TO TENSIONS ON OTHER TEAMS ;  THE ANDRO
DEBATE; UNION STUDIES AGENT ;  LAKERS WANTED RILEY ;  WEBBER SHOWS
EMPATHY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the past week, Vernon Maxwell threw a dumbbell
in the vicinity of Gary Payton, who picked up a chair in order to
counter his Seattle teammate. In Utah, Coach Jerry Sloan and Karl
Malone exchanged angry words during the first half of a game. Asked
whether his relationship with Sloan would recover, Malone replied,
``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Antoine Walker traded insults and nearly punches with
Doug Overton in a timeout huddle as the Celtics and their coach,
Rick Pitino, continued to unravel and make their annual lottery
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Last month in San Antonio, where the Spurs once hailed their
locker room as the happiest in the league, Avery Johnson had to be
restrained in the shower after he and Malik Rose went after each
other, an encounter that nearly turned into a melee between
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Amid this sea of discontent in the dying days of the National
Basketball Association regular season stands one completely
harmonious team, one group of players not having words, sharing
shoves or belittling each other.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, it's the once-combustible Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of odd, because usually we're one of them,'' said
Kobe Bryant last week. ``I guess it's because we've been together
for about four years now. We've kind of grown up together. If we
don't understand or know one another by now, then it just wouldn't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning helps, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers went into the weekend with a chance to record the
highest winning percentage in history by a Western Conference team
against the East. Victories over Philadelphia on Friday and New
York on Sunday would give Los Angeles a 27-3 mark (.900) _ a
percentage better than the 1971-72 Lakers, who went 33-5 against
the East (.868).
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have won seven in a row and 26 of their last 27
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has found a run against the Eastern teams mainly
because of the dominance of Shaquille,'' said Coach Phil Jackson of
Shaquille O'Neal. ``There perhaps aren't the same number or size of
centers in the East that have been able to at least neutralize
Shaq.''
</P>
<P>
   Some also believe Jackson's unconventional coaching philosophy
has much to do with the Lakers' new-found respect for each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably has some characteristics of somebody from outer
space,'' said the Lakers' owner, Jerry Buss, his voiced laced with
sarcasm. ``He's an alien with special gifts; that's all that seems
to be happening. In all seriousness, he's probably knows as much
basketball as any person alive. He's seen a lot of talent.
Everybody has known for a long time we've had the talent. It's
pretty close to the same team. But he could see a way to net it
together which apparently other people could not.''
</P>
<P>
   But back to the angry and maudlin masses. In Seattle, Horace
Grant was hurt breaking up the fight between Payton and Maxwell
during practice last Sunday. He wore a padded wrap on the top of
his left shoulder against the Knicks on Wednesday night. And Sloan
and Malone still weren't talking about talking too much on court
when Malone was replaced briefly in the first half by Scott
Padgett.
</P>
<P>
   Fights in practice and verbal sniping in the news media are
common this time a year. Many teams go through rough times a month
before the playoffs, taking stock of who they genuinely are before
it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's astonishing that the Lakers are no longer one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Andro Debate
</P>
<P>
   The NBA issued a statement on Thursday saying the joint drug
committee of the league and the players' association had added nine
substances to its banned list, including androstenedione _ the
testosterone-boosting supplement made famous by Mark McGwire. But
the National Basketball Players Association filed a grievance to
thwart the move, putting the matter before arbitrator Roger Kaplan.
The union's grievance _ considered a long-shot to overturn the
decision even by its own attorneys _ also challenges the addition
of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) to the banned list.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Olympics and other sports have banned andro, Billy
Hunter, the union's executive director, reasoned that the
supplement has yet to be banned by baseball and the tests on the
muscle-building drug are still inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the union is doing its job. Banning the
supplement was not mutually agreed to by the parties. It could be
said that if the players do not raise a fuss over these issues,
soon they will be tested for hundreds of substances.
</P>
<P>
   And, the league has become adept at announcing policy change _
remember the microphone controversy? _ before consulting its
players.
</P>
<P>
   But the league and the union jointly pay its committee of drug
experts to make these recommendations. And andro use in the NBA is
said to be infinitesimal. Yet by challenging the adding of the
supplement to the banned list, aren't the players drawing more
attention to the possibility of increased usage?
</P>
<P>
   Union Studies Agent
</P>
<P>
   While no formal action has been taken against him, Andy Miller's
troubles may be just beginning. The agent who represents Kevin
Garnett among other clients is under investigation by the players'
association for allegedly contacting prospective clients while they
were still in college _ in violation of state statutes in Florida
and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Miller will appear before the union to give an explanation of
his actions, detailed last week in a New York Times report. If the
union deems Miller's actions in violation of the article governing
agents in its bylaws, he would face disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is also the focus of a $30 million lawsuit by his former
partner, Eric Fleisher, who accused Miller of essentially stealing
his business.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers Wanted Riley
</P>
<P>
   From the Now-It-Can-Be-Told File: Phil Jackson was not always
the Lakers' main man. A Lakers representative approached Pat Riley
about returning to Los Angeles on three separate occasions last
year, a person close to the Miami Heat coach said.
</P>
<P>
   All three overtures were made before the club entered into
serious contract negotiations with Jackson, said the person close
to Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Buss, the Lakers' owner, earlier this month denied
reaching out to Riley, who was under contract at the time with
Miami and eventually signed a lucrative extension there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone did, they did it without my knowledge,'' Buss said.
``He was under contract. After 20 years in the NBA, I've learned
not to mess with people under contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Webber Shows Empathy
</P>
<P>
   Chris Webber has not only become one of the premier players in
the league on the floor; the one-time troubled young soul has also
emerged as one of most thoughtful, introspective players.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento's All-Star forward arranged for a senior from
Columbine High School, Patrick Ireland, to serve as honorary ball
boy during the Kings game against the 76ers at Arco Arena Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland was one of several students wounded on April 20, 1999,
when two students opened fire at the school, killing 12 classmates
and one teacher. Hearing that Ireland loved Michigan, Webber's alma
mater, and especially the Fab Five, Webber extended the invitation
last year to Ireland, who was unable to attend because of ongoing
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to Patrick and his family attending the game
against Philly,'' Webber said. ``I know he's a big basketball fan,
and hopefully the delayed trip was worth the wait.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today, nearly half a century after the Supreme Court ruled that
school segregation was unconstitutional, are efforts to achieve
racially integrated public schools legally and politically doomed?
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Supreme Court let stand a decision by a
federal appeals court, which held that school authorities in
Montgomery County, Md., violated the Constitution when they tried
to prevent a white student from transferring to a magnet school
from his neighborhood elementary school, which is predominantly
black.
</P>
<P>
   The Montgomery County case is only the latest in a series of
decisions, going back several years, that are making it hard for
public schools to maintain even a semblance of racial diversity in
a judicial and political climate that exalts choice above all other
values.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't reconcile choice with diversity, and that's the
tragedy,'' says Samuel Issacharoff of Columbia Law School, a
leading scholar of desegregation. ``Fifty years after Brown vs.
Board of Education, there is still no non-coercive mechanism for
racial integration that has evolved in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   That unanimous 1954 Supreme Court decision became famous for the
phrase, ``Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.''
Less well-remembered is the opinion's insistence that education
itself is ``the very foundation of good citizenship ... the
principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values.''
</P>
<P>
   In the court's view, educating children of different races
together was key to the crucial project of creating a society less
divided by race. But the era when courts were willing to force
integration through mandatory busing ended in the mid-1990s. Now,
judges and parents are questioning the constitutionality and value
of programs that try to create racially balanced schools without
busing, by restricting who can go to school where. Indeed, based on
a pattern of rulings in recent years, the Supreme Court may be on
the verge of holding this as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in judicial and public opinion may mean that the
central premise of the Brown decision _ that integrated public
schools are the most important institution in a pluralistic society
_ will not survive the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Montgomery County case. White enrollment at the
Glen Haven elementary school in Montgomery County dropped from 40
percent in 1995 to 24 percent in 1998, although the county as a
whole is 53 percent white. In an effort to stop the rapid decline,
the county adopted a policy that no student could transfer out of a
school if the transfer would adversely affect racial diversity,
unless he or she could prove some kind of ``unique personal
hardship.'' In striking down this policy, the 4th Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., concluded that the Constitution
prohibits ``racial balancing'' from being used as the decisive
factor in school assignments.
</P>
<P>
   This is a straightforward application of years of Supreme Court
decisions restricting the use of race to distribute government
benefits. But those decisions have left surprisingly few
alternatives open to school districts that value integration. In
the early 1980s, many districts began to abandon futile efforts to
integrate neighborhood schools and instead set up magnet schools in
the hope of attracting a diverse group of applicants from the
entire school district. But using random lotteries to determine
admission to oversubscribed magnet schools often fails to produce
racial balance. For this reason, a magnet school in Arlington
County, Virginia, recently adopted a weighted lottery system,
giving preferences to minority students. Last year, the Court of
Appeals struck down the weighted lottery on the same grounds it had
invoked in the Montgomery County case: in school admissions, racial
balancing is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Academically competitive exam schools have had no more luck in
adopting explicit racial and ethnic admissions goals. In recent
cases, the Boston Latin School in Massachusetts and Lowell High
School in San Francisco, were forced to abandon their racial
admissions targets. In response, Lowell set aside 20 percent of its
class for applicants who met the minimum test score cut-off but had
suffered from socioeconomic disadvantage. This system allowed the
school to admit disadvantaged white and Asian students, but
produced few African-Americans and Hispanics. The handful of
successful efforts to achieve integration in school districts as a
whole are now in legal jeopardy. Cambridge, Mass., has designed a
program called ``controlled choice,'' in which all schools are open
to everyone regardless of where they live, and parents rank the
schools in order of preference. But each school must have a
balanced racial mix. If the Supreme Court ultimately decides that
racial integration for its own sake can't justify race-based
admissions policies, then ``controlled choice'' programs like the
one in Cambridge may be doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any school district that is doing anything around these issues
of promoting diversity is feeling vulnerable right now,'' says Amy
Stuart Wells, a professor of education at UCLA.

<P>
   Today, nearly half a century after the Supreme Court ruled that
school segregation was unconstitutional, are efforts to achieve
racially integrated public schools legally and politically doomed?
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Supreme Court let stand a decision by a
federal appeals court, which held that school authorities in
Montgomery County, Md., violated the Constitution when they tried
to prevent a white student from transferring to a magnet school
from his neighborhood elementary school, which is predominantly
black.
</P>
<P>
   The Montgomery County case is only the latest in a series of
decisions, going back several years, that are making it hard for
public schools to maintain even a semblance of racial diversity in
a judicial and political climate that exalts choice above all other
values.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't reconcile choice with diversity, and that's the
tragedy,'' says Samuel Issacharoff of Columbia Law School, a
leading scholar of desegregation. ``Fifty years after Brown vs.
Board of Education, there is still no non-coercive mechanism for
racial integration that has evolved in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   That unanimous 1954 Supreme Court decision became famous for the
phrase, ``Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.''
Less well-remembered is the opinion's insistence that education
itself is ``the very foundation of good citizenship ... the
principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values.''
</P>
<P>
   In the court's view, educating children of different races
together was key to the crucial project of creating a society less
divided by race. But the era when courts were willing to force
integration through mandatory busing ended in the mid-1990s. Now,
judges and parents are questioning the constitutionality and value
of programs that try to create racially balanced schools without
busing, by restricting who can go to school where. Indeed, based on
a pattern of rulings in recent years, the Supreme Court may be on
the verge of holding this as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in judicial and public opinion may mean that the
central premise of the Brown decision _ that integrated public
schools are the most important institution in a pluralistic society
_ will not survive the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Montgomery County case. White enrollment at the
Glen Haven elementary school in Montgomery County dropped from 40
percent in 1995 to 24 percent in 1998, although the county as a
whole is 53 percent white. In an effort to stop the rapid decline,
the county adopted a policy that no student could transfer out of a
school if the transfer would adversely affect racial diversity,
unless he or she could prove some kind of ``unique personal
hardship.'' In striking down this policy, the 4th Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., concluded that the Constitution
prohibits ``racial balancing'' from being used as the decisive
factor in school assignments.
</P>
<P>
   This is a straightforward application of years of Supreme Court
decisions restricting the use of race to distribute government
benefits. But those decisions have left surprisingly few
alternatives open to school districts that value integration. In
the early 1980s, many districts began to abandon futile efforts to
integrate neighborhood schools and instead set up magnet schools in
the hope of attracting a diverse group of applicants from the
entire school district. But using random lotteries to determine
admission to oversubscribed magnet schools often fails to produce
racial balance. For this reason, a magnet school in Arlington
County, Virginia, recently adopted a weighted lottery system,
giving preferences to minority students. Last year, the Court of
Appeals struck down the weighted lottery on the same grounds it had
invoked in the Montgomery County case: in school admissions, racial
balancing is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Academically competitive exam schools have had no more luck in
adopting explicit racial and ethnic admissions goals. In recent
cases, the Boston Latin School in Massachusetts and Lowell High
School in San Francisco, were forced to abandon their racial
admissions targets. In response, Lowell set aside 20 percent of its
class for applicants who met the minimum test score cut-off but had
suffered from socioeconomic disadvantage. This system allowed the
school to admit disadvantaged white and Asian students, but
produced few African-Americans and Hispanics. The handful of
successful efforts to achieve integration in school districts as a
whole are now in legal jeopardy. Cambridge, Mass., has designed a
program called ``controlled choice,'' in which all schools are open
to everyone regardless of where they live, and parents rank the
schools in order of preference. But each school must have a
balanced racial mix. If the Supreme Court ultimately decides that
racial integration for its own sake can't justify race-based
admissions policies, then ``controlled choice'' programs like the
one in Cambridge may be doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any school district that is doing anything around these issues
of promoting diversity is feeling vulnerable right now,'' says Amy
Stuart Wells, a professor of education at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the new era, only strategies that entice parental choice,
rather than control it, can clearly pass constitutional muster. But
in an age when political support for integration is declining,
these strategies face an uphill battle. Some districts, for
example, have increased financing for inner-city schools on a
field-of-dreams theory: If you improve the schools, white students
will come. But the most visible example of this approach, in Kansas
City, was a notable failure. Under court order, the city spent
nearly $200 million to build a state-of-the-art magnet school. The
white students failed to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Choice plans that allow black parents to send their children to
white suburban schools have had similarly mixed success. Twenty
states have open enrollment laws that allow children to transfer
from district to district. But because few of these states provide
for subsidized transportation to the suburbs, many black parents
are unable to avail themselves of the opportunity. St. Louis, by
contrast, was forced by court order to provide subsidized
transportation for children from the inner city to attend 16
suburban school districts. Thirteen thousand children have accepted
the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents make their decisions on the basis not of ideology but
on whatever they think will advance the education of their
children, and they will choose desegregation whenever it's a viable
option,'' says William Taylor, a veteran desegregation attorney who
represented the plaintiffs in the St. Louis case.
</P>
<P>
   The experience in St. Louis shows that money is necessary to
allow poor parents the same opportunities to escape failing inner
city schools as richer parents enjoy. This, perhaps, accounts for
the growing support among minorities for school vouchers. Professor
Jay Greene of the University of Texas at Austin contends that in
cities that have adopted voucher programs, the voucher schools tend
to be more racially integrated than the public schools. Nearly a
fifth of voucher recipients in Cleveland attend private schools
that reflect the racial composition of the city as a whole, Greene
notes, while only 5.2 percent of Cleveland public school students
are in comparably integrated schools.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Clarence Thomas, a strong supporter of vouchers, has
become the leading national advocate for the view that racial
diversity is ultimately less important than ensuring a genuinely
equal education for African-American children. ``It never ceases to
amaze me that the courts are so willing to assume that anything
that is predominantly black must be inferior,'' Thomas wrote in a
1995 decision criticizing the district court's decision to convert
Kansas City into a magnet district.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to choose between racial diversity and educational
quality, most African-American parents seem to agree with Thomas.
In a 1998 survey of 800 white parents and 800 black parents
conducted by Public Agenda, 82 percent of the black parents said
that raising academic standards was more important than achieving
more diversity and integration.
</P>
<P>
   These overwhelming numbers do not, however, capture the full
complexity and ambivalence of the views of white and black parents
about the value of integration. In the same poll, 80 percent of
black parents and 66 percent of white parents said it was ``very
important'' or ``somewhat important'' to them that their own
children attend an integrated school. Only those without the means
to choose an education that is both integrated and adequate are
willing to settle for quality.
</P>
<P>
   With idealism that, in retrospect, seems poignant, the Brown
decision assumed that the removal of state-enforced segregation
would be enough to integrate schools around the country. In the
North and the South, that view proved to be naive and untenable.
But now that legal and political tolerance for even mildly coercive
forms of integration appears to be evaporating, the hope of
integrated public schools may soon be a distant memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the final frontier,'' says David Goldberg of the NAACP
Legal Defense and Education Fund. ``If the Supreme Court decides
that there's no compelling interest in educational diversity, then
the basic premise of Brown will have been repudiated.''

A NEW FORM OF SLAVERY IS GROWING IN U.S., CIA REPORT FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., R.I.)  (jw) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As many as 50,000 women and children from Asia,
Latin America and Eastern Europe are brought to the United States
under false pretenses each year and forced to work as prostitutes,
abused laborers or servants, according to a CIA report that is the
government's first comprehensive assessment of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The carefully annotated and exhaustively researched, 79-page
agency report _ ``International Trafficking in Women to the United
States: A Contemporary Manifestation of Slavery'' _ paints a broad
picture of this hidden trade and of the difficulties that
government agencies face in fighting it.
</P>
<P>
   Completed in November, the report is based on more than 150
interviews with government officials, law enforcement officers,
victims and experts in the United States and abroad, as well as
investigative documents and a review of international literature on
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials have seen episodic evidence for years
of trafficking in immigrant women and children, some as young as 9.
But the report says that officers generally do not like to take on
these slavery cases because they are difficult to investigate and
prosecute. What's more, it says, the nation does not have
sufficient laws aimed squarely at this problem, meaning that the
penalties often are insubstantial.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Attorney General Janet Reno chartered an
interagency task force to attack the problem, saying, ``We are not
interested in containing modern-day slavery; we want to eradicate
it.'' The report mentions many efforts to fight the problem, but
also many barriers to doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, while up to 100,000 victims poured into
the United States, where they were held in bondage, federal
officials estimated that the government prosecuted cases involving
no more than 250 victims. The Justice Department said it could not
provide precise figures.
</P>
<P>
   The report was prepared by a government intelligence analyst who
was working on assignment to the CIA. While the report is not
classified, it has not been made public. Another government
official who wanted the report's findings publicized provided a
copy.
</P>
<P>
   It describes case after case of foreign women who answered
advertisements for au pair, sales clerk, secretarial or waitress
jobs in the United States but found, once they arrived, that the
jobs did not exist. Instead they were taken prisoner, held under
guard and forced into prostitution or peonage. Some of them were,
in fact, sold outright to brothel owners, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Examples of this may include Latvian women threatened and
forced to dance nude in Chicago,'' the report says. Thai women were
brought to the United States ``but then forced to be virtual sex
slaves.'' Chinese-Korean women were ``held as indentured
servants.'' And ``Mexican women and girls, some as young as 14,''
were promised jobs in housekeeping or child care but, upon arrival,
``were told they must work as prostitutes in brothels serving
migrant workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Girls from Asian and African countries, some as young as 9, were
essentially sold to traffickers by their parents, ``for less than
the price of a toaster,'' one government official said. This mainly
happens in cultures where female children are not valued. The girls
are smuggled into the United States where, in a typical case, they
are forced to work ``in an indentured sexual servitude
arrangement,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   A Nigerian smuggling ring, the report says, citing an
Immigration and Naturalization Service case, charged parents from
that country $10,000 to $12,000 to bring their children to New York
so they would have ``better educational opportunities.'' But once
here, the smugglers ``forced the Nigerian children to work as
domestics.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of these cases received prominent news coverage when they
were discovered. But they are only a tiny fraction of the problem.
The report says 700,000 to 2 million women and children worldwide
are victimized by traffickers each year. Although the numbers who
come to the United States are relatively small, the report says
that the problem ``is likely to increase in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   At a three-day conference in Manila, Philippines, last week,
delegates from 23 Asian countries met to discuss the problem and
called on governments to seize the profits of the crime syndicates
involved. A Filipino group estimated those profits at up to $17
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Frank E. Loy, undersecretary of state for global affairs, told a
congressional subcommittee in February: ``It seems incomprehensible
that at the dawn of the 21st century, the primitive and barbaric
practice of buying and selling human beings occurs at all. Yet
international trafficking in persons, predominantly women and
children, is a widespread and, by all indications, a growing
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The countries that are the primary sources for traffickers are
Thailand, Vietnam, China, Mexico, Russia and the Czech Republic,
the report says. But other countries that are increasingly
providing victims include the Philippines, Korea, Malaysia, Latvia,
Hungary, Poland, Brazil and Honduras, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The INS, one of several federal agencies with jurisdiction in
this area, noted in an internal assessment last fall that agents
had found 250 brothels in 26 cities nationwide that appeared to be
holding trafficking victims. It was not always easy to tell, the
CIA report says, because the victims generally did not speak
English and might have been even more afraid of law enforcement
officers than of their captors.
</P>
<P>
   After busting one of these brothels, the immigration officers
generally move to deport the women _ the victims _ because they are
in the country illegally. Often the officials do not have enough
information to prosecute their captors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said the problem was not new, but the scope
seems to have increased in recent years. The biggest reason is
that, since the mid-1990s, traffickers from Russia and the former
republics of the Soviet Union have aggressively entered the
business, taking advantage of women from those countries who are
looking to the West for opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's accelerated tremendously in the last 10 years,'' said
Donna Hughes, director of the Women's Studies Program at the
University of Rhode Island. She has monitored the issue for a
decade. ``An important reason is that there's increased migration
of women now for purposes of work.''
</P>
<P>
   A CIA analyst derived the estimate of 50,000 victims per year
from public and classified intelligence data, a government official
said. No comparable estimates were made in previous years, the
official said, but the widespread opinion among government
officials was that the number was much smaller 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the scrutiny now is that senior members of the
Clinton administration, including Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and Attorney General Reno, in addition to the first lady,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, have spoken out on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have all of the other agencies involved, and we would
not have been able to do that without the sense that there is a
mandate from the president to work on this issue,'' said Theresa
Loar, a State Department officer who is also director of the
President's Interagency Council on Women.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The task force that Reno established two years ago to coordinate
federal efforts to fight the problem meets every two or three
months. It sponsors training seminars for law enforcement personnel
and pilot projects for victims, among other efforts. The Justice
Department set up a hot line for victims, staffed during business
hours, Monday through Friday. Other federal agencies have started
modest programs, and an administration report says: ``The
administration is committed to taking decisive action toward
combating the trafficking of human beings, in a global effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Other federal officials, and the report itself, say the
government's efforts are often fragmented and ineffectual. Many
agencies have theoretical jurisdiction _ the FBI, the INS, the
Department of Labor, the State Department, among others _ but none
of them see trafficking of women and children as their clear
responsibility, or as a particularly desirable assignment because
``investigating trafficking and slavery cases is arduous'' and
unrewarding, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Federal, state and local law enforcement officers usually come
upon trafficking cases while investigating other crimes. But ``many
FBI agents say it is difficult if not impossible to formally write
up the cases'' because of a lack of time, the report says. Even if
that were not so, ``there is no central repository of all the
trafficking in women and children cases within the United States,''
it says. That would be a crucial requirement for an effective
enforcement program.
</P>
<P>
   Even when traffickers are convicted, the penalties are usually
light. In fact, there are few federal or state laws aimed directly
at this crime. One federal law does forbid ``sale into involuntary
servitude.'' It carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.
Many recent trafficking convictions have brought sentences that
were shorter than that.
</P>
<P>
   In one case last year involving 70 Thai laborers ``who had been
held against their will, systematically abused and made to work
20-hour shifts in a sweatshop,'' the report says, seven defendants
received sentences of four to seven years; one received seven
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``These low penalties and the long, complicated and
resource-intensive nature of trafficking cases tend to make them
unattractive to many U.S. attorneys'' who have become ``frustrated
that the sentencing outcomes have not reflected the work involved
or the full nature of the crimes,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Despite interest in the issue from the Clinton administration,
government officials said, few resources have been devoted to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have hundred and hundreds of government analysts looking at
drugs, arms, economic issues,'' a government official said. ``But
hardly anyone is on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Two bills, in the House and the Senate, would increase prison
time for traffickers, provide assistance for victims and increase
resources and training for law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   The bills would require the State Department to publish an
annual report on trafficking and recommend sanctions against
countries that are not, in the administration's view, fighting it
aggressively enough. This would be similar to the annual State
Department reports on human rights and drug trafficking. But the
department strongly opposes this idea, threatening the bills.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although the CIA report was distributed within the government
last November, it does not appear to be getting much attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one really knows what do with it,'' one government official
said. ``I'm not sure people are really focusing on this.''

COMMENTARY: A HEDGE FUND PRUNED 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only 18 months ago Julian Robertson's Tiger Management had $22
billion in capital, and could leverage that capital into huge
speculative positions. Whole nations trembled at the prospect that
the mighty hedge fund might attack their currencies or stock
markets. But by last week, between heavy losses and withdrawals by
disillusioned investors, Tiger was down to $6.5 billion; and on
Friday Robertson announced he was closing up shop.
</P>
<P>
   One need not cry for the humbled speculator, whose reduced
personal fortune is still a 10-digit number. Indeed, quite a few
people would like to see him suffer a bit more. Robertson is famed
for his temper and his deliberate coarseness. And personal issues
aside, Tiger's biggest successes involved profiting from economic
distress, and _ if you believe the complaints of some Asian
governments _ in some cases deliberately creating it.
</P>
<P>
   But the reporting on Tiger's demise was surprisingly
sympathetic. Some of the stories seemed to cast Robertson as a
victim, the defender of genuine economic values against irrational
hype. And that is apparently how he sees himself: he was
withdrawing, he said, ``from an irrational market, where earnings
and price considerations take a backseat to mouse clicks and
momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways he has a point. He bet heavily, and disastrously,
against Japan. Japan's fundamentals still look very dubious, and
the recent enthusiasm of Western investors for its stocks arguably
reflects herd mentality more than rational assessment. He also bet
heavily against ``new economy'' stocks, and the beating the Nasdaq
took last week, while too late to save Tiger, may provide some
intellectual vindication. Still, Robertson's complaint about
irrational, momentum-driven markets is ironic because he himself
could not have thrived if markets were as rational as he now
complains they aren't.
</P>
<P>
   First, the whole reason for a hedge fund's existence is the
supposed ability of its managers to spot market errors _ stocks,
currencies and so on that are priced either too high or too low
given the fundamentals. The idea then is to engage in arbitrage _
buying the underpriced assets, selling the overpriced. This
strategy can make huge returns for the fund's investors, but it
can't work if markets get the prices right in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a deeper sense in which Robertson is a
creation of the momentum investing he now decries. The phenomenon
of the investor who suddenly, after years of incredible success,
loses his touch is a common one. A notable recent example was
Victor Niederhoffer, who went under just after publishing a
best-selling, self-congratulatory memoir. Each time the market
wonders what happened. And each time one possible answer is that he
never had that touch to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine asking 10,000 people to guess the result of 10
coin-tosses in a row. For sure several will have perfect scores,
but that does not reflect any special talent for coin-tossing. Now
imagine giving hundreds of money managers the chance to bet on
market events year after year, firing the ones who guess wrong.
Those who remain will have extraordinary forecasting records, even
if they have no special talent for forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to say Robertson never knew what he was doing. In
the early days of Tiger, when it was small enough to research and
speculate in small companies, the story may have been different.
But by the '90s, the inflow of money from eager investors who
thought past success guaranteed future gains made Tiger too big to
play that game. Robertson shifted his focus to ``macro'' bets _
attempts to forecast the future of whole classes of stocks, even
whole economies. And there are no consistently good macroeconomic
forecasters _ only bad forecasters who get lucky. (That includes
me.) Fifteen years ago Robertson may have known things about XYZ
Inc. that the rest of us did not; but he's no more knowledgeable
about Japan, or the future of tech stocks, than thousands of other
people.
</P>
<P>
   And someone who repeatedly bets on what are, for all practical
purposes, random coin tosses is bound to be disappointed. He may
win several times in a row _ correctly guessing, for example, that
Asian stocks are about to tumble _ but if he comes to believe in
his own prescience, and stakes his whole capital on each toss,
sooner or later he is bound to come to grief. And so he did.

COMMENTARY: BIOLOGICAL WARFARE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many argue that it is an outrage to expect Elian
Gonzalez to live in a place that tolerates no dissent or freedom of
political expression.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't think Miami is so bad.
</P>
<P>
   Anyhow, this case is not simply about the future of one
6-year-old. This case is about the job prospects of many really
important adults.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, is not only selfish, but
naive. He thinks biology trumps politics? He thinks he can live in
Cuba and be a fit father?
</P>
<P>
   This hotel doorman does not seem to grasp that there are more
urgent things at stake: Who will grab Florida's 25 electoral votes?
Can Diane unseat Katie as the princess of morning TV? Can Miami
Cuban-Americans give a big raspberry to Fidel Castro? Does the Bush
dynasty have a future? Can Janet Reno go home again?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the child watched his mother drown. And the Miami crowd
has worked to turn him against his father. But now the little
castaway can, to use a W. phrase, ``access the American dream.''
His value to us as a metaphor for truth, justice and the American
way surpasses his value to anybody as a child.
</P>
<P>
   He vindicates our culture: celebrity status, play dates with
Diane Sawyer and a free pass to Disney World outweigh blood ties.
</P>
<P>
   Could a communist dad spoil ``Alien,'' as W. calls him, with the
awesome stuff he has now _ Tommy Hilfiger duds, a labrador pup, a
Power Wheels hot rod, a beeper, gold chains, cell phones and his
own Web page?
</P>
<P>
   The debate over his future goes beyond the natural world. It
involves the spiritual world. His protectors in Miami say the
Virgin Mary has appeared in his bedroom mirror and the windows of a
neighborhood bank. So who is Janet Reno to take on Our Lady and
snatch away the Baby Elian?
</P>
<P>
   True, Al Gore looks craven for breaking with the president to
lend his support to the efforts to keep the boy here. But why
shouldn't he try to wrest Florida's Cuban-American vote out of the
grip of the Bush brothers? This is Gore at his Goriest, standing
firm on shifting principles.
</P>
<P>
   As a doting father, the vice president should put his own
family's need to live in the White House ahead of Juan Gonzalez's
need to live with his son in some shack in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   And Bob Graham, the Democratic senator from Florida, can hardly
be blamed for helping Gore by sponsoring a bill to grant Elian
permanent U.S. residency status. The senator's chances to be Gore's
running mate depend on Florida being in play. And Graham knows an
opportunidad when he sees one.
</P>
<P>
   Like all Republicans, the Bush boys believe in family values and
the rule of law _ as long as those beliefs don't get in the way of
a good wedge issue. W. and Jeb pander most fluently in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic mayor of Miami-Dade County, Alex Penelas, has
brazenly warned federal officials that if they have to drag Elian
out of the house, they're on their own. The mayor doesn't seem
overly worried about Miami turning into some riotous Wild West
outpost, defying the U.S. government, daring the president to send
in the National Guard. What's a little mayhem if it helps launch
your Senate bid?
</P>
<P>
   Elian's relatives in Miami should be applauded for refusing to
let Gonzalez take custody of his son in this country while the
legal drama plays out. What child psychologist wouldn't agree that
it is more important for Elian, at this formative age, to spray
Silly String in Diane Sawyer's golden locks than to be restored to
his own father?
</P>
<P>
   While the wishes of a biological parent should be respected, the
lawyer for the Miami branch says, all decisions must be made
according to ``what is best for the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's be blunt. Dads are a dime a dozen. What is best for the
child is to take full advantage of his cachet in the U.S. of A.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani wanted the boy to come help him drop the
ball at the Times Square millennial celebration. Surely Elian will
be asked to sit in the balcony at the first State of the Union
address by either President Bush or President Gore. Hollywood, book
publishers, hucksters and Gloria Estefan will be calling.
</P>
<P>
   The kid will need representation. He can't go back to Cuba.
There isn't a decent publicist on the entire island.
</P>
<P>
   And we must always do what's best for the child.
</P>

   TRYON, Neb. _ Walking across the prairie, stepping carefully
around cow pies, Mike Abel confesses that he has told his son and
daughter not to follow in his line of work.
</P>
<P>
   He sounds for a moment like a repentant bank robber. But Abel,
45, is in an even less promising field: He is a cattle rancher.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers like Abel on the lovely desolation of the Nebraska
prairie near this hamlet, miles and miles from nowhere and nothing,
evoke the gritty determination and toughness of John Wayne on a
good day. But these days the ranchers also evoke something else _
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   This rural area, McPherson County, is by far the poorest county
in the country, measured by per capita income. Federal statistics
show that people in McPherson County earned an average of $3,961 in
1997, the most recent year for which statistics were available,
compared with $5,666 for the next poorest county, Keya Paha, also
in Nebraska. The richest, New York County, better known as
Manhattan, had a per capita income of $68,686 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys like Abel might seem the last people to cry. But with
much of the agricultural economy in deep distress, with dreams of
family farms fading like old cow bones on the prairie, even the
cowboys' lips are sometimes trembling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What always hurt us was when we're at the table trying to
figure out how to make a land payment, and the kids are seeing us
crying as we wonder what happens if we can't make the payment,''
said Abel, a sturdy man with flecks of gray in close-cropped hair.
``We'd always hoped this would be a family operation. But why
should my son, Tyler, struggle and make money only two out of five
years when he could get a good-paying job in the city somewhere?''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the American economy is going gangbusters, many
rural areas are undergoing a wrenching restructuring that is
impoverishing small ranchers and farmers, forcing them to sell out,
depopulating large chunks of rural America and changing the way
Americans get their food. The gains in farming and ranching
efficiency are staggering, but so is the blow to the rural way of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, the United States thought it had a plan to
revitalize the agriculture economy: the Freedom to Farm Act.
</P>
<P>
   Passed by the Republican Congress and signed by President
Clinton in 1996, the law aimed to phase out subsidies but ease
regulations and promote exports to make farming profitable without
government aid.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone agrees that the law has not worked (although
there is also a consensus that it is the other guy's fault). Direct
federal payments to farmers last year rose to a record $23 billion.
That is far more than the federal government spent on elementary
and secondary education, school lunches and Head Start combined.
</P>
<P>
   With the failure of American farm policy, no one has much of a
plan anymore, even though the present course appears unsustainable.
The growing cost of federal farm programs, the replacement of small
family farms with huge factory farms, the fading of rural hamlets _
all these point to historic changes under way in American
agriculture. Yet the changes are happening without anyone guiding
them or the nation paying them much heed.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty statistics can seem misleading to city dwellers, for
the poor farming areas rarely have homeless people or anything like
a slum, and in any case cattle and hog prices are rising this year.
But prospects look dismal, adding to the pressure on many rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The depopulation is evident in the grade school in Ringgold, a
crossroads village in the east end of McPherson County. Leah
Christopher, an effervescent eighth grader who is an outstanding
gymnast, will graduate from the school in a few months at the top
of her class, and at the bottom. She is the only eighth grader.
</P>
<P>
   The entire school, from kindergarten to the eighth grade, has
only one teacher and seven students, four of them from Leah's
family. Another grade school in the county has just four students
and will drop to three next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a training course once where the other teachers were
talking about using the school psychologist and other resources
like that,'' said Elnora Neal, the teacher at the Ringgold school.
``Well, I'm everything. At this school, I'm teacher, nurse,
psychologist, P.E. teacher and janitor.''
</P>
<P>
   McPherson County had 1,692 people in 1920, and since then its
population has been steadily falling, to about 540 today. At its
peak, it had 20 post offices, five towns and 63 school districts;
now it has one post office, five schools and, if one is generous
enough to include Ringgold, two towns. The average age in the
county is in the late '50s, the average American farmer today is
54.
</P>
<P>
   THE EFFICIENCY: SURGE IN OUTPUT KEEPS PRICES DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Moore, a lanky, rail-thin fifth-generation rancher,
complains bitterly about the difficulties as he sorts cattle on an
icy, overcast day on his 13,000-acre ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to college for four years and decided to come back and
live in poverty,'' Moore, 26, said laughing, as he stomped his feet
against the cold.
</P>
<P>
   But while there are many reasons for the misery in the
agricultural economy, perhaps Moore's greatest adversary is himself
_ and all the other farmers and ranchers like him who have figured
out how to increase the output of their land. In Moore's
grandfather's day, it took about 18 acres of this land to sustain a
cow and her calf. Now, ranchers have improved efficiency so that
they need just seven acres for a cow and a calf.
</P>
<P>
   This surge in output is the main force driving the restructuring
of agriculture. In 1969, the average pig used for breeding produced
6.7 piglets per year. By last year, that had risen to 16 piglets
per year, and the most efficient operators got 22.
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of productivity increases have resulted in a world
awash with grain, pork, beef and milk, even though the proportion
of the American public living on farms and ranches has tumbled to
1.5 percent today from 42 percent in 1900. Some experts believe
that with biotechnology, the productivity increases are now
beginning to accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, the agricultural equivalent of the four-minute
mile has been the yield of 400 bushels of corn per acre. The
average is about 150 bushels, but last year an Iowa farmer, Francis
R. Childs, achieved celebrity by producing 394 bushels under tight
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Roger Bannister changed the world's understanding of
human athletic potential when he ran a sub-four-minute mile in
1954, so Childs is waking up agricultural economists. If his
techniques could be replicated and spread widely, that could mean a
doubling of corn output.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any reason why that can't be done,'' Childs said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he acknowledges that he is a bit worried about what could be
done with all that corn. Historically, increases in productivity
have brought falling prices that punish the farmers, while
rewarding consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers have a great life ahead of them,'' said Neil E.
Harl, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University. ``We're
entering a new era, especially in crops but also in livestock.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   THE FACTORY: MASS PRODUCING UNDER CONTRACT
</P>
<P>
   You can smell the future of farming as you approach it on a
narrow dirt road just west of McPherson County, in neighboring
Arthur County.
</P>
<P>
   A series of long, low warehouses contain what is less a hog farm
than a pork factory. The factory is still being expanded, but
ultimately it will cost $5 million and produce 120,000 pigs each
year.
</P>
<P>
   To anyone who thinks that hogs are dirty and humans are clean, a
visit to this farm is an indignity. Before being allowed near the
pigs, all employees and visitors must strip, shower, shampoo and
change into new underwear, socks, boots and overalls that the farm
provides. The aim is to protect the pigs from diseases brought in
by nonhygienic humans.
</P>
<P>
   The sows spend their days lying in tiny pens, eating, drinking
and growing piglets inside of them. After giving birth, the sows
suckle their piglets until being weaned at 17 days and then after a
few days' respite they come in heat and the process begins again.
</P>
<P>
   The sows are taken into a pen next to several boars, whose sole
job is to sweet talk the sows and get them sexually excited.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, a technician artificially inseminates the sows,
as the boars watch from the next pen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be a frustrating existence for the boars,''
acknowledged Dwayne Fritzen, the manager of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   The pregnant sows even get ultrasound examinations at 30 days
and 60 days to make sure their pregnancies are going well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is efficiency,'' Fritzen said. ``I grew up on an
old-fashioned hog farm, where you go out and buy hogs and you don't
know the pedigree. Here, you know everything about these gals'' _
gestured to the sows _ ``and if you don't like the results, then
you switch genetic companies'' and get new sows or new semen.
</P>
<P>
   Industrialized agriculture began to replace traditional family
farms in poultry, and one study found that these days the average
poultry farmer raises 240,000 birds a year and earns just $12,000
for his labor.
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars say that increasingly, livestock and crops alike
will be produced under contract to large food companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farmer in those contracts is somewhere between what you'd
call a businessman and a laborer,'' said Chuck Hassebrook, program
director for the Center for Rural Affairs, a Nebraska research
center. ``Management decisions are typically made by the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Hassebrook added: ``More and more, the people on the land become
simply laborers. The returns are siphoned out of their
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   THE POVERTY: BEING SQUEEZED BY THE SYSTEM
</P>
<P>
   With the welfare system for poor Americans hugely curtailed in
the last few years, there is more scrutiny than ever of what
critics see as a major welfare system for grain and cotton farmers.
Moreover, though the evidence is mixed, some economists argue that
the billions of dollars in federal payments are helping to drive
out family farmers and ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress talks about saving the family farm, but it pours the
money disproportionately to larger farmers,'' said John A.
Schnittker, who runs an agricultural economics consulting firm in
California. ``As you subsidize these large farms, they can pay more
in buying land, and they can pay more in renting land. And so the
system we have now really concentrates farming among the large
operators.''
</P>
<P>
   Two situations loom, neither one encouraging: payments may
continue to soar until they threaten the budget, or Congress may be
forced to cut payments, leaving farmers in desperate shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a quandary,'' said Keith Collins, the chief economist
for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Collins said the
department's projections were that this year's price for wheat
would be the lowest since 1986, for cotton the lowest since 1974
and for soybeans the lowest since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   While grain farmers are ever more dependent on the agricultural
dole, ranchers _ who get left out of the payment system _ are often
irritated by the payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to subsidize people because the price is low _ that kills
ingenuity,'' said Doug Schmidt, 45, struggling to make a go of
cattle ranching on a small spread, near Ringgold.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman says that farm policy has to
be revamped and broadened to do more than make payments to
distressed farmers. He says that it should also help them add value
to their products, make it easier for them to insure against risks
and work on mechanisms to help people run businesses in rural
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as we'd like to use farm programs as the panacea for
problems out there affecting rural America, they cannot be,''
Glickman said. He added, ``We've also got to make rural America
economically thriving, so that people will have a reason to stay on
family-sized farms even if they can't get all their income'' from
farming.
</P>
<P>
   The larger question is why the government should work so
energetically and expensively to preserve the family farm.
Family-owned restaurants, bookstores and newspapers were all widely
regarded as beneficial to their communities, yet in each case
America allowed many of them to fade and be replaced by more
ferocious and efficient economic competitors. Only in the case of
family farms, presumably because they are so rooted in American
mythology and in Jefferson's ideal of the yeoman farmer-citizen,
are Americans willing to spend $23 billion a year fighting economic
change.
</P>
<P>
   THE FUTURE: CORPORATE FLAGS OVER GIANT SPREADS
</P>
<P>
   As dawn comes in McPherson County, a glorious orange sun rises
from the prairies and casts a glow on LaVerne Neal, a 73-year-old
rancher feeding his cattle. Neal, a lanky man whose skin has been
tanned almost to leather, was raised in a sod house on the prairie.
(Houses made of earth used to be very common in McPherson County
because of the shortage of wood, and one family in the county still
lives in a sod house.)
</P>
<P>
   Neal has 240 cows and 3,840 acres, and he had always assumed
that his family would ranch here forever. But he now realizes that
his land is really too small for future generations to make a
living, and he sees his problem as emblematic of a larger pattern
of the decline of the family farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are going to be family farms for too many
more years,'' Neal said wistfully, driving his pickup over the
fields. ``Those big outfits are taking over.''
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the most common laments in agriculture. The
underlying problem for small farms and ranches is diminishing
margins and a tiny return on capital. Many farmers and ranches have
million-dollar investments that are losing them money, so the
country's poorest county probably has a high proportion of
millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Yet paradoxically, for all the fears of corporations sneaking
into agriculture, dismal returns are the best protection family
farms have. If McDonald's announced that it were going to produce
its own beef, wheat, lettuce and tomatoes, its shareholders would
sell in panic, because the return on the investment would be
dreadful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would they want the aggravation?'' asked Ed Sowder, a
county commissioner. ``If you've got ranchers out there who think
they're working for themselves, why bother?''
</P>
<P>
   Only about 2 percent of farms are run by corporations. But
corporate oligopolies dominate both the input side (selling seed
and equipment) and output side (four companies now control 80
percent of the beef market).
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation of farms under way today seems to be a
continuation of a trend that goes back 100 years. The average
American farm has gone from 139 acres in 1910 to 435 acres today,
and the driving force behind this change is simple: economics and a
yearning for a better life. For all the rosy glow that is conjured
by the phrase ``family farm,'' it was often a harsh life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a boy, for my birthday all I'd get was a pair of
socks,'' Neal recalled. ``Come to think of it, that's all I used to
give my children, as well. But these days, you walk into a kid's
room, and you have to kick aside half a dozen teddy bears just to
step inside.''
</P>
<P>
   As the pain in the farm sector drags on endlessly, farmers like
the Abels decide that if they are to keep their children in teddy
bears, they may be better off in other lines of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you pass on your ranch to your son,'' Bob Long, a county
commissioner and rancher, said, ``then it's child abuse.''

MAKING A BIT OF OPENING DAY HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVID FISCHER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Opening day of the baseball season attained ceremonial status in
1910 when President William Howard Taft threw out the first pitch
in Washington. Since then, New York teams have made a bit of
opening day history themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Dodger Blues
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Dodgers lost to the Philadelphia Phillies, 1-0, on
opening day in 1913, in the first regular-season game ever played
at Ebbets Field. The Dodgers' owner, Charles Hercules Ebbets, had
financially overextended himself building the park that bore his
name, and he was soon forced to sell a controlling interest in the
team to the McKeever brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Ebbets died on opening day of the 1925 season. Six days later,
all National League games were canceled for his funeral. At the
funeral, workers struggled to widen Ebbets' grave because it was
too narrow for his oversize coffin. During the wait, mourners were
soaked by heavy rain. One of them was the club president, Ed
McKeever, who developed pneumonia and died one month later.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx Ballpark
</P>
<P>
   At the Yankee Stadium inaugural in 1923, Babe Ruth slammed the
first home run in its history _ a three-run shot off Howard Ehmke
to help pitcher Bob Shawkey and the Yankees capture a 4-1 victory
over the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   When the renovated Yankee Stadium was unveiled for the 1976 home
opener, Bob Shawkey, now 85, threw out the first ball. The Yanks
won the game, 11-4, but Minnesota Twins outfielder Dan Ford hit the
first homer in the modern Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Inaugural No-Nos
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, the 21-year-old Cleveland Indians fireballer Bob Feller
became the first major league pitcher to throw an opening day
no-hitter when he defeated the Chicago White Sox, 1-0, at Comiskey
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Feller doused many an opening day celebration. At the Yankee
Stadium home opener in 1946, Feller also pitched a 1-0 no-hitter.
The only run was scored by Feller's catcher, Frankie Hayes, who hit
a home run in the top of the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   New York Giants pitcher Red Ames worked nine innings without
allowing a hit in the 1909 opener at the Polo Grounds against the
Brooklyn Dodgers. But Ames surrendered a hit in the 10th and lost
in the 13th when Brooklyn scored three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Barrier Breakers
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 25,000 fans at Ebbets Field for the April 15, 1947,
season opener between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Boston Braves wore
``I'm for Jackie'' buttons, signifying the historic debut of the
first black man to play major league baseball. Although Robinson
went hitless that day in three at-bats against Johnny Sam, the
first of Robinson's 1,382 major league games was a matter of
record.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight years later, Rachel Robinson, his widow, threw out
the ceremonial first pitch on opening day at Municipal Stadium in
Cleveland. Her appearance honored Frank Robinson, whose official
debut that day as baseball's first black manager was a winning one.
As the Indians' player-manager, he stroked a first-inning home run
off Yankees pitcher Doc Medich for his 575th career home run.
</P>
<P>
   The Amazin's
</P>
<P>
   The first game in New York Mets history in 1962 was rained out.
The next morning, the opening day starter, Roger Craig, and a dozen
other Mets were stranded in an elevator for 30 minutes at the Chase
Hotel in St. Louis, where the Mets were to begin the season against
the Cardinals.
</P>

   The Mets' opening day lineup on April 11,1962, was: Richie
Asburn (cf), Felix Mantilla (ss), Charlie Neal (2b), Frank Thomas
(lf), Gus Bell (rf), Gil Hodges (1b), Don Zimmer (3b), Hobie
Landrith (c), and Roger Craig (p). Craig lasted three innings and
balked in one run. His teammates committed three errors, and the
Mets lost for the first of a record 120 times that season. Talk
about bad omens: the Mets' home opener was played at the Polo
Grounds two days later, on Friday the 13th.
</P>
<P>
   All Hit, No Field
</P>
<P>
   Ron Blomberg made baseball history when he stepped into the
batter's box on opening day in 1973. The Yankees were playing the
Boston Red Sox in Fenway Park when, in the first inning, Blomberg
became the first designated hitter to bat in a major league game.
Blomberg, who faced Boston pitcher Luis Tiant with the bases
loaded, drew a walk and forced in a run. The first major league
plate appearance by a designated hitter was not an official at-bat,
although Blomberg was credited with a run batted in.
</P>
<P>
   What, No Baby Ruth?
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' home opener in 1978 was when Roger Maris ended his
12-year self-exile by returning to the Bronx. In a pregame
ceremony, Maris and Mickey Mantle raised the team's first world
championship flag in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Standard Brands handed out free ``Reggie!''
candy bars as a sales promotion gimmick to the 44,667 fans who
passed through the turnstiles. In the game's first inning, Reggie
Jackson, who had homered on his last three swings of the 1977 World
Series at Yankee Stadium, connected again on his first cut of the
home season, smashing a three-run homer off Chicago's Wilbur Wood
in the Yankees' 4-2 victory over the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   When Reggie took his position in right field to start the second
inning, the fans threw thousands of ``Reggie!'' bars onto the field
in tribute. The game was delayed about five minutes for
groundskeepers to gather the candy. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: THE NCAA, MORE THAN A BUILDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time in Bill Saum's career when he was on ``the
other side.'' Saum is now the staff liaison from the National
Collegiate Athletic Association to its committee that oversees
eligibility and rules compliance. Saum was once one of the
nameless, faceless plow horses that form the foundation of the
NCAA. He was a football coach. He worked the thankless dusk-to-dawn
hours of an assistant, working the field, teaching football.
</P>
<P>
   Today Saum wields more power than he ever imagines, the power to
make athletes' lives miserable _ which he has done _ or more
clearly define the perimeter of what is acceptable and what is not.
Depending on which side of the NCAA rulebook you are looking from,
Saum is either one of the most disliked men in college athletics or
a valiant crusader doing his job.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Saum, 40, is the point man for a controversial
initiative that could smash the amateurism model that has defined
college sports for much of the last century. Saum is helping to put
into effect an effort that the NCAA describes with an
ominous-sounding catch phrase: Changing the culture.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Saum met with the executive board of the National
Association of Basketball Coaches to get its members' thoughts
about a proposed rules change that would allow athletes to accept
prize money and play professionally after graduating from high
school while retaining their eligibility in case they later want to
go to college. The legislation would allow outside sports
organizations to pay for benefits such as prep school tuition _ an
activity that, over the last three months, has resulted in the high
profile suspension of Division I basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations by Saum's staff have accounted for the suspension
of these players, among others:
</P>
<P>
   _ UCLA forward JaRon Rush, who was suspended for much of the
season after he admitted to accepting money from his Amateur
Athletic Union coach in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rush's younger brother Kareem at Missouri and Oklahoma State's
Andre Williams, who accepted illicit benefits from the same AAU
coach.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jamal Crawford, who was suspended for gifts and benefits he
received from a Seattle-area businessman with whom he once lived.
</P>
<P>
   _ St. John's Erick Barkley, who was suspended this season for
swapping cars and accepting money to pay his tuition at a prep
school.
</P>
<P>
   Saum refused to discuss individual investigations but said cases
like these are part of the problem and part of the reason the model
needed to be changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events of the last two months has raised the awareness of
our coaches and membership that we need to come to the table and
talk about amateurism deregulation,'' he said. ``We need to talk
about agents. We need to work harder _ I need to work harder in my
area _ but we've got to engage the coaches, and we've got to quit
saying that it's horrible. We've got to peel away the layers of the
onion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't tweak the rule and say let's recruit 14 days instead
of 21 days. We need to start over. We need to eliminate people from
college basketball. We need to make education important, we need to
just involve professionals: teachers, guidance counselors,
principals, not all these street people who really. . . .'' Saum
paused to find the right words: ``Their own interest is their best
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the so-called ``street people'' argue that the college
sports infrastructure _ white male dominated _ does not have at
heart the athletes' best interest but only its own coffers. Three
of the Final Four coaches received bonuses for taking their teams
to Indianapolis, and the Final Four site here is surrounded by
crass commercialism that the Carnegie Commission report cited 70
years ago as the cause of college sport's downfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society demands to have this,'' Saum said referring to the
NCAA tournament. ``This is not basketball games, this is an event.
This possibly is the world's greatest sporting event. Society wants
this; the board of trustees want certain things. We have to deal in
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our coaches have agents. What message does that send to our
kids? I'm not saying coaches shouldn't have agents, but I think
that all of us need to be attentive to the role model that we are
to our young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Saum joined the NCAA in April, 1988. Before joining the NCAA, he
coached at The Defiance College in Defiance, Ohio. He was a high
school athlete who did not play at the University of Dayton. At
Dayton he tutored the men's basketball team and coached high school
football. He went to Bowling Green, where he was a graduate
assistant. After that he was at Heidelberg College in Tiffin, Ohio,
as an assistant football coach and head track coach. There were two
years of high school coaching before Defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Saum said he had to look in the mirror and assess where
he was going.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time to step off the carousel of coaching,'' he said.
``I got to a point where I wasn't sure how good a coach I was. But
I loved athletics and I wanted to have an effect on changing
athletics and I got lucky and got employed in the enforcement
department in the NCAA. I needed to change something.''
</P>
<P>
   NCAA officials, especially those involved with enforcement,
rarely talk about themselves, or discuss their backgrounds or the
prism through which they filter rules interpretations. The NCAA
enforcement staff in the past has opted to be the nameless,
faceless stealth bomber that moves under cover of night, swooping
down on so-called wrongdoers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I have some credibility with the coaches because I try
to still be a coach and never ever be a bureaucrat,'' Saum said.
``But when you're a football coach, you only live for 11 Saturdays,
and that's not real healthy and it doesn't allow you to look at the
big picture of intercollegiate athletics. Our coaches in America
are so focused on their institution, their team, next year's kids,
last year's kids. Engaging them in a wide-ranging discussion is
hard. That's the way I was when I was coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA says it wants to change the culture. I'm still not
certain what the NCAA wants to change from: Good to bad? Tall to
short? Urban to suburban? Domestic to foreign? Black to white?
Nevertheless, change is coming. You may not like what Saum is
saying, may not like Ced Dempsey's initiative but coaches and
players had better feel the pulse. The culture is changing,
changing in ways we never imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Who could have imagined this?

<P>
   TRYON, Neb. _ Walking across the prairie, stepping carefully
around cow pies, Mike Abel confesses that he has told his son and
daughter not to follow in his line of work.
</P>
<P>
   He sounds for a moment like a repentant bank robber. But Abel,
45, is in an even less promising field: He is a cattle rancher.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers like Abel on the lovely desolation of the Nebraska
prairie near this hamlet, miles and miles from nowhere and nothing,
evoke the gritty determination and toughness of John Wayne on a
good day. But these days the ranchers also evoke something else _
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   This rural area, McPherson County, is by far the poorest county
in the country, measured by per capita income. Federal statistics
show that people in McPherson County earned an average of $3,961 in
1997, the most recent year for which statistics were available,
compared with $5,666 for the next poorest county, Keya Paha, also
in Nebraska. The richest, New York County, better known as
Manhattan, had a per capita income of $68,686 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the American economy is going gangbusters, many
rural areas are undergoing a wrenching restructuring that is
impoverishing small ranchers and farmers, forcing them to sell out,
depopulating large chunks of rural America and changing the way
Americans get their food. The gains in farming and ranching
efficiency are staggering, but so is the blow to the rural way of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Moore, a lanky, rail-thin fifth-generation rancher,
complains bitterly about the difficulties as he sorts cattle on an
icy, overcast day on his 13,000-acre ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to college for four years and decided to come back and
live in poverty,'' Moore, 26, said laughing, as he stomped his feet
against the cold.
</P>
<P>
   But while there are many reasons for the misery in the
agricultural economy, perhaps Moore's greatest adversary is himself
_ and all the other farmers and ranchers like him who have figured
out how to increase the output of their land. In Moore's
grandfather's day, it took about 18 acres of this land to sustain a
cow and her calf. Now, ranchers have improved efficiency so that
they need just seven acres for a cow and a calf.
</P>
<P>
   This surge in output is the main force driving the restructuring
of agriculture. In 1969, the average pig used for breeding produced
6.7 piglets per year. By last year, that had risen to 16 piglets
per year, and the most efficient operators got 22.
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of productivity increases have resulted in a world
awash with grain, pork, beef and milk, even though the proportion
of the American public living on farms and ranches has tumbled to
1.5 percent today from 42 percent in 1900. Some experts believe
that with biotechnology, the productivity increases are now
beginning to accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   You can smell the future of farming as you approach it on a
narrow dirt road just west of McPherson County, in neighboring
Arthur County.
</P>
<P>
   A series of long, low warehouses contain what is less a hog farm
than a pork factory. The factory is still being expanded, but
ultimately it will cost $5 million and produce 120,000 pigs each
year.
</P>
<P>
   To anyone who thinks that hogs are dirty and humans are clean, a
visit to this farm is an indignity. Before being allowed near the
pigs, all employees and visitors must strip, shower, shampoo and
change into new underwear, socks, boots and overalls that the farm
provides. The aim is to protect the pigs from diseases brought in
by nonhygienic humans.
</P>
<P>
   The sows spend their days lying in tiny pens, eating, drinking
and growing piglets inside of them. After giving birth, the sows
suckle their piglets until the piglets are weaned at 17 days. Then
after a few days' respite the sows come in heat and the process
begins again.
</P>
<P>
   The sows are taken into a pen next to several boars, whose sole
job is to sweet talk the sows and get them sexually excited.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, a technician artificially inseminates the sows,
as the boars watch from the next pen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be a frustrating existence for the boars,''
acknowledged Dwayne Fritzen, the manager of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   With the welfare system for poor Americans hugely curtailed in
the last few years, there is more scrutiny than ever of what
critics see as a major welfare system for grain and cotton farmers.
Moreover, though the evidence is mixed, some economists argue that
the billions of dollars in federal payments are helping to drive
out family farmers and ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress talks about saving the family farm, but it pours the
money disproportionately to larger farmers,'' said John A.
Schnittker, who runs an agricultural economics consulting firm in
California. ``As you subsidize these large farms, they can pay more
in buying land, and they can pay more in renting land. And so the
system we have now really concentrates farming among the large
operators.''
</P>
<P>
   Two situations loom, neither one encouraging: payments may
continue to soar until they threaten the budget, or Congress may be
forced to cut payments, leaving farmers in desperate shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a quandary,'' said Keith Collins, the chief economist
for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Collins said the
department's projections were that this year's price for wheat
would be the lowest since 1986, for cotton the lowest since 1974
and for soybeans the lowest since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   While grain farmers are ever more dependent on the agricultural
dole, ranchers _ who get left out of the payment system _ are often
irritated by the payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to subsidize people because the price is low _ that kills
ingenuity,'' said Doug Schmidt, 45, struggling to make a go of
cattle ranching on a small spread, near Ringgold.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman says that farm policy has to
be revamped and broadened to do more than make payments to
distressed farmers. He says that it should also help them add value
to their products, make it easier for them to insure against risks
and work on mechanisms to help people run businesses in rural
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as we'd like to use farm programs as the panacea for
problems out there affecting rural America, they cannot be,''
Glickman said. He added, ``We've also got to make rural America
economically thriving, so that people will have a reason to stay on
family-sized farms even if they can't get all their income'' from
farming.
</P>
<P>
   The larger question is why the government should work so
energetically and expensively to preserve the family farm.
Family-owned restaurants, bookstores and newspapers were all widely
regarded as beneficial to their communities, yet in each case
America allowed many of them to fade and be replaced by more
ferocious and efficient economic competitors. Only in the case of
family farms, presumably because they are so rooted in American
mythology and in Jefferson's ideal of the yeoman farmer-citizen,
are Americans willing to spend $23 billion a year fighting economic
change.
</P>
<P>
   As the pain in the farm sector drags on endlessly, many farmers
are deciding that they may be better off in other lines of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you pass on your ranch to your son,'' Bob Long, a county
commissioner and rancher, said, ``then it's child abuse.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Showers and embedded thunderstorms will surround a sluggish
front from the interior Northeast to the southern Mississippi
Valley. Over two inches of rain will be common by early Monday from
eastern Texas to the Tennessee Valley as a potent jet stream
disturbance lifts sultry air. Farther north, lighter showers will
dampen the eastern Ohio Valley and northern Appalachians. The
Northeast coast will have some sun, which will fade behind
thickening clouds as showers approach from the west.
</P>
<P>
   Colder air will surge from the northern Rockies to the northern
Plains on gusty winds in the wake of a fast-moving cold front.
Scattered showers will mix with wet snow from the Dakotas to the
northern Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Coast states, offshore winds and ample sunshine will
cause unseasonable warmth to persist.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: CHANGING TIMES
</P>
<P>
   Twisting the hands of a clock cannot change the weather, but
Sunday's time adjustment can alter human perception of weather
events. Many daily weather trends begin at sunrise. The flood of
solar energy sets the air in motion, causing wind speed to
increase. The temperature often begins an abrupt rise. Dense fogs
start to dissipate as the sun warms the saturated air. Often,
strong weather systems overwhelm these daily cycles. But, on
average, as most people begin their day, the weather this week will
be calmer, cooler and mistier than last week because of the change
in time.

<P>
   MBARARA, Uganda _ To the believers, the world was to extinguish
at the year 2000, and so last December was a time for forgiveness
and, more practically, last-minute recruitment for the world to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Restoration of the Ten Commandments went house to
house to visit former cult members, urging them to return before it
was too late. Maria Goreth Sekibibi, 54, left home on Dec. 22,
without so much as a goodbye to her husband, Claudio, who had
argued against her going back, partly because of the cult's
slippery promise of painless salvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was telling her all the time, `Jesus went to heaven after
death,''' he said. `` `His mother, Mary, went to heaven after
death. Who are you to go to heaven without dying?'''
</P>
<P>
   She most probably did die, as did some 923 other people, at last
count, according Ugandan authorities, more than in any cult in
modern history. With mass graves turning up nearly daily,
authorities fear that many more dead may yet be found, perhaps even
hundreds more.
</P>
<P>
   The world was stubborn on Jan. 1, and did not end. And the
Ugandan police now speculate that some cult members, who were
required to sell their belongings and hand over the profits to the
group, rebelled and asked for money back. Paulina Zikanga, a
64-year-old widow and a cult member from the group's inception
until 1998, said this was a constant problem: Cult leaders would
set different dates for the end of the world, but the end never
came.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was still there, some people already started saying:
`How is it that the world doesn't end?''' she recalled. ``They were
insisting that if the world didn't end, they should refund their
money.''
</P>
<P>
   If the deaths were murder _ which looks increasingly plausible,
though no one can yet say for sure _ police speculate that this
unraveling of the cult leaders' New Year's prophecy may have formed
a motive, and another doomsday date was set for March. Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni has called the killings ``mass murder by
these priests for monetary gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the revised date for the end came with ceremony, and
finality. The cult had planned a huge celebration for March 15, and
one priest from the cult reportedly bought a strange kind of party
favor: 50 liters of sulfuric acid, which some investigators say may
have helped fuel the fire that exploded in a cult church in Kanungu
on March 17, finally alerting the world. At the church, the
pathologist counted 330 bodies, though the Ugandan authorities now
say 530 died in the blaze. Another party had been planned for a day
later.
</P>
<P>
   No cult members appear to have survived, though the police
believe that some of the leaders _ including Joseph Kibwetere, 64,
a school administrator and middling politician, and Credonia
Mwerinde, 48, who claimed direct contact with the Virgin Mary _ may
yet be alive, somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, police are working on the theory that cult
members may have been poisoned, because most of the bodies show no
sign of violence. There was also, apparently, little struggle,
which may indicate that some cult members did go willingly to their
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several former cult members said in interviews that part
of the indoctrination concerned martyrdom, and from its earliest
days the cult preached a gospel of doom and dire consequences from
an angry God against people who had long forgotten his word.
</P>
<P>
   Abdan Bishoboorokire, 54, who joined the cult in 1990, said
members were required to fill out questionnaires about whether they
would die for their faith. He quit in 1994 and returned to
Catholicism. But he retained his fervor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to be a martyr,'' he said in his home near
Rugazi, a town where 155 corpses were found around the house of the
former parish priest. ``Being a martyr would be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether mass suicide or mass murder, no explanation for so many
deaths is entirely satisfactory. And as the details surrounding the
deaths grow darker, what becomes clear is that the Ten Commandments
cult was different from others that have periodically burst into
public view by making apocalyptic prophecies and persuading or
coercing followers to lie down and die in a single instant, usually
in mere scores.
</P>
<P>
   In Uganda, incredibly, the deaths seem to have involved hundreds
of people and to have taken place over weeks or perhaps months _
without any hint to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies have been dug out of latrines, from under fresh
concrete in a priest's dressing room, from a packed pit next to a
banana field. Piles of whitened corpses _ many belonging to small
children _ are not yet rotted enough to erode the distinguishing
marks of life. At least one woman was pregnant. Another was lame.
One man showed signs of malaria. The barefoot prisoners charged
with digging them up gagged and spat.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That these grisly scenes unfolded in Uganda is perhaps no
coincidence. This beautiful country, a former British protectorate,
has a history of martyrdom: The anniversary of the deaths of 22
Christian converts in 1886, ordered burned by the king of Buganda,
the leader of the region's largest tribe, is still observed here.
</P>
<P>
   The more recent past has also been scarred by violence: in the
1970s, the dictator Idi Amin organized rampages that claimed up to
300,000 lives in a country of 22 million. While the 1990s brought
economic advances and a leader, President Museveni, who won much
Western support, the scourge of AIDS was rampant. Such
difficulties, Museveni said this week, make ``people develop
fatalism, pessimism.''
</P>
<P>
   Religion and violence have long coexisted in Uganda. In the
1980s, a self-described priestess named Alice Lakwena led a rebel
group called the Holy Spirit Movement against Museveni's young
government. Her cousin Joseph Kony now leads another rebel group in
the north called the Lord's Resistance Army.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens more religious groups that often mix
Christianity with local traditional religion. In September, for
example, Ugandan police raided the headquarters of another doomsday
cult, the World Message Last Warning church in the central Ugandan
town of Luwero, and said they found at least seven girls who had
been sexually assaulted, three boys held against their will and 18
unidentified shallow graves.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When the Ten Commandments sect was forming in the late 1980s,
said Paul Ikazire, a former Roman Catholic priest who joined the
cult, the established church itself was not responding to the
problems of its flock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We joined the movement as a protest against the Catholic
Church,'' Ikazire, now 83, told the New Vision, a semi-official
daily newspaper here. ``We had good intentions. The church was
backsliding, the priests were covered in scandals and the AIDS
scourge was taking its toll on the faithful. The world seemed
poised to end.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The cult seems to have had its earliest roots in Rwanda, and
particularly in the town of Kibeho, where from the late 1970s until
1994, children claimed visions of the Virgin Mary on a soccer
field. A cult of the Virgin spread to southwest Uganda _ and
Mwerinde, a former store owner and brewer of banana beer, claimed
that the Virgin Mary spoke to her for the first time in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   She belonged to a cult of the Virgin, and in 1989, along with
two other female members, she met Kibwetere, who was active in the
Catholic Church and local causes. The women claimed that the Virgin
directed them to him to spread her message: that people needed to
follow the Ten Commandments to escape damnation at the end of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The mesmerizing effect they had was evident in interviews with
former cult members and people whose families died around Rugazi,
about 50 miles northeast of the burned church. ``They acted like
ordinary Christians,'' said Francis Byaruhanga, a 45-year-old local
carpenter. ``But they said they were inspired by the Holy Spirit
and that they had supernatural powers.'' Many people joined the
cult, including two local Roman Catholic priests, Ikazire and the
Rev. Dominic Kataribabo.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, this group made demands that the church did not.
Members were not allowed to talk, and communicated mostly in sign
language. They were required to fast regularly and eat only one
meal a day on Fridays and Mondays. Sex was forbidden. So was soap.
They had to work hard in fields, growing potatoes, cassava, beans,
bananas or sugar cane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, terribly, like in prison,'' Byaruhanga said. ``Building.
Digging. Digging everything like we were slaves.'' The group's
ecstatic vision had an unusual effect on some members, driving
people to a mental extreme that may help explain the violence of
the cult's last weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was also possessed by their power myself,'' Byaruhanga said.
``It was terrible because they told me it was the power of the Holy
Spirit. Sometimes it would even pain my head. The power I got _ as
I was possessed _ I started hearing voices from my head just
speaking to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But the requirement that rankled most was that members sell off
their property and give the proceeds to the church. Several people
here said they quit because their children forbade selling the
family property.
</P>
<P>
   The structure of the cult's leadership was not completely clear,
members said. While Kibwetere was nominally in charge, he appeared
to many to be a weak, if charismatic, man who reportedly suffered
from manic depression. The real power, most everyone said, was
Mwerinde. She translated her visions from the Virgin into the rules
_ the ``program'' as cult members referred to them. Much of the
program was published in a red book, ``A Timely Message From
Heaven: The End of the Present Times,'' published first in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   She was also described as pretty, difficult and wrathful.
``Kibwetere was a quiet man,'' Sekibibi said. ``But Credonia was
too rough in handling members. She would say if you were breaking
one of the rules they gave you that the Virgin Mary and Jesus would
curse you.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the leaders appeared to live much differently from
ordinary members. Ikazire left the cult in 1994 _ taking with him
about 70 members around Rugazi _ but did not mention as a reason
any disparity between the leaders and followers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the cult accumulated houses for recruitment,
indoctrination and worship around southwest Uganda. In a 1997
filing with the government, its membership was listed at nearly
5,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 seemed to provide the final, compelling date for
the cult's predictions of the end of the world. In August,
Dementira Shashano, 61, a longstanding cult member, went to the
nearby town of Kabale to collect her oldest daughter and her
daughter's seven children, said her husband, Yacob Tibanyendera.
</P>
<P>
   In December, they gave away their clothes and, dressed in the
black-and-green uniforms of the cult, left for the church in
Kanungu, along with two other daughters and nine more
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Tibanyendera opposed her going _ they had argued for years about
her belonging to the cult _ but he said he himself was mildly
curious if the world was, in fact, going to end. ``I was also
waiting to see what was going to happen,'' he said. ``My mind was
open.''
</P>
<P>
   As New Year's approached, members at cult sites around the area
sold their clothes cheaply and even gave away expensively bred
cows, neighbors in several towns said. They stopped working the
fields. Former members were re-recruited for the final moment. But
it never came.
</P>
<P>
   Then on March 12, one of the priests, Kataribabo, dressed in
black with a rosary in his hand, went to the town of Kasese to see
an electrician named John Musoke. ``He said he had a problem,''
Musoke said. ``He said he wanted acid.'' For about $170, Musoke
sold the sulfuric acid, usually used to charge car batteries.
</P>
<P>
   On March 15, the members held a huge party in Kanungu,
reportedly roasting three bulls and drinking 70 crates of soft
drinks. As if to show that nothing was amiss, local officials were
invited to a function there on March 18, a day after the huge fire.
</P>
<P>
   At the home of Kataribabo in Rugazi, 155 more bodies were pulled
out of his back yard and in a pit dug into his house. At two other
sites, investigators found 234 more bodies, and they say there may
be many more in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Tibanyendera lost his wife, three daughters and 16
grandchildren. He remembered what they told him as they left for
Kanungu. ``They said they were never coming back,'' he said. ``They
said they were going to the holy land.''

PUTIN'S TEAM HAMMERS OUT A PLAN TO UNTWIST RUSSIA'S ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The victory of Vladimir Putin in last Sunday's
presidential election has focused attention on an opulent Moscow
building known as Alexander House, where a team of liberal-minded
economists and other experts has been quietly drafting Putin's
blueprint for Russia.
</P>
<P>
   German Gref, head of the Center for Strategic Research and
master of Alexander House, confidently predicted last week that by
late May Putin would be ready to release ``a breakthrough scenario
envisaging the most radical reforms,'' from an overhaul of Russia's
cumbersome tax code to a streamlining of its infamous
bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of tax reform, the contents of the program
are still vague and, on critical issues like land reform, still
under debate. But the Alexander House team _ which includes some of
Russia's best-known pro-market reformers _ has already firmly
established itself as the beachhead of liberal economics in the
coming Putin administration.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Putin prepares to assume his new mandate at inauguration
ceremonies scheduled for early May, the question is how Gref and
his ambitious plan will survive in the battle over access and
influence in the Putin Kremlin, which is being watched as keenly in
the United States as in Russia itself.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes in the next round of Byzantine intrigue and
infighting _ a regular feature of former President Boris Yeltsin's
rule _ are unusually high.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a struggle going on over the strategy for Russia,''
noted Boris Nemtsov, once one of the Kremlin's young reformers and
now a leader of the Union of Right Forces, which has broadly backed
Putin. ``Either it will be crony capitalism with tycoons,
corruption, underground deals and social polarization, or it will
be a Western-style economy.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference last week, Gref made clear that he had
Putin's ear, and his backing. He said that Putin had been offered
three plans for growth targets and picked the most ambitious one.
``This means we will really have our work cut out for us,'' Gref
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significant, Putin last week included Gref in a
small inner Cabinet that has been charged with overseeing the
transition and, in Gref's words, with ensuring that government
practice does not stray from the Alexander House team's policies.
Other members of the working group include First Deputy Prime
Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, Minister of Finance Aleksei Kudrin and
Alexsander Voloshin, the Kremlin chief of staff, who is the most
visible holdover from Yeltsin's inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Gref noted, the working group had been empowered to
amend government legislation, now pending in parliament, that
contradicts the center's policies _ a veiled reference to bills on
state registration of foreign trade transactions and capital flight
that seemed to fly in the face of the center's deregulatory bent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gref is building pressure on his rivals by assuring that the
president and the future Cabinet will need only the center's
program,'' the daily newspaper Segodnya said.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference last week, Gref said: ``There is no
alternative program. There may be different positions on different
issues, and if they are well grounded, they will be presented to
the president.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 35, Gref is the latest fresh face to become the standard
bearer for Russian reform. He is a lawyer with a faint Van Dyke
beard, a church-going Lutheran of German descent who, like his
patron, Putin, has a background in St. Petersburg city government,
where he once headed an experiment in housing reform.
</P>
<P>
   Since December, when the center was created by Putin, then the
prime minister, Gref has been coordinating the collection of
opinions on the full spectrum of Russia's unfinished agenda. His
brief career spans reform of the military and bank restructuring,
strengthening the courts and shrinking one of the world's largest
and most corrupt bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews and meetings and in an open letter to the voters
written for Putin during the election campaign, Gref has elaborated
on Putin's commitment to a strong and efficient government,
property rights, openness and the rule of law _ all elements needed
to turn Russia's twisted economy into a level playing field
suitable for desperately needed investment.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, Gref said last week, is to make the Russian economy
``manageable and market-oriented.'' At this point, he said, it has
``stagnated in a semireformed state. Our task is to take it to
normal market conditions.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But it is not surprising that his efforts have already run into
resistance. Boris Berezovsky, the financier and media tycoon who
boasts of his influence over the tiny group that held sway in the
Yeltsin Kremlin, recently poured scorn on the Alexander House team,
dismissing their efforts as ``unprofessional'' and their ideas as
``naive.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts see the battle shaping up in the Kremlin as a
repeat of an old rivalry between Berezovsky and Anatoly Chubais,
another Kremlin insider with the credentials of a reformer, who now
heads Russia's national electric utility company. Another group
reportedly vying for influence is headed by Pyotr Aven, a former
minister who is now president of Alfa-Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But the real issue is whether Putin, who owes his popularity to
his image as a tough, uncompromising former KGB agent, will be able
to prove his independence from all of these competing clans, and
steer Russia on to a more predictable course.
</P>
<P>
   An even greater challenge, many say, will be to override an
entrenched bureaucracy that has long experience in defeating the
best of plans. For this, they say Putin, when he moves, will have
to strike fast and hard, or risk being overwhelmed by vested
interests at all levels of government.
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign business leaders say the appointment of Gref or
members of his team to the new government would be a good start.
``Gref is strongly committed to liberal economics,'' said Glenn
Waller, director of the Petroleum Advisory Forum, a Moscow-based
lobbying group representing foreign oil and gas companies. ``If
Gref or anyone associated with him were to take a senior position
in the government, it would be a clear signal that Putin wants to
pursue reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Gref, the Alexander House team includes such reform
economists as Yevgeny Yasin, considered the captain of the reform
team; Aleksei Ulukayev, a deputy at the economics institute headed
by Yegor Gaidar, Yeltsin's first, reform-oriented prime minister;
Oleg Vyugin, a former deputy finance minister and an analyst at
Troika Dialog, a Moscow investment firm; and Andrei Illarionov, a
liberal economist who was a strong critic of Yeltsin's early reform
governments and is now thought to be in line for a post as Putin's
chief economic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial ally of the Gref team is the finance minister, Kudrin,
a longtime associate of Putin from St. Petersburg, who helped bring
the future president into the Yeltsin administration in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a limited number of people in Russia who can advise
the government on macroeconomic policy,'' said Vladimir Mau,
another deputy at Gaidar's institute who is also advising the
Alexander House team. ``The same people keep coming back, in
different proportions, but they are the same people.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last three months, Putin has conducted his own
economic seminars, as he toured the country ahead of the March 26
elections. Meeting with foreign investors on March 13, he impressed
many of them with his advanced preparation, and his attention to
detail, said Waller and other businessmen present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, his commitment to economic reform has remained
largely rhetorical, apparently in anticipation of the actual Gref
program. He has frequently repeated the broad principles of
free-market reforms, although during the campaign, he uttered
occasional populist comments that veered toward blunt
protectionism.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the reforms now under discussion, only changes to
Russia's awkward and antiquated tax code have already been drafted,
in preparation for a debate in the parliament later this spring.
The new code, which would reduce tax rates and shift from
revenue-based levies to profit-based levies, must be adopted by
July 1, if it is to be implemented next year.
</P>
<P>
   Gref said he did not expect any political opposition to the
changes in taxation, one of the few issues on the reformers' agenda
that also has the support of Russia's Communist Party. He said
opposition was likely in the parliament on other elements of the
program, but he added, with calm understatement, ``I don't think
there will be an atmosphere of sharp confrontation.''

   NEW YORK _ Never underestimate the power of Abby Joseph Cohen.
Last week, a warning about stock prices from Cohen, the formidable
chief investment strategist for Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.,
singlehandedly caused a broad sell-off in markets worldwide. It
left even the most seasoned traders quivering. ``When she speaks,
markets move,'' one marveled to Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   And not just markets. While Cohen has been ubiquitous on Wall
Street, the rest of the world is badly in need of her guidance. But
all that just might change in the months to come if Cohen expands
her spheres of influence. Here's a scenario as played out in a
series of news items:
</P>
<P>
   April 20, 2000 _ Steven Spielberg surprised Hollywood today when
he announced he was dropping plans to develop ``Minority Report,''
a science-fiction thriller set to star Tom Cruise, after the
Goldman, Sachs stock market seer Abby Joseph Cohen told Spielberg
that she believed the highly anticipated film would be a flop. ``I
thought we had a solid script, and Tom is usually bankable,'' he
said, ``but I couldn't take a chance after Abby gave the project a
thumbs down.'' An obviously disappointed Spielberg said, ``I'm
hoping she likes the sequel to `Saving Private Ryan' better.''
</P>
<P>
   May 15, 2000 _ Teen pregnancy rates dropped by nearly one-third
in 1999, to the lowest level in four decades, federal health
officials said yesterday. The National Center for Health Statistics
attributed the encouraging trend, which spanned all racial and
ethnic groups, to the ``Abby Says No'' teen abstinence campaign
featuring the stock market strategist Abby Joseph Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody touches kids like Abby,'' said Donna E. Shalala,
secretary of health and human services. ``Not Britney Spears, not
the Backstreet Boys, no one. She's been so right on the market for
so long that she has what the kids call `cred,' and you can't fake
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, director of the Office
of National Drug Control Policy, has asked Cohen for the chance to
expand ``Abby Says No'' to its anti-drug campaigns. ``Let's be
honest, those ads with the heroin addicts are getting old,'' said
General McCaffrey. ``We're looking for something a little more
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   July 20, 2000 _ Abby Joseph Cohen took home the top prize at the
World Series of Poker yesterday, winning $1.1 million after
defeating a field of more than 400 of the world's best poker
players. Cohen vanquished her final opponent, poker veteran Huck
Seed, with an ace-high flush, topping Seed's straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no chance,'' he said. ``It was like she could read my
mind!'' The always-modest Cohen attributed her victory mainly to
luck and said she had never played poker before entering the
tournament. ``I signed up mainly because I always wanted to see Las
Vegas,'' Cohen said. ``It's pretty neat.''
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 5, 2000 _ ``China and Taiwan will announce today that they
have ended more than a half-century of hostility and agreed in
principle to reunify as one nation by the end of the year, sources
close to the talks said late last night. The shocking deal comes
only days after Goldman, Sachs strategist Abby Joseph Cohen quietly
offered top Chinese and Taiwanese officials a white paper that
predicted stock markets in both countries could fall as much as 90
percent in the event of a Chinese attempt to take Taiwan by force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abby found the issue that resonates with the leaders of both
sides when she showed them just how much money a war would cost
them,'' said one American diplomat about the talks, which are being
held at Goldman, Sachs headquarters in New York City. ``She
deserves the Nobel Prize for this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 8, 2000 _ New York voters soundly rejected both New York
City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton yesterday, instead choosing Abby Joseph Cohen as New York's
newest senator. With 98 percent of precincts reporting late
Tuesday, Cohen, whose name was not listed on the ballot and who did
not campaign, had more than 63 percent of the vote, while Giuliani
and Clinton were locked in a virtual dead heat for second place
with 18 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   After word of Cohen's unexpected triumph was announced
yesterday, New Yorkers statewide rushed into the streets to
rejoice, creating an impromptu block party that stretched from
Buffalo to Montauk. ``I'm so glad it's Abby,'' said Gov. George E.
Pataki of Albany. ``Hillary and Rudy, Rudy and Hillary _ you've
gotta be kidding.''

   Given the transformation of American medicine over the last 75
years, Dr. Martin Solomon, a central figure in this Tuesday's
edition of the PBS documentary series ``Frontline,'' has little in
common with Dr. Martin Arrowsmith, the hero of Sinclair Lewis'
famous 1925 novel that bears his name. But they share a chronic
discontent: a feeling that they are trapped between the duty to
practice their profession conscientiously and the pressures of a
market society. The complaint, rooted in a clash between the
principles of Hippocrates and those of Adam Smith, may not be fully
curable.
</P>
<P>
   We meet Solomon, a primary care physician, in the prestigious
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center at Harvard, where he is
examining a man being treated for a dangerous infection and heart
problems. The patient has been in the intensive care unit for more
than six weeks at a cost of $150,000 and rising. Solomon calls his
expensive case ``a loser.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Israel is owned by CareGroup, a network of 7 hospitals,
3,000 doctors and 400,000 patients, which lost $100 million last
year. In an effort to change that, its doctors have been made
responsible for containing treatment costs and turning their
practices into profit centers. Their expenses _ ``Every time I
write a prescription, every time I order a test, every time I send
a patient to the emergency room'' _ are closely monitored, Solomon
laments, and if they spend too much, their incomes suffer.
</P>
<P>
   So there is pressure to shorten hospital stays and office
visits, reduce high-tech tests and discourage patients from seeking
consultations outside the group. And the best hospitals, like
Deaconess, which take on the most complicated cases and do research
and teaching as well, have the highest bills.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the new system is keeping doctors focused on the bottom
line, but is that where they should be? Sinclair Lewis, the son of
a country doctor, would surely have thought not, and his
Bildungsroman is largely given to the earnest young Arrowsmith's
efforts to resist the lures of the profit motive, which keep
getting in the way of the healer's mission.
</P>
<P>
   Practicing in the 1920s, Arrowsmith does not have to worry about
the high cost of diagnostic equipment since there are precious few
of those latter-day wonders, or about reductions in federal
financing since there isn't much of that either, or about the
impositions of HMOs. . But he has plenty of experience with his
profession's greed. As a satirist, Lewis was usually heavy-handed,
but his diagnosis of social ailments could be sharp.
</P>
<P>
   One character describes a successful surgeon as ``riding up to
the hospital in a lovely car with a chauffeur in uniform, and all
his patients simply worshiping him.'' Another doctor, a specialist
in removing any tonsils within reach of his knife, advises medical
students on the value of salesmanship in dealing with a customer:
``Explain to him, also to his stricken and anxious family, the hard
work and thought you are giving to his case, and so make him feel
that the good you have done him, or intend to do him, is even
greater than the fee you plan to charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrowsmith meets still another doctor, who reasons that ``It'd
be better for the general health situation if there weren't any
public health departments at all, because they get a lot of people
into the habit of going to free clinics instead of to private
physicians, and cut down the earnings of doctors and reduce their
number, so there are less of us to keep a watchful eye on
sickness.'' And Arrowsmith discerns ``the slimy trail of the
dollar'' in a Babbitt-like doctor's opposition to pasteurizing milk
and regulating tenements for fear of offending dairymen and
landlords.
</P>
<P>
   Dated though Arrowsmith's concerns are, the members of Solomon's
medical group, whose annual incomes range from $120,000 to
$300,000, also find themselves in thrall to financial constraints
and influenced by incentives that may run contrary to a patient's
well being. For example, they are under pressure to keep patients
from seeing specialists outside of CareGroup lest it reduce their
income. A doctor at another Boston HMO speaks for his patients:
``Are you really serving my best interest as a patient, doctor, or,
in fact, are you looking out for your best interest?''
</P>
<P>
   As the nation struggles to work out rational, compassionate,
economic health-care arrangements, the ethical issues faced by
Arrowsmith and those facing Solomon are not all that different. The
defiant Martin Arrowsmith ends up doing honest research of his own,
freed at last of the opportunism and corruption of the
practitioners around him. When last heard from, Martin Solomon is
explaining how he now must resist sending a patient to another
doctor even if he knows it might be to her benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether that is a good system, Solomon answers, ``I think
it stinks.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   To save on taxes, Americans routinely understate the value of
what they give their heirs, particularly stock in family-owned
businesses and real estate, new data from the IRS shows. But the
agency has almost no resources to stop the problem, and a recently
passed law has only increased the chances of not getting caught.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 percent of the 1,651 tax returns reporting gifts of
$1 million or more that were audited last year understated the
value of the gift, the IRS found. The average understatement was
about $303,000, on which about $167,000 in additional gift taxes
was due. This alone cost the government about $275 million last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Understatement also appears to be flagrant among the
quarter-million Americans who each year make smaller gifts, IRS
records show. On the 650 of these returns that were audited, the
average additional gift tax the IRS recommended was $97,000. The
IRS would not estimate the total cost to the government of
understated gifts.
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear that a far greater percentage of Americans who
owe gift taxes shortchange the government than do Americans paying
income taxes and other levies. What is more, the sums involved in
each case are much larger.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes on gifts and estates, while intended to make the system
fairer, breed tremendous resentment, and many Americans think they
should be eliminated or sharply reduced. Last year, Congress voted
to repeal the gift and estate tax. President Clinton vetoed the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as these taxes are the law, people are obligated to
pay them, said the IRS commissioner, Charles O. Rossotti. People
who do not, and whom the IRS fails to force to pay, end up with a
much better deal than their neighbors who are playing by the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our system depends on voluntary compliance,'' Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers said. ``Individuals cannot decide for
themselves if the rules apply.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRS, its auditing and legal staff shrinking in recent years
even as the number of complex tax returns grows, lacks the
resources to find most of the Americans who understate the value of
their gifts and estates or even fail to report any transfer of
property, said John Dalrymple, director of IRS operations. The IRS
has just 78 lawyers assigned to gift tax audits, each of whom is
responsible for auditing more than 3,300 gift tax returns this
year. And even when the agency does find abuses, it lacks the
resources to fight more than a small number of the cases in court.
</P>
<P>
   IRS lawyers said they were frustrated by their inability to stop
what they described as rampant cheating on gift taxes.
</P>
<P>
   One such lawyer in Manhattan, the nation's wealthiest tax
district, said his desk was piled high with gift tax returns that
will get little scrutiny. ``There is all this added work and no
staff,'' said the lawyer, who insisted he not be identified. ``I
know that there are millions and millions and millions of dollars
being passed untaxed right over my desk, and there is nothing I can
do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 250,000 gifts of less than $600,000, only one
in 400 is even audited, while among gifts of $600,000 to $1
million, fewer than one in 55 is audited. By contrast, the IRS has
been auditing three of every four gifts of more than $1 million,
but says that this is inadequate and that it is hiring three more
lawyers so it can audit 85 percent of returns reporting very large
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's task has only become more difficult. For one thing,
the number of gifts of $1 million and up jumped 21 percent last
year from 1996, and the IRS expects additional increases of at
least 5 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   Resources are further strained by a sharp rise in estate tax
returns, which are expected to grow by a third in the next four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, nearly three times as many gift tax returns are filed
as estate tax returns, although the estate tax raises six times as
much money. But the gift tax, more than the estate tax, has
recently increased the IRS' workload, because of a law passed by
Congress in 1997 to require speedy audits of gift tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 gives the agency three years to
audit gift tax returns _ or accept them as filed. Under the old
law, such returns could be audited and challenged years or decades
later, typically when the donor had died and his estate tax return
was filed. The new law, and the widespread knowledge that the IRS
can hardly audit all gift tax returns, has encouraged some
taxpayers to aggressively undervalue assets on the assumption that
the IRS either will not notice or will fail to act before the
three-year audit period ends.
</P>
<P>
   Data compiled by the IRS show how the problem has grown. In
1996, 1,816 gift tax returns with values of $1 million or more were
filed. Last year, there were 2,194 such returns. The average amount
of additional taxes owed because gifts were undervalued was
$167,000 last year, up 45 percent from $115,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers show that ``we have a compliance problem,'' said
Tom Hull, national director of specialty taxes for the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The amounts were calculated using rules set by Congress and the
courts to measure the value of assets. The rules are based on
factors like the cash flow of a business or its history of
dividends or, in the case of real estate, sales of comparable
properties.
</P>
<P>
   In cases of direct gifts of cash and publicly traded securities,
there are few problems, Hull said. The understatements involve
harder-to-value assets, mostly family-owned businesses and real
estate.
</P>
<P>
   Gift and estate taxes, which are taxes on transfers of property
during life and after death, respectively, are the fastest-growing
source of tax revenue for both the federal government and the
states. This reflects the rise in the stock market and in real
estate in the past decade, the aging of the World War II
generation, which owns most of this wealth, and the decision by
Congress not to adjust the gift and estate tax to take inflation
and other factors into full account.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS collected $2.7 billion in gift taxes in 1997, a figure
that is expected to grow to $3.6 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The gift tax works this way. For each gift to another person of
more than $10,000 in a year, a gift tax return must be filed
indicating the amount of the gift. When the total of such gifts
exceeds $675,000 during the giver's lifetime, the gift tax kicks
in. It must be paid on additional gifts greater than $10,000 per
person each year.
</P>
<P>
   The gift tax rates are the same as those levied on estates when
people die, but the law creates powerful incentives to give before
one dies.
</P>
<P>
   Consider an individual with $1 million to give who is in the top
tax bracket, which is 55 percent. When a gift is made while the
giver is still alive, the heir gets $645,000 and the gift tax is
$355,000. But if he gives away the money after death, the heir gets
$450,000 and the estate tax will take $550,000. Thus, making the
gift during the giver's lifetime puts $195,000 extra, or 43 percent
more, in the heir's pocket.
</P>
<P>
   But many Americans resent the tax and easily find ways to lower
the amount they pay. ``In my experience as an estate planner, it is
very hard to get people to make taxable gifts,'' said professor
Edward J. McCaffery of the University of Southern California Law
School. ``So when such gifts are made, we are by definition looking
at extremely wealthy and extremely aggressive and dynastically
inclined people, who are very sophisticated and who are going to
shop around for a good appraiser and let him know they want to come
in on the low side.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffery said ``there is a way of signaling to even the best of
the appraisers whether you want a high value, which you want if you
are selling your business or making a charitable gift, or if you
want a low value because you are doing tax planning.''
</P>
<P>
   He said many wealthy business owners planning to make large
gifts to their children ``will first kind of muck up the business''
by taking on debt or making other temporary changes to help an
appraiser justify a figure much lower than the true value of the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Luther J. Avery, a San Francisco lawyer who often writes on
flaws in the gift and estate tax system, said: ``There is a
tremendous competition among appraisers, and each is trying to buy
business from someone else, so they are low-balling their
appraisals. Of course a client will choose the lowest appraisal.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti, the IRS commissioner, said that a rapidly growing
industry is luring many prosperous Americans into illegal tax
avoidance schemes with promises of huge savings through methods
like placing their homes in trusts or opening offshore investment
accounts. These schemes are illegal if they lack a business purpose
other than tax avoidance or if the income from offshore accounts is
not fully reported. Americans are taxed on their worldwide income.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Pratt, widely regarded as the father of the business
appraisal industry and the publisher of a newsletter read by many
estate tax lawyers, said that in valuing businesses and real estate
no one figure is correct. ``There is a range of values'' depending
on how one interprets cash flow, competition and comparable sales
of real estate, he said. He said reputable appraisal firms come up
with a fair range of values, but there are also disreputable firms
producing unjustifiably low appraisals.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The IRS said that its problems are with appraisals, and with
discounts applied to those appraisals, that fall outside a
reasonable range. Discounts may be applied for such factors as
restrictions on the resale of stock in a family business or a
minority interest in real estate.
</P>
<P>
   But the IRS does not have the staff to stop even many of the
most outrageous cases.
</P>
<P>
   Take the tax agency's Fresno, Calif., office, whose workload is
typical of many IRS offices. It received 11,000 gift tax returns
last year, and has three lawyers to audit them, Joseph D'Amico, a
recently retired IRS supervising estate lawyer, told a legal
seminar in January.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, such lawyers will spend 31 minutes auditing each tax
return reporting a very large gift this year. Such returns
typically run dozens of pages, with appraisals, descriptions of
trusts and legal opinions.
</P>
<P>
   One major area of cheating cannot even be detected under the
current auditing system, two IRS lawyers said. When a gift tax
return indicates that total lifetime gifts have not reached the
$675,000 threshold where taxing begins, the return is not audited.
But both lawyers said that when they examined such returns at
random, they found many cases in which gifts declared at a sum like
$10,000 were really worth many times that.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PAVLOVCE NAD UHOM, Slovakia _ On the night of Feb. 7, Tibor
Tancos and Vlasta Tancosova were walking along the edge of the
street with their 12-year-old son, Tomas, when a drunk in a
blue-green Honda ran them down with his car. Tomas survived, but
his parents died.
</P>
<P>
   The police in this northeast corner of Slovakia aren't so
efficient in the best of times, but in post-communist Slovakia,
open discrimination against the Roma, or Gypsies, is the norm.
Rather than arresting the suspect, a well-known Slovak
business-mafia type, the police have instead threatened family
members and have beaten some of them, the family says. The
grandfather in the household, also named Tibor Tancos, has
complained but expects no justice. ``Nothing will come of it,'' he
said. ``We have no rights here, we Roma.''
</P>
<P>
   The Roma are Europe's stateless people, at least 8 million of
them scattered and mostly reviled throughout Central and Eastern
Europe. While half a million Roma died in the Holocaust, which the
Roma call ``the devouring,'' they remain the one people in the
modern, democratic, post-communist Europe whom it is largely
acceptable to persecute.
</P>
<P>
   Europe talks much of common aspirations and a continental
identity. But the 1990s made clear that Europe's most virulent
problem remains prejudice toward minorities and their exclusion
from a full range of democratic rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav civil wars focused attention on the dangers of a
militant nationalism, but in a misleading way. When most of Europe
goes to war with a small corner of the continent to defend the
rights of an oppressed people in Kosovo, it can seem as if
Europeans have learned the lesson of tolerance and are simply
disciplining an outmoded recalcitrant, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But the worsening plight of the Roma and the increasing
intolerance in Central and Eastern Europe after 1989 are bracing
antidotes to smugness about the post-communist spread of shared
values.
</P>
<P>
   The Roma have been despised for centuries as alien, thieving
subhumans (or as singing-and-dancing cartoons out of ``Carmen'')
with no allegiance to their countries or the law. Their culture and
habits combine with discrimination to produce a cycle of poverty,
poor schooling, bad health care and unemployment that are a
function of prejudice but also feed it, contributing to crime
rates, isolation and suspicion of outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Europe _ West or East _ shows little interest in
breaking the cycle of isolation and prejudice. There is no offer of
inclusion in society, or even, as here in Slovakia, much protection
from racial discrimination and violence, whether from neo-fascist
skinheads or the police.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment of the Roma _ including a denial of asylum in
countries like Britain, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden _ raises
serious questions about the basic principles of postwar Europe that
the European Union says it holds dear. Even in NATO-occupied
Kosovo, some 100,000 of the 125,000 Roma have fled or been forced
to flee by the victorious ethnic Albanians, who say the Roma
collaborated with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech president, Vaclav Havel, once noted, ``The Gypsies are
a litmus test, not of democracy but of civil society.'' If so, the
post-communist world is failing the test.
</P>
<P>
   Today, nearly 10 percent of Slovakia's 5 million people are
Roma, yet they are largely excluded from the mainstream of normal
life. According to a newspaper poll, 60 percent of Slovaks favor
their segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Slovakia and Romania are particularly vile to this minority,
which represents about 8 percent of Romania's population. But
Hungary and the Czech Republic discriminate widely too, especially
in education and employment. According to another newspaper poll
published last year, some 39 percent of Czechs still say that
``only force is effective'' in dealing with the Gypsies, while 15
percent say that the skinheads do a good job keeping them in line.
</P>
<P>
   Roma say almost unanimously that their lives and circumstances
are much worse now than under communism, when discrimination was at
least limited by ideology. The end of the communist pledge of full
employment _ no matter how artificial the work in a world where it
was illegal to be jobless _ has meant widespread and sometimes
total unemployment throughout Central and Eastern Europe for Roma,
who are the first to be fired in post-communist ``restructurings''

   ``Life is much worse for Roma than it was in 1989,'' said Claude
Cahn of the European Roma Rights Center, an independent foundation
based in Budapest. He cites official Slovak statistics showing that
80 percent of Roma children attended kindergarten in 1989-90, while
only 15 percent do today.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of Roma children in Slovakia are in ``special
schools'' intended for the mentally handicapped. In the Czech
Republic, a Roma child is 15 times more likely to be labeled
retarded than a non-Roma child.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Danihel, the Slovak government's representative for the
Roma, said estimates for Roma unemployment today are ``between 90
and 100 percent,'' which he admits stems as much from
``intolerance, ignorance and xenophobia'' as from any lack of skill
or education.

   PAVLOVCE NAD UHOM, Slovakia _ On the night of Feb. 7, Tibor
Tancos and Vlasta Tancosova were walking along the edge of the
street with their 12-year-old son, Tomas, when a drunk in a
blue-green Honda ran them down with his car. Tomas survived, but
his parents died.
</P>
<P>
   The police in this northeast corner of Slovakia aren't so
efficient in the best of times, but in post-communist Slovakia,
open discrimination against the Roma, or Gypsies, is the norm.
Rather than arresting the suspect, a well-known Slovak
business-mafia type, the police have instead threatened family
members and have beaten some of them, the family says. The
grandfather in the household, also named Tibor Tancos, has
complained but expects no justice. ``Nothing will come of it,'' he
said. ``We have no rights here, we Roma.''
</P>
<P>
   The Roma are Europe's stateless people, at least 8 million of
them scattered and mostly reviled throughout Central and Eastern
Europe. While half a million Roma died in the Holocaust, which the
Roma call ``the devouring,'' they remain the one people in the
modern, democratic, post-communist Europe whom it is largely
acceptable to persecute.
</P>
<P>
   Europe talks much of common aspirations and a continental
identity. But the 1990s made clear that Europe's most virulent
problem remains prejudice toward minorities and their exclusion
from a full range of democratic rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav civil wars focused attention on the dangers of a
militant nationalism, but in a misleading way. When most of Europe
goes to war with a small corner of the continent to defend the
rights of an oppressed people in Kosovo, it can seem as if
Europeans have learned the lesson of tolerance and are simply
disciplining an outmoded recalcitrant, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But the worsening plight of the Roma and the increasing
intolerance in Central and Eastern Europe after 1989 are bracing
antidotes to smugness about the post-communist spread of shared
values.
</P>
<P>
   The Roma have been despised for centuries as alien, thieving
subhumans (or as singing-and-dancing cartoons out of ``Carmen'')
with no allegiance to their countries or the law. Their culture and
habits combine with discrimination to produce a cycle of poverty,
poor schooling, bad health care and unemployment that are a
function of prejudice but also feed it, contributing to crime
rates, isolation and suspicion of outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Europe _ West or East _ shows little interest in
breaking the cycle of isolation and prejudice. There is no offer of
inclusion in society, or even, as here in Slovakia, much protection
from racial discrimination and violence, whether from neo-fascist
skinheads or the police.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment of the Roma _ including a denial of asylum in
countries like Britain, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden _ raises
serious questions about the basic principles of postwar Europe that
the European Union says it holds dear. Even in NATO-occupied
Kosovo, some 100,000 of the 125,000 Roma have fled or been forced
to flee by the victorious ethnic Albanians, who say the Roma
collaborated with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech president, Vaclav Havel, once noted, ``The Gypsies are
a litmus test, not of democracy but of civil society.'' If so, the
post-communist world is failing the test.
</P>
<P>
   Today, nearly 10 percent of Slovakia's 5 million people are
Roma, yet they are largely excluded from the mainstream of normal
life. According to a newspaper poll, 60 percent of Slovaks favor
their segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Slovakia and Romania are particularly vile to this minority,
which represents about 8 percent of Romania's population. But
Hungary and the Czech Republic discriminate widely too, especially
in education and employment. According to another newspaper poll
published last year, some 39 percent of Czechs still say that
``only force is effective'' in dealing with the Gypsies, while 15
percent say that the skinheads do a good job keeping them in line.
</P>
<P>
   Roma say almost unanimously that their lives and circumstances
are much worse now than under communism, when discrimination was at
least limited by ideology. The end of the communist pledge of full
employment _ no matter how artificial the work in a world where it
was illegal to be jobless _ has meant widespread and sometimes
total unemployment throughout Central and Eastern Europe for Roma,
who are the first to be fired in post-communist ``restructurings''
and who are rarely hired again for anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is much worse for Roma than it was in 1989,'' said Claude
Cahn of the European Roma Rights Center, an independent foundation
based in Budapest. He cites official Slovak statistics showing that
80 percent of Roma children attended kindergarten in 1989-90, while
only 15 percent do today.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of Roma children in Slovakia are in ``special
schools'' intended for the mentally handicapped. In the Czech
Republic, a Roma child is 15 times more likely to be labeled
retarded than a non-Roma child.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Danihel, the Slovak government's representative for the
Roma, said estimates for Roma unemployment today are ``between 90
and 100 percent,'' which he admits stems as much from
``intolerance, ignorance and xenophobia'' as from any lack of skill
or education.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Communism had its horrors for Roma, too: In preaching
assimilation, it repressed Roma language and culture, paid women to
be sterilized as a method of birth control, and often took Roma
children from their parents to raise them in orphanages, said
Miroslav Lacko, a Roma activist in Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, in Romania's wretched orphanages, nearly 75 percent
of the children are Roma.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the economic hopelessness and a widespread tolerance for
skinhead and police violence against the Roma have prompted a large
exodus, at first to Canada, that began about 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ondrej Gina, head of the Roma Cultural Union in the Czech
Republic, said about 20 percent of the Czech Roma have left, and
many thousands have left or tried to leave Slovakia, Romania and
Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers have overwhelmed international goodwill, and
Western countries have responded with new visa requirements,
deportations and the tightening of immigration and asylum
regulations. In a report about to be released, Amnesty
International says British officials are making it more difficult
for asylum seekers to reach Britain, are making conditions for Roma
unpleasant while they await judgment there and are ``almost
automatically'' rejecting their appeals as driven only by poverty
rather than persecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Roma have no reason to stay where they live,'' Cahn said.
``They are excluded from employment. Their housing is appalling.
They are hated. Their schooling will get them nowhere. They are not
components of the societies in which they exist. But Western Europe
deports them back. They are what the Nazis called luftmenschen,
people of the air, and it's hard to know on what they live.''
</P>
<P>
   All European societies regard the darker-skinned Roma as alien
and not a component of the majority population, which tends to be
monoethnic, Cahn said. Still, the desire of countries like the
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland to join the European
Union has brought new pressure to improve the lives and treatment
of Roma at home _ so they will stay there. But in general,
Roma-directed programs are vague and badly financed.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of Slovakia's new government is far better than that of
its nationalist predecessor, whose prime minister, Vladimir Meciar,
called Roma ``mental retards.'' But after 18 months, Denihel still
speaks of plans and studies and strategies and approaches. ``It's
all talk and nothing happens,'' say the parents of the dead couple,
Tibor and Vlasta Tancos.
</P>
<P>
   Tibor's father said his whole family used to work, but now no
one has a job. Skinheads force the Roma to stay in their houses at
night; restaurants and bars often do not let them enter. When he
complained to the police again, he said: ``One officer said: `It
wasn't a government minister who was killed.' So what does that
mean, that a dog or a cat was killed? Aren't we human?''
</P>
<P>
   Vlasta's father, Anton Demeter, said: ``You can't get justice
here. Everybody complained about the communists. But under the
communists, the murderer wouldn't be sitting at home right now,
while my daughter is in her grave. And now we have democracy, and
it's all supposed to be better. And they're surprised that Roma go
abroad? And the Slovaks want to go to Europe like this? This isn't
democracy.''

 By SARAH KERSHAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last Wednesday at 7 p.m., in a two-story house on
195th Street in St. Albans, Queens, Grace Francis put a 4-year-old
boy to bed. Tucked into his tiny cot, under a Power Rangers
comforter and matching sheets, he chose ``Clifford the Firehouse
Dog'' from a stack of books on the night table, and recited along
from memory as Francis read to him. She reminded him to say his
prayers, and when he was done, she flicked off the light and spent
the next few hours tending to an older boy.
</P>
<P>
   Francis is not the boys' mother or their nanny. She is their day
care provider. At Francis Grace Day Care, which Francis runs in her
home, care can start at any hour and last all week, as it did
earlier in March for the 4-year-old, Aldane Chambers. Last week,
his mother, Maureen Baker, dropped him off early Wednesday morning
on her way to New Jersey, where she works as a nanny, and picked
him up at 9 p.m. Thursday. The mother of the other boy is a nurse
who works until 9 two nights a week.
</P>
<P>
   In Francis' licensed day care center, Aldane's mother and other
parents have found the answer to an urgent need: child care at odd
hours. The center is a rare option for working New Yorkers _ bus
drivers and token clerks, nurses and cocktail waitresses, janitors
and seamstresses _ with no one else to turn to. For their city and
state are behind in the world of night care.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years _ particularly after the 1996 welfare overhaul
sent millions of parents into the work force, many on shifts at odd
hours _ dozens of cities and states have taken steps to supply
working parents with round-the-clock child care.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, particularly California, Florida and South
Carolina, have been aggressive in setting up and financing such
centers, while others have provided incentives and grants to
private programs. Such services have also been offered for years by
private companies, like Saturn and Disney, and by hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But New York City, one of the more aggressive in the nation in
reducing the welfare rolls and putting people to work for their
benefits, has until recently not been part of the movement toward
publicly financed, flexible-hour child care. New York state, still
in the early stages of a plan to encourage odd-hour care, has only
begun to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   One in three parents with young children holds a job that
requires early morning, late night or even lobster shifts,
according to a national study two years ago by the Families and
Work Institute, a nonprofit research organization based in
Manhattan. But New York still has not measured the need for
odd-hour care, so there are no statistics for the city or state to
be compared with the national rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knew Chattanooga would be ahead of New York in anything?''
said Phil Acord, executive director of the Children's
Home/Chambliss Shelter, a 24-hour child care center for low-income
families in Chattanooga, Tenn., that receives government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Although such centers are still unusual, some other cities,
including San Francisco and Winthrop, near Boston, support 24-hour
programs that serve as models in the emerging national conversation
about odd-hour care, according to a 1998 study by Parents United
for Child Care, a Boston advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   But thus far in New York City, it is largely individuals _
entrepreneurial providers like Francis, herself a Jamaican
immigrant who saw a need among Jamaican parents in St. Albans _ who
are stepping in to meet the need.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Bellevue Hospital Center is to open the city's
first round-the-clock child-care center, with space for a total of
117 children in eight-hour shifts. Hospital employees and working
parents from the neighborhood can apply, and the center is seeking
city subsidies for low-income parents.
</P>
<P>
   After heavy lobbying from child-care advocates, the City Council
allocated $500,000 last year to open the center at Bellevue. The
project, rejected by city officials years ago, was spearheaded by a
day care center director and a group of hospital employees,
including a Bellevue clinic worker whose 4-year-old-son died in a
1993 fire at an unlicensed day care program while she was on the
job.
</P>
<P>
   State and city officials insist that they are not ignoring the
child care needs of parents working odd hours, although they
acknowledge that they have little information about the demand.
</P>
<P>
   The city's Human Resources Administration, which distributes day
care aid to parents moving off public assistance, is not tracking
the work schedules of the more than 500,000 recipients with
children. However, officials did estimate that up to 10 percent of
the city's 37,000 workfare participants are working odd-hour
shifts, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After sharply increasing day care financing in 1999, the state
set aside $42 million that local childcare agencies could use for
odd-hour programs, among other things. But state officials have
recently told the agencies they should use the money to improve
existing services and increase reimbursement rates to day care
programs serving low-income parents, according to a recent
memorandum from the State Office of Children and Family Services.
</P>
<P>
   William Van Slyk, a spokesman, said that the higher rates should
encourage providers to stay open longer, and that the state would
make $19 million in grants available to opening day care programs,
including those offering odd-hour services. He said the state would
start sending out grant applications next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more needs are identified, I'm confident we will meet those
needs,'' Van Slyk said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The city's Agency for Child Development, part of the
Administration for Children's Services, has no plans to open
24-hour day care centers, officials said, although as far back as
1988 rules for night care were written into the city code that
regulates licensed day care programs. As the city expands day care
programs, the agency will consider proposals for extended hours and
has already received a few, according to Jennifer Falk, a
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   At Francis' day care center, most parents are immigrants who
have not sought the city's help to pay for day care. Because her
program is licensed (to care for up to six children) eligible
parents could use city vouchers to pay for care there, but none
done so, Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   Francis, 50, a nurse by training, opened her program in
September 1998 after noticing that many of the women in her
neighborhood, immigrants from Jamaica and Barbados, were struggling
to find child care to fit their schedules. With financial help from
her brother, George Francis, she opened her center on the first
floor. She uses the front room as an office and the middle room as
the child care room; it is decorated with children's artwork and is
used for playing, dancing, reading and, when she puts out the cots
stored in the office, sleeping. So far, Aldane is her only regular
overnight customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I slept here the other night, and then I slept here again,''
Aldane said earlier this month. ``I like it because it's fun here.
I like playing and sleeping and dancing and sleeping.'' Aldane's
mother, who immigrated to Queens along with her son a year ago from
West Moreland, Jamaica, said she learned about Francis Grace Day
Care from an advertisement in a local shoppers' guide and placed
him there immediately.
</P>
<P>
   As for leaving her son overnight, sometimes for several nights
in a row, Baker, 36, said: ``It's natural for a mother to miss her
child. But when they're OK, you don't worry about what's happening.
I feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not been easy for Francis financially. She charges a
weekly fee of $120 with $10 added for an overnight stay, but waives
some of that if her clients cannot afford all of it. She said she
was also struggling to save enough money to buy a television and a
computer for the children, having spent a $500 grant from a
neighborhood group for basic needs. She had not heard that the
state was planning to offer grants for odd-hour centers.
</P>
<P>
   Some other day care providers who have experimented with 24-hour
service say the extra costs and worry that a child will get ill, or
worse, in the night are not worth the extra business. Some parents,
too, feel uneasy about leaving their children overnight at either a
day care center or in a stranger's home, child care experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very challenging because it's not clear that parents want
centers, so you have to try to make them available and then look at
other ways of developing odd-hour care,'' said Helen Blank,
director of child care for the Children's Defense Fund in
Washington. ``But you have to provide odd-hour care because parents
are working odd hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Jay Maldonado, executive director of Educare, a day care
center sponsored by Bellevue, said she approached day care
officials 20 years ago with the idea of opening a round-the-clock
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have seen a need for 24-hour day care, but society
wasn't ready for it,'' Maldonado said, adding that she was often
concerned when she heard about nurses and other late-shift workers
leaving their children alone at night, perhaps checking on them
during a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, more and more society has become 24-hour oriented,'' she
said. ``If the city wanted 24-hour care, it could be done
tomorrow.''

</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL-INTEGRATION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Less than half a century
after the Supreme Court ruled that school segregation was
unconstitutional, are efforts to achieve racially integrated public
schools legally and politically doomed? A look at recent court
rulings that are making it hard for public schools to maintain even
a semblance of racial diversity in a judicial and political climate
that exalts choice above all other values. By Jeffrey Rosen. WITH
GRAPHIC. (Moved in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   GYPSIES-REVIEW (Pavlovce Nad Uhom, Slovakia) _ The Gypsies, or
Roma, are the new Europe's stateless people, at least 8 million of
them scattered and mostly reviled throughout Central and Eastern
Europe. While half a million Roma died in the Holocaust, which the
Roma call ``the devouring,'' they remain the one people in the
modern, democratic, post-communist Europe whom it is largely
acceptable to persecute. By Steven Erlanger. (Moved in `i'
category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   HEALTHCARE-MARKET-REVIEW (Undated) _ Given the transformation of
American medicine over the past 75 years, Dr. Martin Solomon, a
central figure in a PBS ``Frontline'' documentary, has little in
common with Dr. Martin Arrowsmith, the hero of Sinclair Lewis'
famous 1925 novel that bears his name. But they share a chronic
discontent: a feeling that they are trapped between the duty to
practice their profession conscientiously and the pressures of a
market society. The complaint, rooted in a clash between the
principles of Hippocrates and those of Adam Smith, may not be fully
curable. By Walter Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   ABBY-COHEN-REVIEW (Undated) _ Never underestimate the power of
Abby Joseph Cohen, the ubiquitous chief investment strategist for
Goldman, Sachs. Last week, she almost singlehandedly caused a broad
sell-off in markets worldwide. ``When she speaks, markets move,''
said one trader. And not just markets. Cohen, who appears
frequently on TV, usually just discusses Wall Street, which has
left the rest of the world badly in need of guidance. But all that
just might change in the months to come, if the guru breaks out and
enters other spheres of influence. By Alex Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   ALEX-COMFORT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Dr. Alex Comfort personified the
sort of tweedy English intellectual who could gracefully range from
subject to subject and from literary form to form. He was a
physician, poet, novelist, anarchist, pacifist and a leading
researcher on how people age. He was best known as the author of
``The Joy of Sex: A Gourmet Guide to Lovemaking'' but a glance at
his other writings reveals a dazzlingly multi-faceted mind. By
Douglas Martin.
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-WOMEN-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Pentagon has tried to
emphasize milestones it has achieved in advancing the standing of
women in the nation's armed services. A provocative new book, ``The
Kinder, Gentler Military, '' challenges the sanguine image the
Pentagon would like to convey of equality in the military's
increasing co-ed ranks. The author, Stephanie Gutmann, accuses the
Pentagon's civilian and military leaders of dangerously eroding
U.S. military might in a politically correct pursuit to expand
women's opportunities. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS-STUDY-REVIEW (Undated) _ American researchers studying AIDS
tracked heterosexual couples in Uganda. In each case, one partner
was already infected, and the doctors did not tell the uninfected
partner that the other had HIV. After receiving intensive
instruction on how to prevent transmission, and access to free
condoms, the couples were followed for more than two years.
Anti-viral drugs were withheld. When the study ended, 90 more
people were HIV-infected. Many doctors have asked how such studies
in the developing world can be justified on moral grounds. By
Jerome Groopman.
</P>
<P>
   MONETARY-POLICY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan has been trying, with little success so far, to cool off
an economy that is threatening to overheat and impose a degree of
temperance on Wall Street's long-running party. It is not just
Greenspan whose clout is in question. Given that companies,
consumers and investors have proven largely impervious to a series
of rate hikes by the Fed, economists are wondering whether monetary
policy still works, or at least whether it works the same way it
used to. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   LONG-NOW-CLOCK-REVIEW (San Francisco) _ The Clock of the Long
Now is a much-anticipated clock designed by the inventor and
scientist Danny Hillis to measure the next 10,000 years and beyond.
The prototype clock, an exquisite object standing some 9 feet high,
has been called the world's slowest-moving computer. Part magic box
and part conceptual art, the clock has become the cause celebre of
a heady cadre of Bay Area thinkers and futurists. By Patricia Leigh
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   RENO-ELIAN-REVIEW (Washington) _ Attorney General Janet Reno's
friends and long-time associates say the Elian Gonzalez case has
been especially difficult for her because it is roiling the city
where she was born, grew up and served for 15 years as an immensely
popular state attorney. Miami is also the place where she plans to
return after she leaves the office of attorney general in January,
to live in the ranch house that her mother built on the edge of the
Everglades. By Don Van Natta.

   SCHOOL-INTEGRATION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Less than half a century
after the Supreme Court ruled that school segregation was
unconstitutional, are efforts to achieve racially integrated public
schools legally and politically doomed? A look at recent court
rulings that are making it hard for public schools to maintain even
a semblance of racial diversity in a judicial and political climate
that exalts choice above all other values. By Jeffrey Rosen. WITH
GRAPHIC. (Moved in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   GYPSIES-REVIEW (Pavlovce Nad Uhom, Slovakia) _ The Gypsies, or
Roma, are the new Europe's stateless people, at least 8 million of
them scattered and mostly reviled throughout Central and Eastern
Europe. While half a million Roma died in the Holocaust, which the
Roma call ``the devouring,'' they remain the one people in the
modern, democratic, post-communist Europe whom it is largely
acceptable to persecute. By Steven Erlanger. (Moved in `i'

<P>
   HEALTHCARE-MARKET-REVIEW (Undated) _ Given the transformation of
American medicine over the past 75 years, Dr. Martin Solomon, a
central figure in a PBS ``Frontline'' documentary, has little in
common with Dr. Martin Arrowsmith, the hero of Sinclair Lewis'
famous 1925 novel that bears his name. But they share a chronic
discontent: a feeling that they are trapped between the duty to
practice their profession conscientiously and the pressures of a
market society. The complaint, rooted in a clash between the
principles of Hippocrates and those of Adam Smith, may not be fully
curable. By Walter Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   ABBY-COHEN-REVIEW (Undated) _ Never underestimate the power of
Abby Joseph Cohen, the ubiquitous chief investment strategist for
Goldman, Sachs. Last week, she almost singlehandedly caused a broad
sell-off in markets worldwide. ``When she speaks, markets move,''
said one trader. And not just markets. Cohen, who appears
frequently on TV, usually just discusses Wall Street, which has
left the rest of the world badly in need of guidance. But all that
just might change in the months to come, if the guru breaks out and
enters other spheres of influence. By Alex Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   ALEX-COMFORT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Dr. Alex Comfort personified the
sort of tweedy English intellectual who could gracefully range from
subject to subject and from literary form to form. He was a
physician, poet, novelist, anarchist, pacifist and a leading
researcher on how people age. He was best known as the author of

A NEW PLAYER ENTERS THE CAMPAIGN SPENDING FRAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ George Gorton is hardly a political novice.
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years, since he was a college student supporting James L.
Buckley's campaign for the U.S. Senate from New York, he has worked
for candidates from Richard Nixon to Pete Wilson to Boris Yeltsin.
But even he had not thought much about Section 527 of the Internal
Revenue Code _ at least not until last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was walking around complaining to everybody that I could
find about the amount of money that organized labor was spending on
issue advocacy,'' said Gorton, who cut his teeth as national
college coordinator for CREEP, Nixon's Committee for the
Re-election of the President, in 1972. ``And somebody said to me,
`George, that's their First Amendment right.' And I decided labor
wasn't wrong to do it; they were right to do it, and so I decided
pro-business people should do it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So Gorton, who runs a Republican consulting business based in
San Diego, started Shape the Debate, a nonprofit political
organization that, under Section 527, can raise and spend unlimited
amounts of money, with no disclosure requirements for donors, as
long as it does not expressly advocate the election or defeat of
any candidate. Its inaugural television advertisement, which began
airing this week in California and New York, accuses Vice President
Al Gore of political hypocrisy, in a mock game show in which
contestants answer questions on various topics, including Gore's
support for campaign finance overhaul despite his appearance at an
illegal fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shape the Debate strongly believes that free enterprise and
conservative ideas are more likely to become public policy when
candidates and public officials honestly and publicly discuss their
positions on them,'' according to the group's credo, which can be
found on its Web site, shapethedebate.com. ``Shape the Debate will
therefore use stinging ads of rebuke, where appropriate, or gentle
praise to remind leading candidates and public officials to
honestly discuss our issues, as a means to keep conservative and
free enterprise issues uppermost in the minds of the American
public.''
</P>
<P>
   The group is among the latest entrants in a growing field of
independent campaign expenditure efforts, spurred on by recent
court rulings interpreting the tax law. The group's literature
emphasizes that contributions are not a matter of public record,
and Gorton said that was an appealing point for donors, most of
them Republicans and many of them Californians who supported
Wilson's past campaigns for governor and senator. So far the group
has raised about $1.5 million, in chunks of multiple thousands of
dollars; Gorton hopes to raise another $2 million to $3 million for
advertising campaigns this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the atmosphere that's been created by the Clinton-Gore
administration, where the secret FBI files of Republican appointees
turned up in White House hands, you have to wonder about
retribution,'' he said. ``The heart of the First Amendment is that
you can criticize your government without fear of retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who was forced out of office by term limits last year,
has helped raise money for the group. As governor, he tangled
repeatedly with public employee unions that undertook campaigns
opposing his policies, and former Wilson aides say they see the
latest effort as a way of evening the score a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television is what really does shape the debate,'' said
Wilson, who since last fall has been working for Pacific Capital,
an investment banking concern in Beverly Hills. ``The candidates
certainly have that obligation, and sometimes they fulfill it and
sometimes they don't. But the fact is, there are very definite
limits on what they can reasonably expect to raise through their
own efforts. Arguably, Bob Dole in 1996 was dead before he ever got
to the convention in San Diego, because of the tremendous pummeling
he took in the interim in independent expenditures directed against
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson added, ``I think what you've got now is a situation in
which most of the spending on television on both sides is going to
be financed by independent groups and not the candidates
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   State and national Democratic officials swiftly denounced Shape
the Debate's efforts as ``underground financing'' waged by ``George
W. Bush's ally,'' in the words of a Democratic National Committee
news release. In fact, Wilson's former aides say, he has never had
particularly warm relations with Bush and has regarded him warily
for years as a rival. When Wilson decided last year not to pursue
his own presidential campaign, and Bush telephoned to wish him
well, at least one senior Wilson aide urged him not even to return
the call.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who battled a severe recession in his first term before
presiding over a sharp recovery, nevertheless remains controversial
in California, where his strong stands against affirmative action
and illegal immigration provoked a backlash. Bush has not generally
tapped the old network of Wilson advisers in his campaign here, and
Gorton said he did not believe the two men had talked in months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Peewee's trying to find a way that George Bush will
give him a call,'' said former state Sen. Art Torres, the chairman
of the California Democratic Party, using his party's derisive
nickname for Wilson. ``The problem is, he's now created even more
of a fire wall, because of the sensitivity he's created with this
ad. They have no sense of subtlety and they never did.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson said: ``I have gotten into this because I think
George W. Bush should be president. I also think that had he
faltered, John McCain should have been president. And I don't think
the vice president should be. It's as simple as that.''

   KOBE, Japan _ The crisp, chill air still reeks of smoke outside
the charred Ring Ring House, a telephone dating club where four
patrons died in March in a firebombing that has raised fears of
renewed gangland violence in this otherwise gentle port city.
</P>
<P>
   On fashionable Tor Road near the boarded-up club, where the
police said clients came to arrange dates and prostitution over the
telephone, many passers-by expressed shock and dismay over the
attack, which has been linked to a turf war between rival gangs of
Yamaguchi-gumi, Japan's largest crime syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very scary and very disturbing,'' said Mio Shirakawa,
a 20-year-old college student who came with a friend to take a
picture of the scorched telephone club. ``My grandfather used to
tell me stories about how brutal the yakuza were many years ago,
but I didn't think this sort of violence existed in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the vicious attack, the authorities say, is a besieged
Japanese yakuza, or mob, that once tried to present itself as a
good public citizen but is now feeling the pinch of a weak economy
and an aggressive crackdown by police and community groups. This
accumulated threat to the mob's bread-and-butter businesses _
gambling, the sex trade, drug trafficking, protection rackets _ has
sparked a bitter and often violent struggle among rival gangs for
control of shrinking criminal enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the authorities say it has never been harder to make a
living as a mobster in Japan, and the yakuza's shrinking membership
shows it. The number of full-time yakuza members declined from
48,000 in 1994 to 43,500 in 1998, the last year police statistics
were available.
</P>
<P>
   As the country's largest and wealthiest organized crime group,
Yamaguchi-gumi has more than 17,000 members across Japan. It is
headed by Yoshinori Watanabe, the Japanese godfather of the yakuza,
and has hundreds of affiliated criminal gangs that pay monthly
honorariums to the group's headquarters here in Kobe.
</P>
<P>
   Fulfilling these monthly obligations has become increasingly
difficult as the yakuza, like the rest of Japan, has seen its
profits dwindle during the country's recent economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Those difficulties have been compounded by stricter police
enforcement of new laws intended to limit the mob's money-making
activities, particularly its protection and intimidation schemes,
as well as by successful efforts by many businesses and community
groups to drive yakuza gangs from their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the gangs are scrambling to generate revenues, not
only to meet their monthly obligations to mob bosses but also
simply to survive, the authorities said. While some yakuza groups
are expanding into new areas of business, like waste processing or
providing low-cost labor to the construction industry, other less
entrepreneurial gangs are encroaching on rival territories in
violent attacks, like the one on the Ring Ring House.
</P>
<P>
   The local police have detained two men suspected of carrying out
that fire-bombing for a Yamaguchi-gumi faction that the police say
wanted protection money. The Ring Ring House had refused, the
authorities believe, because it was already paying for protection
from a different Yamaguchi-gumi affiliate, underscoring the
increasing competition among Japanese gangs.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even as the yakuza is being squeezed across Japan, the
authorities say, it still thrives in cities and towns like Kobe,
where its operations are largely invisible to the public until an
occasional violent outburst like that at the Ring Ring House.
</P>
<P>
   On the same evening as the Ring Ring House arson, another Kobe
telephone club, just a few miles away, was also the victim of a
firebomb that injured three people. Gangs related to Yamaguchi-gumi
are the prime suspects.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the police arrested a member of a lower-ranked
Yamaguchi-gumi gang on charges of throwing a gasoline bomb into a
pachinko game parlor in nearby Itami City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody needs to do something to stop all this violence and
corruption,'' said Terumi Okamoto, who owns a women's clothing
store that was damaged in the Ring Ring House fire. ``The problem
is that in Japan, nobody is willing to take responsibility, not the
police, not the head of the mob, no one.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Yamaguchi-gumi tried to present a good public
image, and its members were rarely involved in public acts of
violence. After the devastating earthquake here in 1995, it
distributed food and other aid to quake victims.
</P>
<P>
   At its headquarters here, a heavily guarded compound
encompassing a full city block in an upscale residential district,
Yamaguchi-gumi has posted a list of rules to be followed by its
members.
</P>
<P>
   The rules state that Yamaguchi-gumi members should refrain from
``using or selling narcotics like stimulants and marijuana,'' and
should not commit acts like ``talking with a loud voice, throwing
out dust, cigarettes, or empty cans that cause trouble with the
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   But today, Yamaguchi-gumi's leadership does not exercise the
same control over its members as it once did, and many low-ranking
gangs are engaged in illegal gun sales and the drug trade, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a telephone call to Yamaguchi-gumi's headquarters,
a man who identified himself as Nakamura said the group did not
make statements to journalists. Asked if someone in the
organization could comment on allegations that affiliate members
were involved in the recent attacks, Nakamura said: ``I don't know
such things. People just talk without any basis.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Local police officials said that while the recent firebombings
of telephone dating clubs were reason for concern, the public
should remain calm.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they were using a three-pronged approach to
reducing yakuza activity, including vigorous prosecution of the
mob's executive ranks, large-scale arrests of rank-and-file members
and tougher enforcement of recent laws to deprive the yakuza of
vital revenue sources.
</P>
<P>
   Tsuguaki Shinka, a deputy chief of the anti-mob division of the
prefecture of police, said that so far this year the police had
arrested two senior Yamaguchi-gumi members who were implicated in
gasoline bombing and harassment cases.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Shinka said, under a recently approved anti-mob
law, the police issued 170 ``stop orders'' to yakuza members who
tried to collect protection money or force individuals to pay debts
through intimidation. After issuing more than two such warnings to
a yakuza member, the police are empowered to arrest the offender,
Shinka said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the police, some Japanese citizens are taking
matters into their own hands and forming community and business
groups that are directly confronting the yakuza, and in some cases
driving the gangs away from their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In Amagasaki City, just east of here, and in the Kobe district
of Suma, citizens groups closed down the offices of yakuza gangs
that tried to collect protection fees and extort money from local
businesses and residents.
</P>
<P>
   Kenji Nakayama, a Kobe taxi driver, said, ``As long as the
yakuza remain in their own world, I don't really care if they fight
and kill each other, but I get angry when they cross into our world
and kill innocent people.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, representatives from a cross section of local
industries in Hygyo prefecture held a summit meeting here to
discuss ways of combating yakuza influence in the business
community. The meeting resulted in the creation of an industry
association whose goal is to expel mob groups.
</P>
<P>
   Association members have posted anti-mob signs in their shop
windows and at work sites. The signs state: ``We are a company that
rejects the mob. We refuse to donate any money to the mob.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had all grown tired of being pressured and intimidated by
the mob to make payments,'' said Yoshiro Akiyama, a civil
engineering firm executive who is president of the anti-mob
industry group, ``and we decided that we were not going to take it
anymore.''

THE SHADOWY MAN BEHIND PERU'S PRESIDENT BECOMES A POLITICAL ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ President Alberto K. Fujimori's intelligence chief,
Vladimiro Montesinos is rarely seen in public. Former associates
describe him as a loner with a taste for history books and
classical music. The few photographs that do exist show him to be a
man with a wide smile and a fondness for double-breasted suits, a
handkerchief folded neatly in the breast pocket.
</P>
<P>
   To those outside the Fujimori administration, however, the
53-year-old Montesinos is known as the Rasputin of Peru's politics,
whose power in large part derives from his intimate knowledge of
the president's deepest personal secrets and who is held
responsible for a daunting catalog of political sins.
</P>
<P>
   He was, according to a critical book published here this week, a
dominant force behind shutting down the Congress and Supreme Court
in 1992, the eavesdropping on opposition presidential candidates in
the 1995 elections, and years of manipulation of judges and the
news media that has helped keep the president firmly ensconced in
power.
</P>
<P>
   Now Montesinos is accused by opponents of running a campaign of
dirty tricks intended to assure Fujimori's re-election on April 9.
Montesinos himself has become a top issue in the race _ one that
has hurt Fujimori by association.
</P>
<P>
   An opposition newspaper recently obtained detailed information
showing that Montesinos has in recent years had an annual income of
more than $2 million and, refueling old charges leveled by
political enemies but never proved, that he was in the pay of drug
traffickers. Another newspaper published photographs showing trucks
delivering tons of Fujimori campaign paraphernalia to the
headquarters of the National Intelligence Service, the agency
Montesinos runs, for distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos has been a crucial ally of the Clinton administration
in efforts to stop drug trafficking in the Andean region, and U.S.
officials have not mentioned him by name in public criticisms of
the current election campaign. But opposition politicians and
journalists here hold him responsible for television and newspaper
smear campaigns against several presidential candidates as well as
other irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   His role in the campaign is the subject of almost daily
speculation in the opposition media. He is repeatedly the subject
of questions at news conferences given by presidential candidates,
and several have promised to fire him and to conduct criminal
investigations of his activities should they finally succeed after
10 years in wresting the presidency from Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been fatal for the country,'' Alberto Andrade, mayor of
Lima and a leading presidential candidate, told El Comercio, Lima's
leading daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montesinos is the Machiavelli who over the years has built the
machine for Fujimori's re-election,'' Andrade said in a separate
interview, ``from the appointment of friendly members of the
electoral tribunal, to the appointment of friendly judges who have
assisted in substituting the owners of critical television stations
with minority shareholders friendly to the president, to the firing
of judges who opposed his re-election to an unconstitutional third
term.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Montesinos was born into a family of Marxists. He joined the
army and rose to the rank of captain before he was expelled in 1977
on allegations that he sold state secrets to the CIA. He went on to
practice law and defended drug traffickers against prosecution in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   A retired general, Francisco Morales Bermudez, Peru's last
military dictator, publicly disclosed that Montesinos, while still
an army captain, had forged signatures to allow him to visit
Washington furtively and meet with American officials.
</P>
<P>
   And in a challenge to the intimate relationship that Montesinos
_ and, by extension, Fujimori _ maintains with the Peruvian army,
Morales Bermudez accused Montesinos of manipulating top military
promotions to aid Fujimori's political interests.
</P>
<P>
   Like a good spy, Montesinos does not answer any of these
charges, and he did not respond to multiple requests for an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But Fujimori, in an interview, said he had complete confidence
in Montesinos, whom he described as ``superintelligent, very agile,
very analytical.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori said that there was nothing unusual about a successful
lawyer acquiring riches and that he had no problem with Montesinos'
having defended shady characters in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``He provides the security that allows the government to be
successful,'' the president said, crediting the intelligence chief
with helping to defeat two terrorist insurrections and adding that
he is a crucial ally of the Clinton administration in efforts to
stop drug trafficking and assure stability in the Andean region.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very good relationship between the Drug Enforcement
Administration, the CIA and Montesinos,'' Fujimori said boldly.
``The CIA calls Montesinos from time to time. There is cooperation.
It is good for both countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mansfield, a CIA spokesman, said, ``As a matter of policy,
we don't comment on such matters.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials have long refused to confirm or deny any ties
to Montesinos, only noting that last year they cut off a three-year
$200,000 State Department aid program to his intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Peter Romero, the acting assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs, called Montesinos last year to lobby for
Peruvian help on a United Nations human rights resolution in Geneva
condemning Cuba. Peru did not vote with the United States, and an
aide to Romero refused to speak about his conversations with
foreign officials or comment on Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been sending a mixed message on Montesinos,'' said
Elliott Abrams, the Reagan administration's assistant secretary of
state for inter-American affairs, who is now a paid consultant for
a Peruvian television station owner who was stripped of control of
his station after it broadcast reports in 1997 criticizing
Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the position of decrying human rights abuses on
Monday while working with Montesinos on Tuesday,'' Abrams said.
</P>
<P>
   One candidate who has been careful not to attack Montesinos
directly is Alejandro Toledo, a business school professor who is
Fujimori's strongest challenger. Toledo campaign aides say
privately that the intelligence chief is behind news media reports
that Toledo fathered an illegitimate daughter and refused to
support her. The aides and Toledo's wife, Eliane Karp, deny the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, by his own account, has been receiving polling
information from Montesinos' agency, spurring speculation that he
might be ready to make some kind of arrangement with the
intelligence chief after the campaign is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toledo does not want to confront Montesinos directly,'' said
Carlos Tapia, a former lecturer at the Army Intelligence School.
``He'll seek a negotiated settlement but he won't allow Montesinos
to stay on if he wins. The question is how he will work that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos' influence over the military is rooted in his
extensive collection of files of personal information on young
officers beginning from his days as an army intelligence officer in
the 1970s. Furthermore, in his first term as president Fujimori
gave Montesinos broad independent powers as his go-between with a
security apparatus and military with which Fujimori had had little
previous contact.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials are supposed to keep a low profile, but
Montesinos has had an uncomfortably high profile since 1996, when a
drug trafficker, Demetrio Chavez, publicly said that he paid
Montesinos $50,000 a month in exchange for landing rights at a
jungle airfield outside an army base. Chavez, appearing visibly
disoriented, later retracted his charge but Montesinos' had already
become a household name.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has tried repeatedly but unsuccessfully to improve
Montesinos' public image, particularly after the 1997 rescue of 71
hostages held for four months at the Japanese ambassador's
residence by terrorists. Montesinos was credited with planning the
rescue, and he appeared for the first time publicly in years when
he triumphantly toured the residence after its liberation.
</P>
<P>
   If Montesinos is a political liability for Fujimori, many
Peruvian analysts wonder why the president does not dismiss him.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, said Francisco Loayza, a former official at the
intelligence agency who introduced Fujimori to Montesinos 10 years
ago, is that the intelligence chief knows too much about the
president's private life. As Fujimori's personal lawyer during his
first presidential campaign, Montesinos handled some outstanding
tax matters, and later his divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Loayza also charged that Montesinos handled the paperwork to
cover up Fujimori's birth in Japan since the Peruvian constitution
requires that the president be a native-born citizen. Fujimori has
repeatedly denied the charge, saying he was born in Peru shortly
after his Japanese parents immigrated here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fujimori is Montesinos' hostage,'' Loayza said. ``While
Montesinos has everything on Fujimori, Fujimori has nothing on
Montesinos.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to respond, Fujimori began to speak in the third person:
``Please. Fujimori cannot be controlled,'' he said. ``There is no
power above or behind him.''

   CUBA-ECONOMY-$ADV02 _ HAVANA _ Ten years ago the buzzards were
circling over Fidel Castro's communist Cuba as the country nearly
collapsed in tandem with its long-time patron, the Soviet Union.
Despite the fondest hopes of Miami's exiles, though, Castro appears
to have once again beaten the odds, thanks mostly to a booming
tourism industry that attracted more than 1.65 million visitors
last year. With ambitious plans to attract 10 million visitors by
2010, tourism has brought an influx of foreign investment _ and
American dollars _ that is slowly transforming Old Havana's
decaying buildings into gems of dazzling colonial architecture,
with five-star hotels and high-end restaurants to rival the
fanciest Caribbean destination. But the tourists and their dollars
have also opened a crack in the state-run economy, allowing a tiny
private sector to emerge. (Williams, Cox News Service) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   w/CUBA-PRIVATE-$ADV02 _ HAVANA _ Felix Garces doesn't dream of
leaving Cuba to live a better life in the United States, but he
does want a better life for his own family. Trained in Russia as a
linguist, Garces found his salary of US$13 a month as a government
translator wasn't enough to support his family, so he started a
bicycle-taxi service, shuttling tourists and Havana residents
around in his three-wheel, two-seat rig that resembles a ricksaw.
Now he earns up to US$100 a month. But life is still hard _ he must
pay for a license to operate the taxi, and find tires and parts to
keep it running. (Williams, Cox News Service) MOVED

   COXNET FOCUS 0401: CUBA'S ECONOMIC RESURGENCE _ Tourism, U.S.
dollars are influencing Cuba in both subtle and dramatic ways as
the island nation wavers between its Soviet-influenced past and an
uncertain future. Ten years after experts predicted the collapse of
the Soviet Union would send Fidel Castro's communist Cuba to the
graveyard of broken socialist dreams, Havana is bustling with
workers, visitors and a tourist invasion that poses stiff
competition for its Caribbean neighbors. (Williams, Cox News
Service). Art includes a 3-column color photo of a busy market in
Cuba, a 1-column color photo of tourists dining at a Cuban tourist
destination, a 18-pica color photo of a Cuban photographer taking
pphotos of tourists and a 18-pica color photo women dresses in
traditional Cuban garb posing for tourists.

   WITH: CUBA'S IMPOVERISHED CITIZENRY _ Since the collapse of the
Soviet Union and the end of its billions in annual aid to Cuba,
day-to-day life for many Cubans has been a ceaseless grind. Trips
to the state-run store to pick up monthly rations sometimes yield
empty shelves, leaving people scrambling to earn American dollars
so they can purchase life's necessities in the free-market stores
that now dot Havana's neighborhoods. (Williams, Cox News Service)

   DEADFAMILY _ Waynesville, N.C._ For more than 50 years, Earl and
Cora Phillips lived a simple life in a tiny cinder block house high
above I-40, a curious speck of Appalachian Americana on the edge of
the Great Smoky Moutains. But the house must have shone like a
beacon to the two men accused of killing the couple and three other
members of the Phillips clan. Authorities say the suspects already
had killed one man and were running from police when their pickup
truck broke down not far from Earl Lane. The case stands as one of
North Carolina's worst spree killings in modern history. It also
represents the worst nightmare of isolated country people: a

   COXNET FOCUS 0402: A SEASON ON THE LAND _ More flue-cured
tobacco is grown in Pitt County, North Carolina, than anywhere else
in the nation. The culture and the economy are rooted in tending
the leaf, and in the self-reliant way of life such labor demands.
Yet as court rulings, public opinion and pressure from Washington
alter the fortunes of tobacco, change has made its way into the
fields. There will be fewer and fewer lives like the ones Betty and
W.C. Moore of Bethel live, shaped and bound by the rituals of
passing seasons on the farm. (Schulken, The Daily Reflector)
</P>
<P>
   w/TOBACCO PRIMER In their infancy tobacco plants look like tiny
shamrocks. As many as a million plants have taken root in the
warmth of W.C. Moore's greenhouse, snug in Styrofoam seed crates,
resting on a bed of water. They were sowed in mid-March, and in
April, when the threat of a hard freeze is past, they will be
transplanted in the field, the first crop of a new century. The
green fuzz sprouting in the seed crates doesn't look like much. But
with an average price, the half-million pounds of leaf it will grow
into could net $850,000. (Schulken, The Daily Reflector)

   PHYS-ED _ ORLANDO _ Thousands of physical education teachers are
starting an uphill battle to reverse the gradual disappearance of
phys ed classes in American schools, especially in grades 7 through
12. The decline makes kids fatter and sicker, says Surgeon General
David Satcher. It can also make them mean, says Senate
Appropriations Committee chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who
believes that the lack of a place to let off steam increases
violence and misbehavior by adolescents. Sporting goods
manufacturers are supplying $1 million and international sport and
phys ed groups are offering moral support and research findings to
back up the crusade, which will have its first test in a Senate
vote on a $400 million physical education bill this spring.

   HOUSTON-ATLANTA _ The parallels between Houston and Atlanta are
compelling. Sun-belt giants of industry, both are striving to
establish themselves as cultural centers. Houston has an edge in
some regards. Both cities have resident symphony, opera, ballet
companies and major regional theaters. But Houston's main museum
has ten times the money the High does. And the Alley Theatre has
won a regional Tony Award, while the Alliance has been ignored.
Atlanta, however, won what is rapidly becoming known as the Robert
Spano sweepstakes; the ASO secured the heralded Spano as its new
music director, while the Houston Symphony still looks to fill its
vacancy. Houston's Grand Opera, however, has a national reputation
for introducing new works, a trend it continues on April 14 when it
debuts ``Cold Sassy Tree.'' This story will be an overall look at
Houston as a culture capital, with specifics about how ``Cold Sassy
Tree'' came to be done by the Houston Opera as opposed to, say, the
Atlanta Opera. (Sabulis, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 &HT;    Sanders back on track
 &HT;    By Rick Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ronnie Sanders could be called short-track racing's
Comeback Kid. Except he's no kid anymore.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Sanders, 54, appeared to be nearing the end of a
remarkable career on the short tracks of the Southeast. Since his
first race in 1967, he had won more than 500 races and at least 10
track championships.
</P>
<P>
   But by the late 1990s, his career appeared to be nearing its
end. The victories that once came so readily were becoming elusive.
And his car owner and biggest booster, his uncle Bob Stinchcomb,
died of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if I could make it without Bob,'' Sanders said.
``This is a very expensive sport.''
</P>
<P>
   But it changed, starting with the 1999 season opener for the
Southern All Stars, a series of short-track stock-car races across
the South.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders won the first race at Birmingham International Raceway
and went on to score five more victories, including the prestigious
World Classic, also at Birmingham. The Fayetteville driver won the
All Stars' Hard Charger award, given to the driver who improves his
position the most during each race. And he was honored for leading
more laps than any other driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had been 10 years since I had done anything like that,''
Sanders said. ``When we weren't winning, we didn't ever stop
trying, but it got awfully discouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   He has started this season with another victory and a
second-place finish in the first two races of the season and is the
Southern All Stars points leader.
</P>
<P>
   Age, it seems, is not a hindrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel as good as I ever did,'' Sanders said. ``And with the
way my cars are driving now, age is not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The only change evident is a little more patience behind the
wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past couple of years, I've tried to drive a little bit
smarter than I used to,'' Sanders said. ``Last year, I ran second a
lot at times during races when I could have been leading. Years
ago, I tried to lead every lap, if I could.''
</P>
<P>
   During the years, Sanders has built a reputation as one of the
fiercest competitors in the sport. Former Atlanta Falcons head
coach Jerry Glanville now drives stock cars and has raced against
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronnie's a great competitor,'' Glanville said. ``Every single
lap, he's trying to beat you.''
</P>
<P>
   Glanville said Sanders reminds him of one of pro football's most
durable players. ``Ronnie's the Chuck Bednarik of racing,'' he
said. ``He goes to work every day, lines up and kicks your tail.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Hansard, a Southern All Stars driver from Tyrone, has raced
against Sanders and worked on his pit crew. He said Sanders is one
of the hardest-working people he knows _ on and off the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man gets up at 5:30 every morning and does what needs to
be done,'' Hansard said. ``And he's in better shape physically than
99 percent of the drivers out there. When you get down to the last
10 laps of a 200-lap race, some drivers are about given out, but
not Sanders; he's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansard said a trip to Sanders' race shop is a good indicator of
how hard Sanders works.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have chairs in our shop, because we like to sit down and
read the paper sometimes,'' Hansard said. ``There aren't any chairs
in Ronnie's shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said the only regret he has about his racing career is
that he didn't try harder to break into Winston Cup. He ran about a
dozen Winston Cup and ARCA superspeedway races in the '80s, but his
team was underfunded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I could have gotten a good ride then,'' Sanders said.
``But at that time, our interest was more in winning on the short
tracks, and our Winston Cup effort was secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back on it, it should have been the other way
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Still he is proud of his accomplishments in his short Cup
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always had very little financially, but we were able to do
some things that teams with millions of dollars haven't been able
to do,'' he said. ``We made the Daytona 500 three times. I ran
seventh in the 125-mile qualifying race in 1981 and finished 18th
in the 500, even though we had a wheel break and cracked a cylinder
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1987, we ran the tires that Bill Elliott's crew took off
his car and we still finished 21st. During the day, we ran with a
lot of good cars, but there is only so much you can do on old
tires.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Winston Cup driver Donnie Allison, now a consultant for
Winston Cup teams, raced against Sanders in his driving days. He
said Sanders had a good chance of being a Winston Cup star.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the skills,'' Allison said. ``He just never got with
the right team or car owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison and most of the other drivers Sanders ran against in the
1980s are retired, while Sanders continues to race against drivers
that are his children's age.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other night I loaned a driver a Winston jacket that I won
in 1981,'' Sanders said. ``I told him the jacket was older than he
was.''

 &HT;    Teams gearing up to keep Yankees at bay
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now for Plan J.
</P>
<P>
   The American League for four years has tried anything to escape
the hammerlock that the New York Yankees have maintained almost
unceasingly upon the 13 other teams. This spring bears the same
scant hope.
</P>
<P>
   Chasing a third straight World Series championship and a fourth
in five years, the Yankees of 2000 are essentially the same
substance that has run through both leagues with such ease in
recent autumns. Elsewhere in the league, young teams _ Oakland and
Toronto _ are getting better while solid contenders _ Cleveland and
Boston _ mass for another rush.
</P>
<P>
   But the plain truth remains that the Yankees' roster has hardly
changed during this historic rush. Outside the Bronx, the anguish
grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we've done to this point, all the division titles
and stuff, won't mean anything until we win the World Series,''
said Indians catcher Sandy Alomar, his club having nothing to show
for five straight Central championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's necessary that we win one. And the thing I'm interested
in finding out is will the fans still come out after we win one?''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians' biggest response to New York was adding free agent
pitcher Chuck Finley, which is hardly enough to close the gap
against a rotation of Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, David Cone,
Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte. The Tribe's firing of manager Mike
Hargrove was more a gesture of frustration than a shift in
strategy, after Cleveland went 10-22 against playoff teams last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see us buckle down and play well against good teams
like that,'' new Indians manager Charlie Manuel said. ``I think
that it's important because it can give you a mental edge when you
play those teams again.''
</P>
<P>
   In the West, while Seattle retools for ``small ball'' without
Ken Griffey Jr. and Texas jettisons Juan Gonzalez and Todd Zeile
for pitching, Oakland has emerged as a legitimate force. They might
be the hardest-hitting team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Don't talk to Boston about being hit hard. After the Red Sox's
surprising run last October, the city finds itself in dread about
Sports Illustrated's choice of Boston to win the World Series.
Somehow that worry is great comfort to New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good,'' Clemens said. ``That's great. New century.''
</P>
<P>
   And same old Yankees.

SERBIA'S BLOCKADE RAISES TENSION WITH ITS SMALLER PARTNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia _ Once, even after the old Yugoslavia
disintegrated in bloodshed, the traveler might barely have noticed
there was a border in the mountains between Serbia and Montenegro.
Other republics left the Yugoslav fold, but these two were still
joined in a federation, and relations were so good that there was
no need for police to oversee the lively traffic on a practically
invisible border.
</P>
<P>
   Today, that traffic has slowed to the barest trickle, and police
forces on both sides keep a careful watch on any vehicles that do
cross.
</P>
<P>
   Just outside the town of Bijelo Polje, the last big Montenegrin
town before the border with Serbia, a handful of police in dark
navy blue uniforms wave down cars heading for Serbia and check
documents. Ten miles down the twisting mountain road in Brodarevo,
and again at the main junction town of Prijepolje, Serbian police
in grey uniforms carry out more thorough checks.
</P>
<P>
   For the last month, in an eerie echo of tactics adopted by the
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, against Slovenia and other
republics that broke away from Belgrade in the early 1990s, Serbian
authorities have imposed a strict trade ban on goods passing
between Montenegro and Serbia. The few drivers traveling through to
Montenegro said they were unable to bring even small quantities of
goods bought in Serbia for personal use. The only truck driver
coming through this day had special papers from the army.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me they wouldn't even allow a tin of ham,'' said
Zoran Laric, a restaurant owner who had checked the new rules with
the Serbian police.
</P>
<P>
   The trade ban appears to be Belgrade's latest attempt to
undermine the government of Montenegro and its westward-leaning
president Milo Djukanovic, and it is already hurting local
Montenegrin businesses. Coming alongside a propaganda onslaught and
increased military activity by the Yugoslav army in the region, it
has added an urgency to the sharp debates raging between the
pro-and anti-Milosevic factions in Montenegro, an enclave of
600,000 fiercely proud people divided into clans whose
centuries-old feuds and alliances are riven with bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   The blockade has raised the specter of a permanent split and
even a forced division of the two republics. ``We already feel the
separation,'' said a Muslim businessman in Bijelo Polje who would
give his name only as Daco. ``I am very scared that the same thing
that happened in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Macedonia will
happen to Montenegro. The scenario so far is the same, and the man
guiding it is the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Daco and a fellow businessman, both local shoe manufacturers,
complained that 31 of the 32 items they need for making their shoes
come from Serbia. Only the leather is produced in Montenegro and
even that supply is in jeopardy as the leather producers have also
been hit by the trade ban. ``We have a huge problem, production has
fallen drastically,'' said the second businessman.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to make us believe we cannot live without them,''
said Daco of the Serbian action.
</P>
<P>
   In Montenegro, which was never a wealthy region and has been
further impoverished by 10 years of war and international sanctions
that go with being formally tied to Milosevic, the immediate
effects of the Serbian blockade are rising prices and falling
production. Until last month, 85 percent of Montenegro's trade was
with Serbia. Now, a fraction of that business continues along
special channels apparently sanctioned by the Serbian leadership,
forcing the Montenegrins to think about other markets.
</P>
<P>
   There is an underlying feeling of dread in Bijelo Polje, a town
where half the population is Muslim, and that has already been
buffeted by the tensions of the wars in neighboring Bosnia and then
in the nearby Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian refugees from Kosovo have swelled the town's population
and added an element of anger. Among them are former police
officers from Kosovo, and people suspected of committing war crimes
there before NATO troops entered Kosovo last June. Crowds of young
people throng Bijelo Polje's main street, sitting around with
nothing to do while Montenegrin police patrol the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav army is also in evidence. On Thursday, a truck full
of tough-looking soldiers in combat gear, some with bandannas on
their heads and camouflage paint smeared on their faces, pulled
into a base on the edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   A refugee from Kosovo blanched at the description of that scene.
``That means they are here, they are preparing something, believe
me,'' he said, referring to pro-Milosevic forces.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a grenade exploded in the town's police station.
The local authorities put it down to a couple of drunkards and say
it was not a political gesture, yet admit it is a symptom of social
tension.
</P>
<P>
   The Montenegrin police, who number approximately 20,000, have
the assignment of keeping the lid on any violence, providing
everything from traffic police to specialist paramilitary teams
capable of taking on the Yugoslav army if need be.
</P>
<P>
   The government is open about some of its preparations. On a
stretch of wasteland just south of the capital, Podgorica, a
special police anti-terrorist unit on Friday staged a raid for
journalists on an abandoned house. Black-clad and masked, they
burst through a window and blew out doors, shooting dead their
supposed opponents with ruthless efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Built up in the last two years by Djukanovic's government, the
Montenegrin special police are the talk of this small capital, and
the republic's best hope for defense should it come to conflict
with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone tries to discipline Montenegro by force, we will
prevent him by all means,'' said the commander of the Special
Police, Veselin Veljovic. He supports the government line that
every effort must be made to avoid a conflict with Serbia, but
warns that Montenegro may not be able to control events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a balance of fear will preserve peace. The moment
Belgrade thinks we are weak they will take steps. We know they are
planning that. We will show that we are neither weak, nor
defenseless,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is already a standoff between the Montenegrin police and
the Yugoslav army, the main protagonists in the growing divide
between Montenegro and Serbia. They circle each other warily and
monitor each other's activities across the republic. Numerically
the police have the upper hand, but the army is far superior when
it comes to firepower.
</P>
<P>
   Commanders of the 2nd Army, which is based in Podgorica, do not
appear to relish the idea of conflict against Montenegrins. ``We
are trying to keep out of politics, but the politicians are
dragging us in,'' said a spokesman for the 2nd Army.
</P>
<P>
   The government says that a recent agreement with the army for
joint border controls has reduced the tension and put the
relationship between the police and military on a clearer footing.
Yet the busy activity of the special police tells another tale.
Police officials say the government has not let on just how tense
relations are, and how close to a clash the two have come on
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslims in Bijelo Polje look forlorn when asked if they
think the police could prevent a conflict. ``It has never been so
bad, but I have never seen the people so calm,'' said Daco.
``Perhaps after 10 years of war and troubles they have become
deadened, like a piece of wood.''

 &HT;    Will any team be able to stop the Yankees?
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Yankee-hating, a noble pursuit, remains one of
baseball's most time-honored traditions, spawned by decades of
arrogant success, bad movies, arrogant ownership and even more
arrogant fans. Native son Joe Torre couldn't even stand them.
</P>
<P>
   The great philosopher Bill Veeck used to say that when the New
York Yankees failed it was ``one of those exquisite times when life
and art are in perfect conjunction.'' And he was probably
underselling.
</P>
<P>
   But last fall, the baseball universe stopped what it was doing
to behold the Yankees. October, like the October before it and much
like the last half-decade, became another inning-by-inning
verification that this was a special team in the middle of a
special time doing something special.
</P>
<P>
   An 11-1 run through the postseason and a 25th World Series
title. A third World Series Championship in four years. A World
Series win streak of 12 in a row. Eighteen wins in 19 postseason
games, dating back to the 1998 ALCS. Casey Stengel's five
consecutive championship clubs, 1949-53, did not dominate in the
postseason like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mentality is to win games,'' Torre said. ``How much better
do you want it than winning? Being on a world championship team
stays with you forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager is hardly the first to evoke eternal terminology
around his team. If the Yankees keep this up _and only a few more
gray hairs suggest they can't _ they will become the first team in
more than a quarter-century to win three World Series in a row. The
last was the Oakland A's, 1972-74.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Yankees have done it with style and some grace _
and maybe just a little arrogance _ that has left even the
bitterest rivals with a sense of appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play the game right, whether you like them or not, their
attitude,'' Boston manager Jimy Williams said. ``They play with
respect for the game. Maybe that's why I admire them so much, the
way they play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They did everything right that series,'' Red Sox catcher Jason
Varitek said, referring to New York's ALCS victory. ``They played
pretty much perfect baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is why Las Vegas likes them to do it again. The
roster has been disturbed slightly; the missing include reserve
outfielder Chad Curtis (traded to Texas), fifth starter Hideki
Irabu (traded to Montreal), designated hitter Chili Davis
(retired), catcher Joe Girardi (signed with Chicago Cubs) and
reserve infielder Luis Sojo (signed with Pittsburgh).
</P>
<P>
   But the engine driving the franchise remains untouched. The
four-man rotation of Orlando Hernandez, who had a wicked spring,
David Cone, Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte can expect to be the
best in baseball this year. Ricky Ledee, thrust into a starter's
role in left field, responded by leading the team in spring home
runs. Derek Jeter, now just 25, hit .400 nearly the whole
exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Bernie Williams remains the popular vote for
toughest out in the major leagues. Closer Mariano Rivera led the
majors in saves last year (45), dropped his career postseason ERA
to 0.38 and then picked up the World Series MVP trophy.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees' spring record (12-18) so disturbed owner
George Steinbrenner that he held a late-night meeting in Tampa to
root out the problem, rival teams only laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Call it pennant envy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to hand it to us because we're the Yankees,''
Cone said. ``We don't have a problem with complacency. If there was
any of that, it would have shown up before. But we've won it three
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankee mystique, an ethereal commodity sparked for decades by
the likes of Gary Cooper, William Bendix and Reggie Jackson, might
never be so much in evidence. This weekend, the Yankees flew to
Houston to play the first exhibition games in new Enron Field,
before flying on to San Francisco to do the same for new Pacfic
Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Pirates already are arranging for the Yanks to
play the first games in PNC Park, when it opens in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the name. It's the Yankees,'' said San Francisco's Barry
Bonds, not generally noted for being overappreciative of anything.
``How many people in this world would love to play for the Yankees?
Or have the opportunity to play against them? They won 25 World
Series. That's huge.''
</P>
<P>
   The 25 titles are the most by any team competing in the four
major North American professional sports. The Yankees' share came
over a 78-year period; the Montreal Canadiens won their 24 Stanley
Cups over an 80-year span. Those numbers make the Yankees the
winningest professional team, just as they insist they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up in New York when they won five in a row, I remember
that,'' said Torre, who was raised in Brooklyn, the son of a NYC
detective. ``That's probably what kept me from bring a Yankee fan _
to want to pull for someone who was more of a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is that challenge still there, some 50 years later? A
primary advantage is the franchise's wealth. Funded by a monstrous
$50 million broadcast contract, the Yankees are able to do things
other teams can't, an inequity inherent in the baseball business.
Their payroll will approach $94 million _ Williams just signed an
$87.5 million, seven-year deal _ and the club soon will pay bigger
sums to keep Jeter and Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   But spending money is the effect, not the cause. Williams,
Jeter, Rivera, Pettitte, Ledee, catcher Jorge Posada and outfielder
Shane Spencer all were developed within the Yankee farm system. And
the system remains as fully stocked as any in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Middle infielder Alfonso Soriano, third baseman (and Michigan
quarterback) Drew Henson, shortstop D'Angelo Jimenez and first
baseman Nick Johnson could wind up being better as a group than
what is up in the Bronx right now. Right-hander Ryan Bradley
stumbled in his first major-league exposure last summer, just as
left-hander Ed Yarnall stuggled this spring. But both will inherit
major roles with the big club. Jake Westbrook, who came over from
Montreal in the Irabu trade, made a strong impression in his first
major-league camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got the system set up so they can slowly start moving
guys when they're ready,'' Jeter said. ``They don't have to rush
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Once they get to New York, they find another dividend _ Torre,
whom Steinbrenner dubbed the best manager he's ever had. Duh.
Chided in the tabloids as ``Clueless Joe'' when hired in 1996,
Torre has an innate talent for handling Steinbrenner, diverting the
New York press, presiding over a calm and professional clubhouse
and then winning the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees respond to him. Missing nearly seven weeks last
season for treatment of prostate cancer, Torre returned to the
dugout on May 18 when the team lost in Boston, dropped to 21-16 and
fell to second place. After a three-week interval, the Yanks simply
took off, playing .623 baseball, fending off Boston and winning 98
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't go to the World Series and lose it; they went to
the World Series and swept it,'' Boston first baseman Mike Stanley
said. ``It's hard to say you've gained ground on a team that has
won back-to-back World Series. And it's not like they've made a
whole lot of changes, lost a bunch of players.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, this will be an even older team in 2000. Only
three members of the Opening Day lineup will be under 30. The three
mainstays of the rotation average 36 years old, and right fielder
Paul O'Neill is 37. El Duque might be 34.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really see this as a Chicago Bulls last-hurrah run for
us,'' Cone said. ``We have some great prospects coming up. Paul
O'Neill and I have talked about this. We're getting late in our
careers, and we want to win another title to validate all the other
championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Out in the countryside, they'll really hate to hear that.

 &HT;    Time's gaining on Braves' big three
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLATNA _ John Smoltz had a grin on his face as he walked past
several teammates toward his locker and announced, ``Dead man
walking.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a couple of days had passed since Smoltz had learned, after
five years of fighting it, that the ligament in his right elbow had
finally given way. The Braves would be without the services of one
of their three Cy Young winners for the entire season for the first
time since the rotation had been assembled.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz is walking evidence of something the Braves and their
fans don't exactly like to think about _ the mortality of their
starting pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   The National League's team of the 1990s enters the 2000 season
wiser and older. Smoltz turns 33 on May 15, Greg Maddux will be 34
on April 14, and Tom Glavine turned 34 on March 25. Smoltz is the
only one who has shown serious signs of slowing down. But Glavine
and Maddux struggled early last season, going a combined 7-9 with a
4.76 ERA in April and May.
</P>
<P>
   Those problems might have had more to do with a shrinking strike
zone than anything else, but they brought up the inevitable
question: How long can they go?
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought if I could pitch until I'm 30 that'd be
great,'' said Maddux, who is signed through 2002. ``After 10 years,
I'm on extra credit.''
</P>
<P>
   So, does he see himself pitching until he's 37? Or 40? How about
300 wins?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really look that far ahead,'' Maddux said. ``I'm going
to do what I can this year, enjoy it. I spent a couple years where
I kept waiting for the end of the year, kept waiting for the season
to start, or waiting for the All-Star break, or waiting for the
playoffs. I forgot to enjoy it along the way, so I stopped doing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, whose contract expires after 2001 with an option for
2002, like Maddux is a control pitcher, which means he can feel
good about his chances of pitching for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I feel like I do right now, I'll go for a long time,''
Glavine said. ``Hopefully, I'll get (to) 200 (wins) this year. The
realistic goal that's out there for me is 250 wins. I'm (63) wins
away from that. Average 14 or 15 a year, that's another five years
or so and I think I can pitch that long.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz, because of a mid-90s fastball and a nasty slider and
their toll on his elbow, doesn't have as good a chance to last, and
he knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago my (goal) was to play until I'm 40,'' Smoltz
said. ``I had worked my whole life to do this. I was going to get
the most out of it. But when you realize that it's got you and you
don't have it, that's when my walk with God and my faith changed
me. ... Baseball's not my god anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz's injury actually might prolong his career. Having
ligament transplant surgery could ensure him three or four years
more than he would have had with a weakened elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to be forced out because of an injury,'' Smoltz
said. ``I like to think I still have some unfinished work.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching them all has been a former pitcher with a unique
perspective. Braves broadcaster and Hall of Famer Don Sutton
pitched until he was 43. He won 324 games, one of only 20 pitchers
to reach 300 or more victories, and his 5,282 1/3 innings pitched
ranks seventh all-time.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton's take on who, what and how long:
</P>
<P>
   ``John Smoltz has the personality to be a reliever,'' Sutton
said. ``In order to get John's attention, it's got to be something
big on the line. I'm not sure he's ever been long-range oriented.
</P>
<P>
   ``(What Maddux and Glavine do) from the neck up is going to
decide how long they want to go. They have very uncomplicated,
simple deliveries. Barring some freak injury, they should not get
hurt. ... They've already made the adjustments. They know how to
bum their way through games, how to change speeds, win when they're
not at their best. Glavine learned that about his fourth year in
the big leagues. Maddux knew it as a 13-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one has any guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can predict how long a pitcher will last,'' Braves
orthopedist Joe Chandler said. ``It's a genetic thing. Aside from
that, it's taking care of your body, staying in shape and pacing
yourself, and then there's luck. ... They're smart. They know their
bodies well. (They know how) to play within themselves and maximize
what they do have.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz is the creative one, trying everything from acupuncture
to chiropractic care to massage therapy. The more traditional
Glavine is the one most likely to pass up doughnuts and bacon in
the clubhouse breakfast spread for a bagel with no cream cheese and
some fruit, and to wash down vitamins with his coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux's offseason regimen is mostly about resting his arm and
shoulder. While not exactly the picture of health, Maddux said he
has cut down on fast food. ``It's only if you're in a hurry type
thing,'' he said. ``It's not, `Oh, I'm going there because I want
to.'''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Glavine nor Maddux has noticed much of a physical change
so far. Maddux said he's lost a step or two running, but his arm
feels better than it has in years.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine said the same thing. His worst arm problems came in 1992
and 1993, but in the past several years he has thrown harder than
he did early in his career. He noticed a difference in his
conditioning, so he made some changes. He used to take four to six
weeks off from working out in the offseason; now he takes only two
weeks, because it's harder to get back in shape.
</P>
<P>
   As he has gotten older, Glavine has questioned his approach to
hitters. He went to Sutton early last year when he was struggling
despite feeling good physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I worried about,'' Glavine said, ``was, `OK, am
I at a point in my career where I've been doing this long enough
that people are starting to beat me at my game and I need to
change?' Don helped me in easing my thoughts that I wasn't at that
point. ... I'm just saying I haven't gotten there yet from a
physical standpoint. From a game approach, maybe I've gotten there
a little bit, yeah. I've been here for 13 years now, and there's no
secrets as to what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine made a point of pitching inside more and mixing in more
breaking balls. Maddux, meanwhile, hasn't had to make noticeable
adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still trust my instincts,'' Maddux said. ``I might not be as
good as I once was, but I can still be good enough. It's about
putting your team in a position to win. You don't have to be pretty
to do that, sometimes. I still feel like I'm capable of getting my
team into the seventh, eighth inning, where we still have a good
chance to win. That's what starting pitching is all about. If you
can do that 30 times a year, your team's going to probably win 25
of them. That's kind of what you're after.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux credits manager Bobby Cox with helping extend his career,
physically and mentally, from the trust he puts in the pitchers to
let him know when they are done, to the way he runs spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do the running with the parachutes on, the underwater
exercises,'' Maddux said. ``We're in more than good enough shape to
go out there and play an 18-inning game by the time the season
starts. So what if we can't do the triathlon next week? That keeps
the game fun, and it keeps you mentally into it. It means a lot,
more than people realize.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's Cox's handling of the pitchers in games. Terry
Mulholland, a newcomer to the Braves last August, was surprised
last year when he was asked if he needed to come out of the game.
He said later he hadn't been asked since he played in Philadelphia
three years before.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something for winning today, but there's also
something to be said for being right for your next 20 games, as
well,'' Maddux said. ``(Cox is) one of the few that can kind of
blend it in together, where you don't sacrifice on Friday to try to
win on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox and pitching coach Leo Mazzone take a lot of pride in the
longevity of the ``Big Three,'' and both think all three can pitch
into another contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't lose their enthusiasm, No. 1,'' Cox said. ``It
would be easy nowadays to lose some of that. Players are making
good money. Most are set for life after one contract. They love the
game of baseball. That separates them from a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzone said: ``I think Maddux and Glavine can pitch until
they're 40. I think Smoltzie will come back real strong. I think
they're only in the middle of their careers, based on what I know
about them as people, their work ethic, dedication, mental and
physical approach.''
</P>
<P>
   But will they pitch until they're 40?
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, for one, doesn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they'll reach a stage where there's too much life out
there,'' Sutton said. ``They'd have to go to another team. They'd
have to take a lesser role. I think when they walk into their kids'
bedrooms and drive carpool, they'll say it's not worth it. ... I
don't think(Glavine or Maddux) needs to (pitch that long) to have
carved their niche in baseball. I'd like to see them both win 300.
God willing, I'd like to be there to shake their hand when they're
inducted into the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, more young pitchers will enter the league
labeled as the next Glavine or Maddux or Smoltz. And that's fine
with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been great, and I hope it continues for six or seven more
years,'' Glavine said. ``The people that are in the worst spot are
the Braves, because all three of us are getting old together, and
it's going to be tough to replace three guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Good point. The Braves have staggered their contracts by a year,
but at some point there's going to be a serious void in the
rotation. And not even the pitchers have any idea when.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm to the point where I still feel like I have a good chance
to win, but at the same time, I can walk away right now, no
regrets,'' Maddux said. ``The game has given me more than I ever
hoped. I've got my World Series ring. I've accomplished
individually more than I ever thought I would. Financially, it's
been excellent for me. I could walk away now.''
</P>
<P>
   So then why keep coming back?
</P>
<P>
   ``Kicks,'' Maddux said.
</P>
<P>
   And he was dead serious.

 &HT;    The art of the deal: Grading John Schuerholz's big moves
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John Schuerholz once dreamed that he might save the
world.
</P>
<P>
   A bad case of measles when he was 5 left Schuerholz half-deaf; a
soaring temperature incinerated the nerve system in his right ear.
But he tried to make it work for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always used to visualize, if there was some sort of
tragedy,'' he said, ``where there was some sort of supersonic sound
that was destroying the Earth, I could put one finger in this
(left) ear and go save people with the other hand. I'd have one arm
to work with to pick up people. Everybody else would have both
fingers in their ears. I'd guide them to safety.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not quite work out that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I used to be like the corner freak,'' Schuerolz said.
``The kids in school, they'd blow bugles in my right ear full
blast. Could not hear a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Half-deaf and six months away from 60, Schuerholz is 34 years
into his career of baseball administration. He calls himself ``a
geezer'' now, having come from an age when a guy could get a
baseball job just by writing to a team, as he did. The World Series
Championship team he constructed in Kansas City was paid less than
$10 million. Greg Maddux will make more than that this season.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of younger general managers, Schuerholz is as stiff as
the junior-high English teacher he once was. His game was all
scouting and development and shrewd intuition, not high finance or
drug tests or agents. Beginning his 10th year with the Braves, the
most successful GM in the game sometimes wonders why he is still
doing this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, I ask myself that question a lot more frequently that I
used to,'' he said. ``And it's a shame, because I love the game
still, and I love being a part of it. I'm proud of it. But maybe
that's a just a reflection of the fact that I'm almost 60 years
old, and that's what geezers do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look back on the early days as the golden days, and they
look at the changed environment in which they operate now as not
being as pleasant or enjoyable. Maybe that's true in all walks of
life. I'm probably a living, breathing example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, what would he do without baseball?
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, he was born for this,'' said Herk Robinson, Kansas
City's GM and an old friend.
</P>
<P>
   The job is the fuel for Schuerholz's celebrated ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's even a little cockier now, if that's possible,''
said George Brett, the Hall of Famer whom Schuerholz helped
shepherd through the Royals system.
</P>
<P>
   The job also is what he does best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you've ever been on the inside and worked with him,''
Braves special assistant Paul Snyder said, ``there's no way you can
appreciate the man's baseball intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   And that comes from a man Schuerholz once removed from his job.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the contract of Atlanta's GM was extended through
2003. He says he does not want to leave the impression that he is
bailing out on a team that eventually should stop being a
championship contender every year, as its vaunted pitching rotation
ages.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement would mean something far more grave and sinister.
John Schuerholz no longer would dress for work, and for a slave to
fashion, life is unimaginable without linen slacks and Italian
suits and yellow socks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be casual attire,'' he says wistfully. ``So I'll go to
counseling, I guess, for that. Maybe there's some Good Dressers
Anonymous or something, where we can put on suspenders and ties and
go talk. `Hi, I'm John. I used to dress up. And I miss it.'''
</P>
<P>
   BUILDING AROUND PITCHING
</P>
<P>
   What Schuerholz has demonstrated to contemporary management is
how to spend, where to spend it and when to stop. Tom Glavine, Greg
Maddux and John Smoltz remain the team's unofficial logo, but
Schuerholz's dexterity has been in re-creating what goes around
them. Only two position players from the 1997 Opening Day lineup
are still with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the model I look to,'' Houston GM Gerry Hunsicker
said. ``Nobody's been any more effective or efficient than the
Braves over the past decade. Yes, they've had resources available
to them, but it's being able to use those resources wisely and also
not to be afraid to make changes to a successful nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking at the bigger picture,'' Hunsicker said. ``A
mistake a lot of teams make is, when they have found a successful
nucleus, they let them grow old together, and then they look up and
wonder why they're 20 games out of first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Since coming to Atlanta in the fall of 1990, Schuerholz's teams
have a .618 winning percentage. The Braves have won 76 more games
that the New York Yankees, their closest competitors. Only three
other teams in history have matched Atlanta's current streak of
three consecutive 100-win seasons _ the 1929-31 Philadelphia A's,
the 1942-44 St. Louis Cardinals and the 1969-71 Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The streak of eight division titles in a row is unprecedented.
The Hall of Fame has admitted just 12 club executives through the
years, and it is no stretch to imagine Schuerholz joining that
short list one day. His opinions are highly valued within his
industry.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Braves' inability to win more than one World Series
is a qualifier to Schuerholz's reign. It might have been different
had Lonnie Smith glanced at his third-base coach instead of
stopping at second in 1991 or had Mark Wohlers thrown another
fastball in 1996 rather than the fated hanging slider.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not reality. It's also a reason for Schuerholz to come
to work every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been disappointed for him,'' Cleveland GM John Hart
said. ``With the great organization he's put together, the fact is
that they've never had that three or four (championships) that they
very easily could have. He may still get that.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz enjoys a popularity uncommon to the front office. He
often is asked for his autograph, and when introduced for the
occasional on-field ceremony at Turner Field, his name draws
ovations.
</P>
<P>
   He never could save the world, but for many people, he saved
baseball in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For such a public person, his adopted city knows little about
him, beyond the threads and the articulated sound bites. He rarely
wields his wicked sense of humor unless around friends. He carries
a 10 handicap at the Cherokee Town and Country Club. He works out
with weights regularly, appreciates fine wines and does not dye his
hair, which is still almost exclusively jet black. He returns
telephone calls faithfully but does not share a confidence often or
suffer fools gladly.
</P>
<P>
   He is a painter and still writes poetry on occasion. When his
father died of colon cancer in 1994, Schuerholz wrote a poem (``A
kind and gentle man has left this world too soon ...'') that his
brother Jerry still cannot read aloud without choking up.
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz still bears a ``frustration ... that will go with me
to my grave'' over never being offered a professional baseball
contract, even though he was the best high school second baseman in
Baltimore in 1958 and hit .420 his senior season at Towson State
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he comes off with his first impression as being
somewhat intimidating to people,'' pitcher Tom Glavine said. ``I
got the sense I needed to respect this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   BASEBALL IN HIS BLOOD
</P>
<P>
   The Schuerholzes left Germany before World War I and wound up in
south Baltimore, ``because I guess that's where the boat landed,''
he says. He and two younger brothers were born into a family
already celebrated for athletics.
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather, William, is in the Maryland State Hall of Fame
for basketball. His uncle Gilbert was an Olympic soccer player. And
Schuerholz's father, John, was a promising second baseman in the
Philadelphia A's organization, but three years into his career he
suffered a severely broken leg while playing for the Wilson (N.C.)
Tobs, effectively ending his future in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1940. Schuerholz was born later that year, and it
became almost a genetic duty to compete fiercely with his brothers
as soon as they were old enough to take their floggings. Any game,
anywhere. Even ping-pong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you had to watch for the paddle coming back across the
table,'' brother Jerry said.
</P>
<P>
   They came of age in a Baltimore depicted in the Sam Levinson
film ``Diner,'' a small-town city where kids cracked wise and daily
life circulated around the Colts and Orioles. His high school,
Baltimore City College High, was a castlelike structure across the
street from Memorial Stadium, and some nights the Schuerholz boys
sneaked into the park to play out their baseball fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   His life came down to three primary pursuits: baseball, clothes
and music. His fascination with clothes dates to a pair of pants
given him by an uncle for an elementary-school graduation gift.
They were ``kind of electric blue, and they had the saddle
stitching down the side, a matching belt,'' Schuerholz says. ``Now,
that's not my style any longer. But I was captivated then, I
think.''
</P>
<P>
   He still vividly recalls buying his first record _ Bill Haley
and the Comets' ``Rock Around The Clock'' _ and to this day remains
a '50s music aficionado.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest song ever written by a human being is `Come Go
With Me' by the Del-Vikings,'' Schuerholz said. ``My apologies to
Beethoven.''
</P>
<P>
   But baseball was always the family's primary passion, and
Schuerholz followed in his father's footsteps at second base. He
was an all-conference player at Towson and voted athlete of the
year his senior season, but scouts could not overlook two
statistics: The prospect was 5 feet 9 1/2 and weighed just 155
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a scouting combine, I'd be a good 5-10,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His final at-bats came against Johns Hopkins and Schuerholz went
4-for-5 against Don Lenhardt, who later kicked around the majors
for five years. Schuerholz still cites the episode proudly.
</P>
<P>
   But then he went cold turkey. Within two years, he embraced his
second calling, education. He was teaching by day at North Point
Junior High in Dundalk while pursuing a master's degree in
education by night at Loyola University. He was newly married and
sold on the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ultimately saw myself teaching at the collegiate level and
would often visualize myself in a cardigan sweater, smoking a pipe,
walking down some ivy-covered pathway toward a classroom,''
Schuerholz said. ``I would teach to try to make people
better-prepared for life.''
</P>
<P>
   But four years at North Point did not extinguish what he felt
for baseball. So, in 1966 he wrote a letter to the Orioles'
chairman, Jerold Hoffberger, which set off a remarkable sequence of
events. The letter wound up on the desk of President Frank Cashen,
who had a policy of personally replying to every letter he
received. He was also a former sportswriter for the Baltimore Sun
and recalled the Schuerholz family name. The connection led to an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always serious-minded,'' said Cashen, now a vice
president with the New York Mets. ``And I can give you a codicil to
that. He was also always well-dressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz struck it off with Lou Gorman, the Orioles' energized
director of player development, and was offered a job as his
personal assistant. Schuerholz became one of the only people in the
universe to quit a teaching job and take a pay cut, from $6,800 to
$4,700.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very first day I started in that job, my goal was to
become a general manager of a major-league baseball team,''
Schuerholz said. ``I gave myself five years, after which I would
assess where I was in my career. Because I felt I could always go
back to teaching if I didn't succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   In five years, he was still Gorman's assistant after he had
moved on to help grow the expansion Kansas City franchise. But his
reputation rose, as did the Royals', into the IBM of baseball.
Rising to the position of farm director, Schuerholz oversaw the
drafting and developing of George Brett, Frank White, Willie Wilson
and Dan Quisenberry, who became a backbone for six divisional title
teams.
</P>
<P>
   At 41, Schuerholz finally became a GM in 1981. It had cost him a
first marriage and would introduce him to a host of troubles _ the
notorious Royals drug cases of 1983 and a palace intrigue that soon
engulfed ownership _ that he had not been prepared for. And
compared with flamboyant club President Joe Burke, Schuerholz was
seen by some as a secondary character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maryland, Ivy-Leaguer type, preppy,'' said a smiling Jamie
Quirk, one of Schuerholz's first-round draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that John received the credit that he should have
received,'' said K.C.'s Richardson, who had staffed the farm office
with Schuerholz. ``It may have been perhaps because some people
maybe took John for granted, because he had been there for a long
time. He didn't come in to save the world. He was there and part of
a process.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz was voted executive of the year by The Sporting News
after the 1985 World Series victory. But the club soon divided
against itself, as co-owners Ewing Kauffman and Avron Fogelman
clashed. Fogelman enlisted his GM's support. Everyone else sided
with Kauffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sort of in the middle, and I didn't feel like I had a
lot of support from either side,'' Schuerholz said.
</P>
<P>
   Around that time in the summer of 1990, he and Stan Kasten, the
Braves president, shared a limousine ride in New York. Kasten asked
for Schuerholz's suggestions for a GM, now that Bobby Cox had moved
from the front office back into the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz said he would come up with some names, but when he
called Kasten back a few weeks later, he could think of only one _
his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took this job, I got calls from my friends in the
business who thought I had lost my mind,'' Schuerholz said. ``When
I stepped out on the field at the instructional league in the
winter of 1990, a general manager stepped up to me and said, `Do
you realize what the circumstances are in the organization you just
took over?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Yes, I do.'''
</P>
<P>
   NOT ALL DEALS ARE GOLDEN
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with Schuerholz over a proposed trade is as might be
expected _ straight-forward, no junk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably some misconceptions about John but he's
great to work with on a deal,'' Cleveland's Hart said. ``He's
matter of fact. He knows what he wants. He's always prepared, and
he doesn't mince words.''
</P>
<P>
   Some decisions he made _ fetching Terry Pendleton off the junk
heap, the Fred McGriff steal _ changed the course of the franchise.
But no one in authority is immune from error. Schuerholz has had
his share.
</P>
<P>
   ``You better get him in the right mood if you're going to joke
about the David Cone thing,'' Richardson said, ``because he doesn't
turn loose of those things easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz traded away a future Cy Young winner in 1987 to the
New York Mets for a catcher, Ed Hearn, who had a damaged shoulder,
pitcher Rick Anderson, who would appear in just 13 Royals games,
and pitcher Mauro Gozzo, who never made K.C.'s major-league roster.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on minor-league coaches' opinions that Cone's off-field
conduct could be ``untoward'' _ a conviction later born out in
several New York incidents _ Schuerholz triggered one of the worst
deals in this half of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if Ed Hearn had been healthy as a horse, it would have
been a bad deal,'' Schuerholz said.
</P>
<P>
   The move only exacerbated public opinion in some parts of Kansas
City that Schuerholz was overmatched. While serving as the Royals'
director of player procurement and development in 1976, he signed
free-agent infielder Jerry Terrell, an uncommon move for the
farm-conscious franchise, while Burke, the club president, was
vacationing on a cruise.
</P>
<P>
   The Wichita Eagle did not approve, running a column and cartoon
that said, ``Leaving John Schuerholz in charge of the Royals is
like Jimmy Carter leaving Amy in charge of the White House.'' A
quarter-century later, Schuerholz still grimaces at the episode.
</P>
<P>
   For every right move he has made in Atlanta, his 1997 decision
to send away Marquis Grissom and David Justice, after they had been
so instrumental to a pair of World Series teams, to Cleveland for
Kenny Lofton and Alan Embree remains controversial. The deal was
packaged as a salary-saver, that the club was then able to
negotiate the combined $91 million contracts that Greg Maddux and
Glavine are still tied to.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably one that I think guys questioned because
we're so big on the clubhouse and chemistry and all that stuff, and
the two guys who went in that deal, they were Braves,'' Glavine
said. ``It's tough taking that kind of soul out of your club.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice charged that Schuerholz had deceived him, that he had
told him a few weeks before that he would trade ``my house and
family'' before he would deal Justice. The interceding three years
have brought stoicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what? People get deceived every day,'' Justice said. ``That
man doesn't owe me anything. I've got nothing against John
Schuerholz. The man just told me one lie. It was a big lie, but
that's all he ever did to me.''
</P>
<P>
   CONSISTENTLY GOOD
</P>
<P>
   ``So actually, there are people out there saying that when
Glavine and Maddux retire, I'm going to retire? That that will be
the prompt for me to go?''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got three more years to go on my contract and perhaps
even more than that, if the club so chooses,'' he says. ``But I'll
be in my 60s then, and I don't know how much longer I intend to
work beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some see a change in him already. He and wife, Karen, have a
second home in Cashiers, N.C., which they use for quick getaways.
Schuerholz also has shocked some associates with a newfound
interest in hunting, seemingly unthinkable for a man so
buttoned-down in professional life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so uptight and so conservative,'' Kasten said. ``His
family will tell you all this has done him a world of good. I mean,
now it's hunting? I believe he's a member of Ducks Unlimited. I'm
sure he subscribes to things like Guns &AMP; Quail magazine. I mean,
that's like me getting Blacktop &AMP; Asphalt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Schuerholzes' son, Jonathan, has become a proud diversion;
he is the starting shortstop in his freshman year at Auburn. A
middle infielder, as his father and grandfather were, Jonathan will
play in the Coastal Carolina summer college league this year, which
uses as one of its parks Fleming Field in Wilson, N.C., where his
grandfather played in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Life after baseball appeals to Schuerholz, but the 2000 season
is screaming at him. The John Rocker affair, which Schuerholz
likens to the Royals' drug case as ``an organizational kick to the
groin,'' will bear his close scrutiny all year, and a feeling
exists in the clubhouse that Schuerholz will acquire help for the
end of the rotation. A ninth division title will come harder than
the past five.
</P>
<P>
   Old North Point Junior High was used briefly as a police academy
and then closed down. Three of the stadiums Schuerholz called home
_ Memorial, K.C.'s old Municipal and Atlanta-Fulton County _ have
been closed or blown up. The baseball men who trained Schuerholz
have mostly retired or died.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he remains, shaking a fist at his critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be a one-shot wonder,'' he said. ``In '91, we go from
last to first, like Minnesota. Like the Toronto club we played in
'92. Like the Pirates, who we played for three years and then
diminished. The consistency of our success is a great source of
pride for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will say, `Well, anybody could do it once. Ah, anybody
could do it twice. Well, if you're lucky, three out of five.'''
</P>
<P>
   John Schuerholz simply plots a course for a ninth October. No
one's blown a bugle at him in years.

 &HT;    Commish steers game into brave new century
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bud Selig trades in snake oil.
</P>
<P>
   With a fleet of young stars, a pile of new TV money to be
collected, a string of gleaming new parks and a host of richer,
hipper owners, the baseball commissioner can afford to look the
camera in the eye and foretell a new dawn for a game that just five
years ago lay bleeding in the street.
</P>
<P>
   And Selig will tell you exactly that. But as the game's most
incidental commissioner steers baseball into the 21st century,
empowered as no major-league executive before him, he also knows
better.
</P>
<P>
   The game wants to think it no longer walks with a limp from the
last strike. Bud Selig knows better, and he also knows that the
fans know it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of where we were in '94 and '95 and think of where we
are today and as we head into 2000. It's spectacular,'' Selig said.
``But we're not fooling anybody. In the midst of this incredible
renaissance, we have a paradox of disparity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I could sit here and deny and say we're in this great
renaissance and we have some minor problems. But I can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is the world's only professional sport that, before the
games ever start, eliminates half the teams because they're too
poor, or too cheap, to pay for enough talent to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Television ratings, up against more aggressively marketed
leagues, plummeted 10 percent last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   Worst, the basic working agreement must be readdressed within
two years. Disputes over the document have caused eight work
stoppages over the past 24 years. The sport cannot withstand
another, and both sides are reluctant even to evaluate their
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get locked out or something, I will walk away from the
game,'' St. Louis slugger Mark McGwire said. ``I would be
embarrassed to be a baseball player. We're making way too much
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the 1994-95 strike and whatever lies ahead, however,
Selig is enjoying remarkably good PR. He just negotiated a new $800
million cable deal with ESPN, when it seemed both sides were headed
to federal court over the last contract. Prospects for the next
network contract are glowing. He broke the umpires' union and now
more closely controls umps from both leagues under one umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, in a unanimous vote by the owners, he was granted
newly stated powers to block trades, punish teams and intercede in
the best interests of the game to maintain competitive balance. He
won that clout from a roomful of owners who for decades couldn't
even agree on what to order for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gained control of their house, where he has the ability to
sanction ownership for conduct more readily,'' power agent Scott
Boras said. ``There is more ability for the commissioner to gain
plurality. So from the House of Lords standpoint, he certainly has
more ability to get matters completed more efficiently.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I agree he hasn't done anything yet,'' Pittsburgh
general manager Cam Bonifay said. ``But there's a basis for
productivity that could be very positive for our game.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig stepped down as owner of the Milwaukee Brewers to become
interim commissioner in 1992, mostly because fellow owners were too
battle-worn to break in another outsider. But he also fit the role
well because, as baseball historian Jerome Holtzman writes in ``The
Commissioners,'' he had been ``on the phone for 23 years,
canvassing every square foot of baseball's problems, particularly
at the executive level. He has been the quintessential insider.''
</P>
<P>
   His first big moves _ hiring ex-Toronto CEO Paul Beeston and
ex-Oakland GM Sandy Alderson _ drew high marks. Beeston, chief
operating officer for Major League Baseball, put a likable
personality in control of daily operations.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson, a Princeton-educated lawyer, became his executive VP
and took on the hard cases, the umpires fight and the investigation
of the Aldrian Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   Then late last summer, Selig moved to eliminate the NL and AL
offices, an often-misunderstood move that was devised not to ruin
tradition but to consolidate umpire control and administration.
Club execs view the current set-up to be like the NFL, where the
AFC and NFC act in separate spheres but have no separate offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of going through the league presidents, we're
initially getting through to the commissioner's office,'' Braves
assistant GM Frank Wren said. ``It kind of eliminates middle
management.''
</P>
<P>
   But those were procedural matters that gave ownership the
sympathetic ear of an ex-team executive in MLB's headquarters.
Selig's real agenda remains to be discovered.
</P>
<P>
   He has pushed baseball internationally and envisions not only a
baseball World Cup but a global marketing endeavor similar to the
NBA's.
</P>
<P>
   He has received a report from a blue-ribbon committee for
restoring competitive balance _ read: sharing the money. As a
former small-market owner, he has lived with the problem as it grew
during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm more aggressive as a commissioner (than as an
owner), but they know what I want to do, because I've told them,''
Selig said. ``There are no hidden agendas here, nothing else. They
know the economic system needs reformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that, the owners can address themselves, by sharing more
revenue, specifically local TV-radio proceeds. But Selig's first
crisis will come after the 2001 season, with the next opening of
the basic working agreement. Baseball has changed since the last
strike. The game has 13 new owners, most of them moderate
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball does not have the growing confrontation that was in the
air in the early 1980s. Beeston enjoys a friendly relationship with
union executive director Donald Fehr. They should find negotiating
room; for example, how many players enjoy playing for teams that
can't compete? The previous administration had only rising blood
for fighting the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had had success, I would have been able to talk (the
owners) out of that,'' former Commissioner Fay Vincent said. ``In
that sense, I failed as commissioner.''
</P>
<P>
   As an interim, Selig already had surpassed Vincent in bringing
change to the game. He oversaw the shift to three divisions, the
advent of the wild-card entry in the postseason, interleague play
and the first attempt at revenue-sharing.
</P>
<P>
   But all of that stands as a mere first act if Selig is to reform
the game's economic structure. As that fight and the next union
clash draw closer, the commissioner carries the highest approval
rating he has had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that time tells that, (for) the commissioner who has
been given this authority, the enemy is always increased rather
than decreased,'' Boras said. ``The commissioner's office is a
place that the top 10 clubs always view as the most restrictive.
They're the one who have the liberalness, economically, to get
different things done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time always comes when the honeymoon will end.''

 &HT;    Small-time philanthropists make big difference
 &HT;    By Lori Cumpston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ When George Domet first heard the plight
of an elderly woman about to be evicted from her trailer, he knew
he had to do something.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a heartbreaking woman and some unfortunate things have
happened to her,'' says Domet, 68, who moved to Grand Junction from
Los Angeles with his wife, Valerie, five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is almost totally blind, she has a disabled hip and walks
with a decided limp and a cane, and her right arm is in a sling.''
</P>
<P>
   Domet was initially contacted by St. Mary's Hospital who told
him an IRS snafu caused the woman to lose her federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had taken time to teach blind children to read Braille,''
explains Domet, president of Ironwood Construction, a construction
management firm. ``It wasn't for very long, two or three months,
and someone from the IRS caught this when she filed her tax return
and said if you can work, we're taking you off the rolls.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Domet stepped in to help, the woman was three months
behind on her mortgage and trailer-space rent and was in the
process of being evicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have taken her under my wing,'' Domet says. ``It makes me
feel good inside when I extend myself to help somebody else. Some
people think I'm crazy and that I shouldn't be doing this.
</P>
<P>
   I have a guardian angel that sits right here, he's on my left
shoulder. When I do something right, he pats me on the back and
kisses me on the cheek. When I do something wrong, he kicks me in
the butt. I've probably gotten a 50-50 split on the butt-kicking
and the kissing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Doris Horton found out the kids in her Gateway community
weren't reading because they didn't have library cards, she waged a
campaign to improve an existing reading program by offering toys to
kids who read.
</P>
<P>
   The first stop was Toys-R-Us where she shopped the bargain bins
in search of toys to give away as prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with garbage bags overflowing with toys, she went to the
Gateway Library and presented them with her finds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be wealthy,'' says Horton, 57, a landscape
designer. ``You don't have to do anything big. Just pick your own
spot and make it better.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Long reviews books on tape for AudioFile magazine and then
donates the tapes to the Mesa County Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   ``They send the books at no cost to me,'' says Long, 48, owner
of Montessori School of Grand Junction. ``I listen to four or six
every couple of months.''
</P>
<P>
   Long estimates she donates about 40 books per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rarely listen to a book twice,'' says Long. ``I listen to
them, pass them on and I'm happy to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Small-time philanthropists make up an increasingly large portion
of the giving picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where we build our base,'' says Cheryl Collins,
executive director of the United Way of Mesa County. ``You cannot
cookie-cut people who give money away. Everyone has their own
specific reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, an independent survey found that people in the
lowest income brackets tend to donate as much or more than their
higher-wage counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The average American household donates about 2 percent of its
annual income.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I find ironic is the people who really can't afford to
give always find a way to give,'' says Collins. ``I would like to
feel in my own heart that people give because they want to, not for
any reason other than you get a good feeling when you do it and
it's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins says when the economy is good, people feel good about
giving and are typically more generous.
</P>
<P>
   Churches top the list when it comes to receiving. Other
recipients include colleges and universities, arts organizations
and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Being a philanthropist doesn't mean you have to have to be rich
or have an abundance of time.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the simple things mean the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn your television set off for an hour and go say `hi' to
your neighbor,'' says Collins. ``When you go to the grocery store,
buy an extra can of food for the food drive. Instead of buying
pizza for yourself, take that $15 or the pizza and give it to
someone who might not be able to afford it or buy a gift
certificate and give it to a single parent who might need some
help. Sometimes you just have to stop and say, `What can I do to
help someone today?'''
</P>
<P>
   A DOZEN LITTLE THINGS THAT CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   _ Take your newspapers to the recycling bins.
</P>
<P>
   _ Volunteer to be a master gardener at in Girl Scout program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sponsor a student/tutor pair to learn to read at your local
library.
</P>
<P>
   _ Donate a book to your local library.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pay back your college scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   _ Donate food to the food bank.
</P>
<P>
   _ Volunteer for a charity fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy a pizza or a gift certificate and take it to a family who
otherwise couldn't afford it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Offer to do home repairs for elderly or handicapped neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take a blind or visually impaired person to the park.
</P>
<P>
   _ Establish a scholarship fund.
</P>
<P>
   TAX BREAKS FOR PEOPLE WHO DONATE TO CHARITY
</P>
<P>
   _ General Rule: Gifts of cash or check to qualified charity
(organization described as 501 C3 organization) are deductible if
you itemize for individual returns. There is a limitation on amount
of deductions each year amounting to 50 percent of income.
</P>
<P>
   _ Biggest exception to the general rule: in capital gains
property (i.e.: stocks and bonds), the deduction is the fair market
value of property. If it's appreciated in value, you avoid paying
tax on gain by giving it away.
</P>
<P>
   _ Limitation rule on that type of property: general rule limited
to 30 percent of income.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you make a significant gift of appreciated property (other
than cash or publicly traded securities) you need a qualified
appraisal if amount is over $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you donate out-of-pocket expenses to charity (i.e. driving
for charities) you can take deduction for gas and oil or standard
14 cents per mile in lieu of using actual out of-pocket-costs.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you give a gift of more than $250, a cancelled check is not
sufficient. You need a statement from the organization saying you
gave this amount and weren't compensated for it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Self-created property: For example, if an artist painted a
painting and sold it for $1,000 and the cost of canvas and paints
were only $100, you can only deduct cost of paints and other
out-of-pocket expenses. Self-created property cannot take deduction
for sale price.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you go to a charity ball, you can only deduct the
difference between the value of the meal and the ticket price. You
cannot deduct the full ticket price.

 &HT;    Making shut-eye a priority
 &HT;    By Stephanie Allmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ We've heard the mantra of modern American life
over and over: We're working more so we can spend more so we can
collect more and play more.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise, then, that the time between the last computer
log off at night and the first cell phone ring of the morning has
been decreasing over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Americans don't sleep enough. That's according to the National
Sleep Foundation, which reports that only 35 percent of adults
sleep the recommended eight hours or more per night during the
average workweek.
</P>
<P>
   Most sleep six hours and 58 minutes per night, the foundation
reports. Sometimes the loss of a few zzz's is inevitable, like
during today's daylight-saving time change. But more often, it's
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an interesting sociological phenomenon, where, at a time
of timesaving devices and so many material things that are supposed
to make your lives easier, we still lead lives where there's not
enough time for sleep,'' said Dr. Joe Cunningham, an internist and
senior vice president for medical affairs at Providence Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, The Wall Street Journal reported last year that a good
night's sleep is a much sought-after commodity, ``the ultimate perk
for the truly successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Reversing the previous trends of ``busier is better'' and
``sleep is for slackers,'' top executives are now envied if they
can catch eight hours of shut-eye. And corporate America may not
yet break for a midafternoon siesta, but some CEOs even admit to
taking power naps.
</P>
<P>
   But if America is to be productive, healthy, even safe, a good
night's sleep must become more than a luxury, said Duane Slegel,
clinical director of the Dallas-based Sleep Disorders Center of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleep is really a very important thing, and there's reason why
we spend one-third of our life asleep,'' Slegel said. ``Trying to
trim more and more time off that just interferes with normal
operations of the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Sleep deprivation increases irritability, decreases
concentration and weakens the immune system, Slegel said.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Banks, a junior marketing major and president of Delta
Delta Delta sorority at Baylor University, knows that all too well.
</P>
<P>
   She said not getting enough sleep at night affects how she
interacts with people and deals with situations the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``My roommates can tell when I don't get enough sleep,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep deprivation of any form also greatly increases the
likelihood of motor vehicle accidents. A study last year by the
American Automobile AssociationFoundation for Traffic Safety and
the University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center
found that sleeping less than six hours per night, being awake for
20 hours or longer, working more than one job and/or working night
shifts greatly increased the likelihood of a drowsy-driving
accident.
</P>
<P>
   So if sleep is such a valuable asset, why can't we get enough of
it?
</P>
<P>
   Besides the small percentage of the population that suffers from
sleep disorders and those who work graveyard shifts, it's a matter
of not practicing good ``sleep hygiene,'' Slegel said.
</P>
<P>
   Eating or drinking caffeine after noon can keep some people up
at night, as can eating or exercising too close to bed time, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And if you think Jay Leno or David Letterman make good
bedfellows, think again. Television before bed often stimulates the
mind and the body, and the lights and sounds keep people awake,
Slegel said.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the amount of stress and decreasing the hours of work
during the day will also make for a more restful night, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a direct relationship between how many hours we work
and how many we sleep,'' he said. ``We're working more hours now
than we did in the '70s, and if that's happening, we're sleeping
less.''
</P>
<P>
   Work and stress also affect the quality of sleep that people get
at night. Sleep happens in stages, the deepest occurring while you
dream. People who awaken easily during their dreams probably don't
feel as rested, no matter how many hours they sleep, Slegel said.
</P>
<P>
   But getting a few hours of quality sleep often doesn't make up
for not getting enough sleep, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have the best quality in the world, but if you only
get four hours, you're not getting enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians, nurses and other workers who switch shifts often run
into the quality vs. quantity problem, Cunningham said. In fact,
sleep has been a source of controversy in the medical field
recently, he said. People want good health care providers
available, but they want them well-rested, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone needs eight hours of sleep, said Dr. Rodney Richie,
a lung and critical-care specialist who works with sleep-disorder
patients at Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center. But people's priority
when it comes to sleep should be to get the amount they need at
night to be productive and alert during the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That absolute number is really quite variable. Most people
have a pretty good idea of what it takes for them to be
effective,'' he said. ``If you need six hours and you're only
getting five, you're not going to be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   If, after making some lifestyle changes, you still have trouble
falling asleep, you should see a physician, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most important change people can make to get enough sleep at
night is to be more efficient during the day, Slegel said. One way
to do this is to get more work done during normal working hours so
you don't need to arrive early or stay late at your job, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either we need to become more efficient when we're awake and
leave sleep alone or not work so hard,'' he said. ``Food, water and
sleep are basic human needs. We can't do without sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   ME? CRANKY?
</P>
<P>
   Sleep is not a luxury you can afford to go without: getting
enough of it is essential to your physical and emotional
well-being. You are not the only one who suffers when you are
deprived of adequate sleep. Your job performance and ability to do
certain tasks, such as driving or operating machinery, are impaired
by a lack of sleep. Your mood and as a result, your personal
relationships, can also be adversely affected when you consistently
fail to get enough good-quality sleep.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sleep loss can decrease your ability to perform mental
activities involving memory, learning, logical reasoning and
mathematical calculation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sleeplessness has been associated with higher absenteeism on
the job, a circumstance that costs the national economy as much as
$150 billion each year.
</P>
<P>
   _ A lack of sleep can have serious or even deadly consequences:
the National Highway Traffic Safety Council estimates that more
than 200,000 auto accidents every year may be fatigue-related.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO GET A GOOD NIGHT'S REST
</P>
<P>
   You may not be able to entirely avoid stress, change your work
schedule or make a partner stop snoring, but there are things you
can do to make your time in bed more restful.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use your bed and bedroom primarily for sleep. Try to make the
room as quiet and restful as possible.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have trouble sleeping at night, don't take a nap during
the day. Stay up and go to bed at your regular time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid caffeine, nicotine and alcohol in the late afternoon and
evening. Regular exercise can help you get better sleep, but
working out fewer than three hours before bedtime can keep you
awake.
</P>
<P>
   _ Establish a regular, relaxing bedtime routine and begin
``unwinding'' in time for you to get a full seven to eight hours of
sleep. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day, even on the
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you are still awake 30 minutes after going to bed, don't
lie there tossing and turning. Get up and do something relaxing,
such as reading or listening to soothing music, until you feel
sleepy.
</P>
<P>
   _ If sleep problems interfere with your ability to function
during the day, consider asking your doctor to recommend a sleep
medication. Whether over-the-counter or prescription, sleep
medications are meant to be used for short-term relief until
lifestyle changes can become restful habits.

 &HT;    A natural swagger
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Andruw Jones might not look 22 years old on a baseball
field, but he certainly can in a clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   All 185 pounds of the Braves' Gold Glove center fielder,
scrunched up in a laundry cart, arms and legs dangling over the
sides, talking to his teammates, never cracking a smile. Or eyes
glued to a television and a video-game version of himself _ the one
Jones admits is a better player than the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   Does it bother him?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, because I want to win the video games,'' Jones says with a
shrug.
</P>
<P>
   So he says. But this spring training, Jones' actions have spoken
louder than those words, and the Braves, who have just made Jones a
millionaire, are hoping his efforts translate into a breakout year
for $3.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   After three full seasons in the majors, Jones has left little
doubt that he is the game's best defensive center fielder _ and
maybe one of the best in history. But in November, he was reminded
about his unfulfilled offensive potential, right about the time Ken
Griffey Jr. asked for a trade and Atlanta was mentioned as a
possible destination _ with Jones speculated to be part of the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, three years into his major-league career, Jones' numbers
actually are better than Griffey's were at the same point. But it
didn't exactly reassure Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't let anything bother me, but it was kind of hard,''
Jones said. ``If they call and tell you you're in a situation that
we might trade you, you get shocked. But nobody called me.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until he ran into manager Bobby Cox at Turner Field
during the offseason that Jones breathed a little easier. ``Bobby
told me we didn't even talk about that, so don't worry,'' Jones
said. And then he went back to work.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks earlier than usual, Jones started hitting soft
toss with George Lombard, his alter outfielder _ Jones, the natural
who made heads spin as he moved through the minors so fast, and
Lombard, the project who has had to work so hard at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the most talented player I've ever played with for any
amount of time,'' said Lombard, who said he didn't notice much
difference in Jones this offseason. ``Same old Andruw that always
makes you laugh, whether he's striking out or hitting a home run.
He always makes it look like he's having a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ozzie Guillen, who was released Friday but was one of Jones'
closest friends on the team, has noticed a change in Jones the past
couple of years. It started July 21, 1998, the day Jones came to
him after Cox pulled Jones in the middle of a game for not hustling
to catch a fly ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me if Bobby was being a jerk,'' Guillen said. ``I
told him, `He did it because he wants you to be the best player you
can be.' From when I got here (in 1998), he's a 100 percent better
player. Not the talent part.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones used to be one of the stragglers, Guillen said. Now he's
among the first to the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got here, I told him, `You're cocky; you're walking
around here like you're Willie Mays,''' Guillen said. ``He's lucky
to grow up in the Braves organization. Bobby Cox has a great way of
doing things. He uses a lot of discipline. If Andruw grew up in
another organization, he might be in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is one of the few who exhibits what new teammate Bobby
Bonilla calls ``the Atlanta swagger.'' He has a sarcastic sense of
humor and outwardly he can appear aloof, including toward teammates
and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   New Braves hitting coach Merv Rettenmund is taking his first
stab at teaching Jones the same thing. He's no stranger to trying
to reach a headstrong young player. He spent the past several
seasons working with Ruben Rivera in San Diego and didn't have much
success. But Rettenmund knows it's not just up to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Jones) could make a hell of a difference,'' Rettenmund said.
``But he has to want to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   The two have spent early mornings in the indoor batting cages
and are constantly gabbing by the cage in batting practice.
Rettenmund isn't convinced that Jones has caught on to his ideas
about hitting the ball to center and right field when the pitch is
away and getting his hands into motion quicker.
</P>
<P>
   He is trying to help Jones understand why teams, including the
Padres, jam him inside and then come back with offspeed pitches
away, and why he was an easy target in the postseason, when he hit
only .185.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I had my hands too far up on my body and when they throw
the ball in I have no movement, no nothing,'' Jones said. ``That's
why I got jammed. ... I think in my mind maybe I was tired. I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't be an overnight change. But whether it's because of the
Griffey talk or because he watched Chipper Jones win an MVP award
or because he wants more than a .275 average to go along with his
good but not outstanding run production, Jones seems to be
listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're waiting for me to have a great, great, great
season with my bat,'' Jones said. ``But it's not that easy. ... I
can hit. I just need to make my adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones showed some improvement in patience last year, drawing 76
walks, up from 40 in 1998, and lowered his strikeouts to 103, down
from 129. His homers dropped from 31 to 26 last year and his RBIs
dropped from 90 to 84, but the Braves weren't exactly complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how much of a slump he may be in, if you are as good
as he is in center field, you're still going to be in the lineup,''
Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   When Greg Maddux first heard Griffey might want to come to
Atlanta, he said he assumed the Braves would leave Jones in center
and make Griffey the best left fielder in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andruw's willing to do the little things to help a team win,''
Maddux said. ``Anybody who can play the game like that will be
welcome wherever. He plays like Mark Lemke did. Lemke rarely hit
over .240, but we were a better team when he was on it. Andruw
plays the game the same way, only better.''

 &HT;    C. Jones' best, toughest season
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ From National League ballparks to the Jones kitchen
table in Pierson, Fla., Chipper Jones has managed to amaze.
</P>
<P>
   He was eating supper with his parents _ Lynne and Larry Jones
Sr. _ one night during spring training when the topic of last
season came up. It prompted Lynne to look over at her reigning
National League MVP son and say, ``I can't believe you're my kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while, you wake up and go, that's our kid out
there,'' Lynne said. ``You're going along, and all of a sudden
somebody will be interviewing him on TV, and it hits you. My
goodness, this was a kid from Pierson, Fla. The munchkin monster.''
</P>
<P>
   The munchkin monster who grew into everybody's All-American
baseball hero. But the year that he won his first MVP award began
as one of the worst years of his life. He was only months removed
from having admitted publicly to cheating on his now-former wife
Karin and having a child out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   In a year's time, Jones has gone from tarnished superstar to
National League MVP. Along the way, he has embraced his new role as
father. This past offseason, Matthew and his mother, Jennifer
Rutledge, moved to Atlanta, allowing Jones easier access and more
time to spend with his son, who turned 2 in March.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also has another son on the way. Chipper and his live-in
girlfriend, Sharon Logonov, got married last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As for the details of his new marriage, Jones doesn't feel the
need to address them. Unlike his very public divorce with Karin, he
prefers to keep his personal life more private now. If last year
taught him anything, it was the benefit of putting his troubles
behind him and moving on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to the point where the whole situation was kind of
consuming me. I'd be out there on the field thinking about it, and
that wasn't good,'' Jones said. ``I finally came to the point where
I just said, `You know, I can't control this anymore, so I'm not
going to try. I'm just going to move on.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I've dealt with it,'' he said. ``I'm tired of dealing with it.
I'm just going to get on with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The former No. 1 draft pick managed to turn a season golden in
which he was primed in many ways to fail. He carried the Braves
through the losses of Andres Galarraga and Javy Lopez, and he did
it best when he finally let go of the burden of his past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what he was going through emotionally, all the turmoil
behind the scenes,'' Lynne said. ``For him to go on the field and
turn it all off and not only produce but produce as well as he did
with Andres going down, and Javy going down, was stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   His season began to change not long after a conversation he had
with his mother in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had told him, 'You're going to make yourself sick,''' Lynne
said. ```It happened. It was wrong, but it's over with. You've got
to live with the consequences, but that means living with the
consequences. It doesn't mean tearing yourself up about it day
after day.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jones responded with his best month of the season. He hit .413
in July with 11 home runs. And by the end of September, he was
unstoppable. He virtually assured himself the MVP award by hitting
four home runs in a three-game sweep of the Mets that all but won
the pennant for the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   By then the cheers were pretty well wiping out the jeers.
</P>
<P>
   Jones still hears in fans' taunts the Hooters comments, in
reference to where he met Rutledge. Sometimes, if they say it to
his face, Jones can laugh about it. And he no longer looks at that
situation as one huge mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Matthew just as that, my son,'' Jones said. ``I don't
see the story behind Matthew. If you spend any time with Matthew,
Matthew will make you forget about everything, including baseball.
Now he consumes me. I'm so happy, so proud of him, that you can't
even really look at what happened a couple years ago as being a
mistake, because he's brought so much joy to me and my family
already, and I've only really known him a year. Shoot, I wouldn't
trade it for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the compliments Jones heard last year from coaches and
managers, teammates, opponents, members of the media, family and
friends, the most meaningful ones to him came from fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a parent come up and say to you that their son or their
kids idolize me, they still enjoy coming to the game to watch me
play _ that's the biggest compliment,'' Jones said. ``I understand
that a lot of people don't think much of professional athletes, and
with all that's been on the news, probably they've got pretty good
reason not to, but most of us are good guys. We work hard. We try
our best to entertain the fans the best we can. It's nice to be
given credit for doing that....
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through a stretch where I didn't know if I was going to
hear it anymore,'' he said. ``I didn't know if I was going to get
booed every time I came to the plate, so it's comforting to know
that, at least in most people's eyes, I've been forgiven, (that)
the mistakes that I made haven't soured too many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Jones watched Chipper hit 45 homers and 41 doubles, bat
.319, score 116 runs and knock in 110. She also watched her son
grow up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys who are drafted out of high school never have a
chance to grow up; it's mom's house one day, a millionaire the
next,'' Lynne said. ``From the time they're drafted, major-league
ballplayers have a lot of things done for them. They get used to
leaning on other people. He found out the only one who could stand
on his two feet is him. He's grown up a lot. I hope he'll be a
better man for it. It's a horrible way to have to learn a lesson. I
wouldn't wish it on anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is looking ahead now, to putting up another good year and
also signing a new contract. He is in position to become the
highest-paid player in baseball, more than $15.5 million a year. In
the meantime, he's got the MVP label for life.
</P>
<P>
   The actual MVP award has made the rounds to award ceremonies and
photo shoots, and it probably will spend a year in the Braves
Museum at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually, it will settle back in his parents' house in
Pierson, not far from that kitchen table. Lynne has a spot picked
out in the family room, above his framed 1995 World Series jersey.
</P>
<P>
   And it will serve as a reminder of just how far Jones had to
come, from the days he collected Little League awards to the
heights of the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistakes he made and the consequences brought him down to
earth really hard,'' Lynne said. ``Sometimes they say you have to
bottom out before you get back up. He came pretty close. For a
while (the fun of playing) was gone, and it was tough to watch. The
kid has wanted nothing more than to play baseball since he was 4
years old _ totally, singularly focused....
</P>
<P>
   ``To see him enjoy the game again and thrive on competition,
that was so wonderful,'' his mother said. ``It made me know he was
healing inside.''

 &HT;    Mets vs. Braves can get heated, but it's not hate
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Theirs is not a loathe-hate relationship. The Braves
don't loathe the Mets _ manager Bobby Valentine excluded, of
course. And no, the Mets don't hate the Braves. ``Why?'' Mets
pitcher Bill Pulsipher asked. ``Are we supposed to hate them?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, no. It is neither clean, new-fashioned hate nor sneer and
loathing on the National League campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Mets would rather beat the Braves than anyone else.
Because they're there, up there atop their division for what Mets
reliever Dennis Cook says ``seems like 100 years in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Braves have no one _ not Arizona or old nemesis Los
Angeles, not Ken Griffey Jr. and the Reds or the rest of the NL's
Central Blasting _ that they would rather keep under their thumb
than the Mets. Because after a compelling 1999 season that climaxed
with the most riveting NLCS in years, the Braves and Mets have
become the best of rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the best rivalry we have right now,'' pitcher
Tom Glavine said. ``It's replaced the rivalry we had with the
Dodgers. And after meeting one another in the playoffs last year,
it should add a new dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   The old dementia remains. Listen and you can still hear the Shea
denizens serenading Chipper Jones: ``LAR-ry! LAR-ry!'' And worse.
And more profane for John Rocker, whose rantings and WCW shtick
prompted police snipers to be positioned around Shea.
</P>
<P>
   Add Valentine: ``The polar opposite of Bobby (Cox),'' one Brave
said. ``He thinks he's smarter than everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, the Mets and Braves have the 1999 NLCS. Five one-run
games in a row, concluding with the fall classics: Games 5 and 6,
which lasted 26 innings, took 10 hours and 11 minutes and ended in
the most improbable manner. A bases-loaded, bottom-of-the-11th walk
by Andruw Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never going to have another one like that again,''
Brian Jordan said. ``Ever. That was the best playoff series ever in
baseball. I mean, the intensity, the emotion, the length of the
games. The only way it could've gotten better would've been if it
went to Game 7. I'd probably have pulled out my hair.''
</P>
<P>
   His hair intact, Jordan's sense of the rivalry is stronger than
ever, even after just one season as a Brave. ``It's almost like
bragging rights now,'' he said. ``The team you want to beat is the
Mets. Just the division rivalry.'' RESPECT FROM THE METS
</P>
<P>
   Things change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like we're in a rivalry with somebody different
every year,'' said Greg Maddux, a Brave since '93. ``We've never
really had a (prolonged) rivalry since I've been here. It was just
starting to happen with the Dodgers, then the league switched (with
the Braves moving to the NL East). So we kind of create one every
year.''
</P>
<P>
   It was L.A. in '91, the Reds in '92, the Pirates in both of
those playoff series. In '93, it was the Giants, in the last great
pennant race before realignment. The strike struck the '94 Expos.
The '97 Marlins dominated the Braves during the season, took the
NLCS, then were disassembled faster than umpire Eric Gregg could
cry, ``Strike three!''
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets fit the profile of a rival. ``Two winning teams,
that's what makes a rivalry,'' Maddux said. ``Nothing else. A
winning team and a losing team, who cares? Unless it's the Cubs and
Cardinals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just teams that you like to beat,'' Glavine said. ``You have
an added emotion to want to beat 'em, whether it's players or
whatever on the other team you don't like. Or that team has had a
lot of success and you're sick of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you're two good teams in the same division fighting for
the division, that's the biggest thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence, Braves-Mets. ``No. 1, it's the Mets, and they're from New
York, and New York's a big town,'' Glavine said. ``Teams that come
from bigger cities, it's easier to have a rivalry, because people
tend not to like them. The Mets, Yankees, Boston. And going into
New York, their fans are what they are. You're gonna take abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Their fans hate us,'' Javy Lopez said, smiling. ``Ninety-nine
percent want to kill us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets management, meanwhile, takes a businesslike approach. ``The
Mets are really spending a lot of money on players, trying to get
us off the throne,'' Lopez said. ``Not having done that, I guess
that makes them mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Two seasons ago, it meant trading for catcher Mike Piazza in
midseason, then signing him to a seven-year, $91 million contract.
Then, third baseman Robin Ventura arrived. During the winter, the
Mets signed free agent Todd Zeile and acquired from Houston
outfielder Derek Bell and left-hander Mike Hampton, who was
runner-up in the Cy Young voting. ``I feel that's the reason they
got me over here _ to get over that hump,'' Hampton said. ``Me and
Derek. I think everybody in this clubhouse feels we're going to
have to go through the Braves eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   But can they? ``I think so, I really do,'' he said. ``I think we
have a legitimate chance at (being) a World Series team here. I saw
it last year, not only the talent and attitude, but the heart to
battle back.'' Hampton doesn't hate the Braves. ``They're trying to
do what everybody else is, and that's win,'' he said. ``You can't
hate a team because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone. A Mets clubhouse sampler:
</P>
<P>
   Cook: ``I wouldn't call it a rivalry. We seem to always be
chasing them. They have nothing to prove. They've won the division
for what seems like 100 years in a row. We have something to prove.
And I don't have a problem with the way they carry themselves. As
long as you win, you can carry yourself any way you want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura: ``They've always seemed very professional. And it's a
good rivalry. The NLCS, that's stuff that makes rivalries, back and
forth, both teams coming back. If they were crushing us every game,
it wouldn't be a rivalry.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Turk Wendell: ``They're not cocky. It's confidence, is
what it is. There's a fine line. If they wanted to be cocky, they'd
have every right to be. Now, some of the smack Chipper talked in
the papers, and the whole Rocker thing, (that) gets guys fired up.
Rocker dug himself a hole to dig out of. Which he did. We got him
once (in Game 4), but he got us, too. Everything he got, he
deserved. You say that stuff in the papers, you've gotta be smarter
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a Mets newcomer like Zeile has a feel for the rivalry: ``I
certainly get a sense of the intensity by the way people discuss
the (NLCS) or how we'll match up this year. What guys are saying
more than anything is that they're anxious for another crack at
them, because we didn't fare as well as we could've at the end of
the regular season and in the playoffs. It's a more anxious
intensity to get back on the playing field against them. Even if
you're one of those guys that loves to hate the Braves or wants to,
you have to respect them because of how they've done it over
time.'' TALK, TALK, TALK
</P>
<P>
   In February, Chipper Jones sat beside Piazza at the ESPYs. ``We
talked just like we're teammates,'' said Jones, who also saw Piazza
at the Players Choice Awards. When Glavine comes to bat, he always
says something to Piazza. Lopez is one of Atlanta's several Latin
players who are friendly with Mets infielders Rey Ordonez and
Edgardo Alfonzo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mets players are good people, nice people, friendly,''
Lopez said. ``The fans will change everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of their guys are fine,'' Glavine said. ``To be honest
with you, there's teams you play you don't like because you don't
like some of their players. The Mets are fine. They play hard. I
think all their guys are pretty cool. If I was going to go in the
(ballpark) weight room and work out, there's nobody on that team
that I'd say, `Oh, this guy's in there. I don't want to be in
there.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there's some guys on their team that don't like us,''
Glavine said. ``Some guys last year had a big emotional tie to beat
us because we knocked them out of the playoffs in '98. I'm sure
there are a lot of guys (on several teams) who'd love to beat us
and can't stand us because they think we're cocky. If they come
here, they find out we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, the last game before the All-Star break, Michael
Tucker went in on Piazza with spikes high to beat the Mets. That
enraged Piazza and Valentine. In September, Atlanta swept the Mets
to end the regular season and eliminate New York from the wild-card
race.
</P>
<P>
   Many baseball people don't like Valentine. ``Bobby don't bother
me,'' said Ozzie Guillen, who nevertheless tried to beat him when
he played for the White Sox and Valentine managed Texas. ``A lot of
people don't like his style. He likes to be known, to be seen. He's
not a typical manager, (who will) sit back and manage the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He always says stuff,'' said Eddie Perez, MVP of the 1999
NLCS. ``Players are tired of that. I don't know if he's trying to
intimidate us or say stuff about us. But that hurts. I play so hard
against them because of the way they talk, especially Valentine,
and the things they said about Chipper.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, in September in Atlanta, the Braves swept a
three-game series from the Mets and Jones smacked four homers.
After leaving town, the Mets suspected that Jones was being tipped
which pitch would be thrown to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't a player (accusation), I can tell you that,'' said
Bobby Bonilla, then a Met, now a Brave. ``We were still trying to
figure out, `Why are we still pitching to him?' We kind of locked
up the MVP for him, didn't we?''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said: ``Obviously, they didn't have any proof about that.
I write it off as something said in the heat of battle. I've never
been tipped on pitches. I think what frustrated me right there was,
whatever happened to giving a guy credit when he's swinging the bat
well? If Piazza had done that, we'd never had said he's getting
signs. Besides, you've still got to hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later at Shea, after Atlanta took two of three from the
Mets and seemingly knocked them out of the playoffs, Jones said,
``Now the Met fans can put on their Yankee stuff.'' Bad move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret saying it, in that the Mets took it the wrong way,''
Jones says now. ``That was directed at five fans sitting over the
dugout in Mets jerseys and they're talking about the Yankees in the
World Series and the Mets were not even out of it. I remember
learning a pretty valuable lesson: That place was chaotic enough
without giving them bulletin-board material.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine supplied some when the Mets arrived in Atlanta for the
NLCS, crowing, ``We're here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a loser,'' Perez said about Valentine. ``I think
they had a better team than us last year (in the NLCS), with Javy
hurt and Big Cat (Andres Galarraga) out.''
</P>
<P>
   Duly inspired, Perez homered to win Game 2, after which Rocker
declared, ``To hell with New York fans.'' Then he taunted Mets fans
at Shea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people say, when you're beating somebody, let sleeping
dogs lie,'' Glavine said. ``They already had 100 reasons to kick
our butts; now they had a few more.''
</P>
<P>
   They nearly did. Now it's 2000. The Mets have revamped their
roster, again. Atlanta has, too. One thing hasn't changed:
Braves-Mets. With baseball again considering realignment, this
could be their last season as division rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``By us coming back and winning (Games) 4 and 5, it changed our
view a little bit that, `Wow, we hung tough and made a series of
it,''' Mets left-hander Al Leiter said. ``I think our confidence is
better because our team is better. I don't think it _ I know it.
Each year (general manager) Steve Phillips has put pieces together
to be where we are _ to compete for the National League pennant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say you still have to give the Braves the upper hand, that
we have to beat them,'' Leiter said. ``It'd be ignorant for me to
say we have the upper hand, because we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be the same way, a good season for both teams,''
Jones said. ``We're two of the best teams in the National League.
Both teams know it. So you've got a lot at stake and tensions are
going to be high. And whoever wins, wins.''

 &HT;    Griffey trade considered a benchmark in baseball
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Call it the BKG trade, the Before Ken Griffey
trade. Until Feb. 10, 2000, the BKG deal was acknowledged as not
only one of the best trades ever concocted by the Cincinnati Reds,
it was considered a benchmark in Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It was the baseball diamond heist of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Lee May was an important cog in The Big Red Machine. In fact, he
was the one who came up with that nickname. He was a hard-hitting
first baseman and a funny man in the clubhouse, a leader with a
verbal knife that cut deep.
</P>
<P>
   So, when general manager Bob Howsam included May in a trade with
the Houston Astros on Nov. 29, 1971, fans in Cincinnati howled.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Howsam give up the popular May, he tossed in very
popular second baseman Tommy Helms and outfielder Jimmy Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   And what did Howsam get for this tidy bundle of talent?
</P>
<P>
   Infielder Denis Menke. Who? Outfielder Ed Armbrister. Who?
Pitcher Jack Billingham? Who? Outfielder Cesar Geronimo. Who? And
second baseman Joe Morgan. Who?
</P>
<P>
   The Reds were in the 1970 World Series, losing to the Baltimore
Orioles and the magnetic glove of third baseman Brooks Robinson,
four games to one.
</P>
<P>
   Howsam realized the club was a few pieces short of taking the
final step. He acted quickly and boldly and if the public didn't
feel the same way, well, wait until the results were in.
</P>
<P>
   The results were staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Billingham became a regular in the rotation. Geronimo became a
wizard in center field and developed into a steady No. 8 hitter.
And Morgan? Well, he has a plaque in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   The trade became known as one of the best and most one-sided in
the history of baseball. It pushed the Reds over the top, put The
Big Red Machine in high gear and led to World Series championships
in 1975 and 1976.
</P>
<P>
   What is generally forgotten is that Howsam made another
significant trade that same year _ May 29, 1971. He dealt shortstop
Frank Duffy and pitcher Vern Geishert to the San Francisco Giants
for outfielder George Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy and Geishert never were heard from outside their family
circles, but Foster was as significant as Tony Perez, Joe Morgan,
Pete Rose and Dave Concepcion to The Big Red Machine. Until two
months ago, those two trades were the most significant in Reds
history.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 10, general manager Jim Bowden, after holding his ground
against trading talent like second baseman Pokey Reese, first
baseman Sean Casey, outfielder Dmitri Young and pitcher Scott
Williamson, obtained baseball's marquee player, Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   And he did it at a low, low cost.
</P>
<P>
   The best player the Reds lost was young outfielder Mike Cameron,
who may some day shine. But his star never will shine with the glow
of Griffey's. Bowden tossed in malcontent pitcher Brett Tomko and a
couple Class A minor-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Bowden had the Seattle Mariners against a wall,
unarmed and with their hands up. They could do nothing but trade
Griffey to the Reds for whatever they could get.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, as a 10-and-5 player (10 years in the majors, five with
the same team), could refuse any trade. He told the Mariners,
``Cincinnati and Cincinnati only.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Mariners didn't trade him, Griffey would have become a
free agent after this season and signed with the Reds anyway.
Seattle would have gotten nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the Mariners got nothing anyway. But it figures to
supercede anything Howsam did ... maybe. The verdict won't come
until a few years down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Will Griffey help the Reds win two world championships? After
all, even though Bowden obtained baseball's best player, he
obtained only one player.
</P>
<P>
   Howsam pried five away from the Astros and four figured
prominently in Reds history _ Morgan, Billingham, Geronimo and
Armbrister, who had a big moment in the 1975 World Series against
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It's more difficult for one player to make a difference than
five, but if anybody can, it's Junior Griffey.

 &HT;    Griffey a great catch, but rest of Reds must contribute
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Ken Griffey Jr. is many things to many people,
depending on what vantage point one views him.
</P>
<P>
   To fans, he is the icon of sports, the man who replaced Michael
Jordan as the most recognizable person in sports.
</P>
<P>
   To opposing pitchers, he is a menace with mayhem in mind as he
stands at home plate waving his black double-lacquered Louisville
Slugger.
</P>
<P>
   To his teammates, he is hits, home runs, RBIs and superlative
defensive exploits, along with a few laughs in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   To the Cincinnati Reds, he is tickets sold, memorabilia and
trinkets sold and guaranteed attention from the national media.
</P>
<P>
   All that is pabulum. The big question is, ``Will Junior
translate into victories and championships?''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Jim Bowden, the man who worked the miracle that
brought the 30-year-old Griffey to Cincinnati, is wise enough to
realize baseball games are not won by one player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he is the best player in the game,'' Bowden said. ``But
baseball isn't like basketball, where a Michael Jordan can control
the ball and control the game. In baseball, you can't control the
ball. Griffey comes to bat once every nine at-bats. He'll catch
every ball hit near him, but he can't control when it is hit to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   So other parts must be in place and that, of course, falls into
the hands of the one player on a baseball field who does control
the ball ... the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   As Bowden says daily, ``You can never get enough pitching. We'll
only go as far as our pitching takes us.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Bowden, with 30 teams in the majors leagues,
pitching is diluted. Teams with more than two outstanding starters
are rare.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees win because of pitching, not hitting. The
Atlanta Braves win because of pitching, not hitting.
</P>
<P>
   Do the Reds have enough to make adding Griffey into the mix
worth it?
</P>
<P>
   Opening Day starter Pete Harnisch is as solid as granite. Denny
Neagle should be dazzling after going 6-0 in his last seven starts
last season, but he was wobbly all spring. Steve Parris and Ron
Villone didn't figure into the starting mix at all last spring, but
were sterling citizens once they were plugged into last year's
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Can they do it again? They have no history other than last
season for comparison, so it is a cross your fingers and hold your
breath situation.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth starter? Before the season is over, that spot could be
occupied by a half-dozen suspects, unless Bowden can coax a decent
starter from another team in a trade.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen is nearly intact, missing only seldom-used Stan
Belinda from last year, but returning Dennys Reyes, Gabe White,
Scott Sullivan, Scott Williamson and Danny Graves. The law of
averages says they all can't repeat, and rookie of the year
Williamson was injured the last month of last season and spent most
of the spring trying to find the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, with the addition of Griffey and Dante Bichette
into an already potent lineup, runs shouldn't be difficult to
accumulate daily. Teams, though, can only outscore the opposition
10-9 so many times. Just ask the Cleveland Indians, who survive
because they are in a watery division.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds are in what many believe the toughest division in
baseball. St. Louis will score runs and pitch. Houston will score
runs and pitch. Chicago will score runs. Pittsburgh will pitch.
Milwaukee will neither score runs nor pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The defense up the middle is noteworthy, except for catcher
Eddie Taubensee, who hits with a passion but throws with a prayer.
Taubensee threw out only 15 of 106 base-stealers. But the team was
68-42 when he caught and the team earned run average was 3.78,
while it was 4.93 when Jason LaRue caught and 3.81 when Brian
Johnson caught.
</P>
<P>
   The double play combination of shortstop Larkin and second
baseman Reese is not only good, but flashy. Reese fields everything
on the continent and Larkin remains one of the game's best
shortstops. Griffey has enough Gold Gloves to stock Fort Knox and
catches everything from left-center to right-center and as outfield
coach Dave Collins says, ``He does it so easily he turns difficult
catches into what looks to be routine.''
</P>
<P>
   On the corners is where the defense is suspect. Aaron Boone is
only average with less-than-average range at third base, but
finished last season with a 41-game errorless streak. Sean Casey
has limited range at first base, but catches everything he touches
and made only six errors all season and went the final 48 games
without an error.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Dmitri Young and right fielder Dante Bichette never
will be known for their leather. They make up for it with their
wood. Both should have a two-word phrase in their vocabulary when a
fly ball heads for the outfield: ``Yours, Junior.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bowden and manager Jack McKeon cite pitching as the key,
starter Harnisch says, ``We'll get the pitching, just as we did
last year. Before last season I said, 'If we catch the ball, we'll
win.' We caught the ball and we won. It's the same thing this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey is an excellent accoutrement, an attention-grabbing
bauble. He will do his thing. The rest of the Reds, especially the
pitchers, must do more than their thing for Griffey to get that
World Series ring.

 &HT;    Jack: Junior talks with bat, glove
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ During more than 50 years in professional
baseball, Cincinnati Reds manager Jack McKeon has learned a lot
more about the game than how to fill out a lineup card, the nuances
of the double switch and the proper way to snip a premium cigar.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important duties of a manager is how to handle
and how to relate to his players _ which ones need kind and
soothing words and which ones need swift kicks in the posterior.
</P>
<P>
   In that facet of his job, McKeon is a master. His
fatherly/grandfatherly approach is perfect for a talent-laden team.
His style is, ``To play and let play.''
</P>
<P>
   His credo is for his team to have fun and the best way to have
fun is to win. Show up on time, play the game right, play the game
hard, have fun and McKeon will be no more than a puff of cigar
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   That is the main reason he and Junior Griffey will get along
famously. Griffey plays the way McKeon wants the game played.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably didn't speak more than 100 words all spring,''
McKeon said. ``Once you've said, `Good morning, how are you?' What
else is there to say to him? He is the best player in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the way he is with Barry Larkin, the way he was last year
with Greg Vaughn, the way he is with Sean Casey and Pokey Reese. He
is a hands-off, let-'em-play manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Griffey slid right into our clubhouse, no problems, no muss,
no fuss,'' McKeon said. ``He has a lot of close friends on this
team, especially Larkin. And having his father (Ken Griffey Sr.)
here as a coach certainly helps. He blended in real fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to the right club,'' McKeon added. ``We want them to
have fun, enjoy themselves. There is no pressure or drudgery
associated with this team. Everybody knows they won't be shot or
shipped out if they make a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Junior came here and right away saw guys like Sean
Casey, Pokey Reese and Larkin having a lot of fun while they work
and play,'' he said. ``He saw that good rapport and camaraderie we
have on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey laughs and agrees with McKeon's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our longest conversation all spring was, `Hi, how are you?,'''
and, `Here is your day-off schedule,''' Griffey said. ``I think we
had one five-minute conversation about a commercial I was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows I don't say much to anybody,'' Griffey added. ``I
joke around with the guys and say some off-the-wall things, but I
don't yell at people because they messed up. That's not me and the
manager doesn't have to worry about me trying to run things.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one ominous factor that confronts McKeon and Griffey
nearly every day, especially from out-of-town writers. They wonder
not if, but how soon, will Griffey Sr. replace McKeon as manager
... and wasn't that part of the deal to get Junior to come to
Cincinnati?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's insulting to us,'' general manager Jim Bowden says.
``Jack McKeon is our manager ... period. If we had plans to make
Ken Griffey Sr. our manager right away, would we have given him
permission to interview for three or four other managerial openings
last year?''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey Sr. coached in Seattle when Junior played for the
Mariners, but there was no talk at the time of Senior replacing Lou
Piniella as manager to keep Junior in town.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Griffey Sr. wants to manage. And yes, Junior wants to play
for him. Junior, though, is signed for the next decade to play for
the Reds and, yes, Senior could eventually manage the Reds down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad wants to manage and I'd like to play for him, sure,''
Junior said. ``But if he has an opportunity somewhere else soon, I
sure hope he takes it. There is no agreement here that he has to
manage me with the Reds.''

 &HT;    Bowden always ready to deal
 &HT;    By Sean McClelland
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Shortly before the Cincinnati Reds took the
field for another Grapefruit League game this spring, their general
manager could be found prowling the grounds, a cell phone to his
ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talkin' trade?'' someone asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hope so,'' Jim Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   With Bowden around, the roster is always in a state of flux. And
now, given increased financial flexibility as a result of Carl
Lindner's ownership group taking control, he is that much busier.
Checking. Always checking. Have the Minnesota Twins reconsidered?
Will they listen to offers for Brad Radke now? Is there really a
market out there for Dmitri Young? Where can that missing pitcher
be found?
</P>
<P>
   Think blockbuster. Bowden does. And sometimes his patience with
the cards he's holding wears thin. Asked recently about a pitcher
on the bubble and whether he would make it through the weekend,
Bowden said, ``I couldn't tell you that about any of our players
except for Griffey and Larkin. I may get mad and trade them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden lives to trade, loves to trade. Acquiring Ken Griffey Jr.
on Feb. 10 without dismantling the team will go down as his
crowning achievement no matter what else he does, no matter how it
plays out. And nary a day went by this spring without someone,
whether fan or media member, patting him on the back,
congratulating him.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, he should have worn a mask if he intended to pull off
such a heist. Mike Cameron, Bret Tomko and two minor leaguers for a
10-time All-Star? Can you say Executive of the Year? Again?
</P>
<P>
   The Griffey trade brought out the little kid in Bowden, who
turns 39 in May. It had been his dream to reunite the best player
in baseball with his hometown, and he made it happen, shrewdly
outfoxing Seattle Mariners counterpart Pat Gillick in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball establishment even seems to have forgiven Bowden
for later boasting in a national publication about how he pulled it
off, how he waited and waited until Gillick finally ran out of time
and the asking price began to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Griffey engineered his way out of Seattle. Sure, he would
not be wearing a Reds uniform had it not been his intention.
Bowden, however, can rightly take credit for creating an atmosphere
to which such a superstar of Griffey's caliber would be attracted.
Not lost on Griffey were the Reds' 96 wins last season.
</P>
<P>
   Not lost on Griffey was the type of team Bowden had been
assembling and how, amazingly, shortstop and team captain Barry
Larkin was still its driving force after several years of trade
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Reds been viewed as a team going nowhere, what chance
would they have had to lure Griffey, who had expressed the desire
to play for a contender, but easily could have stayed in Seattle
another year and then tested the free-agent market? Bowden knew
this, of course, and had the foresight to put a winner on the field
before the game's most celebrated star became available.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden seems to do his best work when backed into a corner.
After losing slugger Greg Vaughn to free agency over the winter, he
talked the Colorado Rockies into taking reliever Stan Belinda and
outfielder Jeffrey Hammonds for Dante Bichette.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what Jim's going to do,'' Reds manager Jack
McKeon said, meaning that as a compliment.
</P>
<P>
   For Reds fans, the best news about Bowden is that in 1998 he
signed a contract extension that commits him and his cell phone to
Cincinnati through the 2003 season.

 &HT;    Key to run-producing offense is Mayhem Row
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It isn't Murderer's Row down in the depths of the
Cincinnati Reds batting order _ sixth, seventh and eighth. Maybe
it's Assailant's Row or Perpetrator's Row. It definitely is not the
soft underbelly of the batting order, as it is with many teams.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Young will bat sixth. In the past two seasons, D.Y. has
batted .310 and .317. He has hit 14 home runs both seasons. He has
driven in 83 and 56 runs. He has 48 and 30 doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Taubensee will bat seventh. Last season, E.T. phoned home
with a career-best .311 batting average, a career-best 21 homers
and a career-best 87 RBIs. Aaron Boone will bat eighth. Last
season, A.B. was a positive force with a .280 batting average, 14
homers and 72 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that isn't the most potent lower third of a batting order
in baseball, I challenge somebody to find it,'' general manager Jim
Bowden said. It is fact that the combined 35 homers and 159 RBIs by
Taubensee and Boone are the best numbers for hitters No. 7 and No.
8 in any major-league batting order. The mayhem, though, comes from
above, which is why manager Jack McKeon can put such potency at the
bottom of his lineup card, and smile broadly as he does it.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with Pokey Reese, who began last season as the leadoff
hitter, but got hurt. His replacement at No. 1 was Mike Cameron,
who did so well that McKeon left him there and plopped Reese in the
No. 8 hole when Reese returned to the lineup. With Cameron gone as
part of the Ken Griffey Jr. trade, Reese is back on top of the heap
of hitters. He hit .285 last season, which is A-1. But he drew only
35 walks in 585 at-bats and had only a .330 on-base percentage.
That isn't good enough. A strong leadoff hitter should have an
on-base percentage of .400 or better.
</P>
<P>
   Reese plans to work on it, be more selective. ``I hate to get
behind in the count and I hate to watch good pitches go by,'' Reese
said. ``But I know I have to do it. I have to get on base whatever
way possible for those guys behind me. It is an incentive for me
because I know if I get on base I can score 130 runs this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Following Reese is the Reds' version of Mayhem Row _ Barry
Larkin, Junior Griffey, Dante Bichette and Sean Casey. Larkin is
the perfect No. 2 hitter, a guy who gives himself up without a
whimper. If Reese gets on base, Larkin will hit the ball behind
him, go to right field, anything to move Reese to second on a
ground ball or to third with a base hit to right.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the juice ... Griffey and Bichette. Griffey's numbers
the past four years are Ruthian. He has averaged 52 homers, hitting
56 in both 1997 and 1998. He has averaged 142 runs batted in,
driving in 147 in 1997 and 146 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As the Chicago Cubs' new manager, Don Baylor, said during spring
training, ``Griffey will be pitched around a lot. There are guys on
every team you don't want to beat you, and he is the guy on that
team.''
</P>
<P>
   That often should leave the bases densely populated for
Bichette, and he is accustomed to watching teams pitch around the
hitter in front of him to take their chances with him. ``Happened
to me all the time in Colorado,'' he said. ``They would pitch
around Larry Walker to face me. Hey, I understand that. I'd pitch
around Griffey and Walker to pitch to me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Bichette, though, makes them pay and pay and pay. In his last
seven seasons with the Rockies, he hit .317 with an average of 29
home runs and 118 RBIs. Pick your poison, men.
</P>
<P>
   Casey hit .332 last season and astounded those who said he
wouldn't hit for power by jolting 25 homers and compiling 99 RBIs.
But he's giving up the No. 3 spot in the order to Junior, dropping
to No. 5.
</P>
<P>
   It is an offense that should score runs in the same abundance
scored by their Ohio brethren to the north, the American League's
Cleveland Indians. The Tribe, which gets the added plus of the
designated hitter, scored an amazing 1,009 runs last season. The
Reds, without Griffey and without Bichette, scored 865. ``Don't see
any reason why we can't score 1,000 ... or more,'' Reese said.

 &HT;    Deadline two weeks away, with extra time this year
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The great American game may be procrastination, not
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   How else do you explain the millions of Americans who put off
their income tax preparations until the very last hour?
</P>
<P>
   We get two extra days this year, because the traditional
deadline, April 15, falls on a Saturday. You can bet that millions
of Americans will mosey through that extra weekend, confident that
they can stall just one more day.
</P>
<P>
   That's a mistake. In fact, stalling past today is an invitation
to unforeseen and unnecessary problems.
</P>
<P>
   The closer we get to the deadline, the harder it will be to find
help, professional or volunteer. You may have more problems
locating copies of any missing forms and instructions. Even on the
Internet, which has greatly simplified the process, you can't be
surprised if last-minute traffic jams develop.
</P>
<P>
   Want to start now? Here are some steps you can take:
</P>
<P>
   _ Look for freebies. There are locations where professionals or
trained volunteers will prepare your returns for free. No kidding.
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service is providing help because it wants
to stop being seen as the enemy of taxpayers. Kroger stores are
involved because it's a community service _ one that brings people
into the stores. You'll find IRS employes at selected IRS offices
and Kroger stores.
</P>
<P>
   The senior advocacy group AARP just wants to help.
</P>
<P>
   The service is available to anyone who walks in the door. ``We
will help anybody with low to moderate income,'' said Billy
Phillips of Thomaston, coordinator of the AARP program. The
IRS-staffed sites have no income limitations.
</P>
<P>
   People with particularly complex tax situations are probably
better off doing it for themselves or hiring a professional. That's
just plain good sense if a lot of money is at stake. At the AARP
sites, volunteers will not tackle questions for which they are not
trained.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure you bring with you last year's federal and state
returns, along with all forms for the current tax year. That
includes W-2s, 1099s and other papers that show tax-related income
and expenses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pick a professional, and do it right now. Remember that more
than half of America's individual taxpayers already use CPAs,
enrolled agents or other paid preparers. The best of them may
already be booked solid.
</P>
<P>
   The resource list gives contacts for professional associations
that make referrals. Remember that the best referral always is a
word-of-mouth recommendation from someone you know and trust.
</P>
<P>
   It's best to go with full-time, year-round tax preparers, and to
ask how they keep up with changes in the law.
</P>
<P>
   You should avoid people who advertise that they will get you the
biggest deductions. They might also get you the biggest headaches
with the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Ask upfront how much the service will cost, and ask if the
preparer will stick with you in case of an audit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use your computer. Store-bought software is an established
option, and this year many taxpayers are preparing their returns by
using software on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger's TaxCut, Quicken TurboTax and MacInTax are the
established packages available in stores. All of them get high
ratings from reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   They are also available online. For Kiplinger software, go to
www.taxcut.com or www.HRBlock.com. The Quicken versions are at
www.turbotax.com or www
</P>
<P>
   .macintax.com.
</P>
<P>
   You can find do-it-yourself software at hundreds of other Web
sites maintained by banks, mutual funds and brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   The buzzword for all these options is ``e-filing.'' Roughly one
of every four individual taxpayers will file electronically this
year, and the IRS would like to see a lot more.
</P>
<P>
   The government likes e-filing for reasons that should also
appeal to taxpayers: fewer mathematical mistakes, legible returns
and easier processing.
</P>
<P>
   There's one other advantage for consumers: The software's
interview format, asking one logical question after another,
reduces the fear that you will miss crucial instructions or
misunderstand what you're supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that factor alone will encourage more people to file their
returns before the last minute, this year and in the future.

 &HT;    Reds feeling confident with Griffey in the fold
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before they get started, Barry Larkin, captain of the
Cincinnati Reds and a forthright fellow, wants the rest of the
National League to know something.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a matter of whether we will win the division,''
Larkin said. ``It is a matter of by how many games.''
</P>
<P>
   But wait. There's more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that,'' Larkin said. ``That's the attitude we have
here. The atmosphere here still presents itself that we had last
year. We are confident. Guys can have fun when they're confident.
We'll have a good time, have fun on the field, because it is always
fun when you win.''
</P>
<P>
   Having Ken Griffey Jr. in your dugout can encourage such talk.
But around the league, the Reds have shown enough power and
pitching to make a quick bunch of believers. The old NL ``Comedy''
Central has become the most formidible division in the league, and
perhaps in the majors, and Cincinnati is presenting itself as a
team to be beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to be, with the club they had, and you throw in
Griffey,'' St. Louis general manager Walt Jocketty said. ``They won
96 games (in 1999). We're not ready to throw in the towel, but it
certainly is going to make it tougher to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves will have plenty to say about it. Replacing the
injured John Smoltz will be nearly impossible, and the New York
Mets made offseason improvements. But the Braves field what might
be their most complete offensive team of any of their eight
division-winning rosters of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like our team,'' left-hander Tom Glavine said.
</P>
<P>
   NL West champion Arizona likes its team, too, so much that the
Diamondbacks hardly touched the roster over the winter after a
100-win season. That inactivity raised hopes in San Francisco and
Los Angeles, which improved their clubhouses. Four teams have won
this division over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   The NL wild card becomes harder to call than the division
favorites. Although the Mets will miss first baseman John Olerud,
the addition of Mike Hampton fixes a bigger problem. St. Louis
improved its pitching. Houston retains a strong core from the group
that won the NL Central three years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   And as for a dark horse, Philadelphia has an opinion. ``The
future is here now,'' right-hander Curt Schilling said. ``No doubt
about it. We legitimately have a chance to go the distance.''
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL LEAGUE PREDICTIONS
</P>
<P>
   EAST
</P>
<P>
   1. Atlanta: Reduced pitching staff might require five runs a
night to win, but this roster can handle it.
</P>
<P>
   2. New York: Hampton enhances a team that made strong fall run,
but a poor start will renew the feuding.
</P>
<P>
   3. Philadelphia: Only one winning season in 13 years but the
Phils think they're ready; they must avoid typical late swoon.
</P>
<P>
   4. Montreal: Felipe Alou proclaims Expos' ``crisis'' over, but
someone better teach them to field first.
</P>
<P>
   5. Florida: Targeted contending date: 2002. Until then, these
fish continue some serious bottom-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   CENTRAL
</P>
<P>
   1. Cincinnati: One winning season in the past four, but this
roster is seamless, and Griffey stirs the drink.
</P>
<P>
   2. St. Louis: Pitching still not great yet, but it is improved
enough to take advantage of Big Mac run-support.
</P>
<P>
   3. Houston: New park, new uniforms, but star has slipped; could
see October but not with another Central title.
</P>
<P>
   4. Pittsburgh: Pirates finally might be on to something with
rebuilt talent base. The Central is just too deep.
</P>
<P>
   5. Chicago: HRs rain on Waveland, and Cubbie pitchers serve up
most of them; Baylor earns his money.
</P>
<P>
   6. Milwaukee: What foul cheese be this? Good news: Roster is
revamped. Bad news: New players won't help.
</P>
<P>
   WEST
</P>
<P>
   1. Arizona: 1999 was no mirage. The D-backs are skilled
everywhere and are smart enough to learn what last year required.
</P>
<P>
   2. Los Angeles: Better vibes with Mondesi gone, Green in. Better
yet, who gagged big-mouth GM Malone?
</P>
<P>
   3. San Fran: Bonds waited so long to play in this new park; now
that it's built, can his 35-year-body make it?
</P>
<P>
   4. Colorado: Managers leave Denver the way baseballs leave
Coors. Buddy Bell ponders the uselessness of the six-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   5. San Diego: Padres swear they aren't the Marlins of 1997, but
the roster atrophies as Gwynn's tummy swells.
</P>
<P>
   POSTSEASON
</P>
<P>
   Wild-card team: Mets
</P>
<P>
   First round: Braves over Diamondbacks; Reds over Mets.

CHINA HAS `WAIT AND SEE' ATTITUDE TO TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chinese leaders have told the United States that
they plan to stick with a ``wait and see'' attitude toward Taiwan's
new president and that they are open to resuming a dialogue with
the estranged island, a senior administration official said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese assurances, if borne out, come at a crucial time for
the administration, which is scrambling to put relations with China
on an even keel before President Clinton leaves office and to
persuade Congress to upgrade economic relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, President Jiang Zemin of China and other top leaders
assured the national security adviser, Sandy Berger, that China's
initial, restrained reaction to the election of Chen Shui-bian as
Taiwan's president last month was part of a ``considered policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen's party had previously called for independence from China,
something Beijing has sworn it will not allow, and he only recently
muted that stance.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have decided, at least for the time being, to try to
reach an accommodation with his new government, which is expected
to be formed in May, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't quite know what to make of the situation,'' the
senior administration official said, describing Berger's two-day
talks with the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they are not inclined to act in a precipitous way and they
want to find a way to reach an accommodation consistent with their
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are working on a formulation consistent with their
one-China principle,'' the official added.
</P>
<P>
   Berger traveled to China in part because the administration is
simultaneously seeking to smooth relations between mainland China
and Taiwan even as it struggles to assemble a Republican-dominated
coalition of lawmakers willing to grant China permanent trading
rights in the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders said that any flare-up in tension between
China and Taiwan would almost certainly derail the administration's
hopes to win passage of the trade measure soon. The administration,
in turn, has warned that failure to pass the measure could
seriously set back relations with China and diminish U.S. influence
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an important national security argument for going
forward with permanent normal trade relations, which is if anything
intensified by developments related to Taiwan,'' said the senior
administration official. ``It not only creates a degree of
interdependence between China and the world community but also to
the economic integration of China and Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has in the past threatened to attack Taiwan if it tries
to secede. During Taiwan's election four years ago, the Chinese
lobbed missiles around the island in an attempt to intimidate
voters. Senior Chinese leaders gave a bellicose warning to Taiwan
shortly before the latest elections as well, apparently to persuade
voters to back candidates considered more favorable to
reunification than Chen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, relieved by Chen's conciliatory comments after his
election, China seems inclined to remain open to dialogue, the
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States has no intention of mediating between
Taiwan and China, the officials said that the two sides had the
potential to work through a complex set of historical formulations
for dealing with each other based on differing views of Chinese
sovereignty, and to resume a dialogue that was broken off in the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Though that process would probably take many months, if it
happened at all, the mere prospect reduces the risk of rising
tensions blocking passage of normal trade relations, which Clinton
has called his top remaining foreign-policy priority. A
congressional vote on the matter is expected in May, the same time
that Taiwan's new government takes power.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has asked Congress to give up its annual
review of China's trade status, granting it the same trading rights
_ called permanent normal trade relations _ that most other
countries have.
</P>
<P>
   The step is required if U.S. companies are to benefit fully from
a market-opening agreement that the administration negotiated as
part of China's continuing effort to join the World Trade
Organization. Congress has no vote on whether China can join the
Geneva-based trade-regulation body.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is a technical one _ removing China's name from a
dwindling list of nations subject to Title IV of the Trade Act of
1974, also known as Jackson-Vanik.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters argue that the economic rationale for giving up the
annual review is overwhelming. The agreement with China requires it
to open its markets and overhaul its regulatory regime, making way
for foreign competitors in every area from agriculture to the
Internet. But as Clinton has noted, ``it's a one-way deal'' that
does not require reciprocal trading concessions by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has argued that granting permanent normal trading
relations is essential for the national security of the United
States. He said it would support reformers in China's government,
lock China's bureaucracy into a rules-based international trading
regime and contribute to stability in Asia. Rejection would affect
the United States' economic interests, Clinton said last week, but
``the national security consequences would be worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote, however, has become freighted both with ideological
concerns about China's Communist government and with domestic
political worries in an election year. While the U.S. business
community has begun a national lobbying campaign on behalf of the
measure, labor unions have mounted a vigorous opposition designed
to culminate in what unions are promising will be a huge
mobilization of supporters in Washington and around the nation on
April 12.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, both political parties are divided about the wisdom of
granting new trading rights to a country that has a weak
human-rights record and has often made threats to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Senate passage is considered likely. But if the measure slips
through the House, Clinton will have the Republicans to thank;
early counts show that that two-thirds of his own party's members
in the House will vote against permanent normal trade relations.
</P>
<P>
   The administration and the Republican leadership in the House
have begun to work together to build a coalition across party lines
in support of the measure.

</P>
<P>
   Dennis Hastert, the House majority leader, has acceded to
administration pleas and agreed to set a date for the vote in late
May, aides said, even though Republican leaders acknowledge that
Clinton has not fulfilled what they had insisted was a
prerequisite: proving that he can produce enough Democrats to
ensure passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragic irony that while the president has put this at
the top of his priority list, his own party is becoming more
xenophobic,'' said David Dreier, R-Calif., who heads the House
rules committee. ``But the president is engaged and working hard,
and we are willing to work with him to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, getting to 218 votes may prove difficult. Although
business pressure on Republicans has been intense, some members of
the party argue that the administration should work actively for
the overthrow of the Chinese government instead of giving it
upgraded trading rights.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides say the party will struggle to produce 150
votes in favor of permanent normal trade relations, the same number
that supported annual renewal of China's trading rights last year.
</P>
<P>
   That means supporters will need about 70 Democrats to vote in
favor, and more if Republicans experience any more slippage.
Democratic lawmakers who favor the measure say that this is still
possible, but acknowledge that most of their potential supporters
are still uncommitted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has started a campaign _ run out of the Old Executive
Office Building next to the White House _ that is aimed primarily
at securing support from wavering Democrats. Aides said Clinton is
spending more time on China trade than on any other single item on
his agenda. He will make his sixth major address on the subject on
Monday in California and has scheduled numerous evening talks with
lawmakers in the White House this month.
</P>
<P>
   The president has also assigned five cabinet secretaries to make
China their priority. Three of them _ Commerce Secretary William
Daley, the U.S. trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, and
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman _ have cleared their schedules
this spring to focus on lobbying lawmakers and crisscrossing the
country to drum up support for China trade in the home districts of
key lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an intensive, all-out effort, member by member,
district by district, explaining what this agreement is really
about and what's at stake in terms of relations with China,'' said
Barshefsky, who negotiated the sweeping trade agreement that opened
the door for China to join the WTO. ``What we're saying is that
this decision is about the best way to influence China, not just on
economics but all the surrounding issues as well.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1980, a race riot in Miami confronted Janet Reno
with the first crisis of her public life. As state attorney of
Miami-Dade County, Reno had failed to win the convictions of four
white police officers charged with the beating death of a black
insurance salesman. In the streets below her office window, an
angry mob chanted, ``Reno! Reno! Reno!''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, the specter of another public disturbance in
her hometown has shaped Reno's response to the escalating Elian
Gonzalez immigration drama. In a series of emotional and personal
remarks last week, U.S. Attorney General Reno appealed to Miami's
Cuban-American community to peacefully accept the return of
6-year-old Elian to his Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case has been heartbreaking for everybody involved,''
Reno said. ``But we believe that the law is clear. Elian should be
reunited with his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1980 riots, Reno has always been cautious in assessing
and responding to a potential confrontation. She has kept her own
counsel (one friend said Reno ``uses three words when five would be
all right''), and been criticized for it. In 1993, for example,
during the long standoff at Waco, Texas, which began just weeks
after she was sworn in as attorney general, Reno said very little
publicly and is still considered by some to be hiding the truth of
that fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   As Reno grapples with the Elian case, she is again being
criticized for her deliberate approach to an emotionally and
politically charged case and is even being blamed for worsening the
conflict. This time, however, she is being uncharacteristically
talkative.
</P>
<P>
   Her friends and associates say she is convinced that
communication with her former neighbors in Miami is the best way to
ensure that the international tug-of-war over Elian does not end in
a very ugly way. They also say that the Elian case has been
especially difficult for her because it is roiling the city where
she was born, grew up and served for 15 years as an immensely
popular state attorney. She is also convinced it is the best way to
ensure that the international tug-of-war over a small boy does not
end in ugliness.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, relatives of Elian said they would not turn the boy
over to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, even if he comes for a
visit, and suggested that they may not hand him over to the
authorities, even if they lose their custody case in court. The
lawyers also questioned the father's fitness as a parent.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials have said they would revoke the boy's
right to remain in the United States on Tuesday unless his
great-uncle signs an agreement to hand Elian over, peacefully and
painlessly, if the relatives lose their custody case after legal
appeals are exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's concern over events in the community intensified last
week, her friends say, after Mayor Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade
County said that local police authorities would not help the
federal government remove Elian from Miami. The remarks were viewed
by some as an invitation to civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of the case, most immigration and
international law experts have criticized the attorney general for
not moving quickly enough to return Elian to his father. Jan Ting,
a former assistant commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said that it was ``an abject act of
spinelessness'' that the Justice Department has continued to engage
in lengthy negotiations with Elian's Miami relatives over the
conditions of the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every immigration authority I know of outside of Dade County,
Florida, agrees that the administration had legal authority to
return Elian to his father as soon as they confirmed the father's
identity and fitness,'' said Ting, who is a professor of law at
Temple University's Deasley School of Law. ``Ironically, the local
officials may be right in saying that President Clinton and
Attorney General Reno are responsible for any civil disorder in
Miami, not because of their action but because of their inaction.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand Reno's handling of this matter, one must look to
her long public career in Miami, where she presided over _ and
survived _ race riots, crime waves, drug cartels, massive influxes
of immigrants and brazen acts of political and judicial corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though this is an international and national issue, the
fact of the matter is all politics are local, and this is a local
issue and she's very sensitive to that,'' said Jeffrey Weiner, a
Miami defense lawyer who has known Reno for 26 years. ``Had this
been handled by an attorney general who was not from South Florida,
it would probably have ended a long time ago. She really felt the
pain of the riots here. I think it has contributed to her
insistence that this play out in the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Reno refuses to speculate about Miami's response to
Elian's departure _ ``I don't do what-ifs,'' she said _ friends say
her comments were intended to quell the community's intense anger.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's negotiations occurred at the home of Elian's Miami
relatives, which was often surrounded by a human chain of angry
Cuban-Americans who believe that the U.S. government is plotting to
drug Elian to expedite his swift return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, however, has thus far remained patient. When she was asked
about her reaction to last week's ABC interview with Elian, who
insisted that he did not want to return to Cuba, she replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people understand a 6-year-old. And I can
remember, I loved to go to my grandmother's house. She had such a
wonderful house, and she cooked us biscuits just right, and she
loved us. And she took us to the movies, and she got us French
vanilla ice cream. And she read to us, and she taught us to play
cards. She was a wonderful lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it came Sunday afternoon, and I'd run around behind the
house and hide because I didn't want to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said it is easy for her to understand why Elian wishes to
remain with his great-uncle in the United States. ``I think they
are his own feelings,'' she said. ``They were certainly my feelings
when I ran behind the house and cried and didn't want to go home.''

ALL SEEMS CALM, FOR NOW, IN BATTLE OVER CUBAN BOY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ If there could be such a thing as a quiet day in the
tumultuous story of Elian Gonzalez, it was Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After a tense week filled with defiant speeches against the
federal government by local politicians, accusations by family
members that Elian's father has been verbally abusive to the boy in
telephone calls, and an unexpected show of support for the Miami
relatives by Vice President Al Gore, a comparative calm settled
over Little Havana on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Even the demonstrators _ a few dozen have kept vigil around the
clock there _ were mostly quiet outside the house where the
6-year-old boy lives with his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, and
other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Last week angry demonstrators clashed with and routed a small
group of counterdemonstrators who said they believed Elian should
go back to his father in Cuba, and yelled ``comunista'' at
reporters. But on Saturday an elderly man _ retirees have made up a
large part of the weekday force of demonstrators outside the home _
waved pleasantly to a passing reporter.
</P>
<P>
   But then the crisis itself seemed on hold for the weekend, after
Lazaro Gonzalez and federal government officials agreed to suspend
their long-running negotiations over how, and whether, the boy
would be handed over to his father or federal authorities. That
seeming calm, say people who have been following the case, will
evaporate this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think if they make enough noise, the U.S. government will
listen,'' said Lisandro Perez, director of the Cuban Research
Institute at Florida International University.
</P>
<P>
   But the government, despite Gore's defection from his
administration's position on the Elian situation, seems to be
holding to Attorney General Janet Reno's resolve to reunite the boy
with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials said that if the family lost its appeal
for custody of Elian in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in
Atlanta, and if his great-uncle still refused to sign an agreement
to peacefully hand the boy over, they would on Tuesday revoke the
boy's right to remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials are afraid of violence, as well as trauma
for Elian, if federal officials do not have the cooperation of
Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Coffey, a lawyer for the boy's Miami relatives, said the
family had never said it would resist if federal authorities went
to the house to take the child. Lazaro Gonzalez has said he would
not, however, deliver the boy to them.
</P>
<P>
   It has all led to an unusually ugly confrontation between the
federal government and Cuban exiles here, and one that grew
steadily hotter as the week progressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are destroying justice because we are Cubans,'' said
Dulce Gonzalez, a retired teacher who arrived from Cuba 30 years
ago and kept vigil at the house all week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was, for everyone associated, a dizzying week.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Lazaro Gonzalez refused to sign the government's
agreement, while in the streets of Little Havana exile leaders
continued to drill a small army of demonstrators in protest
tactics, including a ``human chain'' intended to prevent federal
officials from taking Elian.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, President Fidel Castro surprised many when he said
that the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, was ready to go to the
United States to reclaim his son, and would be accompanied by an
entourage that would include his family in Cuba, Cuban officials, a
teacher, classmates of Elian, psychiatrists and others.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official told The Associated Press later in
the week that the boy's father would most likely be given custody
of Elian if he traveled to the United States, though it is
uncertain when that would happen.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, 20 elected officials in Miami said they would not lend
their resources to federal officials if they arrived to retrieve
the boy, and warned that violence could break out.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gore broke with President Clinton and Attorney
General Janet Reno, saying the boy should be allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, lawyers for Elian's relatives in Miami said that
the boy's father was verbally abusive to the boy on the telephone,
and that he told Elian his mother was still alive in Cuba. The
boy's mother drowned when the boat that was bringing her, the boy
and others to Florida capsized in the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
   This week is likely to bring more of the same furor. Federal
officials have said they will not go in and immediately take the
child if Lazaro Gonzalez does not sign the paper, but that they
would revoke the boy's immigration status, clearing the way for his
removal from the home.
</P>
<P>
   But in the streets, demonstrators say they are ready, at a
moment's notice, to block that effort.

CHINA KEEPS HERO'S WIDOW FROM VISITING CRITIC OF ARMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The widow of Edgar Snow, the American journalist who
was celebrated here as a ``friend of China'' for his sympathetic
portraits of the Communist revolution, was prevented by police
Saturday from meeting a prominent critic of the 1989 army crackdown
on student democracy demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by at least two dozen plainclothes officers, several
of them carrying ill-concealed video cameras in book bags, Lois
Wheeler Snow, 79, and her 50-year-old son, Christopher Snow, were
halted at the gate of People's University Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   They had hoped to meet with the critic, Ding Zilin, at her
apartment inside the campus, where she is a professor, and to
support her efforts to provide money and consolation to relatives
of those killed by the army in the Tiananmen Square crackdown in
June 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Ding's own 17-year-old son was among the dead. Since then, she
has risked arrest by demanding that top officials be held
accountable for the shooting of unarmed demonstrators, and she has
been a key organizer of bereaved families, many of whom have
suffered financially.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the authorities felt compelled to keep apart these
two women _ one who for years was described here as a great friend
of the nation, but was sickened by the 1989 crackdown, and one who
lost her son _ was a renewed reminder of the sensitivity in the
Communist Party about the Tiananmen Square demonstrations and their
violent suppression.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, authorities have tried to prevent Ding's
family group from receiving donations, and she has often been kept
under virtual house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a just a friendly visit from a mother with a son to a
mother who has lost a son _ to many mothers who have lost sons,''
Snow said as she was stopped from entering the campus by its chief
of security. ``I just want them to let her receive donations and
distribute them to the victims' families.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, Ding's apartment was also surrounded by
plainclothes officers and she was not allowed to leave home.
Several foreign journalists nearby were temporarily detained.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Ding's, Su Bingxian, whose son was also killed in
the 1989 crackdown, emerged to meet the visitors and relay Ding's
regrets. Snow, clearly moved, gave the friend a book of her late
husband's writings and what she described as a symbolic
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Snow, Edgar Snow's second wife, was married to him from
1949 until his death in 1972. She lives in Switzerland, where they
moved in the 1950s.

   Almost every year from 1972 to 1987, Snow said in an interview,
she returned to Beijing and was honored by high officials. But in
1989, she publicly condemned the crackdown and did not return again
until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had been touched by press accounts of Ding's
efforts on behalf of victims' families, and last summer had tried
to send her a letter and a small contribution. ``The letter was
confiscated and she was not allowed to receive the money,'' Snow
said. ``So I decided it was time to act.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, Snow became the first Western journalist to spend time
with Mao Tse-tung, when his bedraggled army was holed up in the
mountains. Snow's 1937 book on the rise of the Communists, ``Red
Star Over China,'' became a classic.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, he was one of the few Americans allowed to enter
China, but his books and magazine articles played down or missed
some of the darker aspects of Mao's revolution, including a famine
at the beginning of that decade.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, when Mao and Prime Minister Chou En-lai wanted to
signal a willingness to reopen ties with Washington, Snow and his
wife were invited to sit on the rostrum with Mao and other leaders
during the National Day Parade.
</P>
<P>
   When Snow died two years later, his wife returned with a portion
of his ashes, which are interred in a monument at Beijing
University.

REBEL AMBUSH IN CHECHNYA IS ONE OF WORST FOR RUSSIANS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MOSCOW _ As many as 32 Russian commandos were killed last
Wednesday when their convoy was attacked in a rebel ambush, the
Defense Ministry said Saturday. Earlier reports had put the death
toll at seven, with about 30 missing.
</P>
<P>
   The deadly attack, one of the worst in a widening partisan war,
took place as a convoy of 41 elite Interior Ministry troops, on
their way to the village of Dargo, were attacked near Zhani-Vedeno,
deep in the mountains of southern Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Another group from Vedeno came to their aid, many of whom were
seriously wounded. Altogether, only five or six officers managed to
break through the ambush, according to various published reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Itar-Tass news agency, quoting Victor Medveditskov, a top
Interior Ministry official, said Saturday that 32 bodies had been
tentatively identified. According to Interfax, quoting unidentified
sources, only 19 bodies had been recovered in heavily mined
terrain. One wounded man was found three days after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The ambush was the second against an elite unit since an attack
in the Chechen capital, Grozny, against a unit from the Moscow
region that left 20 dead. An entire company of paratroopers, based
in the city of Pskov, was wiped out early last month in southern
Chechnya, and 84 servicemen were killed.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, Lt. Gen. Valeri Manilov said the
number of servicemen killed in the north Caucasus had reached
2,036, with 6,076 wounded. The figures include military and
Interior Ministry troops killed last September in the region of
Dagestan after it came under attack by Chechen rebels, as well as
those who have died or been wounded in fighting in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``One shouldn't underestimate the enemy,'' said Manilov, who not
long ago said the rebel forces were disorganized, and hampered by a
lack of communication.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. high commissioner for human rights, Mary Robinson,
arrived Saturday in the region, on an inspection tour that will
take her to detention facilities where Russian troops have
allegedly beaten and tortured Chechen civilians. Robinson has said
she will investigate the evidence for alleged human rights abuses
committed by both sides in the six-month war.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson began Saturday by touring refugee camps in neighboring
Ingushetia, where more than 200,000 Chechens have fled since the
Russian military began its campaign in their breakaway home region
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups and Western journalists have reported a
series of atrocities committed against civilians by Russian troops
as they moved through Grozny and other towns and villages in
Chechnya to clear out rebel fighters. Human Rights Watch, which
recently had documented 120 cases of civilians executed by Russian
troops, Friday added another seven to the list with a detailed
report of executions that it said took place in the village of
Gekhi-Chu on Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's conduct of the war in Chechnya is now being debated at
the U.N. Commission for Human Rights in Geneva, and will be taken
up at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on
Monday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   President-elect Vladimir Putin, who has taken responsibility for
the war, which was started soon after he became prime minister last
August, has said that Moscow had to use military means to take back
control of a region that had become a haven for terrorists, bandits
and kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Russian news agencies reported that experts were
examining the body of a hostage found in Chechnya which may
possibly be that of Maj. Gen. Gennadi Shpigun, the Interior
Ministry's representative in Chechnya who was kidnapped a year ago
from his car at Grozny airport.
</P>
<P>
   The brazen kidnapping had a big impact in Moscow, where top
officials _ including then-Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin _
vowed publicly to use whatever means necessary to get back their
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   In later interviews, Stepashin, who served briefly as prime
minister before Putin, said that the Shpigun kidnapping led to
preparations for a military operation that was to occupy the
northern half of Chechnya, and establish a ``cordon sanitaire''
along the Terek River that divides Chechnya roughly in two.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Yastrzhembsky, Russia's chief spokesman on Chechnya, said
Saturday that forensic experts were examining the body retrieved in
Chechnya, but that no certain identification had been made. A
German newspaper reported Saturday that the body believed to be
that of Shpigun had been found near the village of Duba-yurt, in
the Argun gorge. According to Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Shpigun had
eluded his captors and frozen to death in the forest.

HIGH GAS PRICES SPUR LIFE CHANGES FOR CALIFORNIANS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gas prices may have risen across the nation in
recent months, as a tight oil supply has driven up the cost of
crude oil. But nowhere in the country are the increases more
astounding than in California, where they have even become
noticeable to people not accustomed to worrying about such things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can barely even fill it up, it's just so expensive,'' said
Katherine Butler, 30, an actress (30 is her real age, she noted
with pride), as she gassed her black BMW convertible at a Sunset
Boulevard station.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Butler said, it costs up to $30 to fill the tank, so
``I'm always just getting enough to get to the next place.''
</P>
<P>
   The vastness of the West has generally made development
horizontal rather than vertical, and in decades past California has
invested heavily in highways. Cars here are more than a privilege
or a convenience; they are a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of OPEC's decision last week to increase production of
crude oil, gasoline here has reached nearly $1.79 a gallon, 28
cents higher on average than in the rest of the nation. In some
places it has exceeded $2.
</P>
<P>
   California has an unusual system: it requires a cleaner-burning
formula than the rest of the country and buys gasoline from
different sources. Most of the state's gas comes from Alaska and
California, and 90 percent of the market is controlled by five
companies, according to state officials.
</P>
<P>
   Cars are still the vehicle of choice in Los Angeles; ridership
on buses and subways is actually down slightly in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   But a few who have made the change to public transportation say
that the gas price increases have profoundly altered how they live.
They have gotten out of their cars, come into contact with other
Angelenos on the subway, enjoyed the camaraderie and passed their
time talking, embroidering or reading, instead of steaming in that
other Los Angeles icon, the traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the encounters have been a bit otherworldly. Heather
Stevens, 31, a Web site editor who takes two subway trains and a
bus to get from her home in Long Beach to her job in midtown Los
Angeles, said she recently sat next to a woman who asked her if she
was going to Houston. When she replied no, the woman said: ``I need
to go to Houston. I'm from the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Evon Gray, a 44-year-old health care customer service
representative, said she rode the subway because ``I was
budgeted.'' The transportation stipend Gray receives from her
employer covers less and less of her gas costs, she said, and ``I
figured it was cheaper for me to take the subway than keep buying
gas.''
</P>
<P>
   State legislators are backing competing proposals to alleviate
the crunch. Republicans favor eliminating the gas tax, which adds
19 cents a gallon. Democrats say that would not stop oil companies
from raising prices further and have proposed a measure to impose a
100 percent tax on oil companies' ``excess profits'' and return the
money to residents. The proposal is short on details and has been
met with skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, public outcry has been more muted than it
was a year ago, when the price of regular unleaded rose to what now
seems a modest $1.58 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the high prices, many in Los Angeles do not consider
public transportation an option _ because their homes are not close
enough to bus or subway stops, because it would be too
time-consuming or because they fear it would be unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   And the subway has not won over all of its new patrons. The high
gas prices are not enough to keep some from going back to their
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not me,'' said Trevon Blaylock, 30, a Mobil gasoline tank
driver who has been riding the subway for two months since his car
broke down. ``I'm buying a car tomorrow. I'm about tired of this,
this subway. It's more convenient to drive a car. In L.A., you have
to have a car.''
</P>
<P>
   For Eugene Negri, a 48-year-old private chef from the Hollywood
Hills, the cost of filling his pickup truck has risen to about $30
a week. But is he doing anything different to save money?
</P>
<P>
   ``No change,'' Negri said, as he finished filling his truck.
``Just endure the pain. At least we have good weather.''

INCIDENTS RENEW RANCH'S BORDER PATROL BAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (jw) 
 By ROSS E. MILLOY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARITA, Texas _ After government vehicles ran over and injured
illegal immigrants on a vast cattle ranch here twice in the past
month, the ranch's owners notified the U.S. Border Patrol that its
agents could no longer pursue their quarry on ranch property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a hard situation,'' said Richard Leshin, a lawyer for
the John G. and Marie Stella Kenedy Memorial Foundation, a
charitable organization that owns the Kenedy Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, which has strong ties to the Roman Catholic
Church, made its decision because it believes that the Border
Patrol has been violating immigrants' human rights.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Leshin said, ``The government has told us that they
have the authority to seize the ranch because we are in violation
of federal law, and that's a major concern for the foundation's
directors.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Border Patrol officials say that while they have
the right to seize the ranch, they do not plan to. But they say
they expect the foundation to allow agents to patrol the area
freely, which, they say, is necessary to control illegal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Each month, several thousand undocumented immigrants try to slip
past the Border Patrol's K-24 checkpoint in the middle of ranch
property on Highway 77, just south of Sarita, the Border Patrol
said. Many of the immigrants enter the largely uninhabited
235,000-acre ranch, one of the largest in Texas, in hopes of
escaping north.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by rolling plains of scrub chaparral and mesquite
trees, the checkpoint and the 90 agents who operate it are like a
dike against the human river of illegal immigrants, said Fred
Borrego, a Border Patrol supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are poor, they're hungry, they're desperate, and
they'll do anything to keep from being caught,'' Borrego said.
``But it's our job to stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   Agents, he said, capture 1,800 to 2,200 undocumented immigrants
near the checkpoint every month, about half the total he estimates
moves through the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we can see dozens of suspected illegals from the
checkpoint and can't do anything about it if we can't get on to
Kenedy Ranch property,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The checkpoint has been controversial for years. A University of
Houston study found that in 1996, 19 immigrants died of heat stroke
and other exposure-related causes while trying to evade the
checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Because of ongoing internal investigations by the Border Patrol,
Borrego would not discuss details of what he called the
``unfortunate accidents'' in which the immigrants were recently
injured.
</P>
<P>
   On March 2, agents working west of K-24 ran over the right arm
of Victor Manuel, 25, while pursuing about 25 people suspected of
being undocumented immigrants; on March 7, another vehicle struck
Armando Leal, who was hiding in high grass, Border Patrol incident
reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Leal suffered major injuries to his back and pelvis that
required surgery. He was released on March 17 from Christus Spohn
Memorial Hospital in Corpus Christi, hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kenedy Foundation banned agents once before, in 1995, when
vehicles operating off the ranch's paved roads ignited grass fires
and agents damaged gates and fences, Leshin said. Border Patrol
agents also fished and hunted on ranch property without permission,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1998, Leshin said, the FBI warned the Kenedy
Foundation that the government was considering seizing the ranch
because of the ban, and a settlement was signed in September 1999
that required federal officials to notify the foundation before
they pursued immigrants beyond paved roads on ranch property.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incidents in which the two immigrants were injured broke
that agreement, and the foundation's board voted March 17 to ban
federal agents from its property,'' Leshin said.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch is used primarily for cattle and oil operations but
also allows nature tourists to prowl its coastal prairies and sand
dunes in search of the 200 species of migratory birds present in
the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, agents have the right to enter any property
within 25 miles of U.S. boundaries. Although the Kenedy Ranch is
nearly 100 miles from the Mexican border, its land extends almost
to the Gulf of Mexico, which officials say is an international
boundary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has the authority to seize the ranch, but I
don't know that there is any current talk of doing that,'' said
Perry Cronin, a spokesman for the Border Patrol's regional district
office in McAllen, Texas. ``We're still in the talking stages, and
no agreements have been reached.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Cronin and Nancy Cohen, with the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in Washington, said they were unaware of any
case in which the government had seized private property in such
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for immigrants in El Paso, Houston and the Lower Rio
Grande Valley say disputes with the Border Patrol over access to
private property and injuries caused by agents pursuing immigrants
have increased along the border in recent years as enforcement
efforts have intensified.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should have the right to seek jobs across borders
without being herded and hunted like animals,'' said Nathan Selzer
of Proyecto Libertad, an immigrant legal aid organization based in
Harlingen, Texas. ``It's an affront to human dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Jimenez of the American Friends Service Committee in
Houston said that, increasingly, residents along the border were
``beginning to object to the numbers of Border Patrol agents coming
onto their property.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``We're hearing many more complaints in recent years
about their tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez said those problems included at least two or three cases
a year of what she called ``rundowns'' by agents chasing immigrants
with vehicles.

PRESSURE MOUNTS FOR CRACKDOWN ON DECEPTIVE LENDING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, N.C., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After several years of inaction, pressure is building in
Washington to impose tighter rules on banks and finance companies
that specialize in lending money to homeowners with blemished
credit records.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, chairman of the House Banking Committee,
said last week that his committee would be pressing for more
vigorous enforcement of a law adopted in 1994 to combat deceptive
lending practices, and may do more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, do we need stronger legislation, more
aggressive regulatory oversight, or both?'' Leach said in an
interview. ``I am increasingly thinking we need both.''
</P>
<P>
   The consumer finance industry, which is regulated by state
governments, has been sharply criticized in recent years for the
actions of certain aggressive lenders who mislead borrowers into
taking out home equity loans with excessively high fees and
interest rates. Some borrowers have lost their homes, and others
are struggling to meet escalating monthly payments.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Congress enacted a law intended to curb those
practices, but more than two years ago, the Federal Reserve Board
and the Department of Housing and Urban Development warned that the
law had failed to stem a tide of deceptive lending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abusive practices continue to exist'' and would continue
unless Congress drafted new ``substantive protections'' of
consumers, the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Little action resulted, even as the industry continued to expand
its lending with billions of dollars raised by leading Wall Street
investment banks. Neither the Fed nor HUD followed up with a formal
legislative proposal, congressional aides said. And the Republican
leadership in Congress, which believed that the 1994 law gave
regulators broad authority to attack the problem on their own, was
distracted by presidential impeachment, a global financial crisis
and a prolonged fight over Depression-era laws governing banks and
brokerage houses.
</P>
<P>
   That all may be about be change.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Leach's blunt call for stronger steps by regulators,
all four federal banking regulators _ including Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve _ had spoken out against deceptive
lending practices, and some are beginning to develop new
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a large and influential corporate player in the
nation's mortgage markets, Fannie Mae, has decided to put its
considerable influence to work to establish enforceable industry
standards.
</P>
<P>
   And with state lawmakers taking matters into their own hands _
North Carolina has already adopted the toughest law in the country,
and other states are considering action _ some segments of the
industry are becoming more willing to consider a federal law that
could head off 50 state laws restricting their business.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about unfair and deceptive loan practices have
intensified since 1994, when Wall Street began to pump substantial
amounts of money into the industry through the sale of securities
backed by home equity loans to so-called ``subprime'' borrowers,
those with less-than-perfect credit ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The industry insists that deceptive practices are rare and that
subprime lenders make credit more available, and more affordable,
for people who once had few options beyond the local pawnshop.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates and regulators _ and lately, a few
mortgage industry leaders _ say that even some of the largest
subprime lenders engage in predatory practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the problem is getting worse because it's getting more
brazen,'' said Franklin D. Raines, the chief executive of Fannie
Mae, a government-chartered corporation that finances most of
America's home mortgages through the purchase of loans from banks
and other original lenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many legitimate lenders are being tempted to get into this
because of its profits,'' Raines said. ``And if this goes
mainstream, we've really got a very serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Raines' company and another federally chartered loan financing
corporation, Freddie Mac, are already taking steps to ensure that
their own loan purchases do not encourage predatory practices.
</P>
<P>
   But Raines, in a recent interview, disclosed that he also
intended to lead an industrywide campaign _ fashioned after an
earlier nationwide effort to discourage investment in South Africa
_ that could deny abusive lenders access to Wall Street capital.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His approach is modeled after the Sullivan Principles, named
after the Rev. Leon H. Sullivan, the Philadelphia civil rights
leader who in 1977 developed a widely followed code of conduct for
companies doing business in South Africa. His efforts have been
cited for helping to end apartheid in that nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hard for Wall Street to know, from where it sits,
which loans are predatory,'' Raines said. But once
``Sullivan-like'' principles are in place and adequately monitored,
he said, Wall Street could refuse to finance any lender that did
not subscribe to those principles.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, where Fannie Mae is a formidable voice, is also
sensitive to the views of Greenspan. And he, too, recently
condemned predatory lending practices.
</P>
<P>
   Although markets have ``vastly expanded credit to virtually all
income classes,'' Greenspan said in a speech on March 22, he was
concerned about ``abusive lending practices that target specific
neighborhoods or vulnerable segments of the population.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has formed a multi-agency study group to explore ways to
address predatory lending, aides to Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's remarks echoed warnings by John D. Hawke Jr., the
comptroller of the currency; Donna Tanoue, chairman of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., and Ellen Seidman, chairman of the Office
of Thrift Supervision.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Seidman will call for public comments on the
problem, the first step in developing new rules.
</P>
<P>
   As for new legislation, Rep. John J. LaFalce, D-N.Y., the
ranking minority member of Leach's committee, is preparing to
submit an anti-predatory lending bill. Leach did not openly support
that effort, but his interest in the issue was encouraging,
consumer advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   The report that the Fed and HUD made to Congress nearly two
years ago provided a road map for new legislation. Its
recommendations included providing clearer and earlier disclosure
of loan fees and loan amounts; prohibiting certain loan terms, like
large balloon payments that force borrowers to refinance their
mortgages; and establishing minimum standards for foreclosures,
which are now governed by state law.
</P>
<P>
   Like Leach, the report called for more active enforcement, but
it also recommended tougher penalties for violating fair-lending
laws, and called for steps to make it easier for consumers to sue
deceptive lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcement of all federal fair-lending laws falls largely on
the Federal Trade Commission, which has recently made lending cases
a top priority, said David Medine, associate director of the
commission's division of consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
   The National Home Equity Mortgage Association, which represents
subprime lenders, has spent at least $300,000 in the last three
years on lobbying efforts in Washington, according to records
assembled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Its allies in the
fight against new anti-predatory lending laws include the Consumer
Mortgage Coalition, representing many large mortgage lenders, which
has spent more than $2.2 million on lobbying since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Both organizations _ and some consumer advocates _ adamantly
oppose Fannie Mae's involvement in the subprime market. Raines says
that such opposition ``only invigorates us,'' but industry
opposition nevertheless could distract Congress from taking
meaningful action.
</P>
<P>
   Even here, though, there are signs of a thaw in the industry's
views.
</P>
<P>
   People in Congress who have recently tested industry sentiment
say they found less uniform resistance in recent weeks. ``They're
divided _ there is some support for a federal law, and there are
others who just aren't decided yet,'' one congressional aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Action would become far more likely, of course, if the mortgage
industry determines that federal legislation is preferable to a
proliferation of strong state laws addressing predatory lending.

 &HT;    Spring training includes lessons in cultural diversity
 &HT;    By Joe Capozzi
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the Atlanta Braves, spring training 2000 was as
much about preparing to beat opposing teams as it was about
learning to respect them.
</P>
<P>
   In group sessions and in one-on-one discussions, the defending
National League champions sat down with a Maryland consultant to
discuss such topics as racism, stereotypes, the O.J. Simpson trial
and what it's like to be a minority in America.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the ground-breaking classes, of course, was John
Rocker, the Atlanta relief pitcher who offended the planet last
December when he disparaged whites, minorities and gays in an
interview with ``Sports Illustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, other teams are tinkering with the idea of making the
so-called ``cultural diversity training'' sessions as much a part
of spring training as batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably something that, for everybody, has long been
overdue,'' said Braves pitcher Tom Glavine, because ``the face of
baseball has changed a lot in the last 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The face of baseball has changed so much that America's national
pastime can be more accurately called the pastime of the Americas
or the pastime of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that in 1950 _ three years after Jackie Robinson became
the first man of color to break into the all-white sport _ roughly
one in 25 major league players on baseball's 16 teams was born
outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are 30 teams. And slightly more than one in every
five players on those rosters is from somewhere other than the
United States. In fact, there are 178 players representing 16
foreign countries and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   All of them bring a myriad of cultures, languages and values
that make each major league clubhouse its own melting pot. While
players share the common language of baseball, the mix of whites,
blacks, Latinos and Asians is producing challenges and problems
both on and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Most teams have recognized the cultural changes and have taken
measures over the years to address them. These are some of the
changes that have taken place:
</P>
<P>
   _ Interpreters, ``player development coordinators'' and
bilingual staff members are increasingly becoming the most valuable
members of a team. Chief among their duties is easing the culture
shock that often scares young minor-league players into leaving
camp, sometimes forcing teams to report the AWOL athletes to the
INS and Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clubs and players are being marketed to fans outside U.S.
borders. Teams have Spanish flagship radio stations to reach
Spanish-speaking listeners, and baseball writers are taking
language classes in an effort to communicate with players.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Braves may extend the cultural diversity sessions to next
season. And managers and executives with several teams, including
the Florida Marlins, one of baseball's most culturally diverse
franchises, say it wouldn't be a bad idea if the classes are
incorporated into their training camps.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees with the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Rocker is not the voice of major league baseball,'' said
first baseman Eric Karros of the Los Angeles Dodgers. ``I think
what's unfair is (that) because one person says that, that doesn't
mean that's what major league baseball players in general feel.
That right there is being stereotypical, which is the basis for
racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it fair for the whole team (to take the classes)? No. One
person made the statements so why does Chipper Jones have to sit
through that. Or (Andres) Galarragas or Brian Jordan?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Jordan, Jones and Galarragas are among the Braves
players who said they were glad they sat through the two-hour
sessions, taught by the Cook Ross consulting firm, whose clients
include the American Red Cross and the Geico insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed it. I found it educational. It caught my ears,''
said pitcher Greg Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   BASEBALL'S CHANGING IDENTITY
</P>
<P>
   ``As we move into the next 10 to 20 years, you're going to see
world baseball. You'll see major league teams in Japan, the
Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Mexico. We are moving in that
direction,'' said General Manager Kevin Malone of the Dodgers, who
have two Russian pitchers in their minor-league camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to not only develop players coming into our
organization but also develop our players to understand those
people. It's really something needed and called for.''
</P>
<P>
   And against that backdrop, this much is certain: John Rocker
might not, as Karros contends, represent the voice of major league
baseball, but he just might represent the voice of a silent
minority around the leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any job there are people with prejudices against people,''
said Marlins third baseman Mike Lowell. ``That's life, society.
Just because we play baseball doesn't mean everyone has nice things
to say about everyone. John Rocker was just willing to say it.''
</P>
<P>
   One expert says baseball isn't doing enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are programs in pockets of teams through their
intervention of Latin America and their baseball academies,'' said
Jose Masso of the Northeastern University's Center for the Study of
Sport in Society. ``But is it enough? No. Should we expand it? Yes.
It would avoid a lot of misinformation and miscommunication in the
world of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Walk into a clubhouse and you'll often see white players hanging
out with whites, and Latinos talking with Latinos. But that often
is a reflection of common values as opposed to ethnic
fractionalization.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican-born slugger Juan Gonzalez of the Detroit Tigers
had plenty to say last month when he accused his former team, the
Texas Rangers, of not treating Latin players well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people working there in Texas don't have good relations
with our cultures, people from different countries, in my
opinion,'' Gonzalez told the Dallas Morning News. Other Latin
players on the Rangers disagreed with Gonzalez's comments.
</P>
<P>
   Even baseball fans have been struggling with the sport's
changing identity _ from the racial slurs screamed at Robinson in
April 1947 to the person who called the sports desk of the
``Arizona Republic'' newspaper during the 1998 Mark McGwire-Sammy
Sosa home-run race to say: ``Allow me to point out, sir, that the
most home-runs-in-a-season title has always been a white man's
title.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's pursuit of Roger Maris' home-run record turned into a
forum for racial identity when the Domincan-born Sosa closed in on
McGwire late that summer.
</P>
<P>
   Whites accused Latino pitchers such as Jose Lima of grooving
pitches to Sosa. Latin fans took note of how the league stopped the
game to celebrate McGwire's 62nd home run but not for Sosa's five
days later.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, some 8,000 Dominican-Americans marched in
Miami to honor Moises Alou, the Dominican-born outfielder for the
Florida Marlins who many thought should have been named the World
Series MVP. That award was given to Cuban-born pitcher Livan
Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Alou recently downplayed the controversy, which some observers
saw as a Dominican-vs-Cuban debate. But Alou owns a 2-year-old race
horse named ``The Real MVP.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlins manager John Boles, a player development guru for more
than a decade, says he has worked with players from enough
different backgrounds to know that ``certain cultures look down on
other cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any difficulties right now, knock on wood,''
said Boles, who would like to see the Marlins offer
cultural-diversity classes. ``What you have to do is really be
aware of people's feelings and if you're a good person, people will
see that and respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   CULTURE SHOCK
</P>
<P>
   Among the most important people within the Marlins organization
is Laurie Soltman, whose title is ``player program development
coordinator.'' Her duties include the underlying charge of helping
minor league players from all over the world make the transition to
the disciplined rigors of professional baseball life. That includes
everything from meeting players at the airport upon their arrival
to teaching English classes after practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've showed them how to turn on the shower, how to use the
commode. If a kid doesn't understand how something works, you show
them. Everything is brand new for some guys,'' Soltman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys show up and they have a duffle bag and they have a
Bible and they have a picture of their mother inside the Bible. And
that's what they bring with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge to every foreign player is the culture
shock _ adjusting to the language, food and lifestyle of another
country. And not all players survive it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can think of so many young guys,'' Soltman said. ``Did they
have the on-field ability? You know what? We didn't even find out
because it was hard to keep them here. They were crazy homesick,
which a lot of guys are. It's really difficult because they don't
feel like there a lot of guys they can really connect with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the hardest thing for me,'' said Cardinals shortstop
Edgar Renteria, a Columbian who broke in with the Marlins.
``Playing baseball is hard, too, but I know how to play baseball. I
didn't know how to speak English.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell, who was born in Puerto Rico and is bilingual, said many
of his minor-league teammates turned to him for help. ``They didn't
know how the American way of things was done. Like paying your
phone bill on time. They didn't understand why it would get shut
off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said many young Latin players are ``the breadwinners of their
families.'' Many are satisfied just to earn a minor-league salary
because it often pays for a year of the family's expenses back
home. ``Sometimes that drive really isn't there to make it to the
big leagues because they are making money.''
</P>
<P>
   LANGUAGE BARRIER
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Lara, a 21-year-old pitcher in the Marlins organization,
laughs when talking about his first year in the Gulf Coast League
when he first left home in the Dominican Republic at the age of 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hungry so I walked to Wendy's behind the (team) hotel. I
saw all the pictures of all the burgers (on the wall menu) and I
said to the girl, 'Can I have number one?' and she said, 'Anything
else?' And I had no idea what she was saying, so I threw my arms up
like I forgot my wallet and I walked back to the hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, while shopping at the Indian River Mall, he would repeat to
himself as he carried his purchases to the cashier: ``Oh, please,
God, don't let her ask any questions. Just take my money.''
</P>
<P>
   Boles said he advocates hiring as many bilingual staff members
as possible. Lean against the batting cage while Venezuelan
shortstop Alex Gonzalez take his cuts and you can hear Marlins
hitting coach Jack Maloof, a Californian, repeat after each swing,
``Bueno! Bueno!''
</P>
<P>
   The most valuable person on the Montreal Expos pitching staff
might be 22-year-old Go Ikeda, an amateur player hired to serve as
the interpreter, roommate and team liaison for Japanese pitcher
Hideki Irabu, a 11-game winner with Yankees last year who will
start third in Montreal's rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without (an) interpreter,'' Irabu said, ``I don't play
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   And without interpreters, many players might just be nameless
faces to fans _ because many baseball writers don't speak a second
language.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball columnist Pedro Gomez of the ``Arizona Republic'' says
that much of the success and popularity of Latin superstars Pedro
Martinez and Sosa can be attributed to their ability to communicate
with American writers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gomez added, players with little grasp of the language
``certainly are not afforded the same courtesy that U.S.-born
players are. I wouldn't say Latins are mistreated but the majority
of the American ballwriters do little to try and learn even a
little about them _ their background, how they grew up, family
situations. Things that really shape the personality.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins are among a growing number of teams that market
themselves to fans from other countries, primarily Hispanics. They
opened Marlins En Miami, a ticket office and merchandise store, in
Miami's Little Havana, and there are weekly Marlins shows on
Spanish television and radio.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres market the team to Mexico, sponsoring bus
caravans from Tijuana. Like the Marlins and Padres, the Arizona
Diamondbacks host weekly pregame festivals at the ballpark geared
toward Latin fans.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some observers watching the major leagues enter the
new millennium would like the sport to take its cultural awareness
measures a step further, eliminating ethnically sensitive names and
images associated with baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The National Coalition on Racism in Sports and the Media is
planning a protest outside Jacobs Field this week against the use
of the team's longtime mascot, Chief Wahoo.
</P>
<P>
   The group would like to eliminate nicknames like the Indians and
Braves. Teams change their uniforms for marketing purposes, the
group says, so why not adopt a more sensitive nickname, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a connection with what John Rocker said and the fact
that he plays for a franchise that actively promotes the tomahawk
chop,'' said Ellen Staurowsky, an associate professor of sports
sociology at Ithaca College.
</P>
<P>
   But she said none of the controversy is necessarily Rocker's
fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Rocker is a product of the society that educated him.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A DIRTY BUSINESS, BUT A BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Had Stephon Marbury remained at Georgia Tech for four long years
and helped keep the departing Bobby Cremins' program afloat, he
would be a rookie now in the National Basketball Association,
greener all over except in the wallet.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Nets' best player was at his dressing stall one
night last week when he was asked if at any time as a millionaire
professional he had found himself sighing, thinking that maybe he'd
moved on too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not once?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not once.''
</P>
<P>
   Much ado _ about nothing _ was made when Marbury, before his
first college game, told a reporter that he might leave college
after his freshman season. Out of the projects in Coney Island,
Marbury has always spoken about the business of basketball with a
no-frills frankness, compared with the intellectual nonsense that
spills from the mouths of university administrators and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I signed to go to Georgia Tech, we were on ESPN 20 times,
instantly,'' Marbury said. ``When you make the tournament, they
just give you money. And then they say a coach can't buy you a
winter coat, even if you grew up in the 'hood and you don't have
one.''
</P>
<P>
   The same stories that are written now about another New York
City point guard, Erick Barkley, formerly of St. John's, were
always whispered about Marbury. He was always said to be getting
one thing, taking another. Cremins once told me that mysterious
characters from Chicago, supposedly part of the crowd that helped
steer Kevin Garnett to the pros, would show up on campus,
unannounced and unwanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who the hell are these guys?'' Cremins said he once asked
Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends of mine,'' Marbury said, leaving the coach nowhere to
go.
</P>
<P>
   The day at Junior's Restaurant in downtown Brooklyn, when
Marbury announced he was turning pro, the agent Eric Fleisher was
already attached to his hip. Fleisher had not long before split
from his brother, Marc, in a litigious feud that fractured a family
made famous in basketball circles by their late father, Larry, the
Marvin Miller of hoops.
</P>
<P>
   Marc and Eric had a nice business going, and then Willis Reed
called one day to recommend a young man who had been a Nets intern
and wanted to learn the agent game. His name was Andy Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The Fleishers took him on, and a couple of years later, Eric
Fleisher was off on his own, Miller tagging along, until Miller
eventually made off with all their clients, creating for Fleisher
another ex-partner to sue.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Marbury was enlisted with David Falk, unofficial
co-commissioner of the NBA. Marbury remembers Miller, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good guy or bad guy?'' he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, he's OK,'' Marbury said, sounding like an Al Gore sound
bite on the character of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury was asked about the telephone calls that Miller
reportedly made to various college players, apparently fished out
of the records of the Eric Fleisher lawsuit against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, that goes on every day,'' Marbury snorted, suggesting
these discoveries were the journalism equivalent of fool's gold.
</P>
<P>
   Miller may have foolishly run afoul of Florida law, but even the
few respectable agents will tell you that contacting players who
are still in college is not only permissible (except in those
states that prohibit it by law) but is standard and mandatory
practice.
</P>
<P>
   The college coaches rail against the agents, but they are such
hypocrites. They have often been accessories to the so-called
crime, steering players to the agent they do personal business
with, and not allowing other agents a chance to sell themselves
when the player decides to turn pro. Is it coincidence that every
John Thompson player of note has left Georgetown with Falk's hand
under his elbow?
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd write the coach and ask for a meeting with the player,''
one agent said the other day. ``They'd say, `You'll get one,' and
then the kid comes out and he's with the agent the coach gets
something from. The agents figure, `If I'm going to speak to this
kid, I'll have to do it myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   So they call, and once they get access, here comes the so-called
financial adviser, who is not governed by the union's agent rules.
Here comes the promise of a prodigious line of credit.
</P>
<P>
   The business is rife with such self-interest and adult-driven
greed, and the student-athlete doesn't have to be dean's list to
know a scam when he sees one. Starting with that $6 billion
television deal in the NCAA's pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they paid the players, they'd stay in school,'' Marbury
said flatly, but that has become a cliche, an unworkable fantasy.
Regardless of what restructuring the NCAA is proposing, the next
significant evolutionary step will be the NBA developmental league.
The industry buzz has David Stern contemplating the two-man game
with Clear Channel, whose sports division is run by Falk, often
referred to by Stern as ``a parasite.''
</P>
<P>
   While a developmental league will certainly lighten the
hypocrisy load, this will remain a dirty game. The agents, already
crawling around the high schools, will infest them. The colleges
could even get desperate and start bidding, like George
Steinbrenner in free-agent heat.
</P>
<P>
   The players will just continue to do what players do, as long as
they are conditioned by people who want something from them. They
will ask, and rightfully so, what's in it for them. And as long as
he's got NBA game, no one will remember Erick Barkley's collegiate
sins, the way no one cares about Marcus Camby's.
</P>
<P>
   They are young men who took a swim in a cesspool and didn't come
out clean. They are the last ones to blame.

IT WAS INEVITABLE: TENNESSEE AND CONNECTICUT  
(JT)

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ There is an air of inevitability to this national
championship game. And the air is electric, charged by the best
rivalry in women's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, the nation's No. 1-ranked team, will play
second-ranked Tennessee for the third time this season. Sunday
night's National Collegiate Athletic Association championship, at
the neutral First Union Center, will be a tie breaker to the
dramatic home-and-home season series the two staged this season.
</P>
<P>
   But on the grand stage, this is the only game that counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that everybody has been waiting for this game,''
Connecticut forward Shea Ralph said, moments after the Huskies
dispatched Penn State, 89-67, in the national semifinals Friday
night. In the earlier semifinal, Tennessee had already defeated
Rutgers, 64-54.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you ask anybody who watches women's basketball,''
Ralph said, ``they probably would have said or put down in their
pocket that UConn and Tennessee would have met in the final game.''
</P>
<P>
   And why not? It was not just the safe pick, but the sentimental
one, too. The rivalry is rather new, yet in just six years, and 10
games, every game in the series has become a showdown, and a
showcase, on national television. If not deciding rankings, the
game has broken home-court winning streaks or determined national
championships.
</P>
<P>
   This season each team stole victory on the other's home court.
Connecticut spoiled Tennessee's home advantage Jan. 8, dominating
the entire game in Knoxville. Then on Groundhog Day, Feb. 2,
Tennessee spoiled Connecticut's perfect season, ending the
back-and-forth thriller with a jumper in the final 4.4. seconds in
Gampel Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Although the teams have met three previous times in the
tournament, the Huskies will play Tennessee in the championship for
the first time since 1995. That year, in Minneapolis, Connecticut
downed the Lady Vols, 70-64, to cap a perfect season and win its
first national title.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies' undefeated run that year, with their personable
star forward, Rebecca Lobo, and gritty point guard Jennifer
Rizzotti, ignited new interest in the women's game, arguably
changing it forever.
</P>
<P>
   The next season, Tennessee downed Connecticut in the national
semifinal game, 88-83 in overtime, in one of the most dramatic
games in Final Four history. The Lady Vols went on to win the
title, their first of three led by the superstar forward Chamique
Holdsclaw, who helped Tennessee go undefeated in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, everyone expected the Lady Vols to win their fourth
straight title, but they faltered in the regional final against
Duke. Connecticut, without the freshman point guard Sue Bird, who
was lost to knee surgery after eight games, sputtered in the
regional semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   That loss to Duke has driven the Lady Vols all season. Bird,
back healthy, has done the same for the Huskies. In their Jan. 8
victory in Knoxville, she had a season-high 25 points, causing
Tennessee Coach Pat Summitt to remark, ``Sue Bird was the
difference-maker.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 2, Bird had 15 points, but Tennessee's junior Semeka
Randall, who averages 21.3 points against Connecticut, hit the
game-winning shots in the final seconds. After the upset, the
Tennessee freshman point guard Kara Lawson mugged for the cameras
and appealed to the poll voters, saying ``We're No. 1,'' while
jabbing her index finger in the air.
</P>
<P>
   But while Tennessee rose from fourth to second in the rankings,
Connecticut never dropped from its No. 1 perch, setting up the
drama for the rematch.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, Lawson and Bird each scored 19 points and had
no turnovers to lead their teams into the final. Both are crucial
to Sunday's outcome, directing their teams' powerful inside games.
Tennessee boasts the national player of the year, the 6-foot-3-inch
junior forward Tamika Catchings, and the 6-5 sophomore Michelle
Snow, while Connecticut counters with its revolving door in the
post: sophomores Tamika Williams, Asjha Jones and Swin Cash.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's roster boasts eight players who were first-team
All-Americans in high school, one player who was All-Canada,
another who was All-Russia. Tennessee has seven first-team
All-Americans from high school.
</P>
<P>
   This national championship features some of the greatest talent
assembled on one court since Michael Jordan practiced alone.
</P>
<P>
   On the sidelines, the teams are led by two of the most visible
and most successful coaches in the country. Tennessee's Pat Summitt
has two best-selling books and six national championships. This
year, Connecticut's Geno Auriemma was the consensus national coach
of the year, winning the honor from the Associated Press on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut (35-1) has won its games more convincingly this
season than Tennessee (33-3), but records may not be consequential
in this series, even at five games apiece. Perhaps there are other
factors.
</P>
<P>
   The game is the same day, April 2, on which UConn won its first
and only championship five years ago. ``It's definitely fate,''
Ralph said. ``It's going to be a big battle. We're prepared, we've
worked hard and we're ready for it.''

MAKING A BIT OF OPENING DAY HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change canceled to called in 1st item and Sam to Sain in
4th item.)

<P>
   Opening day of the baseball season attained ceremonial status in
1910 when President William Howard Taft threw out the first pitch
in Washington. Since then, New York teams have made a bit of
opening day history themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Dodger Blues
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Dodgers lost to the Philadelphia Phillies, 1-0, on
opening day in 1913, in the first regular-season game ever played
at Ebbets Field. The Dodgers' owner, Charles Hercules Ebbets, had
financially overextended himself building the park that bore his
name, and he was soon forced to sell a controlling interest in the
team to the McKeever brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Ebbets died on opening day of the 1925 season. Six days later,
all National League games were called for his funeral. At the
funeral, workers struggled to widen Ebbets' grave because it was
too narrow for his oversize coffin. During the wait, mourners were
soaked by heavy rain. One of them was the club president, Ed
McKeever, who developed pneumonia and died one month later.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx Ballpark
</P>
<P>
   At the Yankee Stadium inaugural in 1923, Babe Ruth slammed the
first home run in its history _ a three-run shot off Howard Ehmke
to help pitcher Bob Shawkey and the Yankees capture a 4-1 victory
over the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   When the renovated Yankee Stadium was unveiled for the 1976 home
opener, Shawkey, now 85, threw out the first ball. The Yanks won
the game, 11-4, but Minnesota Twins outfielder Dan Ford hit the
first homer in the modern Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Inaugural No-Nos
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, the 21-year-old Cleveland Indians fireballer Bob Feller
became the first major league pitcher to throw an opening day
no-hitter when he defeated the Chicago White Sox, 1-0, at Comiskey
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Feller doused many an opening day celebration. At the Yankee
Stadium home opener in 1946, Feller also pitched a 1-0 no-hitter.
The only run was scored by Feller's catcher, Frankie Hayes, who hit
a home run in the top of the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   New York Giants pitcher Red Ames worked nine innings without
allowing a hit in the 1909 opener at the Polo Grounds against the
Brooklyn Dodgers. But Ames surrendered a hit in the 10th and lost
in the 13th when Brooklyn scored three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Barrier Breakers
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 25,000 fans at Ebbets Field for the April 15, 1947,
season opener between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Boston Braves wore
``I'm for Jackie'' buttons, signifying the historic debut of the
first black man to play major league baseball. Although Robinson
went hitless that day in three at-bats against Johnny Sain, the
first of Robinson's 1,382 major league games was a matter of
record.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight years later, Rachel Robinson, his widow, threw out
the ceremonial first pitch on opening day at Municipal Stadium in
Cleveland. Her appearance honored Frank Robinson, whose official
debut that day as baseball's first black manager was a winning one.
As the Indians' player-manager, he stroked a first-inning home run
off Yankees pitcher Doc Medich for his 575th career home run.
</P>
<P>
   The Amazin's
</P>
<P>
   The first game in New York Mets history in 1962 was rained out.
The next morning, the opening day starter, Roger Craig, and a dozen
other Mets were stranded in an elevator for 30 minutes at the Chase
Hotel in St. Louis, where the Mets were to begin the season against
the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' opening day lineup on April 11, 1962, was: Richie
Asburn (cf), Felix Mantilla (ss), Charlie Neal (2b), Frank Thomas
(lf), Gus Bell (rf), Gil Hodges (1b), Don Zimmer (3b), Hobie
Landrith (c), and Roger Craig (p). Craig lasted three innings and
balked in one run. His teammates committed three errors, and the
Mets lost for the first of a record 120 times that season. Talk
about bad omens: the Mets' home opener was played at the Polo
Grounds two days later, on Friday the 13th.
</P>
<P>
   All Hit, No Field
</P>
<P>
   Ron Blomberg made baseball history when he stepped into the
batter's box on opening day in 1973. The Yankees were playing the
Boston Red Sox in Fenway Park when, in the first inning, Blomberg
became the first designated hitter to bat in a major league game.
Blomberg, who faced Boston pitcher Luis Tiant with the bases
loaded, drew a walk and forced in a run. The first major league
plate appearance by a designated hitter was not an official at-bat,
although Blomberg was credited with a run batted in.
</P>
<P>
   What, No Baby Ruth?
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' home opener in 1978 was when Roger Maris ended his
12-year self-exile by returning to the Bronx. In a pregame
ceremony, Maris and Mickey Mantle raised the team's first world
championship flag in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Standard Brands handed out free ``Reggie!''
candy bars as a sales promotion gimmick to the 44,667 fans who
passed through the turnstiles. In the game's first inning, Reggie
Jackson, who had homered on his last three swings of the 1977 World
Series at Yankee Stadium, connected again on his first cut of the
home season, smashing a three-run homer off Chicago's Wilbur Wood
in the Yankees' 4-2 victory over the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   When Reggie took his position in right field to start the second
inning, the fans threw thousands of ``Reggie!'' bars onto the field
in tribute. The game was delayed about five minutes for
groundskeepers to gather the candy.

 &HT;    Studying investor psychology can keep you a jump ahead
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Investors are people, too. Theoretically, that
suggests that understanding investor psychology can give you a
better understanding of market trends.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it can, according to David Hirshleifer of Ohio State
University, whose specialties include investor psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, it seems, suffer human foibles, according to
Hirshleifer. One is that they tend to be overconfident about their
own ability to pick winning stocks. Another is that their
confidence increases more sharply when news supports their thinking
than it decreases when the news is contradictory.
</P>
<P>
   The first human fault helps explain why investors have made the
sky the limit for some technology stocks, says Hirshleifer, who
holds the Ralph Kurtz Chair in Finance in the Fisher College of
Business.
</P>
<P>
   ``People put too much weight on their own analysis,'' he
explained. ``In general, they can either undervalue or overvalue a
stock. People who undervalue may stay away from the stock. People
who overvalue may drive the price to excessive levels.''
</P>
<P>
   That tendency to be too confident _ and overvalue stocks _ can
build on itself because of the second fault, according to
Hirshleifer. ``If people get some good news on a stock, they
overreact. If they get some more news, they overreact even more.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, people tend to downplay news that runs
counter to their thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``If some disconfirming news comes in, people say that was
`random noise,''' Hirshleifer said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the weight of contradictory news overcomes the hubris
and a stock should return to a price level commensurate with
available information, or so the theory goes. Before that happens,
investors can take advantage of human nature, Hirshleifer thinks.
One way, he said, ``is to play the momentum game.''
</P>
<P>
   Momentum investing involves buying stocks that are rising, not
because of any fundamentals behind the stocks but simply because
they are going up. The idea that stock prices swing too much one
way or the other because of overconfidence on the part of investors
suggests stocks that are going up should continue to rise for some
period, presenting an investment opportunity. But how does an
investor figure when to cash out?
</P>
<P>
   No one can make that call. But there are a couple of things to
keep in mind, Hirshleifer says. ``If a stock has been going up, the
more it's been overvalued, and the longer, the riskier the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sign to watch for is a slowing of momentum, he added.
``If you see the stock flattening out, that's a good hint you might
want to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another option is to take a contrarian view and go against
the grain.
</P>
<P>
   One way is to watch the short interest in stocks, Hirshleifer
proposes. Short interest is the proportion of shares that have been
borrowed and then sold, with the expectation that a stock will
decline. If the stock falls, the short seller can replace the
borrowed stock at a lower price than for what it was sold and
pocket the difference.
</P>
<P>
   If overconfidence can send stocks too high, it also can send
stocks too low, according to a theory, proposed in 1998 by
Hirshleifer, Kent Daniel of Northwestern University and Avanidhar
Subrahmanyam of UCLA, that stocks with high short interest may get
beaten down too much.
</P>
<P>
   The three suggested that small stocks, in terms of market value,
are good models for testing their theory, since there's less
outside information to contradict the thinking of overconfident
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stocks that are low in market value are probably stocks that
overconfident investors have become pessimistic about,'' said
Hirshleifer, ``which may create an opening for contrarians to
benefit from an upward correction.''

HOUSE GOP RENEWS CALL FOR MEASURE TO OVERHAUL TAX SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas)  (jw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans in the House proposed legislation
Saturday to help taxpayers in their dealings with the Internal
Revenue Service, and called for hearings this month on developing
an entirely new tax system.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, said the proposed legislation was intended to build on
changes made in 1998, when Congress granted taxpayers broad new
protections in their dealings with the tax service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our new Taxpayer Bill of Rights will help protect taxpayer
privacy, level the playing field between taxpayers and the IRS, and
take at least some small steps to help simplify the process of
paying taxes,'' Archer said in the weekly Republican radio address.
</P>
<P>
   To help assure the confidentiality of taxpayer records, the
legislation would require states with access to federal tax
information to do more to protect their computer systems against
unauthorized access, and would require the IRS to notify taxpayers
immediately if their tax information is obtained illegally by a
third party.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would bar the IRS from imposing taxes on interest
payments it makes to taxpayers, and would stop the tax agency from
imposing interest charges as penalties in cases where the IRS had
made a mistake or caused an unreasonable delay. It would provide a
way for taxpayers to avoid a rapid buildup of interest charges in
disputes with the tax service.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also includes provisions to ensure that banks
and other lenders keep confidential any tax information they
receive in verifying a customer's credit worthiness, to simplify
estimated tax calculations and to speed decisions about
organizations seeking tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   Archer did not provide an estimate on the cost of the changes,
but his aides said it would run into billions of dollars over a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials gave Archer's proposals a muted
welcome. ``While we have concerns about some of Chairman Archer's
suggestions, we agree with many of them,'' Secretary of the
Treasury Lawrence Summers said in a statement. ``We are committed
to strengthening taxpayer rights and we will continue to work with
Congress and the IRS to ensure that taxpayers receive the best
service possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican initiative was timed to coincide with the season
in which voters are most involved in preparing their tax returns,
and to broaden the political debate over taxes, in Washington and
in the presidential campaign, to include the very nature of the tax
system, not just whether the nation wants a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax code is too complicated and confusing, and we'd like
to get the IRS out of the lives of American taxpayers,'' Archer
said.
</P>
<P>
   He has long been a proponent of scrapping the progressive income
tax system and replacing it with an alternative, like a national
sales or consumption tax, or a single-rate flat tax on income.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is popular among many Republicans in Congress, and
among many grass-roots conservatives. But it has never gained much
traction in Washington, in part because such a change would be
costly, technically difficult and certain to bring protest from
groups that would lose tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   To generate some interest in the subject, Archer said he would
hold hearings this month to examine proposals for a national sales
tax, a flat tax and other ideas.

PENNSYLVANIA RACE SPUTTERS TO A CLOSE  
 PRO-BUSH GOVERNOR WANTS TO LEAD MCCAIN'S DELEGATES  
 NADER KEEPS BEING NADER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Ohio, Mass.)  (mk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The way Pennsylvania Democrats figure it, Sen. Rick Santorum, a
freshman Republican up for re-election this fall, is vulnerable,
perhaps as vulnerable as any Republican senator running. They see
him as too conservative for Pennsylvania and too brash to be a good
fit in the staid U.S. Senate, and they always point out that he was
elected in 1994 by a wispy margin of just 2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats have a problem of their own in this contest.
</P>
<P>
   Their best prospects for taking on Santorum _ among them Edward
G. Rendell, the former Philadelphia mayor, and Bob Casey Jr., the
state auditor _ took a pass, leaving six lesser-known Democrats to
duke it out for the party's nomination. The primary is on Tuesday,
and by just about any measure the campaign, even though capped with
a series of debates, has hardly been the riveting kind needed to
give the eventual nominee a running start at Santorum.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the final weekend of campaigning, polls indicated two
of every five voters had not decided how they were going to vote,
an unusually high number. Further, only one of every three voters
felt that Santorum, who has moderated both his conservatism and
brashness, should be replaced in November.
</P>
<P>
   So come Tuesday, who is likely to win the nod to take on the
senator?
</P>
<P>
   The polls found three of the six candidates totally out of the
running, pulling less than 10 percent of the vote combined. The
remaining three _ Rep. Ron Klink, state Sen. Allyson Schwartz and
Tom Foley, a former state labor secretary _ were locked in a tight
contest, with Klink holding a slight edge.
</P>
<P>
   None of the candidates has been able to raise the money needed
to blitz the state with television ads (Santorum has raised more
cash, $6 million, than all the Democrats combined). No compelling
issue has dominated the campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Klink is from the 4th Congressional District in western
Pennsylvania, a part of the state that usually has a heavier
turnout than elsewhere, and he has significant backing from labor
and fellow Pennsylvania Democrats in Congress. Schwartz comes from
Philadelphia, which also has a big vote, and she has the backing of
a number of women's organizations. Foley comes from the Harrisburg
area and, having been state labor secretary, is competing hard with
Klink for the labor vote.
</P>
<P>
   Best bet, as the political pros see things: a tossup on Tuesday,
a slight lean toward Republican in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush Loyalist in McCain Country
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Dee Hull of Arizona raised some eyebrows, and hackles,
early in the presidential primary season when she sided with Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas rather than her fellow Arizonan, Sen. John
McCain. She even volunteered to run Bush's primary campaign in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won easily and therefore ``owns'' all 30 of the state's
delegates to the national convention in Philadelphia. But Hull says
she nevertheless wants the state Republican Party to pick her to
lead the delegation to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   That is the ``standard role'' all governors play at conventions,
she argues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very definitely I would want to be the chairman,'' she told
The Arizona Republic last week. ``My feeling is that's the way we
proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   She insisted that she was not looking for a fight with McCain
and would probably defer if he or other party leaders strongly
objected.
</P>
<P>
   Still, The Republic reported that behind the scenes, the
governor was ``assiduously cultivating allies.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a politician with a tit-for-tat reputation, deserved or
not, did not have any immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   Nader Keeps Running
</P>
<P>
   Since he came on the national scene in the 1960s as a critic of
the auto industry, Ralph Nader has tried ceaselessly to elevate the
consciousness of corporate America. And as he enters the second
month of his second run for president under the Green Party banner,
he is still trying _ making no more progress now, it appears, than
in 1994 (1 percent of the vote) but laying down vintage Nader stuff
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   In Toledo, Ohio, last week, he went after DaimlerChrysler and
city officials for striking a deal that, as he darkly saw it,
resulted in the use of hard-earned tax dollars to roust scores of
helpless citizens from their humble homes so that room could be
made to build a Jeep plant.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, Nader charged, was ``one of the most extreme,
one-sided deals ever given to a gluttonous corporation'' _ a charge
that led Mayor Carleton S. Finkbeiner to call him an untruthful
``demagogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Whereupon Nader countered that somebody should get a bar of soap
and wash out ``the mayoral mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days earlier, while in Boston, Nader threw all
rational political caution out the window and went after two sacred
Beantown icons: the Red Sox and Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   The ballclub, he said, should renovate venerable Fenway and its
Green Monster wall with private money and stop pressuring the state
and city to invest $600 million in a new park.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win a World Series,'' he said of the hapless Sox, ``they
don't need new sky boxes populated by gluttonous financiers
freeloading on the backs of hard-working taxpayers.''

 &HT;    PHYS ED TEACHERS FIGHT AGAINST OBSOLESCENCE
 &HT;    630&AMP;adds. With PHYS-ED-POLL and PHYS-ED-WEB.
 &HT;    For release Sunday, April 2.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Embattled physical education teachers are
leading an uphill struggle to reverse the gradual disappearance of
their classes from American schools.
</P>
<P>
   With fewer than 30 percent of high school students now taking
daily phys ed classes, many worry that the lack of activity could
be making the next generation of American adults less healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the U.S. Marine Corps boot camp at Parris Island,
S.C., reported that while its new recruits are ``smarter and more
mentally agile,'' they ``do not have the physical fitness
foundation of their predecessors.''
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Education reported in January that
nearly 80 percent of the 1 million students tested in grades 5, 7
and 9 failed to meet minimum standards on the ``Fitnessgram,'' a
simple, widely used test. For example, many could not reach back
with one hand over their shoulder and the other under their elbow
and touch fingertips behind their back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're paying a tremendous price for the rollback in
physical education,'' Surgeon General David Satcher told the
convention of the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education,
Recreation and Dance here last month. ``One of the greatest
contributions you can make to an adult's health is to get them
started as a child on a lifetime of physical activity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that at least 300,000 people die each year in this
country because of physical inactivity and poor nutrition, which go
together,'' he said. ``Others become unnecessarily dependent on
others in their old age.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,000 physical educators who convened here with
scholars and business leaders agreed that as a first step to
reverse the trend, they will try to convince Congress to adopt the
Physical Education for Progress bill.
</P>
<P>
   The PEP bill would authorize grants of $400 million over five
years to local school systems for equipment, support, curriculum
development and training of staffs and teachers for physical
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just to keep the next generation from becoming
obese,'' the bill's sponsor, Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said in
his Washington office. ``The kids who are causing all this violence
and bullying, they're not getting the organized physical activity
where you let off steam and learn about things like waiting your
turn and not winning all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, the powerful chairman of the Senate Appropriations
Committee, will offer the bill as an amendment to the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act when it reaches the Senate floor by
early May. While Stevens has 18 Senate co-sponsors for the bill,
opposition by fiscal conservatives makes its prospects uncertain,
supporters said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Republican, but there's a group of Republicans _ they're
very bull-headed _ they say they don't want to have any new
legislation on anything,'' lamented Jim Baugh, president of Wilson
Sporting Goods Co. He said he had personally visited 20 senators on
behalf of the PEP bill.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill does become law and then obtains funding, it would
be the first new federal law on physical education since 1989. But
while such a victory would be a morale-booster for physical
educators, financially it would be only a drop in the bucket _ an
average of about $1,125 a year for each of the nation's 88,000
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   So over the long haul, the physical educators and their allies
hope to revise state and local priorities. They want the United
States to continue producing world-class athletes. But they are
more concerned about the vast bulk of our children who grow up
indifferent to physical activity, passive sports fans more
comfortable on the couch than on the field.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   At their Orlando convention, physical educators were bombarded
with warnings that physical education could follow driver's
education out of the public schools and into the world of
pay-your-own-way luxury.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all baby boomers were required to take physical education
throughout their school years, when policy-makers still recalled
the appalling levels of physical fitness that hampered recruiting
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Those who enjoyed physical education then are among its
strongest supporters now. But it is not unusual for a school board
or legislature to be dominated by boomers who hated those
military-style gym classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in that age group, so I know what too many decision-makers
are remembering _ the single row, the roll calls, competition,
calisthenics, getting picked last,'' said Jennifer Reeves of
Tucson, who taught physical education to children for 20 years
before moving to the University of Arizona to teach physical
educators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many of them don't know that now we're exposing children
to a variety of skills and activities that they can use and enjoy
all of their life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the suspension of the military draft in the Nixon
administration, state enforcement of mandatory physical education
laws began to slack off.
</P>
<P>
   Classes became shorter and rarer. Waivers allow many students to
substitute varsity sports, cheerleading, or music, or work on the
school newspaper or Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Market research by the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association
indicates that participation fell below 70 percent in the 1980s and
below 60 percent in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The decline is especially steep after children leave sixth
grade, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control:
</P>
<P>
   _ Though 42 percent of high school students were taking daily
physical education in 1991, that had dropped to 27 percent by 1997.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only 17 percent of middle schools and 2 percent of high
schools required all students to take daily physical education in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois, cited in 1997 as the only state still vigorously
enforcing a strict physical education mandate for all students in
all grades, now has joined the 49 who slacked off. Chicago school
officials estimate that they will save $16 million a year as the
result of a recent court decision approving their plan to change
physical education to an elective in 11th and 12th grades.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Those who are unswayed by the concerns of Satcher about health,
Stevens about violence or the Marines about finding fit recruits
might be impressed by the potential economic losses, suggested
Gudrun Doll-Tepper, president of the International Council on Sport
Science and Physical Education.
</P>
<P>
   Her nonprofit council's worldwide study, financed by the
International Olympic Committee and released last November,
established that ``every dollar invested in physical education
saves $3.20 in medical costs.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, firms ranging from ski resorts to wholesalers of
athletic footwear lose potential sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Britain, for example, the leisure industry employes far
more people than the car industry,'' said Margaret Talbot,
president of International Girls and Women in Sports and Physical
Education. When her group mentioned that to British parents and
education officials, ``that woke them up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. decline reflects a global trend, according to the
international report. The experts concluded that in almost all
countries:
</P>
<P>
   _ Physical education requirements that exist on paper are feebly
enforced.
</P>
<P>
   _ Much time is wasted in talking instead of activity in physical
education classes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most teachers in the primary grades have very little training.
</P>
<P>
   _ Morale among professional physical educators is low.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot said the good news is that new approaches are probably
more important than higher spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a lot to learn from less developed countries,
because of the way they deliver with almost nothing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best physical education classes I ever saw was in
Buenos Aires, Argentina, with 45 children and one balloon,'' she
said. ``The children were active and involved and learning and
enjoying themselves, and that is teaching at its very best.''

<P>
   Schools aren't providing as much physical education as most
adults and teenagers want, judging from a national poll by the
National Association for Sport and Physical Education:
</P>
<P>
   _ 81 percent of adults and 71 percent of teens agreed that
``daily physical education should be mandatory in schools.''
</P>
<P>
   _ 47 percent of teens said they don't have a daily phys ed
class.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teens split among 47 percent who said they have ``the right
amount'' of physical education, 42 percent who said they would take
``more'' if available, and 9 percent who said they would take
``less'' if possible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teens said what they like most about phys ed class are the
opportunity to have exercise (20 percent), getting fit (18
percent), having fun (16 percent) and the activities offered (16
percent). Only 6 percent said they don't like anything.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teens said what they dislike most about phys ed class are
running (13 percent), boring activities (9 percent) and undressing
and dressing for class (7 percent).
</P>
<P>
   _ Adults who believe they are not getting enough physical
activity blamed their job (33 percent), lack of interest or
motivation (27 percent), lack of time (19 percent) or health
problems (13 percent).
</P>
<P>
   _ Teens who believe they are not getting enough physical
activity blamed lack of time (24 percent), doing homework (19
percent) and lack of interest or motivation (13 percent).
</P>
<P>
   _ Adults who think their own children aren't getting enough
physical activity blamed lack of interest or motivation (24
percent), lack of time (13 percent) and watching television (13
percent).
</P>
<P>
   The phone poll of 1,017 adults and 500 teens aged 12 to 17 was
conducted Feb. 3-7 by Opinion Research Corp. International of
Princeton, N.J. The margin of sampling error was 3 percent for all
adults, and 4 percent for the teens and for the parents (those
within the adult group who had children 6 to 17).

MESSAGES FROM THE DIM PAST TO THE HAZY FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)  (jw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH HADLEY, Mass. _ Over the century, the box sat quietly in
the Mount Holyoke College library, then in the comptroller's
office, then on a shelf in the school archives, and finally on the
dorm room floor of Sara Hines, president of the class of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Hines had little idea what was in the oak box, which measured a
little more than a foot on each side. A plaque on the top described
it as a legacy from the class of 1900 to its sisters in the class
of 2000. As she prepared the box for the cracking-open ceremony on
Friday night, Hines said that it did not much matter what was in
the box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the class of 2000 feels special that a group of
women 100 years ago were waiting for us and anticipating our
arrival,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to time capsules, it is the thought that counts.
The term ``time capsule'' did not exist in 1900, and sealing up
mementos for future generations was not as commonplace as it is
today, and the box avoided the fate of most time capsules: stolen,
misplaced or just plain forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a list of human frailty,'' said Paul Hudson,
co-founder of the International Time Capsule Society at Oglethorpe
University in Atlanta. ``People are so excited about it as they do
it, but they forget about it almost the day after it's sealed.''
</P>
<P>
   To be accurate, the Mount Holyoke box was lost, or at least
overlooked, for about 20 years, after the college remodeled the
library in the 1960s. An employee in the comptroller's office
stumbled across it in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called me from the college and said, `What's this?'''
said Ruth Craig Morales, a Mount Holyoke alumna from Northampton,
Mass. ``It has your name on it.''
</P>
<P>
   She and two of her classmates were named trustees of the capsule
at their graduation in 1950. The phone call reminded her of that
forgotten responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   She was on hand for the ceremony on Friday, as was Peter Carini,
Mount Holyoke's archives director, who was taking all the
excitement over the box with reservation. After all, squirreling
away historical mementos goes against his professional creed. ``The
problem with time capsules is that they are inaccessible for
hundreds of years, so they sort of defeat the purpose of
archivers,'' Carini said.
</P>
<P>
   He joked that opening the box would free space on his shelves,
but deep down he was impressed. In 1896, two weeks into their
freshman year, the class of 1900 saw the main building on campus
destroyed by fire. ``They had the idea that this oak box would last
100 years, and yet they had seen the college burn to the ground in
their lifetime,'' Carini said. If nothing else, they were an
optimistic lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think about the class of 2000, a group of women they were
never going to meet, a group of women they had no connection to, I
find that really interesting. That intrigues me much more than even
the contents.''
</P>
<P>
   A time capsule is not the strangest thing the college has handed
down through the years. Only alumnae can understand the ceremony of
Founder's Day, when trustees rise at dawn to serve ice cream to
students at Mary Lyon's gravesite.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Holyoke student life is a calendar of traditions. In the
fall, students take off from classes to experience nature on
Mountain Day, and don white and carry branches for the Laurel
Parade in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful to think that for the last 160 years, women
have been doing these same things,'' Hines said. ``And if they
haven't been doing them for 160 years, people like to think that
they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of students, alumnae and their families turned out for
the opening of the box. Some thought the box would hold letters of
inspiration; others thought it might turn out to be a big April
Fool's joke. But after the speeches, the class officers removed the
wooden lid, they found the one thing none of them expected: another
box, a black metal box that was soldered tight.
</P>
<P>
   So to a century of anticipation was added another 20 minutes,
while people from the audience hammered away at the stubborn box
with a mallet and putty knife. Hines entertained the crowd by
reading headlines from the newspapers that lined the wooden box,
among them: the birth of the czarina's fourth daughter and the
recovery of Ida McKinley, the first lady, from a recent illness.
</P>
<P>
   The foremothers had enclosed, among other bits of nostalgia, a
beret with the school name, a ticket from a school play and a faded
paper blue book used for ``examinatories,'' the kind that brought
groans of familiarity from the students. There was also a class
photo with the assertion, ``We are really much better looking than
it will give you reason to suppose.''
</P>
<P>
   A letter read: ``We believe that some of the many reforms seen
by us only in the hazy future of the world, and longed for with the
force of a somewhat impatient optimism, will be records of history
to you.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's graduating class plans to use the box for its own
time capsule, to be opened in 2100.

ZIMBABWE PROTESTERS BEATEN BY GOVERNMENT SUPPORTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ A peaceful anti-government march in
Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, erupted in violence Saturday as a
group of armed men wielding machetes and clubs attacked the crowd
of several thousand marchers, leaving several people seriously
injured.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 men, who were described by witnesses as supporters of
President Robert Mugabe, hurled bricks and stones and beat several
protesters bloody until riot policemen intervened with tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine people were hospitalized, according to a spokesman
for the National Constitutional Assembly, an umbrella group of
civic organizations, which organized the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers, some of whom wore T-shirts bearing the name of
Mugabe's governing party, seemed determined to go after the handful
of whites in the overwhelmingly black crowd, marchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were wielding machetes, stones, sticks, and they just
charged at the peaceful marchers,'' said Brian Kagoro, the
spokesman for the NCA, who witnessed the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was screaming,'' Kagoro said in a telephone interview
from Harare. ``Some people were too old to run. Some had crutches.
It was mayhem. It was absolute chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   The clash between Mugabe supporters and opponents came as
Zimbabwe braces for its most heated election since independence in
1980. Mugabe's party, known as ZANU-PF, has governed for 20 years,
but faces its most serious challenge ever in the parliamentary
election, now scheduled for May.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, scattered incidents of political violence have
been reported around the country. Last Sunday, one opposition party
member was killed by armed men after a political rally in the town
of Bindura, opposition party officials say.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, fights between opposition party members and
supporters of Mugabe left 16 people injured in the town of Kwekwe,
according to Zimbabwe's state-controlled newspaper, The Herald.
Twenty opposition members were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's march was organized to call for peace in the country
and to protest the recent invasions of white-owned farms by black
squatters.
</P>
<P>
   About 800 white-owned farms have been invaded and occupied in
recent weeks. The invasions follow the stunning rejection last
month of a draft constitution that would have allowed Mugabe to
seize white-owned land without compensation. About 4,000 white
farmers own more than half of Zimbabwe's most fertile land.
</P>
<P>
   The police had tried to prevent Saturday's march from taking
place, organizers said. But the demonstrators obtained a court
order on Friday barring the police from interfering with the
protest. And several thousand people showed up to voice their
dissatisfaction with the government.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The marchers, who walked peacefully through downtown Harare on
Saturday morning, carried posters and signs that read ``Peace
Now.''
</P>
<P>
   The police had set up cordons to separate the marchers from
Mugabe's supporters, but the latter managed to get through, Kagoro
said. He said the police had taken no action to prevent the armed
men from approaching the demonstrators until the violence occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own thought is that Mugabe was trying to create chaos,'' he
said. ``He wants an excuse to move in against his opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for Mugabe denied that the government had
orchestrated the attacks. The spokesman, George Charamba, said the
demonstrators knew violence might erupt because veterans of the
1970s independence war were in town. Kagoro and other marchers
described the assailants as war veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why the police were very reluctant to allow the
march,'' Charamba said in a telephone interview from Harare. ``When
the NCA organizes a public march, they are responsible for an
orderly outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe's second city, Bulawayo, a march of about 4,000
people passed without incident.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the last rally organized by the National
Constitutional Assembly _ in support of the ``no'' vote against the
proposed constitution _ was broken up by riot policemen using tear
gas.

 &HT;    GOP targets Gore fund-raising
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a hastily called news conference on March 3,
1997, Vice President Al Gore uttered words that have come back to
haunt him repeatedly in the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to news reports that he solicited campaign
contributions from his White House office, Gore said, ``My counsel
advises me _ let me repeat _ that there is no controlling legal
authority that says that any of these activities violated any
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) jumped on the
legalistic response and incorporated it into this presidential
stump speech. ``I'm going to give Al Gore controlling legal
authority,'' McCain told audiences. ``And then I'm going to beat
him like a drum and send him back to Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas also has picked up on the phrase in
his speeches and, in the same breath, drops in a mention of
``Buddhist temples,'' a reference to the controversial fund-raiser
Gore attended in California in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's ``no controlling legal authority'' response and the
Buddhist temple event are sure to find their way into television
commercials this fall. The Republican National Committee already
provides visitors to its Web site (www.rnc.org) streaming video of
the temple fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   To the singsong cadence of Asian music, viewers can watch Gore
glide past robed monks in the regal courtyard of the Hsi Lai Temple
in Hacienda Heights, Calif., and accept a small Buddha statue from
the temple's grandmaster.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC site also has a ``photo album'' of Gore with Maria Hsia,
who helped Gore raise money for his 1990 Senate campaign and
organized the temple fund-raising event. Hsia was recently
convicted of campaign fraud in connection with some $100,000 given
to the Democratic National Committee and Democratic candidates from
temple monks and nuns, who were illegally reimbursed for their
donations.
</P>
<P>
   But while the pictures may make for damaging political
advertising, the facts surrounding the temple fund-raiser and
Gore's White House fund-raising calls escape easy packaging. No
one, for example, has suggested that Gore himself knew that Hsia, a
Los Angeles immigration consultant, was hitting up Buddhist
monastics for illegal contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's most serious brush with the law had nothing to do with
the temple, but rather concerned 45 phone calls that he made from
his office to big Democratic donors. Those calls risked running
afoul of a 19th-century law, updated in 1980, that prohibits
federal officials from soliciting campaign contributions inside
federal buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Gore exposed himself to further problems when the Justice
Department launched a subsequent inquiry into whether he had been
truthful in telling investigators what he knew about the phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Both the phone calls and the temple fund-raiser fit into a much
larger story of the 1996 elections. Gore, an active participant in
his own re-election, was an enthusiastic participant in the
Democratic Party's no-holds-barred effort to raise millions for the
1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing his vulnerability, Gore last week pledged to make
campaign finance reform his top priority. He told voters in
Milwaukee that a ban on unregulated soft money contributions to the
political parties, the type of money he sought in 1996 and
continues to raise in 2000, would be his first piece of domestic
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know firsthand what is wrong with the way we fund political
campaigns,'' Gore said. ``My commitment to changing America's
campaign finance laws is both personal and profound.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Gore had attended an event at a tax-exempt
religious institution first made news three weeks before the 1996
elections. Republican nominee Bob Dole picked up on the report,
accusing Clinton and the Democrats of cycling contributions through
their own ``Laundromat.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the details surrounding the fund-raiser, however, did
not emerge until the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, chaired
by Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.), began investigating campaign
finance abuses in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser was organized by Hsia and John Huang, a former
DNC fund-raiser who since has pleaded guilty to a federal
conspiracy charge. Gore was invited to the temple by its
grandmaster, Hsing Yun, whom he had met on a visit to Taiwan in
1989. Gore traveled to Taiwan at the invitation of Hsia, who was
helping Gore raise money for his 1990 Senate campaign, and a group
of Asian-Americans with ties to the temple.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia remained active in raising money for the Democrats and
arranged for Hsing Yun to meet briefly with Gore at the White House
on March 15, 1996. At that meeting, Hsing Yun invited Gore to visit
the Hsi Lai Temple, the largest Buddhist temple in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia and Huang later said that they planned to hold the
fund-raiser at a separate location, and that Gore would visit the
temple afterward. But because of scheduling, they combined the two
events.
</P>
<P>
   Senate investigators never found substantial evidence to support
the claim that the events were to have been separate.
</P>
<P>
   MONASTICS WERE SHAM DONORS
</P>
<P>
   Gore arrived at the temple shortly after noon on April 29. A
local school band played in the courtyard as Gore, wearing a flower
necklace, passed by scores of monks and nuns clad in saffron robes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore met privately with Hsing Yun before having lunch with about
120 people, some from the temple and some local business people who
had received invitations from Hsia and Huang. Gore spoke briefly.
He did not thank anyone for contributions, as he typically would
have done at a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the crimes committed at the temple occurred after Gore
left. When DNC fund-raisers in Washington expressed disappointment
that the luncheon had raised only $45,000, Hsia and Huang set out
to make up the shortfall, according to Senate investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Using her contacts at the temple, where she often helped
devotees with immigration problems, Hsia persuaded monks and nuns
to make additional contributions totaling $55,000. Those
contributions later were reimbursed from the temple's general fund,
breaking campaign laws.
</P>
<P>
   In investigating the temple, investigators found other
fund-raisers at which the temple's monastics had made illegal
contributions to the DNC, the Clinton-Gore campaign and the
campaigns of other prominent Democrats, including Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy (D-Mass.).
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors ultimately declined to prosecute the monks
and nuns themselves, saying they were unwitting pawns, and instead
focused on Hsia. Hsia was convicted March 2 of five counts of
causing the DNC to file false contribution reports with the Federal
Election Commission. The federal judge presiding over the case,
however, still has reserved the right to dismiss the charges and
has not yet entered the conviction into the court record.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the biggest unanswered question about the
event is what Gore knew about it beforehand. Gore at first said he
thought it was ``community outreach,'' but later admitted he knew
it was ``finance-related.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate investigators, however, uncovered batches of internal
correspondence in the files of Gore's senior staff that referred to
the event as a ``fund-raiser.'' Don Fowler, then chairman of the
DNC, also attended the event, as well as Hsia and Huang, who were
known to Gore as fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite his various denials, the vice president was well aware
that the event was one designed to raise money for his party,''
Senate investigators concluded in their lengthy summary of the
affair.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising phone calls Gore made from his White House
office, raising about $795,000 for the DNC, were far more
problematic for the vice president because of the 117-year-old law
prohibiting federal employees from soliciting campaign
contributions from federal property.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Gore said he did not believe the law applied to him
or the president because they were candidates. But the case turned
on the arcane details of federal campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno declined to pursue an investigation
into the calls on the grounds that Gore was raising unregulated
``soft money,'' not ``hard money'' governed by federal election
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Later, however, investigators found that donations from five
people called by Gore were deposited into hard money accounts. The
DNC explained that its procedure was to deposit the first $20,000
of every soft money contribution into a hard money account if the
donor had not already reached the $20,000 hard money limit set by
law.
</P>
<P>
   After Reno opened a preliminary inquiry, Gore told investigators
he was ignorant of the DNC's method of splitting contributions and
said he believed he was raising only soft money. Reno declined to
appoint an independent counsel in December 1997, saying there was
nothing to suggest that Gore would have known about the split
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The matter might have ended there, but a memo from one of Gore's
senior aides surfaced in the summer of 1998. Handwritten notes by
David Strauss, then Gore's deputy chief of staff, described a Nov.
21, 1995, meeting attended by Gore during which the practice of
splitting contributions was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   The memo was also significant because it portrayed Gore as an
enthusiastic participant in the DNC's overall fund-raising program
of wooing donors with White House coffees and special access to the
administration. At the meeting, Gore volunteered to make more
fund-raising calls than the DNC proposed and was quoted as saying,
``Count me in on the calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on Strauss' memo, Reno opened a second inquiry into
whether Gore had been truthful about what he knew. Investigators
quizzed Gore closely about the 1995 meeting. Gore said he could not
recall what was said. He noted that he usually sat next to Clinton
during such meetings and that the two frequently talked among
themselves while the meeting was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also volunteered that he drank lots of iced tea,
necessitating frequent bathroom breaks. Republican operatives have
seized on this aspect of his testimony and dubbed it the ``tinkle
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   RENO: INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, Reno concluded that there was insufficient
evidence to conclude that Gore lied about the fund-raising calls,
closing the case.
</P>
<P>
   Still more information exists, however, that could prove
damaging to Gore this year. FBI Director Louis Freeh urged Reno in
a memo to name an independent counsel. Congressional Republicans
are pressing Reno to release the memo.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, parts of a memo written by Charles LaBella, who for
a time headed the Justice Department's campaign finance task force,
were leaked to the Los Angeles Times. LaBella's memo, also
addressed to Reno, criticized career Justice Department lawyers for
not holding Gore and other senior White House officials to a higher
standard.
</P>
<P>
   The memo also expressed skepticism about Gore's contention that
he did not know what kind of money he was raising in his White
House fund-raising calls. Justice department officials vigorously
disputed LaBella's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore's campaign labels the temple fund-raiser and the
fund-raising calls ``old news,'' Gore himself addressed the
subjects in an interview in the New York Times on March 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake going to that Buddhist temple,'' Gore said.
``I made a mistake in making telephone calls from my office. And I
have learned from those mistakes.''

MRS. CLINTON OPPOSES RESIDENCY STATUS FOR CUBAN BOY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla. N.Y.)   (See also CUBAN-BOY) 
(jw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton said Saturday that she opposed
legislation _ backed by Vice President Al Gore and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani _ that would grant Elian Gonzalez permanent resident
status and prevent the United States from returning the boy to his
father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton disclosed her position a day after Giuliani said he
strongly opposed returning the 6-year-old boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who is running against Clinton for senator from New
York, said he supported congressional legislation that would grant
Elian permanent resident status, allowing him to remain in the
United States while a family court, rather than immigration
officials, determines whether he should be returned to his father
or allowed to remain with relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's mother died at sea while bringing her son from Cuba to
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani made his remarks a day after Gore broke with the
Clinton administration and backed the bill. The mayor was
attempting to put Clinton in a position of either siding with her
husband or with Gore on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of consideration, Clinton sided with the president
on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Special congressional intervention at this point would only
further politicize and delay this situation,'' her spokesman,
Howard Wolfson, said in a statement issued Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the interest of Elian's well being, we should all be
working together to resolve this case as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as she opposed the bill, Clinton did not specifically say
whether she agreed that Elian should be returned home.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said that Clinton wanted to see the case proceed through
normal immigration channels, which would in all likelihood result
in the boy's being returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson accused Giuliani of trying to exploit the situation for
his political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for Rudy Giuliani to stop turning this young boy
into a political football,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce J. Teitelbaum, Giuliani's campaign manager, responded:
``Give me a break. It seems that everyone has taken a clear
position on Elian, from President Clinton to Rudy Giuliani, to the
entire New York City congressional delegation. Only Mrs. Clinton is
ducking the issue.''

N.J. COLUMN: CANDIDATE LEARNS THE PERILS OF AD-LIBBING THE
ONE-LINERS 
</HEADLINE>
 -NYT  (jw) 
 By MATT PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Jon S. Corzine, the former chairman of Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co., entered the race for the U.S. Senate from New Jersey
with the best campaign money could buy. Generous contributions
endeared him to local politicians. Big checks bought him more
advertising than Priceline.com. He hired President Clinton's
pollsters. Ted Kennedy's media adviser. Two campaign managers. A
squad of consultants and aides.
</P>
<P>
   If only he had hired a joke writer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Corzine left spontaneity to chance, handling the
unscripted moments himself. Now he's paying the price.
</P>
<P>
   Two jokes have returned to haunt him. A small Italian-American
anti-defamation group revealed Wednesday that in a meeting last
summer Corzine joked to some Italian-American leaders sitting with
a Jewish lawyer that the lawyer must be there to get them out of
jail. He recently quipped about making cement shoes to an
Italian-American contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly last week, Corzine, 53, had become what he had said he
wasn't. A politician. Whatever he had been before _ Midwest farm
boy, Wall Street executive _ he was now a New Jersey politician,
sitting at a news conference in a crammed union hall in Hudson
County, and people were shouting.
</P>
<P>
   Did he say those things? reporters demanded. ``Propaganda!''
spat a Corzine supporter. Corzine was contrite: ``I never intended
to offend.''
</P>
<P>
   Since beginning his campaign, he intended to move from corporate
boardroom to Senate cloakroom. Many party leaders saw Jon Corzine,
the nonpolitician, as the perfect foil to Jim Florio, the
recidivist politician.
</P>
<P>
   With the two men competing in the June Democratic primary,
Corzine's Italian-American backers accused Florio of inflating
off-hand remarks just as Corzine's poll numbers improved. Offended,
the former governor denied it, saying his opponent's money was
making the election into ``an auction.''
</P>
<P>
   It is more like a summer stock casting call, with Florio trying
to revive his act and Corzine honing his on stage.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Corzine still resembles a tourist in politics. ``I
think on balance, the political life has been a positive, terrific
experience,'' he said in an interview on Friday. ``I have seen
things from new perspectives and had the opportunity to embrace the
diversity of life.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his understated way, he also sounds hardened after last
week: ``It's a competitive business and I'm going to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio remains popular with Democratic voters. But many party
leaders, particularly in central and northern New Jersey, are still
seething over his $2.8 billion tax increase as governor that led
Democrats to slaughter a decade ago. They haven't controlled
Trenton since, making campaign funds sparse.
</P>
<P>
   That's why they're pinching themselves over Corzine. With an
estimated $300 million of his own and access to big donors, he is
helping to sprinkle cash on parched Democrats around the state.
``He's bringing in new people to the Democratic Party who are
making substantial contributions,'' said Raymond Lesniak, a
Democratic state senator.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, party leaders also like Corzine's politics. He's for
universal everything _ preschool, gun registration, access to
health care. He wants to spread the opportunities he had _ to
attend college with government aid and to succeed financially. ``I
have had people help me from the day I hit the ground,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He proposes urban investment banks, ``recharging'' affirmative
action and two years' free tuition at a state college for B
students.
</P>
<P>
   With his left-leaning platform, graying beard and rimless
glasses, Corzine, who is married with three children, seems like a
member of the used Volvo set. It's hard to imagine him running an
investment firm. Or cracking tired ethnic jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the jokes surfaced, Corzine simply apologized. Career
politicians supporting him were left to explain. ``We found out
that Jon Corzine is not Superman and not God,'' Lesniak said,
targeting the sinner vote. Stephen Adubato, a community leader in
Newark's North Ward, said Corzine's raw honesty shone through since
``the politicians I know would have denied that they said it.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, drawn into the political fray, tried his hand at
spinning reporters. He said his family had argued for years about
whether they were Italian or French. He had decided. ``For certain,
I am Italian.''
</P>
<P>
   You could almost hear the French vote fleeing. Will he never
learn?

ULLRICH MISSES A RACE AND HIS CONDITION IS SUSPECT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Germany)  (mk) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Spring had come to the French Basque coast. The sky was
cloudless, the breeze off the Atlantic soft and briny, the dark
hillside leading down to the French town of St. Jean de Luz flecked
with suspicions of green.
</P>
<P>
   On such a lovely day last weekend, Rudy Pevenage was friendly,
even genial, but his eyes were wary. Definitely wary. For the last
three years, spring has not been his favorite season.
</P>
<P>
   Pevenage, a 45-year-old Belgian who is coach for the Telekom
bicycle team from Germany, knew that anybody approaching with a
notebook or tape recorder did not want to ask about the explosion
of forsythia in the southwestern town, nor about the crocus pushing
up in every garden. What people wanted to talk about for the third
successive spring was the suspect condition of his protege, Jan
Ullrich, now and then a dominant racer.
</P>
<P>
   Spring is not one of those times for Ullrich, the 26-year-old
German.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he celebrated his victory the previous year in the Tour
de France by showing up for the start of the season in February at
least 20 pounds overweight (some said 30). Not until July, when he
finished second in the Tour, did the scales balance at his usual
160 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after Pevenage kept a closer eye on his star's
off-season eating habits, the problem was injury and illness. His
spring was marked by a stomach virus, the flu and problems with a
wisdom tooth, all of which caused Ullrich to skip many of the races
he needs to reach top condition for the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at the end of May, he crashed in the Tour of Germany,
injuring his head and a knee. The headache went away but the knee
injury worsened, forcing Ullrich to miss the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Both springs, Pevenage was kept busy fielding questions and
dodging answers. Now, as the songbirds returned to their accustomed
trees, he was being peppered again: Why did Ullrich drop out of the
Tirreno-Adriatico race in Italy three weeks ago? Why did he not
start the Milan-San Remo classic, as scheduled, on March 18? Why
did he not show up for the Catalan Week in Spain, as scheduled,
last week?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, why was he missing when the Criterium International
started its two-day run in St. Jean de Luz last Saturday? There, in
the printed program, was Ullrich's name, with No. 31 after it, but
there, at the starting line, the numbers on the Telekom team's
jerseys began at No. 32.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of a week, Ullrich had disappointed race organizers
and fans in Italy, Spain and France, while raising the standard
questions about his weight and condition.
</P>
<P>
   Once again those questions were irritating Pevenage, and so the
best approach in stalking him was a general comment about how well
his team is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Zabel, Telekom's star sprinter, has already won eight
races, including Milan-San Remo for the third time. ``A very good
victory for him,'' Pevenage agreed. ``Also very important for the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Andreas Kloeden, a hitherto unheralded young German, won the
Paris-Nice weeklong race with a smooth victory in the decisive
uphill time trial. ``I knew how good he is,'' Pevenage said. ``Now
everybody knows. I wasn't surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexandre Vinokourov, a Kazakh who was lured with a big contract
from a French team, was among the favorites in the Criterium
International.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the team is doing very well,'' Pevenage said. ``It
cannot be better. Everything's OK. It cannot be better.''
</P>
<P>
   His rote answers, his off-guard look, his relaxed body language
_ all proclaimed a time to strike.
</P>
<P>
   It cannot be better? What about Ullrich?
</P>
<P>
   Pevenage rummaged through his memories. ``Jan,'' he finally
said. ``He's home; everything's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Could it be better?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe better. Everything will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Last question: When is Ullrich's next race?
</P>
<P>
   ``Next week,'' Pevenage said. ``Probably.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not look happy. He looked, in fact, like a man thinking:
There goes another spring.

 &HT;    `He can play the game'
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Rafael Furcal spent his first major-league spring camp
giving the Braves a lot to think about, and a lot to look forward
to.
</P>
<P>
   Rated the eighth-best prospect in baseball by Baseball America,
the 19-year-old from the Dominican Republic did nothing but enhance
his status as the Braves' shortstop of the future _ the very near
future.
</P>
<P>
   Furcal made the team as a backup infielder by hitting .283 with
seven stolen bases, displaying a golden right arm and showing his
lack of fear of anything major-league.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's exactly what we heard,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``He's a
good infielder. He's got the best arm in baseball, maybe, as an
infielder right now. He's always hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves made room for Furcal by releasing veteran Ozzie
Guillen on Friday. Furcal will see action spelling Walt Weiss at
shortstop and Quilvio Veras at second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ready,'' said outfielder Andruw Jones, who also made the
majors at 19. ``He can play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones knows what it feels like to itch for the big-league
opportunity. He offered Furcal this advice: ``Keep playing the same
way you've been playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Furcal has a reputation for being a hard worker with a good
attitude, and he displayed it in camp. ``I'm working hard every
day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His first couple of years in the Braves system were good, but he
underscored his label as a top prospect in his first full season in
the minors last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Furcal led all minor-leaguers with 96 stolen bases. He hit .337
and stole 73 bases in 83 games for Class A Macon. In late July, he
was promoted to Myrtle Beach, in the more advanced Class A Carolina
League, and hit .293 with 23 steals in 43 games.
</P>
<P>
   Furcal played second base but was moved to his natural shortstop
position last season. Paul Snyder, the Braves' former director of
scouting and player development, said the organization wasn't sure
which side of second he would play on, but it wanted to keep his
arm in shortstop shape.
</P>
<P>
   Furcal had 34 errors in 86 games last year as he made the
adjustment. He has been a little shaky with his glove this spring,
but he has the arm strength to make up for a lot of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only criticism now is he rushes a lot,'' said Dick
Balderson, Braves director of player development. ``As he gains
experience, it becomes a non-factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Treadway, the former Braves second baseman who managed the
Macon Braves last year, worked with Furcal on his defense. Furcal
was named the South Atlantic League's top prospect, and from
Treadway's perspective it wasn't even close.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't anybody even close to having that kind of
ability,'' Treadway said. ``He's got major-league tools. Throwing
arm, foot speed, hitting ability and makeup _ his personality, his
approach to the game, his intensity. He has the instincts it takes
to play the game. He exudes it.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment has been echoed all over the major-league camp as
he went about his work eagerly and confidently.
</P>
<P>
   In one of Furcal's first at-bats with the major-league club,
against the Blue Jays, he fell behind 0-2 in the count, but worked
it full and then slapped an infield hit.
</P>
<P>
   Another at-bat, he faced a 3-0 count with a runner at second and
a veteran bat coming up behind him. He swung at the next pitch to
drive a single up the middle and score the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has one thing it's tough to have, (and) that's a ton of
confidence in himself,'' Braves hitting coach Merv Rettenmund said.
``He has no doubt he can play ball and hit anybody. He has fun
playing. He believes in himself.
</P>
<P>
   Balderson said: ``He looks like he belongs. He's not
intimidated, not back on his heels, defensive, because he's scared
to make a mistake. He's got a chance to be a special player.''

 &HT;    Warrick both draws praise, loses ground
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Washington Redskins coach Norv Turner calls Peter
Warrick, ``the best player in college football the past three
years.'' Cleveland Browns coach Chris Palmer says the Florida State
receiver is ``exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the first three choices are made in next month's NFL
Draft, Warrick might not be among them. Once regarded as the top
player available, Warrick could go as low as fourth to the
Cincinnati Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick and Alabama offensive tackle Chris Samuels are
considered the best offensive players in this year's draft. The
class is especially deep at wide receiver, running back and the
offensive line, but the NFL might take just one quarterback _
Marshall's Chad Pennington _ in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said this past week that the Browns are leaning toward
drafting one of two Penn State players with the top pick in the
draft. The Browns are thought to be favoring Nittany Lions
defensive end Courtney Brown, who dazzled scouts with a workout
earlier this month. Cleveland also is considering linebacker LaVar
Arrington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Brown and Arrington) are rare and Warrick is
exceptional,'' Palmer said. ``Clearly, those three players are
worthy of the No. 1 pick.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick once seemed like a perfect fit for the Browns,
especially after the team signed free-agent defensive ends Orpheus
Roye of the Steelers and Keith McKenzie of the Packers. Browns
quarterback Tim Couch, the No. 1 pick in last year's draft, has
lobbied Palmer and other Cleveland officials to select Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a horse race, and Warrick came out of the gates very,
very quickly,'' Palmer said. ``It was very easy to evaluate him.
All you had to do was turn on the TV and watch him make plays. But
once we got a chance to evaluate the defensive players, they jumped
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we go around the turn, I'd say Arrington and Brown are neck
and neck, with Warrick closing fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said a final decision might not be made until a few days
before the April 15-16 draft. The Browns would like to have their
first choice signed to a contract before the draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins have the second and third picks, and are thought to
be favoring Arrington and Samuels. That would leave Warrick for the
Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going into this very open,'' Turner said. ``I
think in those first four or five picks everyone is going to get a
great football player. We're going to definitely get two good
football players.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick's stock started to fall after his first individual
workout, in which he ran the 40-yard dash in only 4.54 seconds on a
slick gym floor at Florida State. He was faster in a second
workout, but some scouts also seem concerned about his size. At 5
feet 10 1/2, 190 pounds, Warrick has only average size for an NFL
receiver. But Turner says teams can't ignore Warrick's
explosiveness and open-field moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the whole key to evaluating players,'' Turner
said. ``You've got to go look at what the guy did the last three
years. He's probably the best player in college football the past
three years. All you have to do is turn on the tape and watch him
make people miss.''
</P>
<P>
   What might hurt Warrick is the deep receiver corps in this
year's draft. As many as six could be taken in the first round,
including Michigan State's Plaxico Burress, Georgia Tech's Dez
White, Florida's Travis Taylor and West Virginia's Jerry Porter.
The Browns, who also have the first pick in the second round,
figure that a good receiver might be available at the No. 32 pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen so many good, tall receivers,'' said Mark
Hatley, Bears vice president of player personnel. ``It's the
darnedest thing I've ever seen. And there are a lot more juniors
and sophomores coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the NFL initiated the draft in 1936, only five receivers
have been taken with the No. 1 pick, most recently in 1996 when the
Jets selected Keyshawn Johnson from Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Warrick) would be fun to have and work with,'' Bengals
president Mike Brown said. ``It's what he does after he catches the
ball. In that regard, he may be as fine a wide receiver as any
coming out of the draft in a long time.''

   NEW YORK _ How fast is Global Crossing growing?
</P>
<P>
   The two-year-old company, which runs a worldwide fiber-optic
network, recently signed a lease to house its electronic switching
equipment in 205,000 square feet in an old brick factory building
at 636 11th Ave., between 46th and 47th streets.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, it went back to the landlord asking to rent nearly
the entire 600,000-square-foot building .
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more. Global Crossing, which is expected to
sign a new lease within days, is also talking to developers about
taking 400,000 square feet in one or another office tower it plans
to build in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing, like many other telecommunication and Internet
companies, has a suddenly voracious appetite for space in a city
where large blocks of office space have become rare. In their
quest, the companies are shoving aside industrial tenants on the
West Side of Manhattan, on the Brooklyn waterfront and in Long
Island City, Queens. And they are driving rents up beyond even the
headiest expectations of a landlord.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be happening all over town,'' said Scott Latham, a
managing director at CB Richard Ellis. ``It's astounding what this
whole dot-com, telecom industry is doing to real estate. It's the
modern equivalent of the California gold rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing, which would not comment, is by no means alone.
Internet and telecommunications companies rented as much space in
the first three months of this year as they did in all of 1999, 2.5
million square feet, according to Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, a commercial
real estate broker. They are gobbling up space in nearly every
neighborhood in Manhattan and chasing manufacturers into
traditional backwaters like the Brooklyn waterfront and industrial
parts of Queens, where rents are low. Industrial tenants in these
neighborhoods who had been paying $8 and $9 a square foot cannot
compete with the technology companies that are willing to pay $30
or $40 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   In the fast shrinking garment district below Times Square,
iVillage took 108,000 square feet at 500-512 Seventh Ave., between
37th and 38th streets, and About.com signed a lease to move its
headquarters into nearby 1440 Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' said Adam C. Hochfelder of Max Capital, the
owner of 1440 Broadway. ``One hundred thousand-square-foot blocks
are moving like loaves of bread at a grocery store.''
</P>
<P>
   And printers are getting squeezed out of their longtime home
near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel by newly minted companies
willing to pay three times the old rent.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest Communications International, a multimedia communications
company, took 150,000 square feet at 32 Avenue of the Americas, a
building the Rudin real estate family is developing as a telecom
hotel, in which a building is used to house telecommunications
equipment for a variety of companies. MCI WorldCom leased 105,000
square feet in the same building. At 325 Hudson St., Bell Atlantic
Global Networks, Flag Atlantic USA and Net 2000 have leased large
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Network Plus Corp., a telecommunications carrier that moved into
the Starrett Lehigh Building, at 11th Avenue and 26th Street, has
nearly tripled the size of its space in that industrial building to
90,000 square feet. Last year, Highgate Holdings was planning to
redevelop the 10-story building at 85 10th Ave., between 15th and
16th streets, as a telecom hotel. Instead, Highgate transferred
ownership to Level 3 Communications, a telecommunications network
based in Denver, for a tidy profit.
</P>
<P>
   Highgate is also doing well with 636 11th Ave., despite paying a
small fortune for what is a battered brick structure, still home to
a few remaining printers, lighting shops and storage centers. In
1998, Stephen L. Green signed a contract to buy the old factory for
about $32.5 million, according to real estate executives. But
problems in the capital markets made Green wary. Bidding on the
building resumed last year, with offers of less than $40 million.
Then, real estate brokers said, Highgate won the contest with a bid
of about $43 million.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, Global came calling. Formed in March 1997,
Global acquired Frontier Corp., the fifth-largest telephone
company, in an $11.2 billion deal last year and is in the process
of buying IXnet and its parent company, IPC Communications, for $4
billion. Within the last year, Global's payroll jumped to 12,000
from 148.
</P>
<P>
   Global is taking all the available space in the building at
average rents of about $42 a square foot, said real estate brokers,
well above the single-digit rents paid by the old industrial
tenants. Now, Global, which has hundreds of employees in New
Jersey, and IXnet, which has more than 300 in lower Manhattan, are
looking for a regional headquarters, either in Times Square or
Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire market is adopting the fast pace of the intercom
and telecom companies,'' said Mary Ann Tighe, vice chairman of
Insignia/ESG, a broker. ``Older companies that normally proceed at
a more measured pace are being forced to act quickly, otherwise a
technology upstart will reach in and take the space, or create an
auction atmosphere that drives rents skyward.''

EDITORIAL: PRAYER BEFORE SCHOOL FOOTBALL GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, April 2:
</P>
<P>
   The school prayer issue occasioned a spirited argument at the
Supreme Court Wednesday during which a majority of the justices
expressed a healthy reluctance to permit organized prayer at public
high school football games. Such prayers almost inevitably give an
official endorsement to religious beliefs that may offend some
students and parents.
</P>
<P>
   The case started when a Mormon family and a Roman Catholic
family sued a small school district in Texas, objecting to the
Christian prayers offered by chaplains at school events. Since
then, the district has modified its policies to have a student
chosen in a schoolwide election offer a pregame invocation or
message of his or her own choosing. The district is trying to
persuade the court that prayer led by such an ``independent
speaker'' creates no constitutional problem _ unlike clergy-led
prayer at graduation, which the court outlawed in a principled
decision eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It proved a difficult sell. Five justices suggested that using
an elected student surrogate to deliver the prayer could not mask
the school's role in organizing the religious worship or overcome
the risk of indirect coercion inherent in prayer exercises in
elementary and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
   Only Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia
seemed to be probing for a way to distinguish school prayer from
graduation prayer. ``Nobody has to go to a football game,'' the
chief justice observed, glibly ignoring the importance of high
school football to student and community life in Texas and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Justices' comments during oral argument do not always foretell
the court's direction. But to the extent they indicated that a
majority would oppose creating a school sports loophole to the
First Amendment's protection against state establishment of
religion, the direction is sound.

 &HT;    Uphill defense
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Augusta _ As a greenskeeper's son playing golf as a youngster in
Fuenterrabia, Spain, Jose Maria Olazabal became a short-game
specialist by necessity. Nobody could outwork Olazabal, who
brandished his first club at age 4, but everyone seemed to outdrive
him. Something needed to be done to keep from falling behind his
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really short,'' Olazabal said. ``I was never a strong
boy. When the rest of the kids were hitting irons to the greens, I
couldn't even reach the green. So, I had to be better with the
short game than they were.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, it's an extra bonus that Olazabal's touch with a
pitching wedge or other chipping club remains among the world's
finest. A few days from defending his second Masters title, it's
about the only part of his game not causing stress.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old Olazabal knows that he can arrive at Augusta
with his driver misbehaving but he won't be there on the weekend if
his putter betrays him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Augusta National, without a doubt, favors the long hitter,''
he said, ``but, at the same time, if you have a good touch on the
greens, you can compensate (for) lack of distance off the tee. I
think that is the beauty of Augusta. You don't need to be a really
great hitter of the ball to score.''
</P>
<P>
   After missing the cut at The Players Championship, Olazabal
arrived at the BellSouth Classic speaking as though he could not
hit a fairway or the hole with consistency. While others were
competing in The Players Championship, Olazabal worked on his tee
shots on the practice range at Sawgrass. On Tuesday, he spent hours
on the practice greens at Sugarloaf, in stiff winds, working on his
putting. He was missing badly on straight, uphill putts.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a professional, you know these kinds of things are going to
go through your game,'' he said. ``It's just a pity I have to
approach Augusta in these conditions. . . . Last year, it was just
one thing that was not working well. That was the driver. The rest
of the game was pretty solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, you will forgive the rest of the Masters field if they
don't cry over Olazabal's plight. He poor-mouthed his driving last
year, then wound up with a second green jacket. Not only are the
fairways forgiving enough at Augusta National to allow poor drives
_ even with the addition of the ``second cut'' _ Ollie's short game
and it's pre-adolescent origin, have a way of sharpening at the
sight of the first azalea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seve's the best, but Olazabal's quite close,'' Scotland's
Colin Montgomerie said, referring to the latter's fellow Spaniard,
Seve Ballesteros. ``Their short game is second to none, and that's
what's it's all about at Augusta. The emphasis is not so much
driving the ball at the Masters. It's the second shots and in, and
that's where they both score. And that's why they've gotten four
Masters between them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad (Olazabal) doesn't drive it straight,'' Curtis
Strange said. ``He has a wonderful short game, and he always has.
But look who his mentor was. There hasn't been any person better
than Seve chipping the ball that I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Proud of how colleagues regard his chipping, Olazabal insists
that he grinds over each shot more than the results would indicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may look very confident, but I can assure you I don't feel
that comfortable,'' he said. ``Especially when you pass over the
15th green, and the flag is short, and you're seeing the water
behind the shot that you're facing. There's no way you're going to
be feeling comfortable; it doesn't matter how good you are, having
to hit those shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal's long-term problem has been the driver. Since the 1999
Masters, he has been missing fairways with troubling regularity. He
was mildly encouraged this winter when instructor John Jacobs
strengthened his grip. But Olazabal has gone back to guessing where
his drives might be heading.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience just tells me that the only way to get something
positive (going) is when you see that ball flying straight to the
middle of the fairway,'' Olazabal said. ``Whenever it goes straight
right or left, in the water or in the trees, that is not good news,
and it's not going to be a good confidence-builder whenever you
have to hit the next tee shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange, for one, always has been surprised by Olazabal's
driving woes, considering how strong an iron player he has been
through the years. ``His left hand is on there so weak, he kind of
hangs on his left side a lot,'' said Strange, a two-time U.S. Open
champion. ``It's kind of like he's catching up all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything's relative, though. Olazabal went nearly two years in
the mid-1990s without competing because of rheumatoid arthritis in
both feet that prevented him from walking. Four years before the
second Augusta victory, Olazabal watched the tournament from his
bed. Last year, after his Masters victory, he was treated like a
hero in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason I really do appreciate it much more now is
just that I was not able to walk at all,'' he said. ``For a while,
I thought I would never play golf again.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Gary Player in a conversation at the Tuesday
Champions Dinner last year, Olazabal made a remarkable
transformation with his game. He came to town admittedly ``not a
happy camper,'' lacking confidence and distrusting his driver, but
``after two days, I looked at the tournament from a different
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   This year could be a tougher challenge. With just one finish
outside the top 10 in the Masters since 1988, Olazabal has had few
opportunities when could not count on his putter.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, ``I'm missing them on both sides of the hole.''

   BBO-MELTINGPOT _ Baseball, more than ever, has become much more
than America's pastime. It's increasingly becoming a melting pot of
whites, blacks, Latins, Asians, etc., and with that has come
issues/problems regarding racism (John Rocker), marketing (Sammy
Sosa vs. Mark McGwire) and coaching and playing together (language
barriers). (Capozzi/Gutierrez, Palm Beach Post). MOVED

another World Series title? The team with the highest payroll and
lived up to expectations in recent years, winning two consecutive

   BBN-BRAVES-PITCHING _ The Braves' vaunted Big Three _ Greg
Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz _ is getting old. John Smoltz
has already broken down, being forced to miss the entire season
after elbow surgery. How much longer can Maddux and Glavine keep
going without missing starts? Age catches up with all pitchers, no
matter what they do to fool Father Time. (Rogers, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 50. MOVED
</P>

   BBN-BRAVES-ANDRUW _ At 22, Andruw Jones is already being billed
as one of the best outfielders in baseball. But most of that praise

before Christmas. The Reds have baseball's best position player.
And they got him for a song. Their lineup is intact. Optimism
hasn't run this high since the Big Red Machine days. But in
reality, what impact will Junior Griffey have on this team, which

 &HT;    Houston flexes
 &HT;    By Tom Sabulis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ You can sense Georgia in the air here lately, and
we're not talking humidity.
</P>
<P>
   In the theater district, beneath downtown's copse of rugged
skyscrapers, the Houston Grand Opera is about to unveil its world
premiere of ``Cold Sassy Tree.'' Published in 1984, the
turn-of-the-century novel by Atlanta newspaper writer Olive Ann
Burns is set in a town modeled on Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Catch this week's Houston Symphony performances, and you can
hear Robert Spano _ the Atlanta Symphony's new music director _
conduct the HSO, an orchestra in the familiar limbo of searching
for a new maestro. Houston is also looking to start funding a new
hall in the next year or two.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Houston Ballet produced a newly choreographed
and nationally recognized ``Cleopatra,'' featuring the diaphanous
pastel designs of Judanna Lynn, who also did costumes for the
Atlanta Ballet's new ``Nutcracker.''
</P>
<P>
   Drive over to the live oak-lined museum district, and you'll
find the Audrey Jones Beck Building, a mighty $85 million expansion
to the Museum of Fine Arts. High Museum of Art leaders have checked
out its progress as they await plans for their own addition.
</P>
<P>
   Walk through the perfectly placid Menil Collection campus nearby
_ home to heralded surrealist paintings and a Rothko chapel, among
other treasures _ and you'll experience the seductive low-scale
design by Renzo Piano that helped persuade the Woodruff Arts Center
to hire the Italian architect to draw its redesign. The Menil's new
director is Ned Rifkin, who left the High Museum in December.
</P>
<P>
   Houston. Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Regional capitals. Sweaty Sun Belt siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Two major-league cities incorporated in the first half of the
19th century, now a pair of vast, sprawling metro areas with large,
ethnically diverse populations. It's tempting, but tricky, to draw
parallels between them, particularly when evaluating their arts
communities. Yet comparisons can be instructive when considering
the kind of commitment it takes to be recognized as a world-class
cultural capital.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Houston is ahead, perhaps as it should be,
considering that its economic oil gusher started decades ago. The
city has wide philanthropic support, grounded by half a dozen
family foundations, the largest being the Houston Endowment _
founded by Jesse Jones, an oil and newspaper magnate. While Texas'
largest city reached national status in the arts several years
back, Atlanta still has a way to go _ if not because it lacks
talented artists, then perhaps for a lack of broad community
support.
</P>
<P>
   A TALE OF TWO DISTRICTS
</P>
<P>
   It's an interesting contradiction that Houston, a city famous
for having no zoning, has two well-organized arts districts. The
downtown theater district includes homes for the opera, ballet,
symphony and major residential theater, within a block or two of
each other. Approximately three miles down Main Street, the museum
district is an oak-canopied refuge that includes the Museum of Fine
Arts, its expansion, a sculpture garden, an art school and the
Contemporary Arts Museum. A city park, with golf course, is across
the street and the Rice University campus a five-minute walk away.
</P>
<P>
   Spend a few days at Houston's stages, and two things strike you:
the number of modern, appropriate venues and the amount of new work
being performed.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's opera and ballet reside in the Wortham Center,
featuring administrative offices, rehearsal space and two
customized theaters, seating 2,200 and 1,100, respectively. The
center, which cost $72 million, was built entirely with private
funds during the economic recession of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   David Gockley, general director of Houston Grand Opera, has
forged an international reputation by producing 24 world premieres,
four of them by Carlisle Floyd, the South Carolina native who
composed ``Cold Sassy Tree.'' His city has an appetite for modern
opera, he says, not having grown up _ as many Atlantans did _ with
yearly visits from New York's Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that Houston has less of a traditional audience,''
Gockley says. ``They have not had opera in their lives for
generation after generation; they're a little less formed in their
mind about what it should be. There's a comparatively small percent
of European-descended population that would want to keep the flame
burning as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   A CITY WITH DEEP POCKETS
</P>
<P>
   Enviable endowments enable Houston institutions, such as the
ballet and the Museum of Fine Arts, to make names for themselves
outside the city. Houston Ballet has an endowment of $37 million,
the largest of any dance company in the United States after New
York City Ballet. The new Audrey Jones Beck Building addition to
the Museum of Fine Arts has raised more than $40 million for its
endowment (to operate the building), after raising $85 million to
build it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about commitment in the fullest sense,'' says
the Atlanta Ballet's director John McFall of Houston's
philanthropy, ``so that everything inside them is supported, so
that the institution is not only able to sustain itself, but to
distinguish itself. Rather than just having a nice regional
cultural institution, they have a passion to create something quite
remarkable in their own neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   But support comes from many quarters. ``I get lots of $55,000,
$60,000 checks (from individuals),'' Peter Marzio, director of the
Museum of Fine Arts, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1998.
``That's what this place runs on.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta need not cower in comparison (not that this
self-proclaimed ``sports capital of the world'' would). The city's
upside looks too good. The Woodruff Arts Center seems a solid bet
to adopt a new master plan. People who should know say a major High
Museum expansion will happen. The symphony already has a generous
lead gift of $15 million from Home Depot's Arthur Blank slated for
a new hall. The ASO's hiring of the Brooklyn Philharmonic' Spano as
its music director has drawn national attention. Downtown is
building up along the Peachtree Street corridor; it has an energy,
and mass transit infrastructure, that Houston's desolate stretch of
Main Street, between its two arts districts, simply cannot match.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, arts groups are tapping the city's
growing technology market for financial support. Judging from this
past week's economic forum on the arts at the Metro Atlanta Chamber
of Commerce, there's reason to expect good things. Even new
Houstonian Ned Rifkin, the recently departed High Museum director,
says Atlanta has an edge in ``new economy'' resources for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   But Houston offers a subtle lesson: It's not enough for a city
to want the arts; it has to need them.

PRIVACY CONCERNS THWART CENSUS, DIRECTOR SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The director of the Census Bureau expressed alarm
Saturday that Americans were not adequately cooperating with the
census because they saw the government survey as an intrusion on
their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Kenneth Prewitt, said opinion polls suggested that
public concerns about the privacy of census data had ``sharply
increased.'' About 17 percent of Americans express such concerns,
up from 10 percent three weeks ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said he worried that a ``public backlash'' against the
census, especially the elaborate long form sent to one household in
six, could undermine the quality of data used for a wide variety of
public programs.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was the official Census Day, the occasion on which the
government tries once every decade to take a snapshot of the
population. But in a telephone interview with reporters from his
home here, Prewitt said he was ``concerned about the level of
public cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency said that as of Thursday, 50 percent of all
households that had received questionnaires had returned them. It
did not say what percentage of long forms had been returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get a flood of responses in the next couple of
days,'' Prewitt said, ``we will have a huge task ahead of us as we
go into the community to find nonrespondents. A huge task. We have
to express concern about the number of doors that may be slammed,
with people saying this is not that important.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans in Congress, including Sen. Trent Lott,
R-Miss., the majority leader, have told constituents they may skip
questions they see as invading their privacy. But Prewitt
emphasized that Americans were required to answer all questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``To signal that the census is not serious, that it is a
pick-and-choose exercise, is to put the response rate at risk,''
Prewitt said. ``I do not believe that's the intent of our political
leadership. But I believe it's a possible consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires Americans to complete census forms, Prewitt
said. ``To tell them not to complete the form is to tell them to
break the law,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said the Census Bureau had not anticipated the
``long-form backlash,'' which he attributed to factors beyond the
control of his agency. He said there had been ``a general increase
in dislike of or mistrust of government,'' running from
``Watergate, secret bombing, Pentagon papers, Irangate, right
through the current administration.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``three-decade-long decline in civic responsibility'' has been
aggravated by an increase in privacy concerns, which loom larger
now than in the last three censuses, Prewitt said. ``People
suddenly have a heightened concern about their privacy being
invaded,'' he said. ``Some of that concern is transferred to the
government and the census.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans have always expressed such concerns, but Prewitt
said: ``You now can amplify messages like that much more rapidly
than you used to. Internet sites are out there bashing the
census.''
</P>
<P>
   If a low response rate damages the quality of data, Prewitt
said, the information will be less useful. ``Ask Alan Greenspan if
he'd like to make monetary policy without data on labor force
participation or the Consumer Price Index,'' he said, referring to
the Federal Reserve chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said the government would accelerate radio advertising
in parts of the country where response to the census was lagging.

IMMIGRANTS FLOCK TO UNION BANNER AT LABOR FORUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Ill., Calif., Minn.)  (lb) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Immigrant workers, a huge but often voiceless group,
were given a chance to speak up on Saturday, and speak they did:
about abuses on the job, about mandatory 70-hour weeks, about not
being allowed to take bathroom breaks, about making just $2 an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   These workers were given their soapbox at an unusual forum
sponsored by the AFL-CIO, which is seeking to persuade millions of
immigrant workers to join unions, though labor has long turned a
cold shoulder to them.
</P>
<P>
   The forum, at a union hall in Manhattan, was the official
kickoff of a nationwide effort by the AFL-CIO to reach out to
immigrant workers as labor leaders increasingly acknowledge their
importance to the future of American unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigrants are not only the history of the union movement,
they are its future, its soul, its spirit,'' Linda Chavez-Thomson,
the AFL-CIO's secretary treasurer, told the 300 people at the
forum. ``We are on the side of working people everywhere, and that
means we are on the side of immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   The forum was part educational session, part revival meeting,
part public relations vehicle, aimed to burnish labor's image among
immigrants. The forum was held at the headquarters of Local 32B-32J
of the Service Employees International Union, a local that
represents 55,000 building service workers from 54 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Many immigrants at the forum appeared happy to flock to the
union banner. Herbert Jean-Baptiste, an immigrant from Haiti,
complained that 90 percent of immigrants who work at nursing homes
lack health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Syed Armughan, a limousine driver from Pakistan, said that many
drivers had to work 70-hour weeks, received no health insurance or
retirement benefits and earned less than $30,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   And Zonia Villanueva, a housekeeper from El Salvador, complained
that many employment agencies charged exorbitant fees and that many
homeowners cheated their maids out of wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are workers who contribute to the economy,'' Villanueva
said. ``People depend on us to clean their houses and care for
their children. We have been in the country for many years and we
pay taxes. We want to stand up for our rights. We want to live and
work free from intimidation. We only want the respect that every
worker deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   The forum reflected a sharp change in organized labor's approach
toward immigrants. For decades, many unions and union members
looked askance at newcomers, viewing them as interlopers stealing
jobs and driving down wages.
</P>
<P>
   But as the AFL-CIO has focused increasingly on unionizing
workers on the lowest rungs, like waiters, janitors and hotel
maids, union leaders have recognized that they have to improve
labor's image among immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the reason for the forum, Chavez-Thompson, said, ``We
want to bring a better understanding within the labor movement
because there has been such strong opposition to immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's forum came six weeks after the American Federation of
Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations reversed its
longstanding policy and called for granting legal status to all
illegal aliens and repealing laws that bar employers from hiring
illegal immigrants. In the mid-1980s the labor movement, worried
about high unemployment, backed legislation that made it illegal
for employers to hire illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an amazing sea change in the AFL-CIO's attitude
toward immigrants,'' said Kent Wong, director of the labor studies
center at the University of California in Los Angeles, who attended
Saturday's forum.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the forum was a stacked house, filled with union
leaders and pro-union immigrants who repeatedly talked about all
that unions could do for immigrants. Not surprisingly, none of the
immigrants invited to speak criticized the many union leaders who
do a poor job fighting for workers or the many construction unions
that long turned their backs on non-European immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO plans similar forums in Atlanta (April 29), Chicago
(May 6) and Los Angeles (June 10). The purpose of these meetings,
union officials said, is to listen to immigrants speak about their
problems at work, while also spreading the word about how unions
can help them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Immigrant after immigrant talked Saturday about how, just when a
unionization drive was gathering steam, their employers called in
immigration authorities to crack down on illegal immigrants. That
tactic, these workers said, often took the wind out of organizing
drives.
</P>
<P>
   John Wilhelm, president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
Employees Union, spoke angrily of how immigration officials, acting
on an employer's tip, arrested eight hotel maids who worked at a
Holiday Inn in Minneapolis. The arrests came four days after the
hotel's housekeepers voted to unionize, and all eight arrested were
on the union's negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Bernstein, a policy analyst at the National Immigration
Law Center, said this fear of arrest and deportation ``is bad for
American workers because it adds a weapon to the arsenal businesses
can use to undermine efforts to improve all of our working
conditions.''

 &HT;    Teams gearing up to keep Yankees at bay
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now for Plan J.
</P>
<P>
   The American League for four years has tried anything to escape
the hammerlock that the New York Yankees have maintained almost
unceasingly upon the 13 other teams. This spring bears the same
scant hope.
</P>
<P>
   Chasing a third straight World Series championship and a fourth
in five years, the Yankees of 2000 are essentially the same
substance that has run through both leagues with such ease in
recent autumns. Elsewhere in the league, young teams _ Oakland and
Toronto _ are getting better while solid contenders _ Cleveland and
Boston _ mass for another rush.
</P>
<P>
   But the plain truth remains that the Yankees' roster has hardly
changed during this historic rush. Outside the Bronx, the anguish
grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we've done to this point, all the division titles
and stuff, won't mean anything until we win the World Series,''
said Indians catcher Sandy Alomar, his club having nothing to show
for five straight Central championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's necessary that we win one. And the thing I'm interested
in finding out is will the fans still come out after we win one?''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians' biggest response to New York was adding free agent
pitcher Chuck Finley, which is hardly enough to close the gap
against a rotation of Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, David Cone,
Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte. The Tribe's firing of manager Mike
Hargrove was more a gesture of frustration than a shift in
strategy, after Cleveland went 10-22 against playoff teams last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see us buckle down and play well against good teams
like that,'' new Indians manager Charlie Manuel said. ``I think
that it's important because it can give you a mental edge when you
play those teams again.''
</P>
<P>
   In the West, while Seattle retools for ``small ball'' without
Ken Griffey Jr. and Texas jettisons Juan Gonzalez and Todd Zeile
for pitching, Oakland has emerged as a legitimate force. They might
be the hardest-hitting team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Don't talk to Boston about being hit hard. After the Red Sox's
surprising run last October, the city finds itself in dread about
Sports Illustrated's choice of Boston to win the World Series.
Somehow that worry is great comfort to New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good,'' Clemens said. ``That's great. New century.''
</P>
<P>
   And same old Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN LEAGUE PREVIEW
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox have not won a World Series since 1918, the
longest streak in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   EAST
</P>
<P>
   1. New YorkHey, whaddya want for 90 million bucks? Two-time
titlists have everything for another Series run.
</P>
<P>
   2. BostonCarl Everett addition puts more bite in very toothy
lineup. Can't match Yankees' rotation.
</P>
<P>
   3. TorontoGood but not quite strong enough to contend. See how
Mondesi likes it in Canada.4. Tampa BayIf home runs were gold,
these Devil Rays would dress out in bullion underwear.
</P>
<P>
   5. BaltimoreThey're old, they're slow, they're run by a buffoon,
and 3 million people show up anyway.
</P>
<P>
   CENTRAL
</P>
<P>
   1. ClevelandCan score runs in the dark but mound shortcomings
persist. One year, they'll get it right.
</P>
<P>
   2. Kansas CityLine behind Cleveland starts 30 games back. Royals
get respectable fast with bullpen help.
</P>
<P>
   3. DetroitHere's hoping Juan Gonzalez likes his new home, or
he's gone in a year, and Comerica dozes.
</P>
<P>
   4. ChicagoOn paper, this team looks pretty good. On the field,
Frank Thomas won't let anyone see the paper.
</P>
<P>
   5. MinnesotaQ: What's the difference between Twins and AA team?
A: People will actually watch a AA team.
</P>

pitching. Good idea, wrong staff.
</P>
<P>
   3. SeattleJunior hardly left the cupboard bare. But these guys
just finished third with him.

BELICHICK AT EASE  
 FASSEL WANTS SPEED  
 NO TROUBLEMAKERS  
 ETC... 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Belichick is having a glass of orange juice in a ballroom
at a luxury Florida hotel, his sips being interrupted by glances at
the sandy beach 30 feet away. The green and blue water seems to be
having a calming effect on one of the most intense head coaches in
professional football.
</P>
<P>
   These days Belichick is smiling a lot, and is friendly, even
talkative, at times. These are not images usually associated with
one of the best defensive minds in the game. It is more common to
see Belichick looking disheveled and sounding grumpy.
</P>
<P>
   That is certainly the way he looked during what was the most
chaotic time of his professional life. Remember? Bill Parcells
named Belichick the head coach of the Jets and then, fearing a new
owner might not be supportive, Belichick abruptly resigned,
eventually joining the New England Patriots. It was an awkward,
embarrassing time for both Belichick and the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets were chastised by the news media and fans for not
knowing what was going on inside Belichick's head. And Belichick
was portrayed as a confused goofball who showed a lack of respect
to Parcells. There were National Football League and team officials
who, after watching Belichick's bizarre news conference in which he
resigned from the Jets job, were wondering if Belichick had had
some sort of breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all is well again with the world. Belichick is trying to
rebuild the Patriots, and the Jets have Al Groh as their head
coach. Groh, in fact, said hello to Belichick at the owners'
meetings last week in Palm Beach, Fla. And believe it or not,
Parcells and the New England Patriots owner, Robert K. Kraft, once
bitter enemies, recently had a brief but friendly chat.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean that all the wounds are healed from
Belichick's excellent adventure, in which he went from defensive
coordinator to head coach to unemployed to head coach again within
a span of days. In Palm Beach, when Belichick was asked about
things that did not involve the Jets, he was talkative. But
whenever the subject of the Jets came up Belichick clammed up.
Trying to get his thoughts on the subject was harder than beating
one of his vaunted defensive schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Did he have any doubts during that chaotic period that his
decision to step down was the right one?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Does he ever think about the Jets?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've moved on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few times Belichick smiled while discussing his
former team was after being asked about the trade talks involving
wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson. Belichick said that while he was
with the Jets, he was aware that the organization felt that
Johnson's contract situation would be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Then Belichick quipped, ``I don't think we'll be dealing for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick has a tough job ahead of him. The Patriots are a team
in need of a personality. There are times New England plays on a
championship level, and there are times when it struggles. The team
lacks consistency.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are happy to have Belichick on their side because
for many years, when Belichick was in New York, he devised plans
that completely frustrated New England, especially quarterback Drew
Bledsoe. As Belichick has met with Patriots players, all of them
have expressed their glee about having Belichick's brainpower
supporting them instead of trying to shut them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization showed a lot of trust in me in bringing me to
the Patriots,'' Belichick said. ``For that I am grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants Seek Explosiveness
</P>
<P>
   Several team executives said that the Giants had been approached
by a number of teams about their 11th pick in the April draft.
Ernie Accorsi, New York's general manager, denied that. In fact
only one team has contacted the Giants, the Baltimore Ravens, who
were considering swapping their fifth pick with the Giants in
exchange for the Giants' 11th selection plus additional picks. The
Ravens later changed their mind.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, are the Giants slowly changing the way they evaluate
college draft prospects? Often the Giants have drafted players with
size and power, and not necessarily athleticism. The recent
league-wide trend has been to draft smaller, faster players who are
also great athletes.
</P>
<P>
   One Giants team official said that coach Jim Fassel had been
preaching more and more to draft speedy, athletic players, forgoing
size if necessary. Fassel, the official said, has urged the team to
change the way the Giants look at players, and go for speed. ``We
need explosion,'' Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that Fassel and Accorsi are working well
together, unlike management's relationship with former coach Dan
Reeves, who alienated just about everyone in the personnel
department. Fassel uses reason and logic to get his point across,
while Reeves often tried to bully the organization into doing
things his way by complaining publicly to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get my point across in different ways,'' Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a number of team executives said that Accorsi was
doing one of the best jobs in the league at managing the salary cap
while simultaneously acquiring talent. The Giants lost six free
agents, but have picked up some good players in return, and done so
without destroying their salary cap situation.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos Want Character
</P>
<P>
   One of the most discussed topics at last week's owners meetings
was off-field violence. Some teams have vowed to be more selective
in drafting players, staying away from those with troubled pasts.
</P>
<P>
   Denver coach Mike Shanahan said last week that the Broncos had
already removed 10 players from the draft board because of what he
called ``various problems.'' The issues ranged from having serious
conflicts with the coaching staff to drug abuse to violent behavior
off the field.
</P>
<P>
   And the Broncos owner Pat Bowlen told the owners last week to
put as much emphasis on character as teams do on talent.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Several owners say that the NFL is concerned about the
ever-increasing player salaries, particularly with the signing
bonuses. The league has even gone so far as to lecture teams
sternly to watch their spending habits.... The Jets are still
willing to listen to trade offers for Keyshawn Johnson despite the
proclamation that he is off the trading block. Look for trade
discussions to heat up again in the days leading up to the
draft....More on the draft: The Cleveland Browns, at least for now,
are not going to budge from that No. 1 overall spot, and will
probably select either the Penn State pass rusher Courtney Brown or
his teammate, linebacker Lavar Arrington. Meanwhile the hottest
draft rumor _ and at this time of year there is always lots of
draft gossip _ has Denver trying to trade up to the fourth spot to
pick Florida State wide receiver Peter Warrick....Minnesota coach
Dennis Green is interested in quarterback Bubby Brister, who was
cut by the Broncos. The interest, however, may be intended to put
pressure on Jeff George, who is hesitating to sign a one-year deal
with the Vikings....Instant replay will be back, but for how long?
Supporters don't want it to be voted on on a yearly basis, so after
this coming season, if it again works well, it might be here to
stay for a while.

(ATTN: N.Y.)  
 ON OPENING DAY, FAR MORE FISHERS THAN FISH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN C. SAUTNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSCOE, N.Y. _ On Saturday this otherwise sleepy hamlet at the
confluence of the Beaverkill and Willowemoc Rivers became the
Punxsutawney of the fishing world once again as scores of anglers
came out to see firsthand how the brand-new trout season might
fare.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mr. Trout must have seen his shadow, as most fishermen
went home emptyhanded, settling instead for the opportunity to
simply cast a line on an early spring day.
</P>
<P>
   The morning broke clear and downright cold with a hard frost
covering the nearby ballfield that overlooks Junction Pool, perhaps
the most famous stretch of water in American trout fishing. Dave
Daft, Richard Kress and Moira Dooley joined me as we tugged on
waders and strung up flyrods.
</P>
<P>
   By 6 a.m., 20 anglers lined much of the pool's banks. All around
us, fishers galumphed past in everything from chest-high rubber
waders to blue jeans and baseball caps. They carried an eclectic
array of rods, nets, buckets and coolers. I overheard one angler
pleading to another, ``Let's go the diner and wait till it warms
up.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a far different river from the one I had driven past a
week earlier on a scouting mission. Then, just a handful of
fishermen sat in their cars gazing almost lovingly at their
favorite spots. At Ferdon's Eddy, just downstream of the Junction,
an elderly gent stood alone behind his pickup, having what looked
like his own private tailgate party, complete with a smoky
barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Even Friday afternoon, just a few hopefuls had surveyed the
river. Two men in their mid-30s sipped on bottles of beer and
casually discussed which bait would work best on the morrow. Worms,
they decided.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, the crowd continued to build until it seemed
that half of Roscoe had converged at the Junction. Finally, a rod
bent and a 15-inch brown trout was quickly landed and released.
Another trout, not quite so lucky, wound up on a rope stringer that
held from an old stump in the river.
</P>
<P>
   Six-year-old Tyler Ratner from the town of Beaverkill, N.Y., did
his best to rollcast a streamer into a deep pocket where he
believed a big brown surely must be hiding.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the summer you can catch trout here and they taste very
good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I then decided to wander up the Beaverkill and began drifting a
tandem rig of a streamer and a nymph through a promising-looking
run. By the third cast, ice had started to build in the guides of
my rod. Twenty minutes later, I retreated back to the Junction to
show Dave my woolly bugger, now frozen solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be opening day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 a.m., the local bed-and-breakfast association began doling
out free muffins and coffee. (On opening day in Roscoe, one can eat
free virtually all day long by strategically hopscotching from one
ceremony to another.) Ten minutes later, a group of men wheeled
down a 20-foot-long wooden rainbow trout to the edge of the
Willowemoc to the delight of a local television crew. It was
definitely time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   We decided to head downriver to a spot that Richard believed
might have warmed enough to produce a hatch of caddis flies.
</P>
<P>
   As we made our way down the old highway that parallels the
river, it became suddenly apparent that except for the Junction,
the Beaverkill looked mysteriously empty. Even Cairn's Pool, which
Dave jokes should be annexed by the state of New Jersey for its
propensity to attract a permanent flotilla of Garden State fishers,
was deserted.
</P>
<P>
   We scrambled down the banks to a beautiful jade-green pool and
immediately began drifting nymphs through its lengths. The wheezy
call of a phoebe came from a grove of maples on the far bank. The
sun began to warm the air, and small caddis flies and early brown
stoneflies began fluttering off the river by the dozens. As we
expected, though, nothing came up for them in the chilly water.
Except for two common mergansers patrolling a shallow riffle
downstream, not a soul was in sight. This privacy seemed as lovely
as any trout we might have caught.

 &HT;    J.L. Chestnut: A mighty oak
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SELMA, Ala. _ When his law office was on Jeff Davis Avenue, J.L.
Chestnut Jr. poured his heart _ and funnybone _ into the sign he
hung on the brick wall outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parking for Afro American only,'' the red block letters still
proclaim. ``All others will be towed.''
</P>
<P>
   The name of Selma's first black attorney _ J.L. Chestnut _ is
written inside a black double-pointed arrow at the bottom of the
sign, showing where the rule applied.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would always park his car right there, and it would
antagonize some people,'' said Lucy Hopson, whose son runs a dental
practice next door to the now-vacant building. ``He's outspoken,
and he always speaks the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   That voice _ sometimes inflammatory, never sugar-coated _ is the
one that speaks in defense of Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, accused cop
killer and 1960s radical once named H. Rap Brown.
</P>
<P>
   That voice carries through Alabama's Black Belt, named for the
dark, rich soil where sharecroppers have toiled for years planting
cotton in the middle of the state. It was here that Chestnut and
Brown met, working together to register black voters in Dallas and
Lowndes counties 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That voice has rippled on radio waves, raging against Joe
Smitherman, Selma's white mayor, in power since 1964, a year before
the ``Bloody Sunday'' march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an unbridled opportunist,'' Chestnut has railed on the
air. ``He's an agent of white people. He's not our savior. He's
maintaining white supremacy.''
</P>
<P>
   THE POOR MAN'S COCHRAN
</P>
<P>
   Known to friends as Chess, Chestnut has been the poor man's
Johnnie Cochran.
</P>
<P>
   There is some doubt Chestnut will represent Al-Amin once the
case moves to Atlanta. Cochran, for one, has been mentioned as a
candidate for the job, as have top metro defense attorneys Michael
Mears and Bruce Harvey. But if Chestnut does stay with the case,
expect ``anything,'' says Smitherman, 70, Chestnut's foil since
1964. ``It's going to be a circus. Free admission, except for the
police barricades,'' Smitherman said.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-authoritarian Chestnut style already has shone through
in his defense of Al-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had my problems with the FBI and law enforcement types
for years,'' Chestnut, 69, said on CNBC after Al-Amin was arrested
March 20 in White Hall, Ala. Al-Amin had fled to the tiny town west
of Montgomery after allegedly fatally shooting a Fulton County
sheriff's deputy and wounding another as they tried to serve a
warrant on him in Atlanta's West End.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been practicing law in Alabama for 40 years. They shoot
at my office at least twice a year,'' Chestnut said of the FBI.
``And I've been threatened more times than a Hollywood cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   As Al-Amin left the Montgomery County jail, shackled and bound,
for court a day after his arrest, the former Black Panther
declared, ``It's a government conspiracy, man.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose Sanders, one of Chestnut's law partners, concedes they're
in a public relations war; half the battles will be fought openly
before trial starts.
</P>
<P>
   A SEASONED FIGHTER
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. during the Selma
protests of the 1960s, Chestnut has waged this kind of fight for
years. He has sued for black voting rights and decades later
defended charges of black voter fraud. He fought for minority
hiring at City Hall and U.S. Department of Agriculture loans for
black farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is he an extraordinary trial lawyer,'' said Sanders,
whose office is adorned with a picture of Nation of Islam leader
Louis Farrakhan, ``but because he was a lawyer for Dr. King,
because he's been a part of the struggle to empower people of all
races, because he's had that experience, he is going to bring
something to that courtroom that is unique.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Chestnut is viewed with something close to
reverence, especially in Selma. Chestnut is associated with civil
rights icons such as John Lewis, Hosea Williams and Ralph David
Abernathy.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, when protesters were mobilizing in the Black Belt,
whites threatened to fire their black housekeepers if they marched,
Hopson recalled. So Chestnut and other activists marched for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made us, who couldn't do anything, feel proud,'' said
Hopson, who went to Selma's black high school with Chestnut.
</P>
<P>
   Three times, Chestnut's law firm has outgrown offices on Jeff
Davis Avenue, named for the president of the Confederacy. The
largest black law firm in the state, its new home overlooks the
Alabama River not far from the Pettus Bridge, where white state
troopers and sheriff's deputies beat black voting rights
demonstrators on Bloody Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Against a wall in the lobby, water from a fountain trickles down
15 squares of tile laid three across. On a middle tile, the words
of King are etched: ``Until Justice Rolls Down Like Water.''
African paintings and pictures hang from the brick walls of the
long hallway leading to the attorneys' offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done very well for himself,'' Selma City Attorney Henry
Pitts said of Chestnut. Pitts' father once represented infamous
Dallas County Sheriff Jim Clark, who led a mounted posse against
marchers on the Pettus Bridge in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very good on his feet,'' Pitts said. ``He gives most
jurors a sense of sincerity when he talks to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut is a grandstander to some, an articulate speaker who
deftly charms the media while hammering his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chess can blow a lot of wind,'' Smitherman acknowledged, ``but
he's got a lot of substance to back it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Socially influential, Chestnut's law firm also has been
politically powerful.
</P>
<P>
   His law partner Hank Sanders, Rose's husband, is Selma's first
black state senator elected since Reconstruction. In 1986, they
helped form the New South Coalition. The group broke away from the
Alabama Democratic Conference, which had been the state's
traditional black political machine. They immediately challenged
ADC chief Joe Reed, a powerful black member of the state teachers'
union.SOBERING LESSONS
</P>
<P>
   Being a crusader in the 1960s took its toll on Chestnut. Alone
at times in his fight, he got sidetracked by the good times on the
``Drag,'' the cluster of nightspots in black Selma.
</P>
<P>
   He socialized for hours at a time at the clubs, where he could
get a pint of bootleg corn whisky as easily as a barbecue sandwich.
Sometimes he'd have liquor on his breath when he met with King.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got so I'd work about three days a week,'' Chestnut wrote
in his memoir. ``The rest of the time, I got drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   A favorite joint was across from the jail. Sometimes, instead of
waiting to be arrested for public drunkenness, he'd plop himself
down in a cell. In the morning, he'd wake up, see the metal bars,
then scream about his constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't arrest you,'' the jailer would say. ``The door isn't
even locked. Push it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut had once figured his ticket out of Selma was learning
the saxophone so he could play jazz clubs in Harlem. As a teenager,
he played at a graduation dance at the Selma Country Club. He saw
how some whites lived; for the first time, he saw the blue water of
a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut's father, who ran the Chestnut Brothers Market and
Grocery in Selma, warned him about whites. ``If you can help it,''
his father said, ``don't work for them. Work for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chestnut reached 12th grade, tax agents forced his father
out of business; thousands of dollars worth of meat had been
slaughtered during World War II but no tax had been collected. His
father auctioned off food, scales and freezers from the store to
pay the debt. It wasn't enough. The state garnished the wages his
mother and aunt earned as county schoolteachers.
</P>
<P>
   That was one of the incidents that helped shape the conclusion
of ``Black in Selma,'' Chestnut's autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to persuade me that any white person in power wants
to be fair and work on an equal basis with black people. I assume
otherwise,'' Chestnut wrote. ``In my experience, they want you to
agree with them and let them continue to be in charge of
everything. It takes a lot for me to overcome my built-in
suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother and aunt worked overtime at a cigar factory and
borrowed money to send him to college.
</P>
<P>
   At Dillard University in New Orleans, Chestnut stirred
controversy with a class paper. He argued that black leaders taught
accommodation to their constituents instead of telling them that
blacks could hold equal positions with whites.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut concluded that the establishment wrongfully taught,
``Don't lead black America where white America doesn't want it to
go. Keep your place and work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Selma after earning his law degree at Howard
University in Washington, Chestnut learned his courtroom manner
from Peter Hall, a tenacious black trial lawyer from Birmingham.
Along with Arthur Shores, Hall tried Alabama cases for the NAACP
Legal Defense Fund. Thurgood Marshall would pick up the cases and
argue them before the U.S. Supreme Court, which he would later
join.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aggressive acts always leave the opposition trying to figure
out what to do,'' Chestnut observed. ``I began to get a reputation
as a fighter, someone not afraid of the police and judges.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He is not the police officer who killed an unarmed
man on the West Side last month. He is not the officer who tortured
a man in a Brooklyn precinct station house three years ago. He did
not shoot a squeegee man in the Bronx, frequent a Midtown brothel,
run a drug ring from his locker or do anything else to tarnish the
badge that he keeps on a chain around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   He is Officer Eddie Vasquez, and most likely you have never
heard of him. Several days a week, he kisses his wife and two young
daughters goodbye, climbs into his 15-year-old car and joins the
thousands of other Long Island commuters who inch along highways
toward their jobs in the city. His workplace is 5.5 square miles of
Brooklyn known as the 75th Precinct.
</P>
<P>
   The precinct, in East New York, is just eight miles from City
Hall, but it may as well be 800 miles. Off in the distance, the
mayor is trying to smooth over his denigrating comments about an
unarmed black man killed by a police officer; his opponent for the
U.S. Senate, who is new to New York, is questioning his
temperament; black leaders are accusing the police of
institutionalized brutality; and the police commissioner is blaming
the news media.
</P>
<P>
   But Vasquez cares less about their opinions than he does about
those of his commander. His world is a precinct that routinely
leads the borough, if not the city, in homicides, assaults and
other major crimes. He has spent his entire career there, six years
as a uniformed patrolman, the last four with a plainclothes
anticrime unit. He knows its streets and bodegas the way others
know their office halls and cafeterias.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Vasquez said last week, the faraway actions and reactions
of others affect him. The other day a man returned his good-morning
greeting with a curse. Some of the neighborhood children now play a
game of reaching into their pockets with eyes wide _ only to whip
out a wallet in mimicry of the last gestures of Amadou Diallo,
killed last year by four officers who thought he was reaching for a
gun. It is a game that makes his heart leap every time.
</P>
<P>
   He says he understands the outcry when an Amadou Diallo or a
Patrick Dorismond is killed by the police: the need to mourn, the
demand for respect. He does not apologize for or explain away the
actions of officers like Justin Volpe, who so brutalized Abner
Louima three years ago. But why, he asked, does Eddie Vasquez pay
the consequences? Why don't people see that he is one of the good
ones, one of the many who do a difficult and sometimes dangerous
job as best they can?
</P>
<P>
   When no answer presented itself, Vasquez returned to the
us-versus-them thoughts harbored by police officers when feeling
scorned by those they have vowed to protect. He says it time and
again, he said: You're damned if you do and damned if you don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``And unless you're a cop, you'll never understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez is only one officer, of course, in a police force of
nearly 41,000. But his feelings of being misunderstood and
unappreciated are especially acute among the rank-and-file these
days. For one thing, they believe they are underpaid. Those with 20
years of service make about $55,000; their counterparts in the more
peaceful Suffolk County, where Vasquez lives, earn about $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the hidden pressures: to hew to training in
split-second moments of life and death; to ``bend like a reed in
the wind'' when dealing with difficult people; to adapt to
sometimes contradictory policy changes and meet quotas; to block
out that scuffle from just a few hours ago and go home as though it
never happened. To shake off the same broad-brushed stigma that
police officers are so often accused of attaching to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragedy,'' said Eli B. Silverman, a professor at the
John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the author of ``NYPD
Battles Crime: Innovative Strategies in Policing'' (Northeastern
University Press, 1999). ``At a time when crime has gone down so
substantially, we should be in a period of rejoicing. Instead,
we're in a period of recrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene O'Donnell, a former New York police officer and prosecutor
who also teaches at John Jay College, where officers often take
classes, said that many in the police force had no day-to-day
street contact with the public. And when a case like the Dorismond
killing occurs, he said, a desk job seems like home base in a
nerve-racking game of tag.
</P>
<P>
   ``The institutional message for cops is: Who wants to be a
street cop?''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Vasquez does. He has ever since his older sister dated a
police officer back in Brooklyn, when his father worked the docks
at a sugar refinery in Red Hook and his mother kept the home nice.
The boy liked the uniform; it seemed exciting.
</P>
<P>
   He applied to the force when he was in high school, then worked
at various jobs _ video store clerk, construction worker _ until he
got the call five years later. He graduated from the Police Academy
on April 25, 1990, and six months later he was assigned to the 75th
Precinct.
</P>
<P>
   A week or two later, he said, he was pursuing a car that had
fled an area where gunfire had been heard. One of the suspects
leaned out a car window with a machine gun and began spraying
bullets in his direction. It was not until he was in bed several
hours later, after the adrenaline rush and the high-fives over guns
recovered, that he thought, ``What the hell happened to me?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe as a souvenir or maybe as a reminder, Vasquez has kept a
recording of the police-radio reports of that night.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   He is 33, burly, with a handshake that squeezes with sincerity
and a Jets baseball cap tugged over his bristly black hair. Sitting
in the booth of a diner, recalling moments from his career between
bites of a turkey sandwich, Vasquez appeared wise to the ways of
the street but not hardened by them. He shared anecdotes of the
dramatic and the mundane to make points about the job, not to
portray himself as heroic.
</P>
<P>
   One time he was sitting with colleagues in a Roy Rogers
restaurant: a child's balloon popped, he and three other officers
jumped as if reacting to gunfire, and the mother laughed. Another
time he and his partner had just ordered a pizza when reports of a
gunman in a nearby building came over their radios. They drew their
guns and ran out for what turned out to be a false report, then
returned to the pizzeria, guns holstered.
</P>
<P>
   The stunned owner asked: This is what you do?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, they said. And they ate their pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Most officers never shoot their guns, but Vasquez said he had,
twice: once at the driver of a stolen van who had struck his
partner, once to return shots fired at him in a building. Neither
time did he injure or kill. He said he had earned several
commendations, and been the subject of a couple of complaints
lodged with the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the city's
police-watchdog agency. The charges were not substantiated, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   As vexing as those complaints were, he said, ``my worst day on
the job was standing on that bridge.'' That was in 1997, when
thousands of people marched across the Brooklyn Bridge to protest
the Abner Louima case, many of them waving toilet plungers in the
air. Vasquez was assigned to crowd control at the Brooklyn end of
the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that they can't be upset,'' he said, his anger
peeking through his confused smile. ``But I don't deserve to stand
on that bridge and have people spit at me and call me names. It was
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The public anger faded for a while, then came back with the
Diallo killing in February 1999. It intensified with the acquittal
of the four officers who shot him, and now has reached a boil with
the Dorismond death last month. Throughout, Vasquez and his
colleagues have been out there, concentrating less on the politics
of it all than on spurts of crime in corners of their turf.
</P>
<P>
   Even on normal days it is a difficult job. The unit's members
are so well known on the street that it sometimes seems they might
as well wear uniforms. ``They know us,'' explained Officer Jake
O'Neill, a colleague of Vasquez. ``They got our plates, our cars,
our clothes, our faces. They see us coming and they say, `Here we
go.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the moment is a gang terrorizing a certain housing
project. But whenever Vasquez and his colleagues take in suspects,
witnesses are too frightened to pick the gang members out of
lineups. The gang members leave the station house feeling that much
more invincible, Vasquez said, ``and the people are still scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the manifestations of the Giuliani
administration's quality-of-life crackdown. Vasquez did not
criticize the policy; he said it might be contributing to the drop
in crime. But he sees more people acting furtively on the
sidewalks, their hands inside bulging coats. With suspicions of a
concealed gun, he will investigate _ only to find someone hiding an
open beer can, an offense worthy of a summons.
</P>
<P>
   Take all these frustrations, add the current anti-police mood,
and there sits Vasquez, stabbing sandwich crumbs with his finger.
Yeah, you get hassled for stopping people who are riding bicycles
on the sidewalk, but you've seen the reports of armed suspects
fleeing on bicycles. Yeah, an open beer can is a minor offense, but
your training tells you it is against the law, sets a bad example
for children, and can lead to problems later on in the night. Yeah,
there are officers who are bad, racist, brutal, but you don't know
anyone in the seven-five who wouldn't answer a call of distress.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez has another anecdote, this one about a colleague. The
officer was recently wrestling on the ground with an armed man, and
in the middle of the life-and-death struggle, the officer found
himself questioning whether he was being too aggressive. Such
second-guessing in times like these is natural but wrong, Vasquez
said. ``He should have split the guy's head open.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers all have their styles, some more abrasive than others.
Vasquez said he preferred explanation. If there is a report of a
suspect that is maddeningly general _ a young black man in baggy
jeans and dark jacket _ he will stop those who roughly fit the
description, explain what is going on, treat them with the respect
they may not expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight out of ten times that works,'' he said. ``The other two
times, maybe they're having a bad day. Then it's: `Here's the man
in the blue uniform. Let him have it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lunch was over; there were warrants to check, hot spots to sit
on, gang members to bluff. And when his shift ended several hours
later, Eddie Vasquez got into his old car and melted into the Belt
Parkway traffic flowing east.

POLICE DEFEND FATAL SHOOTING IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN and JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police commanders on Saturday defended two undercover
narcotics detectives who fired a hail of bullets at five young men
on a Brooklyn street Friday night, killing two of them, as the
group tried to rob the officers with what turned out to be a toy
pistol and a pellet gun.
</P>
<P>
   The detectives, who had what looked like three handguns placed
menacingly to their chests, heads and backs, whipped out their own
weapons and killed two of the suspects in a barrage of 23
rapid-fire shots at 9:15 p.m. Friday in Bushwick, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the robbers escaped in the confusion of whizzing
bullets and falling bodies, the police said, and when the smoke
cleared, the undercover detectives, and backup officers who had
rushed in, found beside the fatally wounded youths a toy pistol and
a pellet gun, both wrapped in black electrical tape to give them
the look of real semiautomatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings of Tysheen Bourne, 19, and Andre Fields, 17, both
of Brownsville, were still under investigation Saturday, and
details were somewhat sketchy as detectives interviewed the backup
officers and a few other witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of the Brooklyn district attorney, the detectives
who shot the teen-agers were not immediately questioned by
investigators. Nor were they identified publicly; the police said
their names were withheld to preserve their undercover status.
</P>
<P>
   The victims _ both troubled youths with police records _ were
the third and fourth young men killed by undercover officers in one
month, and their deaths drew mixed reactions in Bushwick and
Brownsville. Some residents, voicing concerned over aggressive
police tactics, said the detectives had overreacted, while others
defended the officers, saying they had put themselves at risk in a
high-crime area.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike recent confrontations between citizens and the police
that sent neighborhoods into angry turmoil, the reactions to the
latest shootings were relatively subdued as the realization sunk in
that the officers had acted in what they regarded as self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has emphatically supported the
police in previous shootings and usually focused negative attention
on the victims, was out of the city Saturday and had no immediate
comment, a City Hall spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Police commanders, meantime, strongly defended the shootings as
justified acts of self-defense in the face of what appeared to be
extreme danger and provocation by young men with criminal
histories, and they moved quickly to highlight the differences with
earlier shootings by undercover officers, including that of Patrick
Dorismond in Manhattan two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``These individuals pointed these weapons at the two undercover
officers and proceeded to rob one of the undercovers of his gold
chain and bracelet, and the second undercover was robbed of his
cell phone and wallet,'' Assistant Chief Joseph Esposito, the head
of the Brooklyn North Strategic and Tactical Command, said at a
news conference at Police Headquarters on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside a table on which the toy pistol and the pellet
gun were displayed alongside two deadly weapons, Esposito noted
that the assailants were black and the detectives were Hispanic. He
denied that there were any racial implications, and reconstructed
the events of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The two detectives _ officers for nine and seven years and the
subject of no civilian complaints _ are normally assigned to the
Brooklyn North narcotics squad, but were working overtime Friday as
part of Operation Condor, the citywide drug crackdown that has led
to more than 21,000 arrests this year.
</P>
<P>
   The robbery that went awry, Esposito said, took place in Cooper
Street, near Broadway, in one of the city's most dangerous areas, a
locale known for drug dealing, muggings and other crimes. Earlier
in the evening, the detectives had arrested three drug suspects at
Cooper and Broadway after watching them buy marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   After placing them in custody, the detectives, clad in jeans and
leatherlike jackets, returned to the street and were on the lookout
for drug transactions. As usual, backup officers were hiding nearby
in case of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Esposito said, five men approached, three of them
carrying what appeared to be black semiautomatic handguns. The
assailants surrounded the undercover officers, and at various times
in the brief confrontation placed the guns to the officers' chests,
heads and backs.
</P>
<P>
   One yanked a gold chain from the neck of one of the detectives,
and took a bracelet from him as well. Then the assailants demanded
the second officer's wallet, the chief said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of producing his wallet, however, the detective drew his
.380-caliber Walther PPK semiautomatic and began firing the first
of 18 shots. His partner then drew his Smith &AMP; Wesson service
revolver and fired five rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bourne and Fields, who were both believed to have held the
gunlike objects, were hit numerous times, the police said, though
the number of bullets that struck them, the areas of the body in
which they were hit and other details were unclear pending
autopsies. No shots were fired by backup officers, who rushed up
too late to be directly involved.
</P>
<P>
   As they fell, their companions fled. Fields was pronounced dead
at the scene, while Bourne taken to Woodhull Medical Center, where
he was pronounced dead 30 minutes after the shooting. A wallet
belonging to one of the detectives, and the other's cellular phone,
were found in Bourne's possession, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police emergency units, with bloodhounds and helicopters,
searched the Bushwick area until the early morning Saturday, but no
suspects were found, and the third weapon _ or what appeared to be
a weapon _ was not recovered, the police said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   One witness, Milton Vargas, 27, who had moved into an apartment
on Cooper Street on Friday, entered his building from the street
only minutes before the shootings and remembered seeing two men _
the detectives apparently _ standing outside. He was in his
apartment overlooking the scene when the shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard loud gun shots,'' he recalled. ``I looked out my
window and saw their faces clearly. It was the two guys that I saw
outside standing with their guns drawn. I saw two kids lying in the
street, and there were two guns next to one of them. I told my wife
to move my daughter away from the window.''
</P>
<P>
   Another neighborhood resident, who declined to give a name,
said: ``I heard rapid-fire shots. They sounded like they were
coming from a machine gun. I came out of my house. I saw someone
running down the block. There were dozens of people running around.
I saw someone running down the block. I saw the bodies of the two
kids lying on the street. They looked like babies.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighborhood woman expressed amazement that the slain youths
had approached the undercover detectives unaware that they were
officers, and with fake guns as well. ``If they didn't know these
guys were cops, they were pretty stupid,'' she said. ``Everyone
knows who the undercover cops are in this area. We know what's
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The same woman noted that drugs, muggings and other crimes were
facts of life in her neighborhood, but there was ambivalence in her
attitude toward the police. ``This neighborhood is going
downhill,'' she said. But she added: ``My friends and family are
always being harassed by cops.
</P>
<P>
   Heriberto Perez, 27, a Bushwick resident who heard the shots
from around a corner, said he believed the police ``overreacted,''
saying that ``it was wrong that they pulled out guns on the cops,
but it was wrong that they shot to kill.''
</P>
<P>
   But other residents voiced support for the presence of
undercover officers. ``We need undercover work here,'' said Larry
Bethune, 28, who said residents were often afraid to leave their
homes at night because of drug dealing and robberies. ``I think
what they did was right. The police didn't know the gun was fake.
They did what they had to do. They might have gotten killed.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, an officer who was listening walked over, shook
Bethune's hand, and said, ``Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   The police were careful to contrast the latest shootings with
those of two unarmed men recently, Dorismond and Malcolm Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, an off-duty security guard, was shot on Mar. 16
outside a bar in Manhattan in a scuffle with an officer backing up
another undercover officer. Dorismond had first taken offense at
being approached and asked for drugs, and then lunged at the one
who shot him, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson was killed in a struggle with a narcotics officer on
the stairway of a Bronx building two blocks from the doorway where
Amadou Diallo was slain in a hail of 41 bullets in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The victims of the shooting Friday night were described by
acquaintances friends as troubled.

KWAN ON TOP OF WORLD AFTER HER THIRD TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICE, France _ Back in the warm-up room while her Russian
opponents took the ice with gold medals on their minds, Michelle
Kwan lay down, stretched and told herself: ``Michelle, you skated
the best program of your life. Whatever happens, be happy, be
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan, who had skated first in the final group, had indeed
performed a marvelous free program on the last day of these world
championships.
</P>
<P>
   But because she had held back too much earlier in the week and
came into this free program in third place, Kwan had to wait,
stretch, think and hope that her rivals Mariya Butryskaya and Irina
Slutskaya would not be able to match her excellence.
</P>
<P>
   It would work out just that way. Kwan captured the gold,
Slutskaya the silver and Butryskaya the bronze. And as Kwan left
the calm of the warm-up room and shared the medal podium with the
Russians after winning the title, a tear slid slowly down her left
cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a very emotional person, and I think I must
have cried 5,000 times,'' she said. ``But I think it was more
satisfaction and a feeling of, this may not happen again. This
moment, you have to cherish it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her free skating program had been a blend of eye-catching
technical difficulty and fluid moves set to a subdued, complex
piece of music that never had the French fans clapping along with
her until the final strains had faded away and the broadest of
grins had spread across Kwan's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's learned more and more that you can't hold back
and achieve anything,'' her coach, Frank Carroll, would say later.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan is fortunate in a way. Many champions in sport dominate and
then fade steadily from prominence. But at only 19, she has had
ample occasions to understand the ephemeral nature of a gold medal:
winning her first world title in 1996, losing in 1997, winning
again in 1998 and losing again last year in Helsinki, Finland, when
Butryskaya became the oldest women's champion in history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, less than a year after leaving the familiar cocoon of her
training center in Lake Arrowhead, Calif., and enrolling at UCLA,
she is back on top again. ``What happened to the odd years?'' Kwan
said Saturday with a laugh before putting this title, her most
unexpected title, in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the most satisfying championship for me,'' she
said. ``There was a lot of pressure from outside: `You've got to do
triple-triple; got to do this; got to up the ante.' And I was able
to work after nationals with Frank for six straight weeks making
the programs more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Carroll, Kwan has never performed two more
technically demanding programs back-to-back. In her short program
on Friday, she inserted a triple flip in place of a triple toe loop
and had only a slight bobble on one of her landings.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, she landed six triple jumps very cleanly in the
first two minutes of her free program and finished with a total of
seven, including a triple toe-triple toe combination which turned
out to be the only clean triple-triple combination of the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   To win the world title was reward for a regimen in which Kwan
had scaled back on training in the fall, but shifted the balance
back toward skating in the winter, when she moved out of the dorm
and took fewer classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year has been completely different for me,'' Kwan said.
``It's been a lot of fun. The first quarter at school was hard. I
had a full load and competitions coming up. I didn't skate as much
as I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   A thrilled Kwan added, ``It's looking good for 2002!'' after
becoming the first American since Peggy Fleming's consecutive
victories from 1966 to 1968 to take three world titles.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I think it was the most satisfying competition for me. I
skated the best program of my life. People kept saying, `She's got
to do a triple-triple,' and I really focused on them after the
nationals,'' said Kwan, who struggled to hold on to her national
title and fell during a triple-toe jump last month in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan had six triples and two back-to-back for the first time in
her competitive career to earn the top votes of seven of the nine
judges with marks that ranged from 5.6 to 5.8 for technical
difficulty and a string of 5.8s and 5.9s for presentation.

NEIGHBORS OPEN ARMS TO NEW GROUP HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By COREY KILGANNON

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Saturday on Glebe Avenue, a sunny residential
street in the Bronx, the scene at first glance resembled the first
day of college.
</P>
<P>
   Parents helped their children carry golf clubs, stereos and
piano keyboards into new rooms. Smiling staff members standing in
front of balloons and a ``Welcome'' sign greeted and introduced new
roommates.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the newcomers were indeed moving away from home for the
first time, but most were in their 30s and 40s and their parents
were mostly elderly.
</P>
<P>
   These were mildly retarded adults moving into the Glebe Avenue
Residence, a group home that opened Saturday in Castle Hill, a
working-class neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to miss my dad,'' said Lee Jarvis, 35, as he put his
arm around his father, Lee Williams, 79. Williams had bypass
surgery twice last year and is feeling less able to give his son
the daily support he has always needed living in their Harlem
apartment, where he has spent his entire life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife, Lee's mother, died a few years ago, and I'm living
day to day healthwise now,'' Williams said. ``Now at least I know
he's safe here if anything happens to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis met his roommate, Freddy Allen, 40, who was also moving
away for the first time from his home in the Bronx. Allen's mother,
Carole Allen, 61, helped him unpack the neatly folded shirts he had
brought with him.
</P>
<P>
   Outside on the street, residents greeted their new neighbors.
Margaret Strapac and Mary Proscio, who have both lived on the block
for 50 years, stood across the street from the newly renovated
three-story home and watched residents unpack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great they're moving in,'' Strapac said. ``We
were afraid we were going to have drug addicts moving in.''
</P>
<P>
   The home is run by the YAI/National Institute for People with
Disabilities, which operates 80 group homes in the metropolitan
region. A year ago, YAI planned to buy two attached houses on
Zulette Avenue in the nearby East Tremont area to use as
assisted-living homes for retarded adults.
</P>
<P>
   Since state law requires that such proposals receive community
approval, the organization submitted its plan to Community Board
10. But many residents near the proposed site complained that there
were already several group homes in the area and voiced their
opposition through petitions and at several raucous meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Then some members of the community board suggested two other
sites, one on East Tremont Avenue, where YAI will open a group home
later this year, and the other a vacant house on Glebe Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time I've ever heard of this happening
successfully,'' said James Vacca, the community board's district
manager. ``So often, when a community suggests alternate sites, it
really means somewhere out in the wilderness.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the alternate sites were in similar neighborhoods. At
the Glebe Avenue location, many of the neighborhood residents
signed a petition circulated by a Board 10 member welcoming the
facility.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This was not a `not in my back yard' issue for the original
site,'' said State Sen. Guy Velella, who represents the area. ``It
was simply not appropriate to further saturate that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Community Board 10 includes mostly low-crime, middle-class
neighborhoods in the northeast Bronx. The board district has 40
adult group homes for the disabled, the most by far of any district
in the Bronx, Vacca said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have many desirable areas that nonprofits want to move
into,'' he said. ``Yes, there should be a proportionality
borough-wide, but still, we can't just say no to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Glebe Avenue home has several staff members who try to keep
the eight residents on a normal working schedule on weekdays, and
in counseling and organized recreation activities in the evenings
and at weekends. Most of YAI's clients need some daily support and
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly $60,000 annual cost of keeping a resident in a home
is largely financed through the Medicaid allowance for each
resident.
</P>
<P>
   Elderly parents of mentally retarded children are concerned that
there will be no one to care for their children after they die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these people really waited for a long time to get into
these homes,'' said Thomas A. Dern, YAI's associate executive
director. ``You have elderly parents so frantic that they make
suicide pacts, where the child agrees to die if the parent dies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among elderly parents who take care of their retarded
children, I often hear, `I hope my child will die before I do.'
It's a terrible position to be in to feel that at least I can die
easy knowing my child won't end up in the street or dying because
of neglect.''

IN CHICAGO, TWO BETS ON AN AREA'S REVIVAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill.)   (jw) 
 By ROBERT SHAROFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The first new market-rate housing to be built in many
decades is raising hopes that South Shore, a faded jewel of a
neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago, is due for a revival.
</P>
<P>
   The area, about 20 blocks south of the University of Chicago's
Hyde Park campus and about seven miles south of the Loop, the
downtown business district, has a lot going for it: access to Lake
Michigan; grand, historic architecture; and housing values that
have remained stable, if depressed, for many years.
</P>
<P>
   South Shore came into being in the late 1890s in the wake of the
1893 Columbian Exposition in nearby Jackson Park. The crown jewel
of the neighborhood is the former South Shore Country Club, a
65-acre lakefront property that includes a beach, golf course,
tennis courts, a riding arena and an imposing Mediterranean-style
palazzo of a clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The clubhouse, which is on the National Register of Historic
Places, was designed in 1916 by the Chicago firm of Marshall &AMP; Fox,
which also designed the Drake Hotel downtown as well as some of the
most exclusive apartment buildings on Lake Shore Drive. The
highlight is a much-photographed ballroom _ ``an enormous glass box
with a Wedgwood lid'' is how the ``A.I.A. Guide to Chicago''
describes it _ that remains popular for weddings and parties.
</P>
<P>
   The entire country club was brought by the city in 1973 and now
serves as a cultural and recreational area. The neighborhood is
bounded, roughly, by 67th Street on the north, 79th Street on the
south, Stony Island Avenue on the west and the lake on the east.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, South Shore also had one of the largest and most
elegant commercial districts in the city, which was concentrated
around the neighborhood's main thoroughfare, 71st Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were lots of boutiques and chic salons, and I remember
having to dress up in lace socks and patent-leather shoes to go
shopping there,'' said Leslie Hairston, a neighborhood resident for
more than 30 years and now alderman for South Shore.
</P>
<P>
   No one would describe the street as elegant today. The little
retailing that remains consists primarily of fast-food restaurants
and convenience and liquor stores.
</P>
<P>
   For much of its history, South Shore was known as a largely
Jewish and Irish neighborhood. In the 1960s it underwent a change
as, in the wake of a 1948 Supreme Court ruling that had struck down
the city's restrictive housing covenants, more and more black
residents moved into areas of Chicago that had long been denied to
them.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the neighborhood is home to some of the most prominent
black Chicagoans, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Shore never really fell into the disinvestment cycle
that happened in other neighborhoods that underwent a racial
change,'' said Helen Dunlap, the president of South Shore Advisory
Services, a division of South Shore Bank. ``The neighborhood is 90
percent African-American, but that doesn't mean poor. According to
our research, there are 8,500 college graduates living in the area
and over 5,000 households with incomes of $50,000 or more.''
</P>
<P>
   Two things kept South Shore going, longtime residents say: Its
housing stock, much of which is excellent, and the efforts of South
Shore Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a number of a notable lakefront apartment
buildings, there is a three-street neighborhood within a
neighborhood called Jackson Park Highlands that has some of the
most palatial prewar mansions in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The houses and apartments are second to none in Chicago in
terms of aesthetics and the quality of the buildings,'' said
William Trammell, a Coldwell Banker broker.
</P>
<P>
   The South Shore Bank was taken over by Milton Davis and three
other investors in 1974 and given the mission of stabilizing the
area and encouraging new investment in the wake of the racial
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the real estate and financial interests in the city
had decided that South Shore was headed for abandonment and
demolition,'' said Davis, chairman of the bank and a longtime
resident. ``We thought the area had a lot of assets and advantages
that were not being acknowledged. Our goal was to give residents
the resources to rebuild the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, that goal has been met. Over the years, the
bank, with assets of $900 million, has written thousands of
mortgages in South Shore and is by far the main residential
mortgage broker in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Through an affiliate, the Shorebank Development Corp., it has
also built about 5,000 rental apartments _ some of them subsidized
_ in South Shore and Austin, another depressed neighborhood on the
city's west side. But it has steered clear of market-rate housing
because, until now, the neighborhood could not support it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Shorebank is betting that the boom in city living that has
revitalized many older neighborhoods in the last decade has reached
South Shore. The development company recently broke ground on
Lakeshore Pointe, with 87 town houses and condominiums at 71st
Street and South Shore Drive, across the street from the old South
Shore Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   The $15 million project was designed by FitzGerald &AMP; Associates,
a leading residential architecture firm in Chicago, and is the
first extensive middle- to upper-income housing development for
sale in the neighborhood since World War II. Units are priced from
$145,000 to $350,000, and 31 have already been sold. If all goes as
planned, the first residents will move in this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, we're leading the market in terms of
price,'' said Cindy Holler, a vice president of Shorebank
Development. ``But I also don't think there's any question that
we'll get it. The early sales prove that.''
</P>
<P>
   The buyers at Lakeshore Pointe are a mix of young professionals
and families, and about half already live in South Shore.
</P>
<P>
   One who does not is Robert Brown, a college administrator who
now lives in Lincoln Park, the prominent lakefront neighborhood on
the North Side.
</P>
<P>
   So why is he moving to South Shore? ``The housing stock is
awfully nice,'' he said. ``And I really like that the cultural
center and golf course are right across the street. It's also a
very good deal. I just see all kinds of really neat possibilities.
I think South Shore is on its way back.''
</P>
<P>
   Lakeshore Point has already spurred further development in South
Shore. Just across the street is a neo-Gothic 1923 apartment
building that is being renovated into 76 condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   The developer of the block-long project, called the Park Waters,
is the the Poter Construction and Development Co. of Chicago, which
is spending about $6 million on the renovation, expected to be
finished next year. Apartment prices will range from $79,000 for
one bedroom to the low $200,000s for three bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real estate market is hot right now, and South Shore is
positioned to be a low-cost alternative to Hyde Park,'' said Gary
Poter, the company's owner. ``We've also had a lot of interest from
young people who grew up in South Shore and then moved to other
parts of the city. They'd like to return, but up until now there
hasn't been any new housing to speak of.''

IN ALL OF NEW YORK, HIGH GOES HIGHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DENNIS HEVESI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No getting away from it: Everywhere in New York City
home prices keep climbing _ from the rarefied heights of Manhattan
where 11 apartments have sold for $10 million or more so far this
year, compared with just six in all of 1999, to every single ZIP
code area in the city's other boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   A studio apartment in Manhattan costs 31 percent more than it
did only a year ago, one survey says; a one-bedroom, 29 percent
more. A family's income now needs to exceed $100,000 to cover the
costs of a well-kept brownstone in Harlem, according to the
president of the neighborhood's real estate board.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of a one-bedroom condominium in Astoria, Queens, which
was $95,000 in 1998, climbed to $120,000 in '99. And a detached
colonial in Forest Hills that sold for $267,000 in 1996 went for _
``Are you ready?'' the broker said _ $417,000 last year. Even in
struggling East New York, Brooklyn, the average price for a
single-family house rose 8.4 percent in 1999, from $140,789 to
$152,585.
</P>
<P>
   One family tried to get away, however briefly, from this frantic
house-buying scene, said Susan Goldy, the president of the Bronx
brokerage company that bears her name, and it cost them their dream
house.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled into a hillside in Riverdale, the Mediterranean-style
three-bedroom with a terrace and sunken living room had been
snatched up _ verbally _ for $515,000. ``Then the couple went on
vacation,'' Goldy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came back a week later, and there were three offers
beyond theirs,'' she said, ``and now the house is selling at
$565,000'' _ a $50,000 leap in only two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last people, the ones accepted at $565,000, told the
seller that they were going on vacation,'' Goldy said. ``He, in
turn, told them they had to sign the contract, have everything
done, before they left or no deal.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's a good thing, Goldy said, ``because there are now other
interested parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, so many interested parties _ particularly in buyer-maddening
Manhattan _ are bidding with abandon. ``The bidding is where the
rubber meets the road, a hint of where we're going,'' said Barbara
Corcoran, the chairwoman of Corcoran Group. ``We have dozens of
buyers for every good apartment and a half dozen for every one
that's not so good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months ago,'' Corcoran said, ``our average overbid was 8
percent, meaning the offer over asking price. Since January, that
has jumped to 14 percent. To me, overbids tell more of the story
than the sales prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Henckels doesn't quite know what tale is being told by the
prices in his stratospheric market niche. Henckels is the director
of Stribling Private Brokerage, specializing in homes selling for
at least $3 million, ``but given the increases of the last three
years,'' he said, ``we're probably going to have to double that.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially puzzling is a sudden burst of ionospheric activity.
``All of last year, there were six prewar co-ops in Manhattan that
closed at $10 million or above,'' Henckels said. ``Now, in the
first three months of 2000 there have been 11,'' the highest about
$35 million for the 17,000-square-foot apartment at 740 Park Ave.
once owned by John D. Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows?'' Henckels said when asked why there is suddenly so
much rare-air movement. ``This very high end of the market is
usually conservative, even though the expenditure is a relative
pittance to them. When this group buys, they seem to do it en
masse, as if they'd gotten on the phone the night before and said,
`Let's go shopping tomorrow.' I've watched this for 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But even for regular folks, housing costs keep climbing. For the
second straight year, according to the repeat-sales survey
conducted by Case Shiller Weiss, a real estate statistics company,
prices appreciated last year in every one of the 130 ZIP code areas
in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island (the survey does
not include Manhattan). In 1997, by comparison, 14 areas saw prices
drop, and in 1996 the number was 30.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's house-price picture is not all that different
from that of the nation and the rest of the region, except for one
significant aspect. In 1999, for the fourth straight year, the
national median price for an existing single-family home set a
record, rising to $133,300 from $128,400 in 1998. In the region,
the median price hit $208,000 last year, up from $187,400 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, said Rae Rosen, the senior regional economist
for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is that, even more than
its suburbs, the city is ``pretty much landlocked, so we're bidding
up a fixed supply.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, with the economy in its 109th month of
expansion (the longest in history), with the stock market pumping
out bonuses and dividends and with consumer confidence strong,
buyers are out in force.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, more and more of them are out there because more
people are working. ``The job picture in New York City has been
exceptionally strong in recent years,'' said John Weiting, the
regional commissioner of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics,
``and in 1999 employment in the city's private sector gained more
momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   The city added 81,000 private-sector jobs during 1999, raising
the total to 3.1 million. ``The 1999 increase topped the 76,000
gain in 1998,'' Weiting said, ``with the number of jobs added the
largest for any year in nearly half a century.'' Between 1989 and
1992, during a deep downturn, the city lost 321,000 private-sector
jobs. But by last December, the unemployment rate was 6 percent,
down from 7.6 percent the year before and down from 11.3 percent in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Rising mortgage rates might be expected to take some of the
house-buying steam out of that expanding work force, and financing
costs have certainly risen recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at about four-year highs for the standard 30-year,
fixed-rate mortgage, hovering near 8.3 percent,'' said Keith
Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage statistics
company in Butler, N.J. ``But as you might expect, a steady rise in
fixed rates has given resurgence to adjustable-rate mortgages,''
which offer a lower-cost alternative to traditional fixed-rate
financing, at least for a time _ usually three, five, seven or 10
years _ before they are adjusted downward, with any luck, but quite
possibly up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some 30 percent of mortgages being originated right now have
some form of adjustable rate, up sharply from 10 percent in January
'99,'' Gumbinger said. ``And part of the reason home sales have
done so well is because there are these alternatives to rising
fixed rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the reason, in Corcoran's view, is that the
rising rates ``have only added fuel to the fire and increased the
urgency to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are asking, `If not now, when will I buy?''' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All of which leaves Rosen of the Federal Reserve optimistic
about the city's housing prospects. ``You know what's exciting?''
she said. ``Twenty years ago, it used to be that 96th Street in
Manhattan was sort of a cut-off, and now you can keep going, and
the health of the area is clear for almost another 30 blocks.
Storefronts are no longer closed up. There are new window frames
all over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go right outside Forest Hills in Queens, it looks like
a mini-United Nations,'' Rosen continued. ``It's astounding how
various groups have migrated to the United States and invigorated
communities. There's a similar robust Russian community that has
created million-dollar homes in parts of Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Schill, the director of the Center for Real Estate and
Urban Policy at the New York University School of Law, is a little
less sanguine. Given recently released data from the city's 1999
Housing and Vacancy Survey, he said, ``one might be surprised by
the rapid increase in prices over the past few years.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey shows that between 1996 and 1999 the rate of increase
for the city's housing supply outpaced population growth. Over
those three years, housing units rose by 1.5 percent while the
city's population went up 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet, despite the fact that housing supply was increasing
faster than population, vacancy rates actually declined,'' Schill
pointed out, from 4.01 percent in 1996 to 3.19 percent in 1999.
Five percent is the statutory benchmark for declaring a housing
emergency, allowing rent regulations to be continued.
</P>
<P>
   There has been considerable increase in residential
construction. In 1999, building permits for 12,421 housing units
were issued, according to the Department of City Planning, a 19.6
percent increase over the 10,387 units authorized in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Schill offers several reasons why the housing crunch has
continued, even though construction outpaced population growth.
Pointing out that between 1996 and 1999, the city's median
household income rose by 11.5 percent, from $29,600 to $33,000, he
said: ``First, families were able to pay more for housing and,
therefore, bid up sales prices and rents. Second, households that
were doubled up with friends and relatives are now be able to move
into their own homes.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Census Bureau may be underestimating
population growth. ``This seems likely,'' Schill said, ``given that
we are experiencing extremely high levels of immigration, a
substantial portion of which is probably illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Other causes for the crunch: Most of the new construction is
luxury rental apartments, not co-ops or condominiums, and
conversions of existing buildings to co-ops and condominiums are,
at best, rare.
</P>
<P>
   All of which pushes up prices.
</P>
<P>
   Divining real estate trends by the numbers is, at best, a murky
exercise. To begin with, co-op sales are not officially recorded
because, technically, they are securities transactions involving
the selling of shares, and not transfers of title. Condominium
sales, however, are officially recorded. As a result, brokerage
houses and appraisal concerns that do studies of co-op data do not
claim to include all transactions in the market.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some market surveys report average prices,
while others use a median _ meaning half the prices are above that
figure and half below. Still, the numbers, along with anecdotal
impressions, can serve as barometers of market patterns.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, the median price for all residential sales _
combining co-op and condominium transfers _ from the Battery north
to West 116th Street and East 96th Street was $320,000 in 1999, up
14.3 percent from $280,000 in 1998, according to Jonathan Miller,
the president of Miller Samuel, the appraisal company that prepares
perhaps the most comprehensive sales survey, the Douglas Elliman
Manhattan Market Report. The number of sales for the same area of
Manhattan was 8,154, up 8.1 percent from the 7,542 transactions in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   For studios, the Elliman report said, the median price was
$136,000, up 12.4 percent from $121,000 in 1998. For one-bedrooms,
it was $260,000, up 10.6 percent from $235,000. The median for
two-bedrooms was $595,000, up 9.2 percent from $545,000; for
three-bedrooms, $1,595,000, up 25.1 percent from $1,275,000. And
for four or more bedrooms, it was $3.4 million, up 13.1 percent
from $3,006,145.
</P>
<P>
   The Real Estate Board of New York offers a localized assessment.
</P>
<P>
   The median price for prewar apartments on the East Side, between
42nd and 96th streets was $632,500, up 7 percent from $592,500 in
1998. For postwar apartments on the East Side, the median was
$350,000, up 40 percent from $250,000. On the West Side, from 42nd
Street to 110th Street, prewar apartments sold for a median of
$432,500, up 31 percent from 1998, when it was $329,000; and for
postwar apartments it was $316,000, up 36 percent from $232,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Heym, the chief economist for the real estate board,
explained that according to the board's guidelines, a studio
usually contains one to two and a half rooms with, perhaps, a
separate kitchen and an alcove. One-bedrooms run from two and a
half to four rooms with a living room, a kitchen and, perhaps, a
dining area. Two-bedrooms run from four to seven rooms;
three-bedrooms from five and a half to 10 rooms including, perhaps,
a maid's room and a library, and four-bedroom apartments contain 11
or more rooms.
</P>
<P>
   For everything south of 42nd Street, prewar and postwar
combined, Heym said, the median price was $264,500, up 30 percent
from the 1998 figure of $202,800.
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly a seller's market. ``There's one thing holding
people back when you talk to them,'' Heym said. ``They say, `I'd
love to sell, but then where am I going to go?'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Miller pointed out that the overall numbers _ that 14.3 percent
rise for all co-ops and condos _ may be misleading. ``Because the
economy is so good, due to Wall Street, Silicon Alley and the
entertainment sectors, there's a lot of entry-level younger buyers
moving into the market,'' he said. Those buyers tend toward studios
and one-bedroom apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because so many more smaller apartments are transferring,''
Miller said, ``they pull the overall prices down so that a reader
of the statistics may not fully appreciate how much prices have
actually increased.''
</P>
<P>
   Corcoran appreciates it. ``We had, last week, a large
two-bedroom on Fifth Avenue that every broker agreed was grossly
overpriced,'' she said. ``It was overbid by three buyers, 33
percent over asking, from $1.8 million up to $2.4 million.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was stunned,'' Corcoran said, ``including the
hard-to-shock seller.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark Halstead, the founder of Halstead Property Co., tried to
put it in perspective. ``Take a Park Avenue building in the high
80s, a distinguished prewar where there are numerous six-room
apartments,'' he said. ``Classic Sixes'' are considered the
prototypical family apartments in Manhattan: living room, dining
room, kitchen, two bedrooms and a maid's room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our records show that four sales of this six-room type in 1990
averaged $606,000,'' Halstead said, ``and in 1999, four more sold _
not the same ones _ for an average of $1,320,000. That's a 120
percent increase.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The hue and cry of the cocktail party circuit is that
apartment prices have gone berserk,'' Halstead said. ``But compare
that 120 percent to financial assets, like the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500, which went up 400 percent over the decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Heiberger is the president of Citi Habitats, which
focuses on the expanding downtown market. ``My average number of
calls for people willing to spend $1 million or more has doubled,
to two a day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tight rental market is driving up sales prices, Heiberger
said, as is ``the fact that many proposed conversions from
commercial to residential were canceled because the commercial
market went so crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Citi Habitat sales, the median price for a studio
below 14th Street was $165,000 last year, compared with $135,000 in
1998, a 22.2 percent increase. For one-bedrooms, it was $260,000,
up 20.9 percent from $215,000. Two-bedrooms climbed to $462,000, up
21.9 percent from $380,000. And three-bedrooms were $720,000, up
9.1 percent from $660,000.
</P>
<P>
   The upper uptown market is getting pricey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just this winter,'' said R. Kenyatta Punter, the president of
the Greater Harlem Board of Realtors, ``a one-family, three-story
brownstone at 416 Convent sold for $660,000.'' In 1998, it would
have sold for $600,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other than in dilapidated buildings requiring renovation or
government-subsidized new construction, ``it's becoming
increasingly difficult for persons making $50,000 to $70,000 to
find home-ownership opportunities in the Harlem community,'' Punter
said. ``Your income really has to exceed $100,000 in order to make
the kind of purchase I cited.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no central source for price data, by the dollar, for
Brooklyn. But by another measure of the market, the Case Shiller
Weiss repeat-sales index, the direction is clear: every one of the
borough's 36 ZIP code areas saw prices rise last year.
</P>
<P>
   The survey is based on a table showing the average price for all
single-family homes sold by ZIP code area, year by year. To
determine price fluctuations in 1999, the survey took the purchase
price of each home sold in each ZIP code area during the year,
compared it to the price the house brought the last time it sold,
and then, using the annual index, adjusted the earlier price to
what it likely would have been had it sold in 1998. The 1999 prices
for homes within each ZIP code area were then compared with the
estimated 1998 prices to compute the change.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 36 Brooklyn areas, one increased by up to 4 percent, 34
by 4 percent to 8 percent and one _ Bay Ridge _ by 8 percent to 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the rise was universal over all the areas that we deal
with,'' said Christopher Thomas, William B. May Co.'s senior vice
president for Brooklyn, ``there are certain areas with houses at
the lower end of our price spectrum that rose higher than those in
more established communities.'' Thomas' company specializes in the
more affluent areas of the borough, like Brooklyn Heights, with
neighborhoods like Fort Greene at that lower end of the company's
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where in late '98 a four-story town house in Fort Greene was
selling for $635,000,'' Thomas said, ``there's one currently in
contract for $850,000.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn Heights, a year ago, he said, at least half a dozen
brownstones were listed for under $2 million, while now all but two
are listed between $2 million and $3 million. ``Last year, you
could still buy one-bedroom apartments in the $150,000 to $200,000
range; now they go for closer to $300,000,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn's less affluent communities are also appreciating.
Jacob Shayovitz, a certified appraiser and the president of the
Brooklyn Board of Realtors, cited one section of East New York
where the average price last year was $140,789, up 8.4 percent from
$152,586. ``It shows that people are taking more pride in home
ownership, maintaining them better,'' Shayovitz said. In one area
of middle-income Midwood, he said, ``homes sold for an average of
$299,231 in 1998; in 1999, for $301,729.''
</P>
<P>
   In Queens, according to the Long Island Board of Realtors, which
covers the borough, the median price in December was $190,000, up
2.7 percent from $185,000 in 1998. And according to the Case
Shiller survey, 13 of the borough's 57 ZIP code areas experienced
increases up to 4 percent, 24 by 4 percent to 8 percent, 18 by 8
percent to 12 percent and two _ Fresh Meadows and Howard Beach _ by
12 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Frechter, the president of Glenjay Realty in Forest
Hills, said she sold a three-bedroom detached colonial between
Austin Street and Queens Boulevard for $267,000 at the end of 1996,
``and in '99 it sold for _ are you ready? _ $417,500.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The same person we sold that house for bought in Cord Meyer,
the north side of Queens Boulevard where there are large, beautiful
homes,'' Frechter said. ``That house had five bedrooms, a kind of
custom-built split, and it sold for $550,000.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A two-bedroom co-op on Queens Boulevard that sold for $85,000 in
1998, she said, ``would now be $95,000 to $100,000, absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   In Astoria, ``because it's so close to the city,'' Frechter
said, a one-bedroom condominium that sold for $85,000 to $95,000 a
year ago ``is now selling for $120,000.''
</P>
<P>
   And a three-family, semidetached house in Astoria that sold for
$270,000 in 1998 ``went for $370,000 in '99,'' Frechter said, a
whopping 37 percent jump.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics kept by the Bronx Board of Realtors are
incomplete. But the Case Shiller report indicated that all 25 of
the borough's ZIP code areas saw prices increase: one by up to 4
percent, 23 by 4 percent to 8 percent and one _ Throgs Neck _ by 8
percent to 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One broker, Haniff Baksh, the vice president of ERA Besmatch,
conducted his own survey, based on deed transfers recorded by the
Department of Buildings. For Throgs Neck, Pelham Parkway and
Mosholu in the northeast Bronx, 1999 prices averaged $180,000 for a
one-family home and $230,000 for a two-family.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '98, those numbers were slightly less, about $170,000 for a
one-family and $220,000 for a two-family,'' Baksh said. In the
once-desolate South Bronx, single-family homes now average
$150,000, compared with about $135,000 a year ago, Baksh said,
while two-family homes average $200,000, up 10 percent from
$180,000 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of investor activity helping to revitalize these
areas,'' he said. ``There's some subsidized housing, of course, but
that's not the bulk of it; this is private activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldy, the broker in Riverdale, cited rapid-fire price rises in
her neighborhood. ``We closed on a combination apartment _ two
one-bedrooms _ in July at $250,000,'' she said. ``And the very same
apartment, for unusual reasons, came back on the market in January
and sold for $275,000.''
</P>
<P>
   A one-bedroom co-op on Kappock Street sold for $50,000 in
December 1998, she said, ``and we closed on another one-bedroom in
the same building in January 2000 for $74,000.''
</P>
<P>
   On Staten Island, said Sandy Krueger, the executive vice
president of the borough's Board of Realtors, the median price for
single-family homes was $177,000 in 1999, a 7.3 percent increase
over 1998's $165,000. For two-family homes, it was $250,000, up
14.7 percent from $218,000. And for condominiums and co-ops, the
median was $107,000, an 18.9 percent jump from $90,000. According
to Case Shiller, all 12 ZIP code areas on Staten Island saw prices
increase by 4 percent to 8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Getting site-specific, Krueger said that ``in West Brighton, on
the north shore, the median for single-family homes was $151,500,''
a 25.2 percent increase over $121,000. For two-families, it was
$159,900, 10.3 percent over 1998's $145,000.
</P>
<P>
   For Heartland Village, in mid-island, the single-family median
was $202,000, 12.2 percent over $180,000; and for two-families, it
was $279,900, a 14.2 percent increase over $245,000 in 1998. And in
Huguenot, on the south shore, the median for single-family homes
hit $355,000, up 8.7 percent over $326,500 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas of William B. May in Brooklyn proffered perhaps the only
sure-fire solution for price-battered buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a couple selling a co-op in Brooklyn Heights who signed
a contract to purchase a town house in Prospect-Lefferts for
$325,000,'' Thomas said. ``The house closing took longer than
expected because they had to sell their co-op.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they didn't go through with the deal they would forfeit
their 10 percent deposit,'' he said. ``Then, coincidentally, during
that delay, they inherited a house in Westchester.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though they were not going to live in the Prospect-Lefferts
house, the couple decided to go through with the deal, and then put
it on the market. ``We sold it immediately for $375,000 _ a $50,000
profit,'' Thomas said. ``It just indicates the degree to which the
market rose over just that four-month period.''
</P>
<P>
   A postscript: The couple had bought their Brooklyn Heights co-op
in 1996 for $120,000. They sold it for $320,000. ``They made out
pretty well,'' Thomas said.

A NEW PLAYER ENTERS THE CAMPAIGN SPENDING FRAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (REMOVES ``CREEP'' from 3rd graf.) 
 (mk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ George Gorton is hardly a political novice.
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years, since he was a college student supporting James L.
Buckley's campaign for the U.S. Senate from New York, he has worked
for candidates from Richard Nixon to Pete Wilson to Boris Yeltsin.
But even he had not thought much about Section 527 of the Internal
Revenue Code _ at least not until last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was walking around complaining to everybody that I could
find about the amount of money that organized labor was spending on
issue advocacy,'' said Gorton, who cut his teeth as national
college coordinator for Nixon's Committee for the Re-election of
the President, in 1972. ``And somebody said to me, `George, that's
their First Amendment right.' And I decided labor wasn't wrong to
do it; they were right to do it, and so I decided pro-business
people should do it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So Gorton, who runs a Republican consulting business based in
San Diego, started Shape the Debate, a nonprofit political
organization that, under Section 527, can raise and spend unlimited
amounts of money, with no disclosure requirements for donors, as
long as it does not expressly advocate the election or defeat of
any candidate. Its inaugural television advertisement, which began
airing this week in California and New York, accuses Vice President
Al Gore of political hypocrisy, in a mock game show in which
contestants answer questions on various topics, including Gore's
support for campaign finance overhaul despite his appearance at an
illegal fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shape the Debate strongly believes that free enterprise and
conservative ideas are more likely to become public policy when
candidates and public officials honestly and publicly discuss their
positions on them,'' according to the group's credo, which can be
found on its Web site, shapethedebate.com. ``Shape the Debate will
therefore use stinging ads of rebuke, where appropriate, or gentle
praise to remind leading candidates and public officials to
honestly discuss our issues, as a means to keep conservative and
free enterprise issues uppermost in the minds of the American
public.''
</P>
<P>
   The group is among the latest entrants in a growing field of
independent campaign expenditure efforts, spurred on by recent
court rulings interpreting the tax law. The group's literature
emphasizes that contributions are not a matter of public record,
and Gorton said that was an appealing point for donors, most of
them Republicans and many of them Californians who supported
Wilson's past campaigns for governor and senator. So far the group
has raised about $1.5 million, in chunks of multiple thousands of
dollars; Gorton hopes to raise another $2 million to $3 million for
advertising campaigns this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the atmosphere that's been created by the Clinton-Gore
administration, where the secret FBI files of Republican appointees
turned up in White House hands, you have to wonder about
retribution,'' he said. ``The heart of the First Amendment is that
you can criticize your government without fear of retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who was forced out of office by term limits last year,
has helped raise money for the group. As governor, he tangled
repeatedly with public employee unions that undertook campaigns
opposing his policies, and former Wilson aides say they see the
latest effort as a way of evening the score a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television is what really does shape the debate,'' said
Wilson, who since last fall has been working for Pacific Capital,
an investment banking concern in Beverly Hills. ``The candidates
certainly have that obligation, and sometimes they fulfill it and
sometimes they don't. But the fact is, there are very definite
limits on what they can reasonably expect to raise through their
own efforts. Arguably, Bob Dole in 1996 was dead before he ever got
to the convention in San Diego, because of the tremendous pummeling
he took in the interim in independent expenditures directed against
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson added, ``I think what you've got now is a situation in
which most of the spending on television on both sides is going to
be financed by independent groups and not the candidates
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   State and national Democratic officials swiftly denounced Shape
the Debate's efforts as ``underground financing'' waged by ``George
W. Bush's ally,'' in the words of a Democratic National Committee
news release. In fact, Wilson's former aides say, he has never had
particularly warm relations with Bush and has regarded him warily
for years as a rival. When Wilson decided last year not to pursue
his own presidential campaign, and Bush telephoned to wish him
well, at least one senior Wilson aide urged him not even to return
the call.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who battled a severe recession in his first term before
presiding over a sharp recovery, nevertheless remains controversial
in California, where his strong stands against affirmative action
and illegal immigration provoked a backlash. Bush has not generally
tapped the old network of Wilson advisers in his campaign here, and
Gorton said he did not believe the two men had talked in months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Peewee's trying to find a way that George Bush will
give him a call,'' said former state Sen. Art Torres, the chairman
of the California Democratic Party, using his party's derisive
nickname for Wilson. ``The problem is, he's now created even more
of a fire wall, because of the sensitivity he's created with this
ad. They have no sense of subtlety and they never did.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson said: ``I have gotten into this because I think
George W. Bush should be president. I also think that had he
faltered, John McCain should have been president. And I don't think
the vice president should be. It's as simple as that.''

<P>
   A day after he stunned the Boston Red Sox by publicly demanding
more private investment in the team's proposed new $600 million
ballpark project, Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino said Saturday that
his goal is to protect the city's taxpayers _ not to delay
legislative action on a new Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to kill the project,'' Menino said. ``I'm still
a big supporter of a new ballpark. I just want to be sure we get a
return on our investment. I haven't been convinced of that yet ...,
but I remain open to having the Red Sox show me how that can be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   But ballpark supporters fear that with only four months to go in
this legislative session, Menino's late push for more private
investment could prevent passage of a bill to help fund a new
Fenway Park this year.
</P>
<P>
   And those who support the mayor's demand for more private
investment admit that it would be difficult for the team to
complete the lengthy negotiations with Major League Baseball and
potential new partners that are likely to be required before
lawmakers adjourn for the year in July.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he held out hope for a new Fenway Park, Menino continued
to raise the bar for the team's plans. On Saturday, he ruled out a
tentative plan to use city bonds to finance construction of a new
muncipally owned ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not interested in owning the ballpark,'' Menino said,
dismissing the idea. ``I have a city to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeating a theme he struck during a taped interview slated to
be broadcast Sunday, the mayor added: ``I think the Red Sox need to
look to Major League Baseball and maybe some new partners to get
more private investment (in the ballpark.) The city is not in the
baseball business.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Boston Globe reported Saturday, Menino has called for
Major League Baseball to invest up to $8 million in a new Fenway
Park, and has urged the team's owners to take on two major Fenway
landowners as partners in the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Menino first offered the proposals on ``The Boston Globe/WBZ
News Conference'' program scheduled to air this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently caught off-guard, the Red Sox have declined to
comment on the mayor's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   While some observers suggest the mayor is adopting a tough
public negotiating posture with the Red Sox, others say they
believe he may be concerned about public opposition to investing
taxpayers' money in a new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to force Major League Baseball to assume some of the
costs, Menino wants the Red Sox to retain the $8 million it
currently pays to smaller market teams in revenue sharing and use
the money to help repay any city investment in a new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   League officials, however, rejected the idea, noting that
revenue sharing is covered by the league's collective bargaining
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   To change it, the Red Sox would have to secure agreements from
other team owners and the players union _ a formidable challenge
that could take months, if not years, with no assurances of
success, ballpark boosters said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Red Sox pushed the idea, it's unclear whether the
league would embrace the idea, since it would set a precedent for
other team owners anxious to secure public investment in their
proposed new ballpark projects.
</P>
<P>
   Menino has also ruled out creating a stadium authority to
acquire the new ballpark site and build the new Fenway Park. That
idea, promoted by Robert Walsh, Red Sox development adviser and the
team's liaison with the city, was an option the city has been
seriously considering for months.
</P>
<P>
   According to city officials, the purpose of the new stadium
authority would be to access the city's bonding authority and its
ability to borrow at lower interest rates, thereby reducing the
team's investment in the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not see a stadium authority in my future,'' Menino said.
``I do not like that idea at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Menino's call for dramatic changes in the team's financing plan
comes as a surprise since he has been one of the strongest
advocates of a new ballpark and he directed the team to build its
new ballpark in the Fenway area.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, state officials have encouraged the Sox by
signaling their willingness to consider public investment in
infrastructure before lawmakers adjourn for the year in July.
</P>
<P>
   While Menino estimated the Red Sox will need $250 million in
public funds, the Red Sox have not said how much public investment
the team needs in the project. The team's plan includes a new $350
million ballpark, major infrastructure improvements, two parking
garages, and the acquistion of 14 acres of privately owned land
adjacent to Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Menino insisted that a new ballpark bill could still pass this
year. The city, he said, remains willing to invest in acquiring
land for the new ballpark as long as it is guaranteed the project
would return the investment over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not ruling out using city bond as long as we have a
demonstrated way to get back the money,'' Menino said. ``The new
convention center is the model here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We invested money in the new convention center, but we got
dedicated revenue streams to pay back our investment,`` he said.
``We are getting back get every dollar back we spent on land-taking
through new hotel taxes and the sale of taxi medallions. That's the
kind of thing we're looking for with a new ballpark.''

EWING IS STILL SHOOTING, AGAINST THE LAKERS AND TIME
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ At times, the game clock has been
cruel to Patrick Ewing. In a career of last-second shots, the
basket has seemed covered in cellophane.
</P>
<P>
   At times, his body clock has turned against him. As he closes
his 15th year with the Knicks, his injuries have become more career
threatening and each recovery less definite.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the tick-tock is audible to everyone but Ewing these
days. On the Knicks' current trip, he came up with two game-saving
plays against Portland last Sunday and two more to calm the team's
nerves in Vancouver on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling as fit as he has in years, Ewing coolly delivered two
free throws and a runner in the final minute at General Motors
Place to turn a shaky one-point lead by the Knicks into a 89-83
escape.
</P>
<P>
   With each time he comes through, a mood that once resembled
storm clouds this season grows a shade lighter. He's doing his
favorite thing: proving everyone wrong. In keeping with his
stubborn spirit, only Ewing would think he could match the Lakers'
Shaquille O'Neal on Sunday in Los Angeles after failing miserably
just two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're prepared,'' Ewing said. ``I know I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago in a 92-87 loss to the Lakers at home, Ewing's
pride seemed to get the best of him. Shying away from driving
inside on the Lakers' mammoth center and taking mostly jumpers,
Ewing launched 20 shots _ and only made six_ while O'Neal gushed
for 43 points at Madison Square Garden. On Sunday, the unabashed
Ewing may take 20 more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he scores, yeah, I'm going to come back and try to score,''
Ewing said. ``If my play is called, I'm going to try to score.
That's the way it's always been.''
</P>
<P>
   But a lot has changed this year. On some nights, the Knicks do
go back in time and lean on Ewing to bail them out. But most of the
time, if Ewing has an off night, there is Marcus Camby, Latrell
Sprewell or Allan Houston to carry on. In tight games, though,
Ewing continues to demand the ball even if it's not always a
popular concept within the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we win, I think everyone will bite their tongue,''
one teammate said. ``Hey, Pat's been big in a lot of games.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, it was hard to fathom Ewing playing such a
high-profile role on the team. The Knicks were moving on without
him as he recovered from injury.
</P>
<P>
   During training camp, he allowed his thoughts to drift to
retirement. As the season began, he dropped hints about finishing
his career in Miami. Friday night, he left open the possibility
that he will be a Knick after his current deal expires in the
summer of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens, happens,'' Ewing said. ``Honestly, I'm not
worried about it right now. I'm just having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked what he would do if the Knicks approached him
about a contract extension this summer, Ewing referred to his
agent, David Falk. ``I would tell them, `Talk to David,''' Ewing
said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Even if his career in New York is prolonged, the window for
Ewing to win a title is shrinking to the size of a porthole.
</P>
<P>
   If Ewing does get another shot, the ominous Lakers could be
standing in his way. That's why the Knicks want to show O'Neal and
company they can pose a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we capable of beating them?'' said the Madison Square
Garden president Dave Checketts, who joined the team during their
road trip. ``I'd like to think so in a seven-game series.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the NBA finals, though. Not yet. But the way Ewing's
bravado has returned to its familiar levels, it's hard to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big game,'' Ewing said. ``They're the best team in the
league. Hopefully, we'll meet them in the finals. We need to let
them know we're capable of beating them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Ewing will admit he will need help in defending O'Neal. The
last time the Knicks played him, they allowed O'Neal to catch the
ball and make a move to the basket before sending help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to stop him one-on-one,'' Ewing said. ``He's big and
strong and he outweighs me by about 70 pounds. Everyone needs to
help each other. It's got to be a total team effort.''

GOSS SET BACK BY MISHAP IN YACHT'S MAIDEN TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the British adventure sailor Pete Goss, March will be
remembered for highs and lows of kingly proportions. Just over two
weeks ago, Goss' radical new 120-foot catamaran, Team Philips _ a
craft embodying Britannia's fervent wish to once again rule the
waves _ was christened and blessed by Queen Elizabeth II in an
emotional ceremony in the heart of London.
</P>
<P>
   But last Wednesday, in a cold, gray North Atlantic seaway, Goss'
worst nightmares were realized when a 45-foot section of the
spindly port bow cracked off like an icicle dangling from a sill,
on the third day of the boat's maiden trials. Suddenly, Goss had a
royal problem on his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a very loud bang,'' the 38-year-old former marine
said in a telephone interview from St. Mary's in the Scilly Isles,
the port to which he, his five-man crew and his crippled sailboat
had been towed after the incident. In typical understatement he
added, ``We found that the port bow had a major structural problem
and was starting to work itself off.''
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, was not supposed to happen to a boat that was
scheduled to undertake not one but two round-the-world voyages over
the next several months. First, Goss had planned an imminent
assault on the so-called Jules Verne record for the fastest
circumnavigation, which is currently just over 71 days. But that
trip was viewed as a mere warm-up for Goss' entry in The Race, the
fully crewed, nonstop, around-the-world competition waged with no
limits on the size of boat or crew. That race will begin from
Barcelona, Spain, on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The record attempt is now out of the question. But Goss vows
that he will be on the starting line for The Race. ``We didn't hit
anything,'' Goss said. ``It's something to do with the structure or
the manufacture. We need to distill it down to that kernel of truth
as to what happened. I feel confident we can resolve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Goss has gotten into tight jams before. In a desperate feat
during the 1996-97 Vendee Globe single-handed race around the
world, he turned around and sailed 160 miles into the teeth of
hurricane-force winds to rescue a French skipper, Raphael Dinelli,
whose boat was sinking. For his heroics, Goss was awarded the Medal
of the British Empire and the Legion d'Honneur of France.
</P>
<P>
   The shakedown of Team Philips, named for the Netherlands-based
electronics company that is bankrolling the roughly $4 million
campaign, began far less dramatically. After setting out from
Dartmouth on England's south coast, Goss tacked north for the Irish
Sea on the first leg of what was planned as a five-day voyage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were making 21 knots with ease,'' Goss said. ``It was just
fantastic, the boat was sailing like a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after midnight last Wednesday morning, Team Philips
jibed back toward Land's End at the mouth of the English Channel.
Just after first light, with the boat cruising at 18 knots in a
20-knot northeasterly, Goss was off watch and in his bunk when he
was awakened by the sound of splintering carbon fiber. The port bow
was in critical condition, but the starboard bow had also incurred
a serious crease.
</P>
<P>
   ``All hands were called on deck in survival suits,'' Goss said.
``We let the mainsheets go and immediately depowered the boat, and
then called the marine rescue control center. They immediately sent
out a lifeboat and a helicopter.''
</P>
<P>
   Team Philips began limping towards the Scillys, some 30 miles to
the south, under her own power. But the port bow parted ways with
the vessel soon after, and the craft was then towed into St.
Mary's. The missing piece was later recovered in a separate salvage
operation. Last Friday, with its rudders removed, Team Philips was
towed backward to Dartmouth, where further inspection awaited.
</P>
<P>
   With an all-up weight of just 44,000 pounds, a 70-foot beam, and
twin, unstayed wing masts, the Adrian Thompson design is one of a
handful of unlimited nautical projectiles setting course for The
Race. There are also plans for at least two American boats to
compete: Steve Fossett's PlayStation, which also has its share of
work-up woes, and Cam Lewis' Team Adventure, currently under
construction in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news, if there is such a thing, is that the damage on
the starboard hull gives us a good indication of where the crack
started,'' said Thompson. ``We believe both hulls failed in the
same manner. We can't attempt a repair until we completely
understand what caused the problem. Next time, this boat has got to
be bulletproof.''
</P>
<P>
   Goss has managed to stay focused on the silver lining of the
dark cloud obscuring his dream. ``In a funny way this has pulled us
together,'' he said. ``It's easy when things are going well; the
real measure is when you're at the bottom. Everyone's pulled tight
as a knot and we're going forward.''

HOSPITALS PUSH PHYSICIANS FOR MORE PRODUCTIVITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LIZ KOWALCZYK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to boost their drooping revenue, Boston's elite teaching
hospitals are telling their top-notch doctors they must see more
patients and bring in more money.
</P>
<P>
   Some hospitals are even hitting those who fail to do so where it
hurts: their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   These hospitals _ run by Harvard, Tufts, and Boston University _
employ about 7,000 doctors, who are accustomed to pursuing their
own academic interests and setting their own schedules. Many are
unhappy about the productivity push, which has intensified in
recent months after hospitals suffered record losses in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many doctors feel very frustrated by the pressure to see more
patients,'' said Dr. Frannie R. Kronenberg, medical director of a
physicians' group at Brigham and Women's Hospital. ``They've seen
their income decline, from standards that are already lower in
academic medicine. They feel that their commitment to very
high-quality care and the energy and passion they put into it are
being devalued by the pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals in Boston and elsewhere across the country are using a
variety of rules and incentives to get the message across. Typical
is Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center's request that its 120
primary care doctors increase their annual number of patient visits
from 85,000 to 100,000. In the same spirit, a new salary system at
Brigham and Women's will dock less productive doctors up to 10
percent of their pay this year. That amount will grow to 20 percent
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements are accompanied by a whole new Wall Street
language for doctors, one where patient visits are assigned
``relative value units'' depending on complexity, and where
administrators hand department heads ``balanced score cards''
listing revenue generated and goals met.
</P>
<P>
   While productivity quotas at teaching hospitals in other parts
of the country have sparked union movements and lawsuits from
doctors, so far in Boston, doctors are responding more measuredly.
One common reaction: give up low-paying or volunteer teaching jobs
to work longer hours seeing patients.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in private practice, who essentially run their own small
businesses, have grown used to working longer and faster during the
1990s as health insurance companies reined in medical costs, a
movement known as managed care.
</P>
<P>
   But many academic doctors, who are salaried and divide their
time among teaching, research and patients, have been shielded from
marketplace pressures until recent years. In fact, they went into
academic medicine for this very reason _ to be freed from the
commercial aspect of doctoring so they could focus on providing
cutting-edge care and diagnosing interesting cases.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching hospitals, as their reimbursements from insurance and
Medicare dropped, felt the pressure too and started to scrutinize
doctors' workloads. Last year's record losses intensified their
push for productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors worry they are losing the thoughtful culture that has
flourished at academic medical centers for decades. But hospital
administrators say their institutions must adapt to survive. And as
with any change, tensions are high.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hospital and the doctors disagree,'' said Dr. Nancy
Gagliano, associate medical director at Massachusetts General
Hospital, where doctors are fighting higher productivity quotas.
``The hospital wants to get more for its money. But the doctors
feel like they're sinking and they're doing the best they can do.
No one wants us to give up excellence and become churning
factories.''
</P>
<P>
   But as long as patients continue to receive top-notch care, said
Dr. David Fairchild, director of primary care at Brigham and
Women's, the productivity push is having positive results,
particularly for patients.
</P>
<P>
   Some Brigham and Women's doctors, for example, are opening their
offices on Saturday mornings and are staying open until 8:30 p.m.
on weekdays, while doctors at Beth Israel Deaconess are promising
appointments within one week to almost half the patients who call.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old system, it worked for the physicians, so there
wasn't much focus on whether the patients were happy,'' said Dr.
David R. Fulton, chief of cardiology outpatient services at
Children's Hospital, who put changes in place last year.
</P>
<P>
   Children's Hospital, which lost $61 million last year, has
approached the issue of physician productivity gingerly, trying not
to upset its doctors, who are considered some of the best
pediatricians in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the hospital set up two side-by-side clinics for
outpatient visits. On one side, doctors treat patients more quickly
_ 20 to 30 minutes for a basic visit _ while on the other,
residents, medical students and researchers take up to an hour or
more with each child. Doctors choose the path.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton was brought in two years ago from New England Medical
Center to increase productivity and efficiency in the outpatient
cardiology clinic, where children and their parents were spending
four to five hours a visit.
</P>
<P>
   Parents made appointments and then ignored them; they knew if
they showed up first, they'd see the doctor first. A child could
wait two hours between having his vital signs read and receiving an
echocardiogram. And doctors wandered in and out, disappearing to
return phone calls, teach medical residents, conduct research, or
check on patients who'd stayed overnight.
</P>
<P>
   That had to stop, Fulton said.
</P>
<P>
   So he asked all the doctors how many patients they could see
each day and how long they needed for each visit. Then he added
exam rooms and more precise scheduling _ and held them to it. Since
he implemented the system in July, the clinic has increased its
capacity from 60 children a day to 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't handcuff the doctors,'' he said, ``but because the
patients are moving through the system faster it makes sense for
them to be close at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   At Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the 130 full- and
part-time doctors and medical residents who work for Healthcare
Associates _ the hospital's primary care practice _ are throwing
out their traditional scheduling system in their effort to meet
their new quota of 100,000 visits this year, the third year the
hospital administration has ordered up an increase.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors used to make appointments for patients two months in
advance, said Dr. Richard Parker, associate medical director for
the hospital's internal medicine practices. Now, they reserve
nearly half of the appointments for patients calling no more than
one week ahead _ a scheduling technique that reduces no-shows and
allows more patients to see their own doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who see more than eight patients per session _ normally
four hours _ receive a salary bonus of up 15 percent, Parker said.
Beth Israel Deaconess just began switching its 75 community doctors
to performance-based salaries that include bonuses and penalties
based on volume and quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not asking us to be conveyor belts,'' said Parker,
who added that the practice can also hire more doctors. ``But yes,
we feel pressured. We feel pressured every day. We're being asked
to justify our budget and it's difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But doctors are less upset about reshuffling their schedules
than they are about having their daily schedules monitored and
recorded down to the half-hour _ a key component of the
productivity movement and the most controversial.
</P>
<P>
   While some hospitals are still measuring the productivity of an
entire doctors' group, and leaving it to the group to dole out
rewards and discipline, most are now moving to measuring numbers of
patients and revenue for individual physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Brigham and Women's is measuring its primary care doctors'
productivity with relative value units, which vary depending on the
complexity of the case. Relative value is considered a more
sophisticated yardstick than simply counting the number of visits,
especially at academic medical centers where doctors treat the
sickest patients.
</P>
<P>
   With the hospital losing $80,000 to $100,000 on each primary
care doctor, Fairchild said, ``Academic medical centers need to
make money like any other business.'' And, he said, doctors who
work longer hours are pleased to be paid extra.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Britain Nicholson, chief medical officer at
Massachusetts General Hospital, said even relative value units
don't take into account all of a doctor's work _ tasks such as
calling a family to discuss unhappy test results _ an omission that
leads doctors to oppose higher quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the pressure to do more, doctors insist they are not
shortchanging patients. But Dr. Robert Witzburg, chief of community
medicine at Boston Medical Center, said something must give when a
doctor increases the number of patients he or she sees in a
four-hour session from eight to 12, as he has done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relaxed time I have with patients has shrunk; it's more
businesslike,'' he said. And that matters ``because when I sit down
and talk to a family about bad news, that conversation goes easier
for both of us if we've established a relationship.''

   BURBANK, Calif. _ The report came in over the police scanner
just after 3 p.m.: major traffic collision in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   Time to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, Larry Welk, a pilot-reporter for KCAL-TV
(Channel 9), and cameraman Gil Leyvas were hovering 1,400 feet over
the crash scene where an MTA bus and a Ford Explorer had collided.
Ten people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, four more news helicopters and a police chopper joined
them, all trying to get the best shot of the collision - and all
trying to avoid planes from nearby Burbank Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Los Angeles' crowded skies. This is the era of
airborne journalism and breathless TV anchors. Live! Breaking news!
Continuous coverage shot from a circling helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Television stations tout the value of reaching news events
quickly, with a perspective impossible for land-bound reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Undeniably, the live action makes for riveting viewing. But
critics point out chopper coverage often sensationalizes minor
events and trivializes the news itself - all to justify the
thousands of dollars spent keeping L.A.'s TV fleet of a dozen
``telecopters'' aloft every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have these toys and they want to use them,'' said Rick
Marks, a broadcast journalism professor at California State
University, Northridge, and former KNBC-TV (Channel 4) news
producer. ``And they use them for everything. So suddenly something
that's not a news story - some of these chases - becomes news
because you have the technology to show these things.''
</P>
<P>
   And as in the case of the news chopper crash at Van Nuys Airport
during the Academy Awards, the helicopters themselves can become
the story for TV news.
</P>
<P>
   Welk joins other reporters and news directors who contend they
provide a valuable service to the public, often by showing a view
of events that a ground reporter can't provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think they're abusing the helicopter? Not at all,'' said
Welk, grandson of TV's famed music conductor Lawrence Welk.
</P>
<P>
   Airborne reporters said breaking news events are difficult to
predict, so any car chase or fire can end up with a dramatic
outcome, even if it starts out slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on car chases where the guy's been leaning out the
window shooting at cops,'' said KNBC pilot/reporter Bob Pettee.
``I've seen kids or people thrown out of cars by the bad guys after
they hijack a car. How do you know what's going to happen or who's
in there 'til you get there?''
</P>
<P>
   Welk said he's occasionally been sent on stories that ended up
being not newsworthy. Similarly, ground reporters now more
frequently do live on-location shots hours after an event has
ended, simply to add immediacy to their report.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast professionals note that with helicopter rates up to
$1,000 an hour, news directors know they have to be careful not to
abuse them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Roger Bell, news director of KCBS-TV (Channel 2),
acknowledged that sometimes stations can get carried away using
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're asking can the technology be overused or abused, I
think absolutely,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of us in the television and newspaper journalism
world have raised that question, in terms of what kinds of stories
are we covering with it? Are we getting carried away sometimes,
covering stories that don't have the significance of an O.J. chase
or a major fire?''
</P>
<P>
   But it's a tough question to answer, Bell said, because a
segment of the audience wants to watch car chases, even
insignificant ones, and their needs - and ratings boosts - have to
be balanced against those of viewers interested in substantive
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've proven on ratings if you don't cover the car chase,
the opposition gets all the rating points,'' said Joe Saltzman,
associate dean of University of Southern California's
communications school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a live event and people will always be fascinated with
live events because of the unusual and unexpected. You know that at
any second something horrible can happen, something that's not
scripted or planned.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first telecopters used in the 1960s were rather limited in
range. In fact, they couldn't rise much more than 50 feet off the
ground - the length of the camera's cable.
</P>
<P>
   Camera operators once wore a harness, leaned out of the chopper
and held the camera on their shoulders, delivering a shaky picture
at best.
</P>
<P>
   Today, cameramen like Welk's partner Leyvas sit inside and
control the camera with a joystick for a picture that is
gyro-stabilized to adjust for the flight's bumps.
</P>
<P>
   After Pettee's chopper took a bullet during the Rodney King
riots, he recalled, his station bought the new technology, and
other stations followed.
</P>
<P>
   The industry was dealt a major wakeup call in 1998, when
stations went live to a man who had parked his pickup truck on an
overpass of the Harbor and Century freeways to protest health
maintenance organizations. The man suddenly committed suicide - on
live TV.
</P>
<P>
   At least one station was airing the drama live at a time when
children were watching TV after school, recalled KABC-AM (790)
radio traffic reporter Jorge Jarrin.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of the stations were on a tight close-up at the
moment he pulled out the shotgun, put it under his chin and pulled
the trigger. It was very graphic.''
</P>
<P>
   Stations said they would use a tape delay or pull back if
incidents could become too graphic - although how often they have
done so is open to question.
</P>
<P>
   Pettee said his station installed a button that allows him to
quickly switch cameras to one focused on him inside the chopper.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't used the button yet, he said, although in retrospect
he wishes he had last week when covering a story in Tarzana about a
man trapped in a trench. Thinking the man was still alive and had
been saved by firefighters, Pettee's cameraman panned down to the
man's body.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came back and it was obvious at that point the fire people
had given up, and I said, Pull back, pull back. I wasn't prepared
for that because I thought he he was alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the things that we grapple with in live
television.''
</P>
<P>
   SAFETY CONCERNS
</P>
<P>
   Following last Sunday's crash, the reporters union said it has
been struggling to give more control over flight decisions to
reporters and pilots, rather than news directors and helicopter
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The local American Federation of Television and Radio Artists
filed a grievance two weeks before the crash, requesting safety
information about Van Nuys-based Helinet Aviation, which provides
choppers for five L.A. stations.
</P>
<P>
   While KTTV-TV (Channel 11) officials said they agreed with the
concerns, and commissioned an independent safety audit, Helinet
officials said they have an excellent safety record and have never
before had an incident involving an electronic journalist. They
also said they don't pressure pilots to fly against their better
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line really is this: The helicopter company
management is never going to pressure a pilot to fly,'' said
Helinet Vice President Dave Corsello. ``A pilot getting in the
aircraft is going to make the decision. It's their decision to fly
or not fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the early days of helicopter journalism, there have been
crashes. They include Francis Gary Powers - the famed U-2 pilot
shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960 - who in 1977 died
returning from a story when his helicopter ran out of fuel,
crashing in Encino.
</P>
<P>
   Welk, who helped guide KTTV chopper pilot Kris Kelley back to
Van Nuys last Sunday night, said flying and reporting can be tricky
- and he's had a few close calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about news flying that makes it different is it's
easy for the pilot to get caught up in the story and forget to
concentrate on the flight,'' Welk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not hard for me, though, because I want to go home to my
kids every night. There's not a story in the world that's worth
risking that.''

SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS WITH SOFTWARE GIANT FALL APART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Settlement talks in the historic antitrust lawsuit against
Microsoft Corp. collapsed Saturday, as a federal mediator declared
that the differences between the software giant and its accusers
were ``too deep-seated to be bridged.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Richard Posner of the US Court of Appeals in Chicago, who
has been working for four months to broker a settlement, issued a
statement Saturday saying that ``the quest has proved fruitless.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 drafts of a settlement had been submitted, Posner
said, but none was acceptable to all parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed that the government would not agree to a
fair and resonable settlement that would have resolved this case in
the best interests of consumers and the industry,'' said
Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   With the talks at an end, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of US
District Court in Washington, D.C., is expected this week to
announce his ``findings of law'' in the case.
</P>
<P>
   And given Jackson's scathing criticisms of Microsoft in last
year's ``findings of fact'' ruling, there seems little doubt that
he will rule that Microsoft committed serious violations of federal
antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   The US Justice Department and 19 states filed their antitrust
suit against Microsoft in May of 1998, charging that the company's
Windows software holds a monopoly in the market for operating
systems for desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   The government has charged that Microsoft used this monopoly to
try to dominate the market for Internet browsers, and to try to
destroy a rival software company, Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Posner said, ``I particularly want to
emphasize that the collapse of the mediation is not due to any lack
of skill, flexibility, energy, determination, or professionalism on
the part of the Department of Justice and Microsoft Corp.''
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft source drew attention to this statement Saturday
night, noting that Posner had not praised the actions of the 19
state governments.
</P>
<P>
   The source said that it was a handful of these states who had
spoiled the talks late Friday night, by holding out for conditions
that the source described as ``Draconian minutiae.'' The Microsoft
official declined to name the states that had taken a hard line,
but said that Microsoft decided it would be better off accepting
Jackson's ruling and fighting it on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe ... that it would be as Draconian as what
some of the states were asking for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed that Jackson may call for the dismantling of
Microsoft into several separate firms, in a manner similar to the
breakup of the Standard Oil trust in the early 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lande, a Microsoft critic and board member of the American
Antitrust Institute, said that a breakup of the company would be
the only way to prevent further abuses of its power.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a repeated pattern of going way, way over the line,
then you do break them up for that,'' said Lande, who added that he
was not surprised by the collapse of the talks.

HOSPITALS PUSH PHYSICIANS FOR MORE PRODUCTIVITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LIZ KOWALCZYK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to boost their drooping revenue, Boston's elite teaching
hospitals are telling their top-notch doctors they must see more
patients and bring in more money.
</P>
<P>
   Some hospitals are even hitting those who fail to do so where it
hurts: their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   These hospitals _ run by Harvard, Tufts, and Boston University _
employ about 7,000 doctors, who are accustomed to pursuing their
own academic interests and setting their own schedules. Many are
unhappy about the productivity push, which has intensified in
recent months after hospitals suffered record losses in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many doctors feel very frustrated by the pressure to see more
patients,'' said Dr. Frannie R. Kronenberg, medical director of a
physicians' group at Brigham and Women's Hospital. ``They've seen
their income decline, from standards that are already lower in
academic medicine. They feel that their commitment to very
high-quality care and the energy and passion they put into it are
being devalued by the pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals in Boston and elsewhere across the country are using a
variety of rules and incentives to get the message across. Typical
is Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center's request that its 120
primary care doctors increase their annual number of patient visits
from 85,000 to 100,000. In the same spirit, a new salary system at
Brigham and Women's will dock less productive doctors up to 10
percent of their pay this year. That amount will grow to 20 percent
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements are accompanied by a whole new Wall Street
language for doctors, one where patient visits are assigned
``relative value units'' depending on complexity, and where
administrators hand department heads ``balanced score cards''
listing revenue generated and goals met.
</P>
<P>
   While productivity quotas at teaching hospitals in other parts
of the country have sparked union movements and lawsuits from
doctors, so far in Boston, doctors are responding more measuredly.
One common reaction: give up low-paying or volunteer teaching jobs
to work longer hours seeing patients.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in private practice, who essentially run their own small
businesses, have grown used to working longer and faster during the
1990s as health insurance companies reined in medical costs, a
movement known as managed care.
</P>
<P>
   But many academic doctors, who are salaried and divide their
time among teaching, research and patients, have been shielded from
marketplace pressures until recent years. In fact, they went into
academic medicine for this very reason _ to be freed from the
commercial aspect of doctoring so they could focus on providing
cutting-edge care and diagnosing interesting cases.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching hospitals, as their reimbursements from insurance and
Medicare dropped, felt the pressure too and started to scrutinize
doctors' workloads. Last year's record losses intensified their
push for productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors worry they are losing the thoughtful culture that has
flourished at academic medical centers for decades. But hospital
administrators say their institutions must adapt to survive. And as
with any change, tensions are high.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hospital and the doctors disagree,'' said Dr. Nancy
Gagliano, associate medical director at Massachusetts General
Hospital, where doctors are fighting higher productivity quotas.
``The hospital wants to get more for its money. But the doctors
feel like they're sinking and they're doing the best they can do.
No one wants us to give up excellence and become churning
factories.''
</P>
<P>
   But as long as patients continue to receive top-notch care, said
Dr. David Fairchild, director of primary care at Brigham and
Women's, the productivity push is having positive results,
particularly for patients.
</P>
<P>
   Some Brigham and Women's doctors, for example, are opening their
offices on Saturday mornings and are staying open until 8:30 p.m.
on weekdays, while doctors at Beth Israel Deaconess are promising
appointments within one week to almost half the patients who call.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old system, it worked for the physicians, so there
wasn't much focus on whether the patients were happy,'' said Dr.
David R. Fulton, chief of cardiology outpatient services at
Children's Hospital, who put changes in place last year.
</P>
<P>
   Children's Hospital, which lost $61 million last year, has
approached the issue of physician productivity gingerly, trying not
to upset its doctors, who are considered some of the best
pediatricians in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the hospital set up two side-by-side clinics for
outpatient visits. On one side, doctors treat patients more quickly
_ 20 to 30 minutes for a basic visit _ while on the other,
residents, medical students and researchers take up to an hour or
more with each child. Doctors choose the path.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton was brought in two years ago from New England Medical
Center to increase productivity and efficiency in the outpatient
cardiology clinic, where children and their parents were spending
four to five hours a visit.
</P>
<P>
   Parents made appointments and then ignored them; they knew if
they showed up first, they'd see the doctor first. A child could
wait two hours between having his vital signs read and receiving an
echocardiogram. And doctors wandered in and out, disappearing to
return phone calls, teach medical residents, conduct research, or
check on patients who'd stayed overnight.
</P>
<P>
   That had to stop, Fulton said.
</P>
<P>
   So he asked all the doctors how many patients they could see
each day and how long they needed for each visit. Then he added
exam rooms and more precise scheduling _ and held them to it. Since
he implemented the system in July, the clinic has increased its
capacity from 60 children a day to 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't handcuff the doctors,'' he said, ``but because the
patients are moving through the system faster it makes sense for
them to be close at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   At Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the 130 full- and
part-time doctors and medical residents who work for Healthcare
Associates _ the hospital's primary care practice _ are throwing
out their traditional scheduling system in their effort to meet
their new quota of 100,000 visits this year, the third year the
hospital administration has ordered up an increase.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors used to make appointments for patients two months in
advance, said Dr. Richard Parker, associate medical director for
the hospital's internal medicine practices. Now, they reserve
nearly half of the appointments for patients calling no more than
one week ahead _ a scheduling technique that reduces no-shows and
allows more patients to see their own doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who see more than eight patients per session _ normally
four hours _ receive a salary bonus of up 15 percent, Parker said.
Beth Israel Deaconess just began switching its 75 community doctors
to performance-based salaries that include bonuses and penalties
based on volume and quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not asking us to be conveyor belts,'' said Parker,
who added that the practice can also hire more doctors. ``But yes,
we feel pressured. We feel pressured every day. We're being asked
to justify our budget and it's difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But doctors are less upset about reshuffling their schedules
than they are about having their daily schedules monitored and
recorded down to the half-hour _ a key component of the
productivity movement and the most controversial.
</P>
<P>
   While some hospitals are still measuring the productivity of an
entire doctors' group, and leaving it to the group to dole out
rewards and discipline, most are now moving to measuring numbers of
patients and revenue for individual physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Brigham and Women's is measuring its primary care doctors'
productivity with relative value units, which vary depending on the
complexity of the case. Relative value is considered a more
sophisticated yardstick than simply counting the number of visits,
especially at academic medical centers where doctors treat the
sickest patients.
</P>
<P>
   With the hospital losing $80,000 to $100,000 on each primary
care doctor, Fairchild said, ``Academic medical centers need to
make money like any other business.'' And, he said, doctors who
work longer hours are pleased to be paid extra.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Britain Nicholson, chief medical officer at
Massachusetts General Hospital, said even relative value units
don't take into account all of a doctor's work _ tasks such as
calling a family to discuss unhappy test results _ an omission that
leads doctors to oppose higher quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the pressure to do more, doctors insist they are not
shortchanging patients. But Dr. Robert Witzburg, chief of community
medicine at Boston Medical Center, said something must give when a
doctor increases the number of patients he or she sees in a
four-hour session from eight to 12, as he has done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relaxed time I have with patients has shrunk; it's more
businesslike,'' he said. And that matters ``because when I sit down
and talk to a family about bad news, that conversation goes easier
for both of us if we've established a relationship.''

 &HT;    A long season of presidential campaigningBy Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Less than three weeks into the longest general election
season in presidential history, George W. Bush and Al Gore are on a
daily campaign pace that few believe they can maintain.
</P>
<P>
   But, to the chagrin of many Americans, they seem intent on
trying.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a front-loaded primary season that both parties agree
is not democracy's finest moment, Bush and Gore smashed the record
for earliest dual clinchings. Both secured their respective party's
nomination March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, both have been Energizer Bunnying across the nation,
eager to keep the campaign going and goingright up until the Nov. 7
election. The first TV commercials showed up March 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, people went home and relaxed and thought
about things, and on Labor Day the campaign began. That's over,''
said 1988 Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, who
believes the current candidates could drum up some interest by
picking their running mates now.
</P>
<P>
   Short of something dramatic like that, Dukakis and others
wonder, is there much reason for anybody to be listening?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they're going to do between now and
convention time,'' said Howard Baker, a former U.S. senator from
Tennessee and Reagan White House chief of staff, in a television
interview when Gore and Bush clinched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do think there's a risk that the country's going to
get turned off by intensive campaigning between now and then.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since Clincher Tuesday, Gore and Bush have been
campaigning close to nonstop, something made possible by the fact
that both have government jobs that don't seem to require much
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither side wants to risk the other side taking advantage of
the early time frame,'' according to a senior Bush adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bush scampered across the nation, including
campaigning in Wisconsin as if the state's Tuesday primary
mattered. Gore also was out and about most of the week.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview at the Governor's Mansion, Bush said he
will maintain a ``pretty active schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the people necessarily want to hear the
full-bore campaign,'' he said, using ``bore'' in the sense of
measurement. ``But there are events we can do and ways to highlight
important issues, and I'm going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   So far that has meant education as Bush tries to put the focus
on his more moderate side and off South Carolina's Bob Jones
University, the Confederate flag and his unity-busting campaign
against Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Though both candidates are ready to campaign until Election Day,
there might be a forced blackout because of the Summer Olympics.
Though the Games always coincide with presidential elections, they
are usually held in July or August, when political attention is at
a low ebb.
</P>
<P>
   But this year's Melbourne, Australia, event begins Sept. 15 and
ends Oct. 1, prime political season. Bush advisers believe their
guy will have to fight for attention during that period.
</P>
<P>
   One way to drum up big attention long before the Olympics would
be to go nontraditional with the selection of running mates.
Dukakis, who candidly admits he didn't exactly write the book on
how to run for president, said both contenders should pick their
vice presidential candidates long before the summer conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Now would be a good time, Dukakis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had faced this kind of situation in 1988, I probably
would have begun that process. I would have tried to pick my
running mate at the earliest possible time and get that person out
there campaigning with me as soon as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan tried an exaggerated form of this in 1976 during
his unsuccessful effort to derail then-President Ford's bid for the
GOP nomination. Reagan announced during primary season that, if he
were nominated, his running mate would be Pennsylvania Sen. Richard
Schweicker.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Dukakis clinched the nomination June 7, though he was
the apparent nominee by late April. He picked then-Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas as his running mate in July. Much earlier would be
much better, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a running mate who is in place, who is working with
you and campaigning for himself or herself. I see all kinds of
advantages,'' said Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there are no hints of early selection of running mates.
Both contenders also are not eager to re-create Dole '96, whose
road to defeat began when he ran out of money after the primaries
and was forced into political hibernation until federal money for
the general election flowed after the Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The spending caps were no problem for Clinton because he had no
serious primary foe and, thanks to the perks of the presidency, he
could always find ways to make news.
</P>
<P>
   Dole also was hindered by spending caps that came with the
federal matching money he took for the primaries. While Dole was
hamstrung, Clinton was all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not take the government's money for the primaries, so
he does not have to play by its rules. In the period leading up to
the summer convention, he can spend whatever he can raise. Gore,
who took federal matching money, faces spending limits but, as vice
president, has an incumbent's advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates will take federal money for the fall campaign.
The Federal Election Commission recently announced that each major
party nominee will get $67.5 million for the period from the
conventions until Election Day. That's all they can spend.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Reed, Dole's 1996 campaign manager, believes Bush, though
unencumbered by the shackles that helped doom Dole, will find that
the longest-ever, pre-convention campaign will come with limits of
its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it more difficult for the nominee to maintain
interest and momentum through the long summer leading up to a
party's convention,'' he said. ``In a national campaign at this
phase, a day feels like a week and a week feels like a month. It's
very difficult to break through and keep the excitement going about
a candidate, even a good one like George W. Bush, when there is no
defining event for three months.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic consultant Paul Begala, who helped Clinton navigate
treacherous waters in 1992, said the long campaign season brings
opportunity and peril for Bush. It's what Begala said his ex-boss
would call a ``high-class problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of problem you want, but it's still a problem,''
said Begala. ``It's just flat out impossible to dance in the
spotlight for 34 weeks or whatever it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Begala knows what it's like to try. In 1992, after clinching the
nomination June 2, Clinton was out-PR'ed by Ross Perot's on-again,
off-again, on-again campaign that proved to be a publicity machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perot took all the oxygen. That's why we went on `Arsenio
Hall.' We were starved for attention. We couldn't get arrested. We
later cured that problem,'' Begala said.
</P>
<P>
   He sees little chance that the public will put up with the
wall-to-wall campaign that Gore and Bush want to stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public right now is tuning them out,'' said Begala, a Gore
backer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing they'll tune in for is a gaffe. That's the
reason it's wise for Bush to talk about education. It's the only
subject besides baseball I have ever seen him talk about where his
eyes don't look like a slot machine that hit bar, apple, lemon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both would be better off if they just went fishing for a week
or two,'' said Begala.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Bush campaign hinted it might agree. Gore
accepted an invitation to a foreign policy debate this month, but
Bush said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll be plenty of time for debates when the voters are
paying attention to the election,'' said Bush spokesman Scott
McClellan.

GAMBLING STUDY IS DISTURBING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the release this week of a University of
Michigan study that revealed that 84.4 percent of Division I
officials have gambled since becoming college officials, the famous
Las Vegas sporting gentleman, Jimmy Vaccaro, cracked:
</P>
<P>
   ``And the other 16 percent are lying.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, can't be proven, but 40 percent of those
collegiate officials surveyed admitted to having bet on sports and
it's indisputable that such an activity has become a wide-spread
phenomenon with the proliferation of outlets in the Caribbean,
Nevada, Mexico and on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   What is chilling about the Michigan report is the candid
admission by two officials that their awareness of the point spread
resulted in ``their officiating with a level of bias.''
</P>
<P>
   What is chilling about the Michigan report is that 12 officials
say they knew of colleagues who had not called a game fairly
because of gambling reasons.
</P>
<P>
   What is chilling about the Michigan report is that it reaffirms
a belief I've always privately held that once in a while a judgment
rendered by an official has been swayed by the point spread.
</P>
<P>
   This is not meant to impute that athletics we're talking both
amateur and professional here is rift with corrupt officials, nor
is it meant to tarnish the credibility of all those games we watch
on television.
</P>
<P>
   But the sobering fact is there are instances rare instances, I
think when some arbiter has made a call or even calls that have
been dictated by the point spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there is big money involved, there is going to be a
level of cheating,'' the notorious bookmaker, Harry Gross, once
told me. ``And believe me, I've seen some cheating in athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Gross was the biggest name in
his profession in New York, and eventually he would descend on Long
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   He was heavily involved in the betting business for more than 50
years, and related titillating stories about fraudulence among both
athletes and arbiters that can't be related here in detail because
of libel laws.
</P>
<P>
   If only a fraction of what Gross related to me was true, one
can't help but forever cast a cynical eye on sporting competitions.
</P>
<P>
   It has been estimated that 10 percent of the male population in
America gambles excessively, and you can be sure or even bet on it
that there are a few referees and umpires who have serious habits.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen countless illustrious athletes over the years gambling
merrily away in Las Vegas casinos.
</P>
<P>
   I often saw the late NBA referee, Mendy Rudolph, in those places
playing high-stakes blackjack.
</P>
<P>
   I know a prominent Las Vegas boxing judge, still living, who
bets heavily on football games.
</P>
<P>
   What if he has a bad week, and owes the bookmaker thousands of
dollars?
</P>
<P>
   Under such circumstances, would he not be more susceptible to a
bribe, or at least more susceptible to making a sizable bet on a
boxing match that he's working?
</P>
<P>
   I also can't tell you how many times across the seasons I've
seen late-game calls especially in football that have defied all
sane calculations and, by the sheerest coincidence, had a direct
effect on the final point spread.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA, in its typical obtuse, inane manner, has been trying
to push through legislation in Washington to ban sports gambling on
college sports.
</P>
<P>
   How would that help?
</P>
<P>
   OK, so I'm stopped from going to Nevada and betting on college
football and basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Big deal! I can always make the hour and a half trek down to
Tijuana, where there are plenty of sports books at my disposal. Or
I can open up an off-shore account with one of the Caribbean
outfits. Or I can call up illegal bookmakers, who are all over the
place and will always be all over the place as long as people want
to gamble on sports and horses.
</P>
<P>
   As Harry Gross, a colorful character who, in a fit of
despondency, took his own life in a Long Beach apartment in 1986,
often said, there is always a certain amount of corruption when the
financial stakes are high.
</P>
<P>
   It's like that in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   It's like that in government contracts.
</P>
<P>
   It's like that in almost every business enterprise imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Jimmy Vaccaro sniffs at the NCAA's attempt to forbid
betting on college sports in the Nevada sports books.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is it that a place like England has more than 1,000
betting shops around the country (William Hill and Ladbrokes), and
there's no problem?'' wonders Vaccaro. ``Does the NCAA honestly
think that people are going to stop betting on college sports just
because you won't be able to bet on them in the sports books?
Please. Gambling on college sports is here to stay, no matter
what.''

PRESIDENT LASHES OUT AT FIRST LADY'S OPPONENTS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton jumped full-force into the New York campaign
for U.S. Senate Saturday, declaring that Hillary Rodham Clinton was
the target of a ``right-wing venom machine'' allied with Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, and asserting that Republicans were prepared to
throw a ``double-ton of money'' into derailing his wife's first
attempt at public office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way they can win is to convince people that we're
space aliens,'' Clinton said at a union fund-raiser on behalf Mrs.
Clinton's Senate campaign in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who has, until now, appeared to take pains to
avoid overshadowing his wife's campaign, was anything but
restrained Saturday, forcefully advocating Mrs. Clinton's candidacy
and portraying Giuliani as a creature of the right.
</P>
<P>
   The president invoked on behalf of his wife some of the same
arguments _ indeed, some of the same phrases _ that he has
marshaled in his own campaigns for office, asserting that Giuliani
was seeking to demonize his wife because he could not defeat her
based on issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a complicated deal, and that's why Hillary's
opponent can raise a double-ton of money, besides being mayor and
having special relations with a lot of those people who have it in
New York,'' Clinton said. ``And you have the right-wing venom
machine all geared up against her again.''
</P>
<P>
   The president has taken swipes at Giuliani in the past, and
Giuliani has relentlessly criticized the president in recent
months. But the remarks Saturday were by far the fullest and
harshest attack he has offered against the mayor; indeed, they were
generally tougher than what Clinton herself has been saying during
nine months of campaigning in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's attack on Giuliani appeared to be a spontaneous
expression of frustration, rather than an orchestrated strategic
gambit by Mrs. Clinton's campaign. The $75,000 fund-raiser, which
was sponsored by the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers and held at the Hyatt Hotel on Capitol Hill, was not listed
on her public schedule, and her press aides did not accompany her
to the event. An accounting of the president's remarks was provided
by pool and wire service reporters who routinely accompany the
president for all his public travels.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by Clinton, who has less than 10 months left in the
White House, came at a time in which he has appeared increasingly
tempted by the campaigning going on at the periphery of his
presidency. Recently, while in New York, Clinton offered an attack
on George W. Bush, the Texas governor and presumed Republican
opponent of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not running for anything,'' Clinton noted Saturday. ``Most
days, I'm OK about that.''
</P>
<P>
   More immediately, Clinton's attack on Giuliani and his allies
came two days after Mrs. Clinton's campaign was startled to learn
that it was being significantly outpaced by Giuliani's in
fund-raising. Giuliani announced last week that he had raised $7
million in the first three months of this year, compared with $4
million by Mrs. Clinton. (Giuliani's campaign manager, Bruce J.
Teitelbaum, said Saturday night that a more up-to-date tally found
that Giuliani had raised $7.3 million).
</P>
<P>
   The president is extraordinarily popular in New York, one of the
first lady's aides noted Saturday night, and thus may be in a
particularly good position to take on Giuliani, who is far less
popular than Mr. Clinton. That said, Clinton appeared with his
remarks to risk diminishing Mrs. Clinton at a time when she has
been trying to establish her own identity. She offered only
perfunctory remarks at Saturday's fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   One of Clinton's allies said Saturday that the episode might be
portrayed as evidence that Clinton, in making her first run for
office, could not stand up for herself.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Clinton's attacks were reminiscent of what has
been a common refrain in the Clintons' public lives: attempting to
present themselves as victims, a point Teitelbaum made when asked
for a response to the president's attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever the Clintons get into trouble, they revert to blaming
it all on a vast right-wing conspiracy,'' Teitelbaum said. ``In
this case, it seems to be an attempt to deflect attention away from
Mrs. Clinton's lagging fund-raising numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, Howard Wolfson, asserted that
Clinton, in his remarks, was ``defending a shared set of Democratic
principals that have been good for America and good for New York.''
Asked if mrs. Clinton had asked the president to speak on her
behalf, Wolfson responded: ``The president was saying what he
believed. The mayor has been running a relentlessly negative
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the audience of about 300 people that Giuliani was
repositioning himself politically as he turned his attention from
winning election in New York, a Democratic city, to winning in New
York State, which is relatively more Republican, and in a contest
in which he has relied on financial support from conservatives
across the nation who are unhappy with the notion of Clinton's
serving in the Senate.

 &HT;    Spartans march on
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ It wasn't pretty. In fact, it was probably as
ugly as the game of basketball can be played. But to Michigan State
coach Tim Izzo, it was thing of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State, the only No. 1 seed left in this totally
unpredictable NCAA Tournament, pushed, prodded and pounded its way
into Monday's national championship game by beating Wisconsin 53-41
Saturday night at the RCA Dome.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans (31-7), in the Final Four for the second
consecutive year, will play the winner of Saturday's late game
between North Carolina and Florida in hopes of winning its first
national championship since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth time since Feb. 12 that Michigan State had
beaten its Big Ten brother (22-14), which was in the Final Four for
the first time since 1941. Wisconsin, which finished sixth in the
Big Ten, got to Indianapolis with a tenacious defense and a steady
but efficient offense.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State, the Big Ten champions, took Wisconsin's game and
simply played it better. Wisconsin made only 15 of 43 shots (35
percent). Michigan State also shot 35 percent in the game (16 of
46) but beat the Badgers 14-2 in offense rebounds. That was the
difference in the game.
</P>
<P>
   After a brutally physical first half, Michigan State outscored
Wisconsin 11-2 in the first six minutes of the second half to take
a 30-19 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin continued to be frustrated as it tried to find room in
the Michigan State defense to take a shot. The Badgers hit only two
of their first seven attempts in the second half and on several
possessions never got a shot off against the rugged Michigan State
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin finally scored again when Kirk Penny hit a 3-point
basket to bring the Badgers to within 32-22. But several
possessions later, with the shot clock near zero, Morris Peterson
picked up a loose ball at the top of the key and canned a long
3-pointer. That gave Michigan State a 37-22 lead and Wisconsin
would never recover.
</P>
<P>
   The first half was anything but an artistic success as the two
teams combined to shoot 26.6 percent (12 of 45) from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State jumped out to a 17-8 lead with 10:01 left in the
first half and it appeared the Spartans would be able to take
control of the game. Wisconsin could do little right in that
stretch, hitting only 3 of its first 11 shots while getting pounded
7-1 on the offensive boards.
</P>
<P>
   But little did Michigan State know that a layup by Mateen
Cleaves with 11:42 left would be its last basket of the first half.
In fact, after a free throw at the 10:01 mark, the Spartans did not
score again until Morris Peterson hit two free throws with 3:34
left. All total, Michigan State missed its last 11 shots in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wisconsin began to grind its way back into the game,
getting 3-point baskets from Penny and Roy Boone. That enabled the
Badgers to climb within two, 19-17, at halftime.

 &HT;    Familiar name, a top slot: Nicklaus
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What's this? Mickelson head-to-head against Nicklaus
in the final round of a PGA Tour event? Some computer simulation
perhaps, linking golf's past with its present?
</P>
<P>
   No, it's real, but there's a twist. It's Phil Mickelson and Gary
Nicklaus, a tour rookie and son of Jack, tied at 11-under par 205
heading into today's final round of the BellSouth Classic at the
TPC at Sugarloaf.
</P>
<P>
   The story lines are numerous, to be sure, but one is better than
any other. Imagine the irony if the young Nicklaus, in the first
year that Augusta National does not invite PGA Tour winners, were
to secure a victory on the eve of the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction would likely be heard all the way out to Arizona,
where Jack, a six-time Masters champion, is playing in The
Tradition.
</P>
<P>
   But Mickelson isn't the only one who can get the Masters
committee off the hook. There are 12 other players within four
shots of the lead _ including 36-hole leader Joey Sindelar, who
fell to three back after a 74.
</P>
<P>
   Tied for third at 9-under 207 are Kenny Perry (70), who hasn't
won on the PGA Tour in five years; and Harrison Frazar (70), who is
looking for a first PGA Tour win. Three strokes off the lead at
8-under 208 are Jay Don Blake (69), Tom Pernice Jr. (69), former
U.S. Open winner Steve Jones (70) and Sindelar.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Cink, with the day's lowest round Saturday, a 5-under
67, is still in contention, tied for 10th at 7-under 209. Franklin
Langham, who has gone 67-69 after an opening 74, is tied for 15th
at 6-under-par 210.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Stankowski, two shots back after 36 holes, slipped to a 74
and is also five back at 6-under.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mickelson and Nicklaus missed closing opportunities to lead
alone today. Mickelson, who shot a 69, took a bogey at the 17th
hole, where he missed the green and then a 3-foot putt. At the
par-5 18th, his second shot, a 2-iron from 250 yards, hit the green
hard and carried over it into a swale. Guarding against the water
beyond the green, the lefthander flopped a wedge back short, onto
the fringe, then missed his birdie putt from about 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was originally just going to bump-and-run it,'' Mickelson
said of his third shot. ``I thought there was a chance that it
could come out perfect and a chance it could roll 30 to 40 feet by.
. .I had to make sure I got underneath the ball. I was on a pretty
good downslope. If I didn't get underneath it, it could be sent off
into the water long.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, who shot a 68, grazed the side of the cup at the 18th
from eight feet for birdie, but made his share prior to that. The
31-year-old, who has never won an event as a professional, bogeyed
two of his first three holes, then ran off four straight birdies
from Nos. 10-13, beginning with a chip-in at the par-5 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Of his mindset for today, Gary, expecting to talk with his
father again before the final round, planned to ``not do anything
different; just keep calm and patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack, who was able to watch some of the BellSouth during a
weather delay, said he got so ``charged up'' after viewing his son
on the telecast that he promptly went out and birdied 13, 14 and
18.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, he's been on the sidelines rooting for me,'' Jack
said. ``Now it's my turn to be on the sidelines pulling for him. .
.I'm very proud of him. I'd love to have him win a tournament,
period.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion David Duval is playing today only for
exercise. After spinning two balls back off the fifth green for an
8 at the par-4 5th, shot shot a front-nine 41 for 77 and is in 73rd
place at 3-over 219.

MICROSOFT AND U.S. UNABLE TO REACH ANTITRUST ACCORD
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After four months, mediation efforts between
Microsoft and the government were abandoned Saturday, making it
likely that the presiding judge in the trial will issue his
decision in the long-running antitrust case in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came from the court-appointed mediator, Richard
A. Posner, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago, who
said in a statement, ``I regret to announce the end of my efforts
to mediate the Microsoft antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   ``After more than four months,'' he added, ``it is apparent that
the disagreements among the parties concerning the likely course,
outcome, and consequences of continued litigation, as well as the
implications and ramifications of alternative terms of settlement,
are too deep-seated to be bridged.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, the trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson,
postponed a decision in the case to give the parties one more week
to reach a settlement. In his findings of fact in the case, issued
in November, Jackson found that Microsoft had used its monopoly
power to threaten and bully allies and competitors alike, stifling
innovation and competition in the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   Because those findings were weighted so heavily against
Microsoft, he is widely expected to find the company in violation
of antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   The judge will then consider court-ordered remedies, probably
after holding hearings and receiving a recommendation from the
plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   This evening Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, said he had spent
``hundreds of hours'' on the settlement negotiations, adding: ``We
went the extra mile to resolve this case, but the government would
not agree to a fair and reasonable settlement that would have
resolved this case in the best interests of consumers and the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates added: ``Ultimately, it became impossible to settle
because the Department of Justice and the states were not working
together. Between them, they appeared to be demanding either a
breakup of our company or other extreme concessions that go far
beyond the issues raised in the lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, in a statement, said: ``We would have
preferred an effective settlement to continued litigation. But
settlement for settlement's sake would be pointless. We could agree
only to a remedy that effectively solves the competitive problems
detailed in the court's findings of fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and the government had been exchanging proposals and
counterproposals over the last week, under a carefully scripted
schedule set by Posner. The Justice Department sent its latest
proposal to Posner late in the week, and the judge passed it on to
Microsoft. A lawyer who was close to the talks said Microsoft would
not agree to the government's latest demands.
</P>
<P>
   When Posner saw Microsoft's counterproposal, he declared the
talks dead.
</P>
<P>
   The 19 state attorneys general, who are partners in the suit,
were unhappy both with Microsoft's offer and with the Justice
Department's response. Saturday afternoon, before Posner's
announcement, one official said the ``views of some attorneys
general differ'' from those of Joel I. Klein, the assistant
attorney general in charge of the Justice Department antitrust
division. Several attorneys general, this official said, ``have
severe misgivings about some of the concessions Microsoft has
convinced Judge Posner that the governments ought to make.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the state attorneys general sent Posner their own set
of additional and separate demands, including what they said were
stronger terms for enforcing the proposed agreements. Although
other participants in the talks disagreed, Microsoft said the
additional demands from the states were the death blow to the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard-liners won,'' one Microsoft executive said. The
company and the Justice Department, he added, had reached agreement
on a number of elements in a possible settlement, though further
negotiations were needed. But after the states weighed in with new
demands, he said, it became clear that the gap between Microsoft
and the plaintiffs was too wide to be bridged.
</P>
<P>
   One person involved in the talks said Microsoft's response on
Friday was ``not even close'' to the Justice Department proposal.
Microsoft, this participant said, insisted on its unrestricted
freedom to bundle software _ like Internet browsing software _ to
its industry-standard Windows operating system, which was a key
element in the case.
</P>
<P>
   One attorney general, Richard A. Blumenthal of Connecticut,
said: ``We sought common ground, but the differences between us
were unbridgeable. We are now ready to return to the courtroom with
the same aggressive and determined approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer industry leaders expressed relief at the news that the
talks broke down. For the last two days they had been pressing the
Justice Department to toughen its proposed sanctions, which they
said would have done little to restrain Microsoft from abusing its
market power. The Justice Department, in response, had been telling
these executives that they did not fully understand the
government's position.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday evening, Ken Wasch, president of the Software and
Information Industry Association, a trade group, said: ``The
Justice Department and the states successfully litigated this case
for two years, and now they are going to continue pursuing the goal
of restoring competition to the software industry in the courts.''
He and other executives said they preferred to send the case back
to court, where a finding that Microsoft violated the nation's
antitrust laws is expected.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among the major points in the final draft of the proposed
agreement put forward by the Justice Department were these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft would be required to establish a uniform pricing
schedule for the Windows operating system so the company could not
use price discrimination to penalize companies that defy its will.
</P>
<P>
   _ The company would be prohibited from tying any of its products
to Windows by sales contract, though it would still be free to
integrate applications or features into the program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft would be forbidden to strike exclusive contracts
with other companies, as it did with Internet service providers who
were asked to feature Microsoft's Web browser and none other.
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft would be required to share technical information
about its products without discrimination with any company that had
a right to it.
</P>
<P>
   _ The company would also be required to disclosure the software
interfaces that allow programmers to like their programs to
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft would no longer be allowed to raise the price of
older versions of Windows as soon as a new one is released, a
tactic to prompt faster migration to the new version. The company
would have to support the old version, and sell it at the same
price, for three years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Computer manufacturers would be allowed to license the source
code to Windows so they could modify it, allowing them to change
opening screen uses see when the turn the computer on. They could
also modify the program to feature program they prefer, such as a
different browser. But Microsoft would disclaim any responsibility
for offering technical support for those parts of the program that
have been changed, or affected by the changes.
</P>
<P>
   One official said Posner had been receiving e-mail messages and
telephone calls from numerous state officials over the last several
days, complaining that their interests were being ignored and
warning that there could be no settlement without the states'
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Posner noted: ``I particularly want to emphasize that the
collapse of the mediation is not due to any lack of skill,
flexibility, energy, determination, or professionalism on the part
of the Department of Justice and Microsoft Corporation'' Nowhere
did he make mention of the states.

ANGELS SAY THEY'RE CONTENDERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- When the Angels open the 2000 major league baseball
season against the defending World Series champion New York Yankees
Monday night at Edison Field, they will honor members of their
all-time team, which was selected by the fans to commemorate the
franchise's 40th season.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Jackson will be there. Bobby Grich, Brian Downing and
Doug DeCinces will be there. Chuck Finley and Jim Edmonds, however,
have committed to previous engagements.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, voted to the team as one of two left-handed starters,
will be in Baltimore, where his new team, the Cleveland Indians,
are playing the Orioles. Edmonds, the franchise's all-time center
fielder, will be in St. Louis, where his new team, the Cardinals,
are playing the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels promised changes would be made after last season's
debacle, and they were true to their word.
</P>
<P>
   Out as general manager is Bill Bavasi. In is Bill Stoneman. Out
as manager is Terry Collins. In is Mike Scioscia. The entire
coaching staff, with the exception of bench coach Joe Maddon, is
new. The scouting staff was replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Finley's departure, changes to the players roster
were slow in coming. Talks of a deal to trade Edmonds for pitching
help went on all winter. And finally, after Stoneman suggested no
deal would be made, a deal was made.
</P>
<P>
   On March 23, less than a week before the team broke camp in
Arizona, Edmonds was traded to the Cardinals for 18-game winner
Kent Bottenfield and second baseman Adam Kennedy, who has become
the starting second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   When Stoneman was hired last Nov. 1, there was a lot of work
needed to be done in a short period of time. Now looking at the
roster -- and there might be more changes coming -- the Angels say
they are happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're better balanced now,'' Stoneman said. ``We were
able to add starting pitching. That helps. We were able to add a
second baseman. That helps.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps because going into spring training, those two areas
were the club's biggest holes. The starting pitching is still
questionable, but if they can stay healthy they'll be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hill has an arthritic elbow and hasn't won more than nine
games in a season since he won 16 for Texas in 1996. Bottenfield
will provide innings and keep the team in the game. Ortiz, if his
shoulder is healthy, is a Rookie of the Year 9to

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Gore, not Bush, agrees to debate
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has accepted an invitation to a foreign
policy debate with likely Republican presidential nominee George W.
Bush, but Bush hasn't said whether he'll attend. On Friday Gore's
camp prodded Bush to take the bait. ``We hope he will reconsider
his decision,'' Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said. ``Bush still has
the opportunity to agree to Gore's challenge to drop radio and TV
ads and hold regular debates on the issues.'' The debate has been
proposed by CNN and the Council on Foreign Relations. It was
scheduled to run 60 minutes in late April and feature questions
from journalists and international affairs experts.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN GETS MOST FEC MATCHING FUNDS
</P>
<P>
   Former Republican presidential contender Sen. John McCain scored
more than half of the $5.9 million the government will issue in
matching funds to seven current and former presidential candidates,
the Federal Election Commission announced Friday. Totals include:
</P>
<P>
   _ $3.7 million for McCain, who suspended his presidential
campaign after the Super Tuesday primaries March 7. Many political
analysts said the amount signifies McCain's fund-raising strength
after he won the New Hampshire primary in February. That brought
his total to $10.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vice President Al Gore will receive another $718,485, bringing
his total to $13.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley, who has abandoned his campaign,
will receive another $849,553, bringing his total to $12.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ Patrick Buchanan, who is seeking the Reform Party nomination,
will get $174,185, bringing his total to $3.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government matches the first $250 of each individual
contribution for candidates who agree to limit their total primary
spending to $40.5 million. GOP presidential candidate George W.
Bush, who has raised a record $75 million, is not accepting federal
funds and can spend as much as he can raise in his GOP presidential
bid.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH AND MCCAIN REACH DELEGATE DEAL
</P>
<P>
   John McCain is giving George W. Bush six of the Michigan
delegates he won and has similar deals or is close to agreement in
several New England states McCain won before suspending his
campaign. The Arizona senator agreed to give Bush six delegates to
add to the six Bush won in the Feb. 22 Michigan primary, leaving
McCain with 46 of the state's 58. The deal allows Gov. John Engler
to attend the National Republican Convention as a Bush delegate and
is the latest move toward GOP reconciliation after the divisive
primary contest.
</P>
<P>
   KEYES TIPS HAT TO GORE
</P>
<P>
   Still pursuing his Republican presidential bid, Alan Keyes told
Wisconsin voters this week that Vice President Al Gore, the
presumed Democratic nominee, has a ``pretty good chance'' of
winning the election. Keyes said Gore would benefit from ``economic
prosperity and peace'' in a race against the presumed Republican
nominee, George W. Bush. Ambassador Keyes, who spoke to voters at
the Monroe County Fairgrounds, said Republicans needed to promote
moral values and oppose abortion, which he called worse than
slavery.
</P>
<P>
   BUCHANAN WEIGHS IN ON OIL PRICES
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan says the United States should stabilize oil prices
in part by lifting sanctions on Iran and Iraq, selling them
oil-drilling equipment and threatening to withhold military help
from Persian Gulf allies unless crude prices fall to $20 a barrel.
``None of these Gulf regimes is worth another war,'' Buchanan said
Friday at Boston University. ``We should play hardball with those
who play hardball with us.'' Buchanan blamed the problem on ``a
global price-rigging conspiracy by oil-exporting nations.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSH FAMILY TREE SPANS 16 PRESIDENTS
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has always had an impressive family tree. But it
seems he has an even richer political pedigree than the immediate
family and recent ancestors. In fact, according to the
little-noticed 1995 ``Ancestors of American Presidents'' by
genealogist Gary Boyd Roberts, George W.'s relations extend to 16
U.S. presidents. Not only that, but he is distant kin to a bunch of
British monarchs and even Pocahontas, the American Indian princess.
Roberts' president list: George Washington, Millard Fillmore,
Franklin Pierce, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses Grant, Rutherford B.
Hayes, James Garfield, Grover Cleveland, Teddy Roosevelt, William
Howard Taft, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Franklin Roosevelt,
Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and, of course, George H.W. Bush.

SAVE THE NICETIES: SPARTANS REACH THE FINAL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ It looked like a game played at lunchtime on one
bent basket in an industrial warehouse between two teams of
hard-hatted and work-booted laborers who knew each other too well.
Instead, Saturday night's game was a NCAA tournament semifinal, a
highly anticipated full-court game before a sold-out crowd and a
national television audience.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State and Wisconsin knew each other quite well _ this
was the Badgers' fourth attempt at beating the Spartans this season
_ and it showed. On defense, each team played with tenacity and the
intimacy of knowing each other's plays. On offense, however, both
teams were awful, with both shooting 35 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the top-seeded Spartans (31-7) were less awful and
prevailed, 53-41, to advance to the championship game against the
winner of Saturday night's North Carolina-Florida game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's beautiful to be able to play basketball with five
guys and take on superior athletes with more skill and be able to
beat them,'' Wisconsin's Mike Kelley said before the game. ``I
don't know how you can't enjoy that. But I think it is viewed as
ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   The 42,399 who brimmed to the top of the RCA Dome must have
believed they had been transported back to another time, or to 1941
to be exact, the third year of the NCAA tournament when Wisconsin
(22-14) employed equally comatose tactics to win the national title
by beating Washington State, 39-34.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers' jersey-to-jersey defense kept them on pace to match
their forefathers on the scoreboard through a 19-17 first half. But
in the first nine minutes of the second, the Spartans went on a
15-5 run to take 34-22 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Michigan State senior Morris Peterson, who returned
here on Friday from Mississippi and the funeral of his grandmother,
Clara Mae Spencer, who shifted the Spartans briefly from no gear to
first gear.
</P>
<P>
   He had 10 points on 4-of-6 shooting in the run after going just
1 of 5 in the first half. He finished with 20 points to lead all
scorers. His teammate Mateen Cleaves led both teams in rebounding
with 11.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson's grandmother died last Saturday on the morning of the
Midwest Regional final, but his family waited to tell him until
after the victory over Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's going to have the best seat in the house,'' he
said. ``She's going to be sitting right there watching over the
team and guiding us. Hopefully, we can make something happen for
her.
</P>
<P>
   When Peterson hit a 3-pointer with 8 minutes 35 seconds
remaining, his 17th point of the game, the somnambulant crowd came
to life as Michigan State took a 15-point lead. The Badgers closed
to 40-29 with 5:40 to play when their leading scorer in the
tournament, Jon Bryant, scored his first basket of the game, but
they never got closer.

PEREZ IMPRESSIVE AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO - The Dodgers were worried about the final spot in the
rotation because Eric Gagne and Carlos Perez were dreadful early in
the spring.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with the exhibition season over, Perez's strong finish
has eased some apprehension about the spot in the rotation. And
Chan Ho Park's continued problems have bred concern.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought Perez would be pitching better than Park
entering the season?
</P>
<P>
   Perez finished his spring by allowing one run in four innings of
the Dodgers' 2-1 win against Toronto on Saturday at SkyDome. In his
last four starts, Perez's ERA is 2.50.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Park ended his spring by allowing five runs in four
innings on Thursday. His 7.63 ERA is worse than the 7.43 ERA Perez
had in `99. And after working on mechanics and his change-up during
his first three starts of the spring, Park tried to put it all
together. Still, he had an8.31 ERA in his last three starts and
battled tightness in his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The positive thing about (Park) is he's getting more
consistent release points, and that's what he's been working on,''
Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley said. ``The numbers aren't good, but
so what? The other day he started off stiff, and by the second
inning he loosened up and was throwing the ball really good. But
he's got a lot on his mind, he's trying to do a lot of different
things right.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the battle Park must win to be successful. Manager
Davey Johnson has had several talks with Park about just pitching
instead of letting outside distractions creep into his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had that conversation with him already, and I'm going to
continue to have it,'' Johnson said. ``Don't give him a lot of time
to wait forthe ball. Don't let him wait around for signs. Give it
to him. Work faster. Let's go.''
</P>
<P>
   Park said the tightness in his arm was caused by a slight change
in his mechanics with his right leg, but he insists that's over. He
also said he feels fine despite the poor spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy physically, and happy mentally,'' said Park, trying
to rebound from a year in which he was 13-11 but had a 5.23 ERA.
``I did have agood spring. I worked out a lot. I feel like I'm
stronger.''

CHINA HAS `WAIT AND SEE' ATTITUDE TO TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS 16th graf with talks between China and the European Union
breaking down.) 
 (lb) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chinese leaders have told the United States that
they plan to stick with a ``wait and see'' attitude toward Taiwan's
new president and that they are open to resuming a dialogue with
the estranged island, a senior administration official said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese assurances, if borne out, come at a crucial time for
the administration, which is scrambling to put relations with China
on an even keel before President Clinton leaves office and to
persuade Congress to upgrade economic relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, President Jiang Zemin of China and other top leaders
assured the national security adviser, Sandy Berger, that China's
initial, restrained reaction to the election of Chen Shui-bian as
Taiwan's president last month was part of a ``considered policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen's party had previously called for independence from China,
something Beijing has sworn it will not allow, and he only recently
muted that stance.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have decided, at least for the time being, to try to
reach an accommodation with his new government, which is expected
to be formed in May, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't quite know what to make of the situation,'' the
senior administration official said, describing Berger's two-day
talks with the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they are not inclined to act in a precipitous way and they
want to find a way to reach an accommodation consistent with their
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are working on a formulation consistent with their
one-China principle,'' the official added.
</P>
<P>
   Berger traveled to China in part because the administration is
simultaneously seeking to smooth relations between mainland China
and Taiwan even as it struggles to assemble a Republican-dominated
coalition of lawmakers willing to grant China permanent trading
rights in the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders said that any flare-up in tension between
China and Taiwan would almost certainly derail the administration's
hopes to win passage of the trade measure soon. The administration,
in turn, has warned that failure to pass the measure could
seriously set back relations with China and diminish U.S. influence
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an important national security argument for going
forward with permanent normal trade relations, which is if anything
intensified by developments related to Taiwan,'' said the senior
administration official. ``It not only creates a degree of
interdependence between China and the world community but also to
the economic integration of China and Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has in the past threatened to attack Taiwan if it tries
to secede. During Taiwan's election four years ago, the Chinese
lobbed missiles around the island in an attempt to intimidate
voters. Senior Chinese leaders gave a bellicose warning to Taiwan
shortly before the latest elections as well, apparently to persuade
voters to back candidates considered more favorable to
reunification than Chen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, relieved by Chen's conciliatory comments after his
election, China seems inclined to remain open to dialogue, the
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States has no intention of mediating between
Taiwan and China, the officials said that the two sides had the
potential to work through a complex set of historical formulations
for dealing with each other based on differing views of Chinese
sovereignty, and to resume a dialogue that was broken off in the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Though that process would probably take many months, if it
happened at all, the mere prospect reduces the risk of rising
tensions blocking passage of normal trade relations, which Clinton
has called his top remaining foreign-policy priority. A
congressional vote on the matter is expected in May, the same time
that Taiwan's new government takes power.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between China and the European Union over China's entry
into the trade group broke down on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has asked Congress to give up its annual
review of China's trade status, granting it the same trading rights
_ called permanent normal trade relations _ that most other
countries have.
</P>
<P>
   The step is required if U.S. companies are to benefit fully from
a market-opening agreement that the administration negotiated as
part of China's continuing effort to join the World Trade
Organization. Congress has no vote on whether China can join the
Geneva-based trade-regulation body.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is a technical one _ removing China's name from a
dwindling list of nations subject to Title IV of the Trade Act of
1974, also known as Jackson-Vanik.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters argue that the economic rationale for giving up the
annual review is overwhelming. The agreement with China requires it
to open its markets and overhaul its regulatory regime, making way
for foreign competitors in every area from agriculture to the
Internet. But as Clinton has noted, ``it's a one-way deal'' that
does not require reciprocal trading concessions by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has argued that granting permanent normal trading
relations is essential for the national security of the United
States. He said it would support reformers in China's government,
lock China's bureaucracy into a rules-based international trading
regime and contribute to stability in Asia. Rejection would affect
the United States' economic interests, Clinton said last week, but
``the national security consequences would be worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote, however, has become freighted both with ideological
concerns about China's Communist government and with domestic
political worries in an election year. While the U.S. business
community has begun a national lobbying campaign on behalf of the
measure, labor unions have mounted a vigorous opposition designed
to culminate in what unions are promising will be a huge
mobilization of supporters in Washington and around the nation on
April 12.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, both political parties are divided about the wisdom of
granting new trading rights to a country that has a weak
human-rights record and has often made threats to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Senate passage is considered likely. But if the measure slips
through the House, Clinton will have the Republicans to thank;
early counts show that that two-thirds of his own party's members
in the House will vote against permanent normal trade relations.
</P>
<P>
   The administration and the Republican leadership in the House
have begun to work together to build a coalition across party lines
in support of the measure.

<P>
   Dennis Hastert, the House majority leader, has acceded to
administration pleas and agreed to set a date for the vote in late
May, aides said, even though Republican leaders acknowledge that
Clinton has not fulfilled what they had insisted was a
prerequisite: proving that he can produce enough Democrats to
ensure passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragic irony that while the president has put this at
the top of his priority list, his own party is becoming more
xenophobic,'' said David Dreier, R-Calif., who heads the House
rules committee. ``But the president is engaged and working hard,
and we are willing to work with him to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, getting to 218 votes may prove difficult. Although
business pressure on Republicans has been intense, some members of
the party argue that the administration should work actively for
the overthrow of the Chinese government instead of giving it
upgraded trading rights.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides say the party will struggle to produce 150
votes in favor of permanent normal trade relations, the same number
that supported annual renewal of China's trading rights last year.
</P>
<P>
   That means supporters will need about 70 Democrats to vote in
favor, and more if Republicans experience any more slippage.
Democratic lawmakers who favor the measure say that this is still
possible, but acknowledge that most of their potential supporters
are still uncommitted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has started a campaign _ run out of the Old Executive
Office Building next to the White House _ that is aimed primarily
at securing support from wavering Democrats. Aides said Clinton is
spending more time on China trade than on any other single item on
his agenda. He will make his sixth major address on the subject on
Monday in California and has scheduled numerous evening talks with
lawmakers in the White House this month.
</P>
<P>
   The president has also assigned five cabinet secretaries to make
China their priority. Three of them _ Commerce Secretary William
Daley, the U.S. trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, and
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman _ have cleared their schedules
this spring to focus on lobbying lawmakers and crisscrossing the
country to drum up support for China trade in the home districts of
key lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an intensive, all-out effort, member by member,
district by district, explaining what this agreement is really
about and what's at stake in terms of relations with China,'' said
Barshefsky, who negotiated the sweeping trade agreement that opened
the door for China to join the WTO. ``What we're saying is that
this decision is about the best way to influence China, not just on
economics but all the surrounding issues as well.''

SHAQ IGNORES NUMBERS GAME

   EL SEGUNDO - Shaquille O'Neal's drive for the NBA scoring title
may be unintentional - he says he doesn't care whether he gets it
or not - but it's alive and well after his 37-point drubbing of the
Philadelphia 76ers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal heads into today's game against the New York Knicks with
a 29.1-point average, No. 1 in the league. Now the greatest threat
to his second career scoring trophy (aside from the Sixers' Allen
Iverson) is the Lakers' own success.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Lakers (61-12) clinch home-court advantage throughout
the playoffs - they need three wins, three Portland losses or any
combination thereof - O'Neal's minutes will shrink. So will his
scoring opportunities, as coach Phil Jackson plans to rest him for
the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Jackson will stick to the status quo, which
means 37 to 40 minutes a night for O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think clinching is something that when it happens, it will
happen. You just play it out and still keep as competitive as you
can,'' Jackson said. ``That's just the only way to play basketball,
for us at least. And yet humanly it's almost impossible not to
relax a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said last week that O'Neal's play would show him whether
he wanted the scoring and rebounding titles. O'Neal's performance
Friday left an impression, but afterward O'Neal once again
downplayed the scoring race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think the more competitive a game, the more he's going
to step up,'' Jackson said. ``He was very active (Friday) night,
not only at the offensive end but defensively. I think that
competitive nature naturally brings it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the judge is the next time we play Golden State or the
next time we play ... an under-.500, non-playoff team, how hard
he's going to play in that kind of a game. It's kind of the
indicator as to what level he wants to win a scoring title, but
he's basically told me it's not important to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest time: Jackson sounds ready to finally give veteran Ron
Harper the extended rest he's been promised.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of indicating Harper would head to the injured list,
Jackson said ``there's a good possibility'' he'll make the move

CHINA HAS `WAIT AND SEE' ATTITUDE TO TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS title for Hastert   in 1st graf of 2nd take; ADDS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chinese leaders have told the United States that
they plan to stick with a ``wait and see'' attitude toward Taiwan's
new president and that they are open to resuming a dialogue with
the estranged island, a senior administration official said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese assurances, if borne out, come at a crucial time for
the administration, which is scrambling to put relations with China
on an even keel before President Clinton leaves office and to
persuade Congress to upgrade economic relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, President Jiang Zemin of China and other top leaders
assured the national security adviser, Sandy Berger, that China's
initial, restrained reaction to the election of Chen Shui-bian as
Taiwan's president last month was part of a ``considered policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen's party had previously called for independence from China,
something Beijing has sworn it will not allow, and he only recently
muted that stance.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have decided, at least for the time being, to try to
reach an accommodation with his new government, which is expected
to be formed in May, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't quite know what to make of the situation,'' the
senior administration official said, describing Berger's two-day
talks with the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they are not inclined to act in a precipitous way and they
want to find a way to reach an accommodation consistent with their
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are working on a formulation consistent with their
one-China principle,'' the official added.
</P>
<P>
   Berger traveled to China in part because the administration is
simultaneously seeking to smooth relations between mainland China
and Taiwan even as it struggles to assemble a Republican-dominated
coalition of lawmakers willing to grant China permanent trading
rights in the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders said that any flare-up in tension between
China and Taiwan would almost certainly derail the administration's
hopes to win passage of the trade measure soon. The administration,
in turn, has warned that failure to pass the measure could
seriously set back relations with China and diminish U.S. influence
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an important national security argument for going
forward with permanent normal trade relations, which is if anything
intensified by developments related to Taiwan,'' said the senior
administration official. ``It not only creates a degree of
interdependence between China and the world community but also to
the economic integration of China and Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has in the past threatened to attack Taiwan if it tries
to secede. During Taiwan's election four years ago, the Chinese
lobbed missiles around the island in an attempt to intimidate
voters. Senior Chinese leaders gave a bellicose warning to Taiwan
shortly before the latest elections as well, apparently to persuade
voters to back candidates considered more favorable to
reunification than Chen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, relieved by Chen's conciliatory comments after his

administration official said.

DALY TRIES TO TURN DODGERS AROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. - It took the Fox Group 18 months to turn one
of sports' great franchises into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   In the five months since becoming the managing partner, chairman
and CEO, Bob Daly brought back control to a team Fox had allowed to
spiral out of control, returned focus and given reason to believe
the family-friendly days of the O'Malleys are possible again.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are a day from opening the 2000 season in Montreal,
but they are light years removed from the end of the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see how things have simmered down,'' Dodgers left fielder
Gary Sheffield said. ``Just having (president and COO) Bob Graziano
back and Daly having some ownership, I think it brought a sense of
urgency for this franchise to get back to where it needs to be to
get along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have new ownership you're going to have
adjustments. You have to make a couple of mistakes, a couple
decisions you feel are right, and then you learn from them. I think
the Fox Group has seen how baseball is operated the past couple of
years and they see they needed to hire certain types of people, and
they did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly's brought a little boy's enthusiasm and passion for
baseball back to Dodgers ownership after two years of facelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Daly ran Warner Bros. and CBS, but he's loved baseball since he
attended a Brooklyn Dodgers game as a 6-year-old. But this is also
business, and Daly, 63, didn't purchase a minority share and agree
to run the club on a day-to-day basis to lose money. Rupert Murdoch
still pays most of the bills, but Daly has a piece, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Daly said the Dodgers lost $22 million last year. The club
figures to lose around $15 million this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy when I was at Warner Bros. is, `We're in this
together,' '' Daly said. ``I don't think anybody should point
fingers when things don't go right. I think it's critical, that
when we start the season that (manager Davey Johnson) and (general
manager Kevin Malone) and me and (senior vice president Derrick
Hall) and Bob Graziano and everybody are all on the same page. If
things don't go right, I believe you start at the top. I'm
responsible, and I don't mind taking the rap, as long as we're all
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to stay together, and last year I have the feeling
the Dodgers weren't together, and I think probably because they
were all shocked how badly they were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly preaches stability. During the Fox 18-month
hands-mostly-off run of the Dodgers, the environment created by Fox
executives Peter Chernin, Chase Carey and News Corporation chairman
and CEO Murdoch, was anything but stable:
</P>
<P>
   -The bungled Mike Piazza negotiations that led to the catcher's
trade. From that deal, only Sheffield remains with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   -The firing of manager Bill Russell and general manager Fred
Claire in June 1998. Replacements were interim in Glenn Hoffman and
Tom Lasorda, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   -Malone was hired as the general manager in late September, and,
at the urging of Fox, hired Johnson as manager.
</P>
<P>
   -Pitching coach Charlie Hough was fired last May and replaced
with Claude Osteen.
</P>
<P>
   -Fox hired NBA marketing genius Rick Welts last summer to
oversee all of the company's sports holdings. Welts, who resigned
in December, fired Graziano as president and CEO of the Dodgers in
late September. Daly then entered the equation and brought Graziano
back in November, but only after Chernin, at the October press
conference introducing Daly, said Graziano was never fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I nearly had a heart attack when they changed the pitching
coach, and that's not a judgment call on my part, at all, about one
pitching coach versus another pitching coach,'' Daly said. ``I
bring no judgment, so I don't know. Claude Osteen is a tremendous
pitching coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not bringing judgment, no judgment. I'm a manager. I'm a
guy that runs companies. You don't do that, unless you have to; the
guy is incapacitated, he is irresponsible, whatever he is. You
don't do that. That was not, to me, a good idea, because it's just
too disruptive. That's a management decision I would question, not
over abilities, call Claude Osteen better, but to me that's a very
disruptive thing to do to your pitching staff and everybody,
especially after going through previous changes.''
</P>
<P>
   And intertwined through it all was griping players, who aired
their grievances through newspapers. Players complained about a
lack of communication. A battle between Eric Young and Johnson last
season became public, and Raul Mondesi blasted Malone and Johnson
and asked to be traded. That was last year, and Daly saw it all. He
also didn't think it looked very good.
</P>
<P>
   So when center fielder Devon White expressed concern about
knowing his role when spring training began six weeks ago, all
parties were called together to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I think, if you want to call it the new Dodgers,
is we confronted the thing right up front,'' Daly said. ``We took
the thing on right as we got here.... Basically everybody told him
up front, he's going to have to hustle and do his stuff. Everybody
talked to him and he knew exactly where he stood.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly joined the organization Oct. 28, 1999, and has made a lot
of changes. He brought back public relations whiz Derrick Hall and
made him senior vice president, communications.
</P>
<P>
   From his office down the left-field line, Daly watched and
charted the renovations at Dodger Stadium. He jumped into the
player personnel side and negotiated Shawn Green's contract, thus
finalizing the trade with Toronto involving Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   The day the Dodgers traded Young and Ismael Valdes to Chicago
for Terry Adams and two minor-leaguers, Daly and Malone spoke on
the phone six times about it. Daly also played a big role in
signing former Dodger Orel Hershiser.
</P>
<P>
   In spring training, Daly met with the front office and coaching
staff to discuss the roster. He talked with pitcher Carlos Perez,
not only about his drunk-driving charge last month, but Perez's
on-field behavior, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a tough winter for a lot of reasons for the
Dodgers, and the way it was handled was great,'' Johnson said. ``A
lot of the clouds were removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly also turned salesman. Between negotiating long-term
contracts for Green, Adrian Beltre, Eric Karros and Mark
Grudzielanek, he sold luxury suites at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, what always distinguished the Dodgers, in addition to
the fact they always had winning ballclubs, is they always had done
things in a total professional way,'' Daly said. ``You may not even
agree with all the decisions they made, but they were professional.
I questioned a lot of decisions the Dodgers made in the '90s. I
have faxes that I sent. Peter O'Malley has a file with my faxes in
it. From the winning of the World Series in 1988, my faxes began in
1989. Losing Steve Sax was my first fax. I could not believe we
lost Steve Sax. I've had a lot of feelings about that, but it was
done in a professional way.
</P>
<P>
   ``My management style says if you're going to make a change, and
sometimes you do, you make it at the right time, unless there's a
reason that is so predominant that you have to do it. Sometimes you
have a wholesale revolt, so you have to do it. But if you're going
to do it, make it at the right time. And I think the problem with
the Dodgers are there were too many changes. You're a Dodger fan,
you don't expect all these changes.''
</P>
<P>
   So, should Dodgers fans expect a change at the general manager's
positions should the team stumble to another 77-85 record despite a
payroll of near $92 million
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin Malone made the two trades I find the most damaging to
the Dodgers,'' Daly said. ``The (Henry) Rodriguez trade and the
Pedro Martinez trade were made by Kevin Malone; on the other side
of the fence, he was with Montreal (at the time).... The one thing
I know about Kevin Malone is that he is a very, very good judge of

SECOND-RANKED HINGIS ENDS ON TOP IN ERICSSON
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. _ Lindsay Davenport will become the world's
top-ranked women's player on Monday when the latest WTA rankings
comes out. Yet Saturday she was a distant second in the Ericsson
Open.
</P>
<P>
   Martina Hingis, whose No. 1 position Davenport will take,
administered a 6-3, 6-2 humbling in the final at the Tennis Center
at Crandon Park, taking the $350,000 top prize.
</P>
<P>
   The 58-minute victory stopped Davenport's winning streak at 21
matches, as well as Hingis' five-match losing streak against her.
The last time Hingis had prevailed over Davenport was more than 16
months ago _ on Nov. 22, 1998, in the Chase Championships at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   After the victory, Hingis approached Davenport and told her she
deserved to be ranked No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far this season, she's played very well,'' Hingis said.
``But it's different pressure being No. 1 and No. 2. Now I'm the
hunter.''
</P>
<P>
   In this mushrooming rivalry, Davenport still leads overall,
11-8. This is the fourth straight final between the two in
tournaments they have both entered. Not since Chris Evert and
Martina Navratilova, who met in five straight finals spanning 1984
and '85, have the top two ranked women's players met with such
regularity.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport said she felt subpar Saturday, the result of a
three-set semifinal against Sandrine Testud late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost felt like I left everything out there that night and
didn't bring anything today,'' Davenport said. ``I just felt really
heavy today. I was definitely a step slow.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport made 40 unforced errors to Hingis' 10 and couldn't
rely on her usually potent first serve, in part because of a
persistent breeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll meet many more times and I'll beat her again
one day,'' Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, who didn't lose a set in this tournament, took
Saturday's first set in 30 minutes. She broke Davenport's service
in the second and fourth games, in the process making Davenport
look overmatched. One spectator, upset at her plethora of unforced
errors, even boomed, ``Davenport, this is the final.''
</P>
<P>
   She proceeded to win the next three games, breaking Hingis
twice. But just as it appeared there would be some drama after all,
Hingis took charge again. She easily broke Davenport, forcing her
into three forehand errors, and held service to finish the set.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis moved up by 4-2 in the next set, the same spot she was in
two weeks ago in Indian Wells, Calif., when Davenport won the last
10 games to capture the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was different this time,'' Hingis said. ``I broke her many
more times. She was not serving that well. When we got into the
rallies today, I just felt like we were even. She didn't get that
many free points off her serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis broke Davenport in the seventh game after it reached
deuce, hitting a backhand winner and forcing her to send a backhand
long.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Hingis simply held service to wrap up the match.
Davenport watched the clinching backhand whiz by.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis said the blustery conditions favored her patient return
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have more chances because I run and try to get as many balls
back as I can, then try to do something,'' she said. ``Here,
Lindsay just can't go for big shots because it's too dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching Davenport labor in the match, Hingis said she was
glad she didn't play doubles in this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when things are going great, it's still very tiring,''
Hingis said. ``It takes a lot out of you. Every time you go out
there, you have to motivate yourself, push yourself one more day,
one more time.''
</P>
<P>
   But she acknowledged that this turned out to be one of the most
satisfying weeks of her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like every tournament,'' Hingis said, ``I got better. I don't
want to take too long off because I feel so good right now.''

EDITORIAL: DIMMED PROMISE IN PRAGUE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, April 2:
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright expected a warm reception
when she visited her native Prague, Czech Republic, last month. But
even she was surprised to learn shortly before her arrival that
President Vaclav Havel intended to propose her as a possible
successor. Beyond his admiration for Albright, Havel was trying to
register a larger point. In the decade since the Velvet Revolution
against Communist rule, Prague's political leaders have compiled a
record of disillusioning failure, including the fracturing of
Czechoslovakia into separate Czech and Slovak states in 1993. No
one of Havel's stature has yet emerged to replace him when his term
expires in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Czechoslovakia's expectations were understandably high when it
restored parliamentary democracy and market economics in 1990.
Between the two world wars, it was one of Eastern Europe's most
vigorous and longest-surviving constitutional democracies. Under
Alexander Dubcek in the 1960s, it tested the limits of liberal
Communism. Then, after the Soviet invasion of 1968, its dissident
intellectuals, foremost among them Havel, developed a vision of a
broadly based civil society. By the bleak standards of the Soviet
bloc, Czechoslovakia's economy performed relatively well.
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring failures of the past decade have been in
economic management. Under Vaclav Klaus, who served first as
finance minister and then as prime minister until 1997, state-owned
industries were privatized without adequate legal oversight or
accountability. Initially, the results were promising. But more
recently growth has sputtered and a series of corruption scandals
has tainted the reputation of business and political leaders. The
Czech Republic still has one of Eastern Europe's richer economies
and is a candidate for early admission to the European Union. But a
more thoughtful round of reforms backed by more legal safeguards
will be needed to attract foreign investment and revive growth.
</P>
<P>
   Political life has also been disappointing. Klaus, a brash
conservative, saw his early popularity erode as the economy
weakened. Three years ago he fell from office amid a corruption
scandal. A weak Social Democratic government now rules in coalition
with Klaus' conservatives. As president, Havel remains popular and
respected, but his health is poor and his political influence is
limited.
</P>
<P>
   Albright was right to disclaim any interest in the Czech
presidency. It would create an intolerable conflict of interest for
a secretary of state to be looking ahead to directing the affairs
of another country. But if Havel's proposal can jolt Czech
politicians into thinking more creatively about their future
leadership, it will have served a good purpose.

WHETHER YOU MOW OR MOAN

 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The days are getting warmer, the nights are getting shorter, and
the sun is moving higher in the sky. It is the time of year when
homeowners reclaim their yards and gardens. And what could be more
inviting than the idea of meandering around the yard enveloped by
spring breezes, bird songs and the muffled roar of a self-mulching
gas mower?
</P>
<P>
   Root-canal work, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   Well, whether you are the kind of homeowner who can't wait to
plunge head-first into lawn chores, or the type who would rather
plunge into a porch chair and watch a professional do the work, now
is the time to start thinking about your lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say that except for grub control, most everything you're
going to be doing to your lawn you'll be doing over the next month
or so,'' said Tim Elkner, a Penn State extension agent in
Lancaster, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Elkner explained that this is a critical time of year for lawns
because what is done _ or not done _ within the next few weeks will
determine in large part how the lawn will look during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   For a lawn to be at its best in July and August, it has to
develop a strong, hardy root system in the spring. So the first
thing a homeowner should do is to rake the grass to aerate the
soil, and to remove any twigs, leaves or dead grass that may have
accumulated over the winter. It is also wise to avoid the
temptation to cut the lawn too short on the first mowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some folks like to crank their mowers all the way down to get
that wall-to-wall carpet effect,'' Elkner said. ``But if you leave
the grass a little longer right now, anywhere from 2{ to 3 inches,
you'll end up with hardier grass and a better root system.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing that will generally not be necessary this year, he
said, is grub control. He explained that grubs _ those small,
white, crescent-shaped critters that eat grass roots on their way
to becoming adult beetles _ are not likely to be a problem this
year, because of last year's dry summer.
</P>
<P>
   Beetle eggs, which are laid in the summer, need moisture to
hatch. ``So unless you watered regularly last summer,'' Elkner
said, ``there probably wasn't enough moisture in the soil for the
eggs to hatch.''
</P>
<P>
   What could be a problem, though, is crab grass.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Long, a vice president of Scotts Lawn Service, a subsidiary
of Scotts Co., the lawn-products manufacturer in Marysville, Ohio,
said that crab-grass seeds would not have been affected by the dry
conditions last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any areas of your lawn had crab grass last year, it's a
good bet you'll have it again this year,'' Long said, explaining
that the only way to prevent crab grass from gaining a foothold is
to apply a pre-emergent herbicide just before the crab-grass seeds
start germinating.
</P>
<P>
   If the herbicide is applied too early, he said, any rain that
falls after the application and before germination could dilute or
spread the herbicide so much that it becomes ineffective. If it is
applied too late, on the other hand, weeds that have already
sprouted have a good chance of surviving the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   So when is the right time to apply a pre-emergent?
</P>
<P>
   ``Once soil temperatures reach 55 or 60 degrees for a few days
running, the seeds will start germinating,'' Long said. ``And
that's when you want to be applying your pre-emergent.'' He added
that now is also the time to do some seeding if the lawn has any
bare spots or areas that were damaged over the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general rule of thumb is that any bare spot larger than a
coffee saucer will not fill in over the course of a growing
season,'' Long said. Areas that are going to be seeded should be
raked well before seed is applied, he said, and then the seed
should be raked into the soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``And be sure to avoid applying your pre-emergent on any areas
you're seeding,'' he said, ``because the crab-grass preventer can't
tell the difference between germinating weed seeds and germinating
grass seeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Another routine lawn-maintenance chore this time of year is the
application of fertilizer. ``It's always good to make certain that
you get the lawn fed with a balanced fertilizer,'' Long said,
explaining that most fertilizers contain a combination of nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium, nutrients that are essential for healthy
lawn growth.
</P>
<P>
   What homeowners need to know when buying fertilizer is the ratio
of those nutrients, he said. A fertilizer with an ``NPK ratio'' of
2-1-1, which is a good ratio for a starter fertilizer for use in
the spring, would be one that contains two parts nitrogen (N), one
part phosphorus (P) and one part potassium (K). A fertilizer with
an NPK ratio of 3-1-1 could also be used at this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone has the time, energy or inclination
necessary to rake, seed, fertilize and trim the lawn. For those
people, there are plenty of professionals who are happy to do the
work for them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Our standard service contract consists of mowing, edging,
trimming and blowing once a week,'' said Michael Buczny, the owner
of Groundworks Landscaping, a lawn maintenance company in Long
Branch, N.J. The cost ranges from about $80 to $120 a month or
more, depending on the size of the lot; the number and type of
obstacles, things like swing sets and flower beds; and the length
of the sidewalks and driveways that have to be edged.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Giardino, the owner of C.G. Lawn and Landscaping in New
City, N.Y., said that his company offers a ``full maintenance''
service contract, which includes weekly cutting and edging, along
with mulching and weeding flower beds every two weeks, four or five
applications of fertilizer, the application of herbicides and
insecticides as needed, and weekly trimming of shrubs and hedges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that a ballpark figure for a full-service
maintenance contract can run from $350 to $400 a month'' for an
annual contract, he said. ``And if you include snowplowing in your
contract now, you can get a package deal for as little as $425 a
month.''

CITY CONVENIENCES, WITH TREES AND PARKING
</HEADLINE>
   (jw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Not everyone who lives in the outer boroughs is an aspiring
Manhattanite, resentful of the high rents that push people to the
north, south or east. On the contrary. Hard as it might be for some
of the more insular Manhattanites to believe, there are people who
prefer, say, Queens, and consider it a desirable and central
location.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Caccavale, who works in Manhattan for Quinn &AMP; Co., a
public relations firm, grew up in Westchester County and graduated
from Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. When she decided last
year that it was time to move out of her mother's house in Pelham
Manor after living there for a year to save money, she did not
really consider Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in suburbia,'' she said. ``I've always had a car. I
knew parking would be a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   She decided to look in Queens because it would put her close to
work, her family, friends on Long Island, and her boyfriend, who
lives in Astoria.
</P>
<P>
   Because she wanted to have a subway commute of only 25 minutes
or so to her office in the West 30s, she looked in neighborhoods
near the N and R lines. Fairly quickly, through an ad placed by an
owner, she found a one-bedroom apartment on 30th Avenue in
Boulevard Gardens, a large co-op complex on the border of Astoria
and Woodside. The 10 six-story buildings are threaded together with
paths bordered by grass and trees, which appealed to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like what I'm used to in suburbia,'' she said, adding
that the neighborhood was also safe and quiet. ``Coming home late
at night, I'm not afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the co-op told her that he had had several offers
well above his initial asking price of $800 a month, including
utilities, but he agreed to sublet the apartment to her for $840 a
month because she seemed the most stable of his prospective
tenants.
</P>
<P>
   And, probably, the most efficient. She got the apartment in late
August, and by the time she moved in in September, she had already
managed to furnish most of it. ``Within three weeks, I bought
everything,'' she said. A Labor Day sale at Jennifer Convertibles
yielded two couches with pillows, a coffee table, two side tables
and lamps, all for $1,000. At a small furniture store on Long
Island she found a bedroom set with two chests, a mirror, and two
bedside tables for $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought everything except the TV and the comforter'' with
money she had saved, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the apartment already feels as if she has lived there
forever, with scented candles gently perfuming the air, Caccavale
says she plans to stay in Queens for no more than five years. She
expects to become engaged this year to her boyfriend of six years,
a police officer, and eventually, to move to a suburb in
Westchester or on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Caccavale has always been a planner, a person looking ahead, and
thrifty, too. ``I would sell my Easter chocolate to my brother,''
she said, preferring the money to the candy. Her cautious nature
was shaped by a difficult start in life: when she was 20 days old,
her father, a detective, was killed.
</P>
<P>
   By living in Queens, she finds it easy to remain close to her
family, whose photos are everywhere in her apartment. Her desire to
stay close to them influenced her career path. Although she studied
journalism in college and expected to continue on that route, ``I
knew I'd have to move to Bumbletown, USA, to get a job,'' she said,
``and I wasn't ready to leave the area.'' And so she took the job
in public relations. She now specializes in travel, working with
clients like the Westin Rio Mar Beach in Puerto Rico, Le Parker
Meridien Hotel in New York and the Aruba Sonesta Resorts.
</P>
<P>
   With E-ZPass reducing her wait at bridge tollbooths, she said,
she can drive to her mother's house in 15 minutes. But usually, she
makes a detour. Almost every Saturday, she drives to her
grandmother's house in the Pelham Bay section of the Bronx to take
her grocery shopping, and then continues on to see her mother in
Pelham Manor _ and to do her laundry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I lived at home,'' she said, ``I don't like the whole
Laundromat thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friends like her new apartment in Queens, she said, because
they can all gather there _ and park their cars on the street _
before going into Manhattan on Saturday nights. Her office even
held its Christmas party there, because it was convenient for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great meeting spot,'' she said. ``Everything is less
than 30 minutes away.''

 EDITORIAL: SAVING THE SNAKE RIVER SALMON  (mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, April 2:
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been willing to challenge 70
years of accepted public policy that hydroelectric dams are by
definition a good thing. Led by Secretary of the Interior Bruce
Babbitt, it has pressed the contrarian notion that dams that are
doing more harm than good _ to fish stocks, to watersheds and to
the environment generally _ ought to come down. Several dams have
in fact been destroyed in the last few years. But these dams have
been relatively small, and the administration now faces a huge test
of its resolve _ whether to order the breaching of four large
hydroelectric dams on the lower Snake River in eastern Washington
state. The purpose would be to restore 140 miles of the river to
its natural free-flowing state and greatly increase the chances for
survival of the river's depleted salmon populations.
</P>
<P>
   These dams provide many benefits _ power, irrigation and
shipping _ and most regional politicians seem flabbergasted that
anyone would even think of breaching them. But if the
administration follows the path that most scientists have drawn for
it, and does an unprejudiced calculation of costs and benefits, it
will ask Congress to breach these dams. In doing so, it will have
partly atoned for a colossal ecological mistake and added greatly
to President Clinton's environmental legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the dams lies with two federal agencies that are
expected to issue reports in the next two months _ the National
Marine Fisheries Service and the Army Corps of Engineers. Both are
under orders from a federal judge, Malcolm Marsh, to devise
recovery plans for the salmon under the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   Dam-breaching is on the table because other efforts to save the
salmon have failed. The four Snake River dams came on line between
1962 and 1975. In the last 25 years, in a futile effort to assist
fish migration, the federal government has spent more than $3
billion on programs that include fish ladders, hatcheries and even
a complicated truck-and-barging system to get the young fish
downstream. Even so, salmon stocks, which averaged more than
100,000 adults in the 1960s, have fallen to little more than 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although some federal biologists argue that the barging programs
should be given more time, most scientists believe that breaching
the dams would be the most effective step toward restoring the wild
salmon runs. One team of federal, state and university scientists
gave the spring-summer chinook runs an 80 percent chance of
recovery if the dams were removed. No scientist can or will
guarantee complete success. But what seems clear is that the salmon
cannot be saved without breaching.
</P>
<P>
   With the science tilting against them, opponents have relied on
economic arguments. For example, Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., warns
that breaching would be ``an unmitigated disaster and an economic
nightmare for the region.'' But it will not. The $1 billion or so
needed to decommission the dams could be rapidly amortized by
saving the $200 million a year now spent running the dams and
barging the salmon around them. Indeed, that annual outlay could
rise dramatically if the dams are not breached, since the corps
would have to take other measures, all of them costly, to satisfy
Marsh.
</P>
<P>
   Losing the salmon could exact other costs as well. Near the end
of the 19th century, the United States signed treaties with various
Northwestern Indian tribes guaranteeing fishing privileges for all
time in ``usual and accustomed places.'' The Indians have been
wonderfully patient in not enforcing these rights over the years.
But if they did, and there were no salmon to be found, the legal
obligation, according to federal experts, could run into the
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Some people would suffer real if momentary pain. The dams supply
about 4 percent of the region's power, and monthly utility bills
could rise between $1 and $4 a month if breaching occurs. Even so,
Northwestern consumers would still pay among the lowest utility
rates in the country. Barge transportation, used mainly to move
wheat downstream, would be eliminated above the dam sites. But with
modest public investments, the railway that served the farmers
successfully until the dams were completed 25 years ago could be
revived.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest price would probably be paid by 13 farms covering
37,000 acres in western Washington, which would lose irrigation
water now pumped from a reservoir behind one of the four dams. Here
again, modest investments in new wells or pipes to pump water from
a lowered Snake River would soften the blow and keep all but the
most marginal farmers on their feet. The costs that Gorton regards
as unbearable are in fact manageable if the government is willing
to step in with targeted grants and loans, much as it did 10 years
ago when the decision to save the spotted owl sharply reduced
timber harvests.
</P>
<P>
   Is such a program worth it in this case? Oregon's governor, John
Kitzhaber, one of the few regional politicians to support
breaching, said it well: ``If our salmon runs are not healthy, then
our watersheds are not healthy. A highly degraded ecosystem _ which
is where we are headed today _ represents a decision to mortgage
the legacy with which we have been blessed for our own short-term
benefit. I believe we are better than that.''

   &UR; VERA: (Mrs. Vladimir Nabokov) &LR;  By Stacy Schiff. Modern Library,
$14.95. This biography of Nabokov's wife, protector and perfect
reader unravels their 52-year marriage without trying to explain
the enigma that the couple present. ``The triumph of `Vera' is not
just in providing entree to her famous husband,'' Lyndall Gordon
wrote in The New York Times Book Review last year. ``She fascinates
in her own right.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOR THE RELIEF OF UNBEARABLE URGES &LR;  By Nathan Englander.
Vintage International, $12. The author, a former yeshiva student
from New York who lives in secular Israel, explores the tension
between old and new worlds, tradition and modernity, in his first
collection of stories. Whether writing about Stalin's purge of
Yiddish writers or a Hasidic Jew whose sexual torment is so acute
that his rabbi gives him a special dispensation to visit a
prostitute, ``Englander combines a compassionate grasp of the
Orthodox Jewish world with the skeptical irreverence of one
estranged from yet still oddly defined by it,'' James E. Young
wrote last year. These ``taut, edgy and sharply observed'' tales
form ``a volume of polished gems.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LAST OF THE JUST &LR; , by Andre Schwarz-Bart (Overlook,
$15.95), is a French novel that chronicles the agonies of a Jewish
family from 12th-century England to Nazi Germany. It is ``part
history, part vision, forged into a single echoing, terrifying
outcry,'' Frederic Morton wrote in 1960. ``It is at once lush and
sardonic, full of dolor and fury and a heartbreaking richness.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; YOU'RE MISSIN' A GREAT GAME: From Casey to Ozzie, the Magic of
Baseball and How to Get It Back &LR;  By Whitey Herzog and Jonathan
Pitts. Berkley, $7.99. The former crowd-pleasing manager known as
the White Rat gives away plenty of trade secrets as he surveys his
half-century in major-league baseball. He also offers some frank
advice for rejuvenating the sport. ``What makes the book work is
that Herzog wants to talk about the things that people don't like
to talk about,'' Bill James wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FENWAY: A Biography in Words and Pictures &LR; , by Dan Shaughnessy
and Stan Grossfeld (Houghton Mifflin, $18.95), pays tribute to a
legendary ballpark that has been a house of pain for generations of
Beantowners. Shaughnessy's text is ``straightforward and
unsentimental'' and Grossfeld's photographs are ``sparkling and
upbeat, evoking not the park's gloomy history but its charming
eccentricities and ever-startling greenness,'' Charles McGrath
wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LOW AND INSIDE: A Book of Baseball Anecdotes, Oddities, and
Curiosities &LR; , by H. Allen Smith and Ira L. Smith (Breakaway Books,
$13), canvasses the national pastime between 1860 and the beginning
of World War I, and includes hundreds of tales of figures great and
small, including ancients like Rube Waddell and Germany Schaefer.
In 1949 the reviewer Tallulah Bankhead (a Giants fan) called this
``a fascinating and hilarious collection.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued the authors' follow-up
compilation,  &UR; THREE MEN ON THIRD &LR;  ($13), which covers the ensuing
years up to 1951 and features accounts of flying grapefruits, wacky
baserunning and a player who caught his own home run. The result is
``a cheery, informative book,'' Rex Lardner wrote in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUSIC FOR TORCHING &LR;  By A.M. Homes. HarperPerennial, $14. This
willfully depraved novel about a disaffected middle-class suburban
couple's walk on the wild side is a long way from Cheever country,
to put it mildly. ``I was at times appalled by the book, annoyed by
it, angered by it,'' Gary Krist wrote last year. ``But even so, I
found myself rapt from beginning to end, fascinated by Homes'
single-minded talent for provocation.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ARMADILLO &LR;  By William Boyd. Vintage International, $14. This
novel's hero is a London insurance adjuster of Gypsy descent whose
life is undone by an outbreak of zemblanity, the opposite of
serendipity, in the multicultural hubbub of Cool Britannia. The
book ``is full of loose ends, unsolved mysteries and red
herrings,'' A.O. Scott wrote in 1998. ``But it is also charming,
unsettling and sneakily, serendipitously profound.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SHOW ME A HERO &LR;  By Lisa Belkin. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $14.95.
A writer for The New York Times explores the polarizing conflict
that followed a 1988 judicial order to build 200 units of low-cost
subsidized housing in Yonkers, N.Y. ``We learn a lot, and we learn
it in impressive detail, about the intimate feelings and motives of
the people who got new housing and the people who tried to prevent
it,'' Nathan Glazer wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PICTURE THIS &LR;  By Joseph Heller. Scribner, $13. This fantasy
about a Rembrandt painting of Aristotle is basically a springboard
for the author's sarcastic musings on justice, money and the
stupidity of war. ``Heller treats the whole panorama of history
past and present with the bravado of Mark Twain in one of his
sassier moods,'' Robert M. Adams wrote in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MIDSUMMER NIGHT &LR;  By Uwe Timm. New Directions, $12.95. The
narrator of this German novel is a novelist who travels to
post-reunification Berlin to research an article on potatoes and
finds himself swept up by a city in restless flux. The result is
``a picaresque comedy that is also, unobtrusively and astutely, a
novel of ideas,'' Bill Christophersen wrote in 1998.

RUIZ WON'T FALL FOR SUCKER PUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The date keeps changing and the court rulings keep coming, but
one thing remains the same for Chelsea heavyweight contender John
Ruiz: His chance is coming.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz is scheduled to fight three-time heavyweight champion
Evander Holyfield July 3 at Caesars Palace. But emissaries from
undisputed champion Lennox Lewis want Ruiz to bypass that fight for
a promise to meet Lewis July 15 in London, assuming Lewis survives
the challenge of Michael Grant April 29.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz is unlikely to fall for that.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz and his handlers believe Holyfield is old and ready to be
beaten, which would give Ruiz more bargaining power as Lewis's
mandatory challenger in the WBC and WBA. Also, Ruiz used to be a
stablemate of Lewis's and distrusts his manager, Frank Maloney, and
promoter, Panos Eliades. They once left Ruiz in Atlantic City
without a room after inviting him to watch Lewis fight and Ruiz's
manager, Norman Stone, has never forgotten it. Ruiz remembers that
slight and many broken promises and does not believe Lewis would
fight him in July if he refuses the Holyfield fight.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a practical reason for Ruiz to take the $1
million-plus purse to face Holyfield now, and Grant's trainer, Don
Turner, understands the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Turner advised Grant against fighting Ruiz before he fought
Lewis, even though the conventional wisdom was Grant could have
scored two big paydays. ``There's no such thing as easy money in
the heavyweight division,'' Turner said. ``Big man hits you, down
you go. Take the biggest fight you got in front of you. For Johnny
Ruiz, that's Holyfield.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what happened to Grant in his last fight when Andrew
Golota dropped him twice before Grant stopped Golota late in the
fight. Grant has been training at Turner's North Carolina camp for
his return against Lewis. Turner insisted Grant looks so sharp,
Ruiz should not be concerned about a title shot with Lewis in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox Lewis may have a fight on July 15, but it'll be a
nontitle fight,'' Turner said. ``What Michael said in Ring Magazine
I agree with.''
</P>
<P>
   What the normally soft-spoken Grant said was Lewis would either
``quit or get knocked out'' April 29. If he's right, Lewis won't be
fighting July 15 against anybody, least of all Ruiz.
</P>

   HBO Sports senior vice president for programming Lou DiBella has
heard many reasons for fighters pulling out of bouts, but never one
like Mike Acri gave him when he pulled Razor Ruddock out of
Saturday night's fight with WBO heavyweight champion Vitaly
Klitschko in Berlin. ``Razor had an operation to reverse a
vasectomy a few weeks ago and he got hit low in sparring and the
guy was in agony,'' DiBella said. Ruddock was replaced by Chris
Byrd, a younger and more difficult opponent. ``(Ruddock) had a
bulge in his abdomen and nobody knew what it was,'' DiBella said.
``They were afraid he had cancer. So he got an MRI and it turned
out there was an infection from the (operation). Obviously, he
couldn't fight. As excuses go, it was one of the better ones I've
heard. It's so embarrassing to the poor guy, he couldn't be
lying.'' Promoters were scrambling for a replacement and came up
with the slick-boxing Byrd. When the fight was made, Klitschko's
promoters wanted an opponent like Ruddock, who still had a
reputation and appeared dangerous, although his looping hooks are
dangerous only if you walk into one. Byrd (30-1, 18 KOs) is every
heavyweight's nightmare, a giant Willie Pep, who moves constantly
and seldom gives an opponent an opening. There may have been a
tougher match for the predictable, hard-punching Klitschko, but the
show had to go on . . . Byrd was scheduled to fight former Olympic
team captain Lawrence Clay-Bey but Clay-Bey suffered a detached
retina and was replaced by former cruiserweight champion Alphonso
Washington. Byrd jumped at the opportunity for a bigger payday and
a shot at Klitschko, but promoter Dan Goossen refused to let Byrd
off the Fox television card against Washington without a $150,000
stepaside fee. Goossen said the money will reimburse the Las Vegas
hotel for losing the fight. Sure it will.

   The 45th anniversary of Tony DeMarco winning the undisputed
welterweight title from Johnny Saxton at Boston Garden was
celebrated Saturday night during a Rich Cappiello show at the Roxy.
A clip of the fight was shown and you can bet it was the best fight
of the night . . . Clay-Bey is contemplating retirement after his
latest setback with a detached retina, even though doctors said he
could begin fighting in three months. The Hartford heavyweight is
34 years old and 11-0, but it has taken three years to get in 11
fights because of injuries. Clay-Bey applied for his old job as a
correctional officer in Hartford. His promoters, America Presents,
told him he was facing his first big fight when this latest problem
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Rather fight than switch
</P>
<P>
   Roy Jones fights again May 13 on HBO vs. WBA No. 1 contender
Richard Hall. HBO tried to get Eric Harding, a far more credible
opponent, but Jones wanted an additional $500,000 above his $4
million fee to switch opponents, even though Harding has no more
chance of beating him than Hall does. Promoter Murad Muhammad tried
to get out of the Hall fight, claiming he was not worthy to be the
WBA's No. 1 contender. ``I can't figure out one guy he beat,'' said
one boxing promoter. ``The only guy I ever heard of is the guy he
lost to (Rocky Gannon).'' After the fight was announced last week
in Indianapolis, Muhammad changed his tune. ``Roy and I watched
Hall on tape and found out he has not been given the credit he
deserves,'' Muhammad said with a straight face. ``He's 6-3 1/2 and
a southpaw. He has 23 knockouts in 24 wins.'' So what? He lost to
Gannon, which damaged his credibility . . . Middleweight champion
Bernard Hopkins is on the Jones undercard. HBO signed Hopkins with
the intent of landing a match with Jones, but Jones has not
announced his next opponent. HBO still hopes to make that fight as
well as a match for Jones in Germany . . . Jones apparently is not
ready to follow the lead of Oscar De La Hoya, who refuses to pay
exorbitant sanctioning fees to Los Banditos, the organizations that
rate fighters. ``I have a lot of obligations with three, four, five
titles,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Around and around
</P>
<P>
   WBO light heavyweight champion Dariusz Michalczewski will face
Graciano Rocchigiani April 15 at Preussag Arena in Hannover,
Germany. Jones says he's going to fight Michalczewski, but hasn't
yet. If Michalczewski wins, Jones would be wise to challenge him.
The money would be big but the hype would be even bigger, and Jones
could use it . . . Promoter Bob Arum may be in hot water in Las
Vegas. He testified before a federal grand jury to paying $100,000
to have the IBF waive its rules (requiring a fighter be rated
before he can fight for a world title) to allow Axel Schulz to
fight George Foreman. Now a deputy attorney general from Nevada,
with Arum's admittance under limited immunity, might force the
state to revoke his promoter's license. Arum will fight the charges
and claims he did nothing illegal. Somewhere Don King is laughing .
. . Cedric Kushner continues to expand. In addition to a regular
heavyweight card in Manhattan, he added a seven-fight series at the
Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas . . . Concerns that young
Floyd Mayweather has poisoned his career are growing. He recently
broke with Arum and called a multimillion dollar contract with HBO
a ``slave contract.'' Mayweather drew fewer than 2,500 paying
customers to his last fight in Las Vegas vs. Goyo Vargas and was
booed when he entered the ring. In September, he reportedly drew
only 1,750 paid at Mandalay Bay. Despite being one of the world's
best young fighters, Mayweather's future seems in doubt. HBO, which
still has his rights, is concerned he may self-destruct . . . WBC
lightweight champion Stevie Johnson failed a drug test in England
after his victory over Billy Schwer last November. Johnson claims
the substance was in a cold medicine and the WBC has refused to
acknowledge the test results. The British Boxing Board of Control
wants Johnson to be stripped of his title. Fat chance of that.

MARCH MADNESS FOR NBA COACHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Who wants to coach a millionaire? It's not a game
show, you won't find Regis Philbin anywhere nearby, and there never
seems to be a winner.
</P>
<P>
   But there's just as much drama, as NBA coaches from coast-to-
coast lost control of their teams in a March Meltdown that shows
last year's 50-game season might have been better for the sanity of
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a look at some of the shenanigans that took place in
the past few days:
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee. Coach George Karl and his star, Glenn Robinson, got
into an altercation after a !ital!victory!off! over Boston.
Robinson was reportedly upset that he was taken out of a game, no
doubt adding fuel to the belief he is over-concerned about his
stats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dog and I are cool,'' Karl said. ``I took him out early in the
fourth quarter, when we had an eight-point lead. And by the time I
was going to put him back in it was 15 or 16. So maybe he was
(upset) because he didn't go back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle. First, Vernon Maxwell and Gary Payton get into an
altercation during practice, with Payton throwing a chair at
Maxwell, and Maxwell throwing a weight at Payton, which hit Horace
Grant and injured his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Chuck Person, already on the injured list, aggravated
his sore knee while trying to break up the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an argument,'' Payton said. ``That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics moved Maxwell's locker away from Payton's, and
although the pair took their teammates to dinner to eliminate
lingering dissension, coach Paul Westphal finally abandoned his Mr.
Nice Guy persona.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal threatened Maxwell and forward Vin Baker with major
changes if their effort doesn't improve. ``Right now, I'm
emphasizing that we stink,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, just as things were settling down, Payton's agent
said he wouldn't be surprised if the point guard were traded. Just
more wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto. After dropping five of six games, veterans Charles
Oakley and Antonio Davis voiced displeasure over the team's
offense, saying it focused too much on getting shots for phenoms
Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady.
</P>
<P>
   ``(When) the two younger guys get the ball in their hands, they
have to create for us and everybody else shots,'' Oakley said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Davis: ``I try to stay away from questioning the way this
is (run), but I just feel like at times a big majority or a big
percentage of our offense is being run through two guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Raptors coach Butch Carter responded by saying that he didn't
mind going to any player who was scoring, and ripping Davis for
missing three of his first four shots in a recent game. ``No good
coach is against some guy who's producing,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly the way Toronto wants to be heading into the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Utah. Karl Malone and Jerry Sloan got into their first public
argument ever, after Sloan had the temerity to remove Malone from a
game after he sprained his ankle against Philadelphia. The injury
appeared so serious that John Stockton committed an intentional
foul to stop the game, to give Malone a chance to get to the bench
for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he started yelling at Sloan for removing him. In
another first, Sloan went home right after the game and refused to
talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Clippers. Something happened between their coach and a player,
but we can't remember.` j

YOUTH HELD IN SLAYING AT DELI
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 15-year-old Staten Island boy was arrested Saturday
in the shooting death of a clerk at a neighborhood deli after he
and his mother returned to the store a few hours after the slaying
to retrieve his coat, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year-old, whose name was not released Saturday afternoon,
was arrested at the deli by investigators from the 120th precinct's
detective squad, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Andrew McGinnis, a New York Police Department spokesman,
said investigators believed that the clerk chased the youth from
the Second Eden Deli, at 281 South Avenue in the Arlington section,
around midnight. Witnesses told investigators the clerk had caught
him trying to steal snack foods, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he left the store, he dropped his coat and produced a gun
and fired,'' McGinnis said.
</P>
<P>
   The clerk, Sarif Saed, an 18-year-old immigrant from Yemen who
lived next door to the deli, was shot twice in the chest and was
pronounced dead at St. Vincent's Medical Center on Staten Island,
officials said. Two other store employees, Susaim Mused, 41, and
Shawn Heyes, 28, were grazed by bullets and declined medical
treatment, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As detectives searched for clues around the store, McGinnis
said, the youth returned, with his mother, to search for his coat,
which officials think he dropped during the incident. ``His mom did
not know he shot anybody,'' McGinnis added.
</P>
<P>
   The youth was taken into custody by detectives.
</P>
<P>
   The office of the Staten Island district attorney, William P.
Murphy, was reviewing the case to determine whether to bring murder
charges against the youth, officials added.

GLORY IS GONE, BUT NOT FORGOTTEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time has not dimmed the memory. It still ranks on the top shelf
of his closet-full of great moments. And if you want to call it the
greatest Masters ever, not many people will argue. Certainly not
Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   The image is as fresh as this morning's coffee, the greatest
golfer of our time doing a victory dance around the 16th green at
Augusta National, his putter thrust skyward, caddie Willie Peterson
punching the air with his fist. His most emotional display ever? No
doubt, but for good reason, says Nicklaus. ``How many times do you
hole a 40-foot putt that puts you in the lead on the 70th hole at
the Masters? Sure I was emotional. That was a great battle going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 1975 and Nicklaus's spot atop the golf world was
unquestioned. But there was no shortage of players willing to take
a run at him. Tom Weiskopf was big, strong, and fearless. Johnny
Miller had authored a closing 63 at the US Open two years earlier
and was winning weeks at a time. Tom Watson was on fame's doorstep.
Arnold Palmer perhaps couldn't compete week in and week out, but,
at 45, he still knew how to get around Augusta National.
</P>
<P>
   And with all the stars aligned, there they all were for four
glorious days in April 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1975 Masters is probably one of the most enjoyable golf
tournaments in which I ever played,'' says Nicklaus. ``Maybe the
most enjoyable. I would say that even if I hadn't won.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but how he won. Much to the despair of Weiskopf, his fellow
Ohio State Buckeye who readily concedes that he was never the same
after that heartache. And at the expense of Miller, who missed his
greatest chance to show the critics that he wasn't an early-season
flash who feasted on desert layouts.
</P>
<P>
   Weiskopf and Miller, bless their souls, had to walk that entire
final round in Bear Tracks, which is to say they followed in the
noise of the Nicklaus gallery. The Golden Bear, starting the day in
second place at 8-under 208, was paired with Watson, who was fourth
(212). Quirky as it may now seem, the last group was the leader
Weiskopf (207) and third-place Miller (211).
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus had stormed to the front that year, opening 68-67 for a
five-shot lead. ``But I've seen some five-shot leads lost and I've
blown some myself to lose tournaments,'' warned Nicklaus, who had
already captured four green jackets. What he got Saturday was his
worst nightmare _ a pairing with Palmer, who had opened 69-71.
</P>
<P>
   Great for golf fans, misery for the legends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said many times that we both got wrapped up in playing
against each other,'' said Nicklaus. ``That's why we sort of hated
to play with or against each other when we were in contention.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, that held true. Nicklaus shot 73 and relinquished the
lead to Weiskopf, who backed up a 69-72 start with a blistering 66.
And Palmer, who had led through 27 holes, dropped back with a 75
that would signal his exit from Augusta as a serious contender. He
was T-13 that year and would never again finish higher.
</P>
<P>
   But the news of that third day was the blond guy who had already
twice shot 61 that year and won three times. Miller, barely making
the cut at 75-71, was setting the place on fire as Nicklaus,
Weiskopf, Palmer, and Watson hit practice balls. Starting on the
par-5 second, Miller ran off six straight birdies. ``I said to
myself, `Boy, I'm going to shoot zero today,' '' Miller told
reporters after he posted a third-round 65 to get into the hunt. At
the time, it was one shot off the course record.
</P>
<P>
   As the sound reverberated through the pines of Augusta, Nicklaus
warmed up. Did he know what was going on, reporters asked? He may
be colorblind, Palmer told reporters, but ``Jack isn't deaf. He
knows what a birdie sounds like.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller turned in 30 to break Nicklaus's frontside mark of 31 and
surprisingly set his sights on something other than the
leaderboard. ``I was more interested in the course record,'' he
told reporters. ``I wanted to play a good round so you guys
wouldn't say I was a dog this week.''
</P>
<P>
   As impossible as it seems, the final day surpassed the previous
three.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus fell out of the gate, pushing his opening drive right
and making bogey. Miller, playing mind-boggling golf, toured the
front in 32. Weiskopf put up a 34. Nicklaus recovered splendidly
after the first and made his fourth birdie on the front at the
par-4 ninth hole to shoot 33, a stretch that included his second
shot into the difficult fifth that never lost sight of the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was three guys coming down the stretch in the last nine
holes,'' said Nicklaus, ``and it wasn't who made bogeys, but who
made the most birdies. And that is hard to do at Augusta.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus felt he let the tournament get away from him when he
hit his second shot to the par-5 13th fat and settled for par. Then
he three-putted the 14th. When Weiskopf, who had made a miraculous
bogey after hitting his approach into the water at 11, came through
and made birdie at 14, he went back into a one-shot lead.
</P>
<P>
   It remained one shot as first Nicklaus (a 1-iron second shot
from 240 yards setting up a two-putt from 15 feet) and then
Weiskopf birdied the par-5 15th.
</P>
<P>
   Which brought the drama to No. 16.
</P>
<P>
   It is a par 3 that has determined so many Masters titles and
this year was no different. Nicklaus fell in love with his tee
shot, but that quickly faded when he saw the ball hit the slope and
stay well short, settling in a spot that would require him to
negotiate two severe breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Two putts would have been a welcomed achievement, but Nicklaus
got more than he bargained for. His putt was pure, it took the
first break, then the second, and found the center of the hole.
When it fell, the stern-faced, always-focused Nicklaus let loose.
He knew exactly what had just happened to the two gentlemen
standing back on the 16th tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``That did them (Weiskopf and Miller) in,'' said Nicklaus.
``That happens. You can't regroup yourself after you have a mindset
of what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Weiskopf and Miller seen the putt? ``See it,'' Miller would
later say. ``I had to walk through the bear prints.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiskopf tried to draw his approach into the pin _ nestled, as
it always is on Sunday, tight left _ but the shot came up well
short. Three putts later, he now trailed by one.
</P>
<P>
   Miller pulled into a tie with Weiskopf for second when he
birdied the 17th, then both hit their approaches within 15 feet on
18. Nicklaus stood in the scorer's tent, having finished par-par
for a 68. ``I felt surely that one of the two would make it and we
would be here on Monday having a playoff,'' said Nicklaus. But he
was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   First Miller. He played for a 26-inch break, but it moved a few
inches more. He settled for a 66 and an incredible weekend that had
produced 15 birdies.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Weiskopf. His 9-iron approach had come to rest some 8 feet
from the pin. He watched Miller's putt break and couldn't believe
it when his didn't curl as much as he had anticipated. A runner-up
for the fourth time in this event, Weiskopf just stood and stared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say how I feel,'' said Weiskopf. ``How do you describe
pain?''
</P>
<P>
   That is left for individuals. As for great drama, you can
describe it as the 1975 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   A good match
</P>
<P>
   Laugh, if you will, but Karrie Webb vs. Tiger Woods is a more
intriguing head-to-head matchup than Sergio Garcia vs. Woods.
Perhaps he will turn things around, stop acting like a spoiled
brat, and quit trying to be the second coming of Woods, but for now
things are not going so well for Garcia. The swing is loose, the
expectations too high, and the schedule overwhelming. By August,
when he is scheduled to play Woods in that made-for-TV event,
Garcia's star could be totally burned out. Who knows? But what we
do know is that Webb is the real deal and since the beauty of golf
is that you can adjust the course to make things even, it is
conceivable that she could give Woods a good match. This would not
be Billie Jean King vs. an over-the-hill Bobby Riggs; it would pit
the two most dominant players in their respective sports, each in
their prime. Set the course up at 7,000 yards for Woods, 6,500 for
Webb and you'd have a fair, competitive battle . . . Dottie Pepper
was the best player in the field not named Webb at last week's
Nabisco Championship. Asked to compare Webb's 10-shot victory with
the way Amy Alcott was playing in 1991, Pepper was her usual candid
self. ``Actually I think it was closer to the way I played last
year, to be honest with you. I set the record by quite a few, I
think.'' You know, Pepper is one player who will gladly keep
challenging Webb on the golf course, something that tour
desperately needs . . . Aree Wongluekiet, the 13-year-old who
finished third in that Nabisco Championship, was penalized in the
final round after tournament officials viewed a replay of an
incident on the 14th green. As she settled into the address
position over her putt, Wongluekiet's ball moved ever so slightly.
She did not move it back to its original spot, which brought about
a two-shot penalty. ``She was matter of fact about it,'' said Barb
Trammell, the LPGA Tour's director of tournament operations, when
asked about Wongluekiet's reaction. ``She obviously would have
called for a ruling, but had no knowledge that the ball had
moved.'' . . . For Len Mattiace, there will always be questions
about the 17th hole at TPC Sawgrass where in 1998 he came unglued
and squandered his chance at victory in The Players Championship.
The class act he is, Mattiace answers them like a man. ``I am OK
with the hole. I did it. It happened, and I am OK with that,'' said
Mattiace at this year's tournament. Flash back to 1998: Holding a
lead and seemingly on his way to a final-round 65, Mattiace flew
the island green with a 9-iron, then hit his third shot into the
bunker. He skulled his fourth shot into the water, ended up making
a snowman, and opened the door for Justin Leonard's victory. The
fact that his mother, confined to a wheelchair and terminally ill
with cancer, was in the gallery made the story even more
heart-wrenching, but two years later Mattiace can face the
questions. ``I know I would have done things differently,'' he
said, ``and I would have hit different shots and all that. That is
put way back in the memory banks to draw on.'' . . . Darren Clarke
earned $1 million for winning the match play title against Woods,
but he noticed that the payout at The Players Championship was
more. $1,080,000 to be exact. ``The extra $80,000 could come in
handy,'' said Clarke . . . There are many players who think the
drop area at the island green 17th at TPC Sawgrass is a tougher
shot than the regular tee. Yet players don't practice shots from
there during pre-tournament rounds. Why? ``That is preparation for
a bad result. It is a defeatist attitude,'' said Hal Sutton . . .
Craig Stadler on his opening round of 83 at The Players
Championship. ``It was a thrill every minute. Actually it was very
enjoyable until we teed off.''

   For those of you who can't wait until Thursday to get into
Masters mode, take note that USA will televise a one-hour preview
Wednesday night at 10. ``The Course of History'' will be
interrupted by just four one-minute commercials, so the bulk of the
hour will be devoted to a look at this unique tournament.
Interviews with Jose Maria Olazabal, Nicklaus, Palmer, and Woods
will be featured and there will be a look back at Gene Sarazen, the
beloved Squire who passed away at age 97 a month after last year's
Masters. USA will have live coverage of the Masters Thursday and
Friday 4-6 p.m., before weekend action shifts to CBS . . . As a
lead-in to its Saturday and Sunday coverage, CBS will show ``The
Story of Golf,'' a documentary that was produced by two Boston men,
John Carver and Tom Martin. The film is a must for golf fans, rich
in history, broad in scope, captivating in its presentation.
Narrated by Jim McKay, the film earned an Emmy nomination for best
script for George Peper, editor of Golf Magazine. ``It's the best
project of my life,'' said Carver. ``As a former caddie, coming
this far with the film is a great experience.'' It will be shown in
two parts on CBS: 2-3:30 Saturday, 3-4 Sunday . . . The Golf Course
Superintendents Association of America has bestowed its most
treasured honor, The Old Tom Morris Award, upon Nancy Lopez for her
commitment to the game of golf . . . You know there is some young
talent out there when the reigning US Amateur champ, David Gossett,
is ranked 18th in the MasterCard Collegiate Golf Rankings. Gossett
is a sophomore at the University of Texas. Matt Kuchar, a senior at
Georgia Tech, is ranked No. 1. . . . There has been a site change
for one of the upcoming State Four-ball qualifying rounds.
Presidents GC in Quincy will replace Braintree Municipal . . .
Would you like to improve your golf game? Prepare yourself mentally
for the upcoming season? Understand the dynamics of the swing? Get
a better feel for how physical strength could help? Then a one-day
session April 8 at the Radisson Hotel on the corners of Stuart and
Kneeland Street may be of interest. Dr. Patricia Hopkins, president
of Joint Ventures, and Tom Cavicchi, head professional at Wollaston
GC in Milton, have put together a group of experts who will discuss
various topics that can give you a better understanding of physical
golf. Physioballs, astar system, flexibility analysis, swing motion
trainer, balance evaluation _ those are just some of the
discussions and demonstrations to be covered, and a free driving
range is available to help with swing analysis. The admission is
$55 per person, with $20 of that going to the Arthritis Foundation.
The hours will be 9 a.m.-3 p.m. (lunch will be 11-1), and for

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ For University of Connecticut coach Geno
Auriemma, the rivalry with Tennessee dates back to 1995, when his
team first played the Lady Vols in the regular season, and met the
following March in the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Kara Lawson and Sue Bird can look back to a much older rivalry,
one that dates back to when Connecticut's Bird was in the sixth
grade and Tennessee's Lawson was in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   It was an AAU ``under-12'' semifinal that pit Lawson's Vogues
team out of Washington, D.C., against Bird's Liberty Belles from
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Both opposing point guards remember it vividly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in Salt Lake City, and we won by 9 points,'' Lawson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Bird: ``We called (Lawson) `pigtail' and I don't know why
I remember this, but she had a great hook shot. She was probably
the best player on her team even though she was the shortest.''
(Both point guards are now 5 feet 9 inches, and are still friends,
as are their dads, who met at that AAU game.)
</P>
<P>
   The next year the teams met again, and that time Bird's team was
victorious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never did face either again in AAU, so I think head-to-head
right now we're 1-1,'' Lawson said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the players are 2-2 if you count their collegiate
games when the schools played this season. UConn (35-1) won the
first game down in Knoxville, Tenn., and a month later the Lady
Vols (33-3) beat the Huskies in Storrs, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   So Sunday night's NCAA final at the First Union Center is not
just the rubber game of the season, but of the two programs. The
schools are 5-5 against each other in games dating back to January,
1995. Three were in NCAA tournament play, and in eight of the
meetings, one of the two teams was ranked No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's every coach's dream to make sure you're playing in the
last game of the year,'' said Auriemma. ``So we're playing in the
last game against the last team that's left besides ourselves, and
you can't get any better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams have four players averaging double figures, so the
focus will be on Tennessee's Tamika Catchings (15.7) and
Connecticut's Shea Ralph (14.3).
</P>
<P>
   But the subplot is the battle of the point guards.
</P>
<P>
   Lawson is a freshman, and Bird a sophomore, but played only
eight games last year before she tore her left anterior cruciate
ligament and was out for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know most of the focus is on Shea and Svet (Abrosimova),''
said Bird. ``But that's both bad and good, because it takes the
pressure off.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lawson knows her team has to be wary of more than the stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't overlook Sue like we did in the first game, when she
scored (a game-high) 25 points, you have to disrupt her and can't
give her open shots,'' Lawson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawson's sporting days go back to when she played Pop Warner
football at 8 years old. She played running back and linebacker,
averaged three touchdowns a game, and was a guest on the ``Today''
show for their Athlete of the Week segment.
</P>
<P>
   But Lawson's father thought she'd hit a dead end with football,
so he talked her into giving it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought there wasn't much a future in it for me, so I just
kind of shopped around and started playing organized basketball in
third grade,'' Lawson said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to playing AAU ball and being a member of the USA
Women's World Team in 1998 that went to the Soviet Union, as a
senior Lawson received the Naismith Award as Player of the Year,
and set every record during her career at West Springfield High
School in Alexandria, Va. Meantime, Lawson started lifting weights
when she was a freshman, and can bench 235 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   So she was hardly a rookie when she arrived at the University of
Tennessee campus. She was asked to move to the wing instead of her
favored point guard spot, and had to defer to the older players
with NCAA playoff experience.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through the season, though, Tennessee coach Pat Summitt
decided to make some changes. The team had lost to Georgia, 78-51,
and Summitt gave the team a dressing down.
</P>
<P>
   Lawson moved over to the point guard spot, and the Lady Vols won
the next 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came back to the point, I was glad, because that's
where I feel most comfortable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Summitt said Saturday she did question if a freshman point guard
could lead the team to a national title, ``but I have a great deal
of confidence in her and I believe she can.''
</P>
<P>
   Summitt also assessed the Lawson-Bird matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're two of the best point guards in the country,''
she said. ``I think Sue has a little more experience, but Kara can
really ignite us offensively, like she did last night.'' Lawson
scored a team-high 19 points with three assists against Rutgers
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Auriemma also praised Lawson, albeit with qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not a freshman, I don't think,'' Auriemma said. ``I
think we should check her birth certificate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird, meanwhile, is hoping to settle the score on a rivalry that
dates back almost 10 years, with February's loss still fresh in her
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that propelled us,'' she said. ``Now it's a split, and
it's winner take all.''

BELICHICK, GROH UNDERSTAND RIVALRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Bill Belichick may not yet know what the
rivalry between his new employer and his old one has come to, but
he knows what it's not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the Army-Navy game,'' the Patriots' new head coach
said last week during a breakfast at the annual league meetings.
``I've learned there's a difference between Army-Navy and
Jets-Patriots. This league is built on winning championships; it's
not built on a one-game rivalry. It's 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Giants, beating the Redskins was beating a big rival,
but that's because they were a team we contended with to get to the
Super Bowl, not because they were a four-hour drive away or
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough perhaps, but as Pete Carroll learned the hard way
during his three years in New England, there is little in the NFL
at the moment to compare to the twice annual war between the Forces
of Evil (the Jets) and the Good Soldiers (the Patriots).
</P>
<P>
   It is a rivalry based not on common sense or common opponents,
but on a history of common hatred that dates back to the sale of
Babe Ruth to the Yankees and was fueled by the defections of Bill
Parcells to the Evil Empire two years ago and of Belichick back to
the Resistance Movement this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the next history of the NFL is written, there will be a
few chapters on what's gone on between the Jets and the Patriots,''
said Jets head coach Al Groh, the former defensive coordinator in
New England and longtime friend of both Parcells and Belichick.
``To say this rivalry doesn't exist or that there won't be those
elements of a rivalry involved when we play is to try and ignore
human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to understand human nature and deal with it is a
key requisite of coaching. The intuitive process in the world has
been all but eliminated. You don't need to figure out how to get
where you need to go anymore, you just call up maps.com. But a head
coach has to think about his team and the game they're going to be
playing to be at its highest level. So when it comes to the
Jets-Patriots, neither side wants to be facing the other at 0-3 in
the fourth game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having grown up in New York and subsequently lived in Boston,
I've seen the New York-Boston rivalry since the DiMaggio brothers
were playing center field. I understand this thing. Fans are
playing into that rivalry. Perhaps it will stay that way with the
fans longer than with the people inside our building, but it adds a
little juice to things. It's not like every third year you meet.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not make Jets-Patriots the Army-Navy game. In some
ways it makes it worse. Much worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see some of what's gone on between these two teams and it
explains why nations fight over a taxicab crossing the border,''
Groh joked. ``Internally you may try and say it doesn't exist, but
there will be a few million people out there to remind us.''
</P>
<P>
   They will remind Groh in New York and they will remind Belichick
in New England. They will remind them both that this is not the
Army-Navy game; it's bigger than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think too much about that,'' Belichick said. ``I can't
control it or whatever happens. It's an important game, but it's a
16-game season. For us to go 2-14 and beat the Jets twice doesn't
mean much.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but to go 14-2 and lose twice to the hated Jets means
you're going to hear about it.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting the heights
</P>
<P>
   Word is that because of the failures of their recent midget
cornerbacks, the 49ers have decided they will not draft a corner
shorter than 5 feet 10 inches despite the argument that three of
the league's top ones are 5-9 or shorter. Because of the recent
success of tall receivers like the Vikings' Randy Moss and the
Jets' Keyshawn Johnson, the day of the Darrell Green style
fast-but-tiny corners may be, at least temporarily, coming to an
end . . . Like everyone else, the NFL is moving into the Internet
age by trying to figure out how to maximize its income. Some teams
would like to control their Web sites and the income generated from
them, but Patriots owner Bob Kraft is among those who favor pooling
revenue the way the current television setup does. ``The right way
to go is aggregation,'' said Kraft. ``On the other hand, as teams
develop their own home pages some will generate considerable
revenue. In the short term, we could probably do better
(individually), but for a long-term situation, the NFL is such a
name brand, that's the way to go.'' Meanwhile, the owners have
decided to give individual clubs the right to develop their sites
for another year as long as they do not make any deals that would
prevent a league-wide deal later . . . The major reason talk of
creating a flexible schedule for December and January to ensure the
hottest teams the most national exposure died was both Fox and CBS
feared losing its best games to ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' . .
. Groh said despite his team's hot 7-2 finish, it would be unfair
to blame New York's early failures simply on the loss of
quarterback Vinny Testaverde in the first game of the season.
``Sure there were some mitigating circumstances, but they didn't
shoot everybody after Vinny got hurt,'' Groh said . . . Groh grew
up not far from the Jets' training facility in Hempstead, N.Y., and
sees his return in a unique way. ``I earned one of my first
paychecks three-quarters of a mile from where I'm getting my next
one,'' Groh said. He's earning it differently though. His first job
was as a bouncer at a place called Ryan's. Groh, offensive
coordinator Dan Henning, and Testaverde all grew up within 10 miles
of each other and the Jets' home. ``I don't think there's ever been
a situation like this,'' Groh said . . . Here's how Belichick
described the offensive or defensive coordinator's life: ``The week
really starts on Thursday (10 days prior to the game). That's when
you start breaking down the film for the future opponent. Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday you work on that team as well as key up for
the team you're playing on Sunday. Sometimes you walk out for
practice at 1 p.m. and you don't know if it's going to be 80
degrees or 20 degrees. The most important thing after lunch is to
ask somebody who has actually been outside, `What do we wear?' You
learn to gauge what they say liberally. It's important to ask a guy
who knows how you dress in the weather.'' . . . Someone asked
Belichick this week if he would sleep at Foxboro Stadium the way
Parcells allegedly used to at Giants Stadium. ``If he did, it
wasn't often,'' Belichick said, a smirk on his face . . .
Indianapolis president and general manager Bill Polian received the
Sporting News's NFL Executive of the Year Award for his rebuilding
of the Colts. It's the fifth time he has won the award in 12 years.
The last time he won it, he got fired the next year in Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Temptations loom
</P>
<P>
   Belichick had an interesting point of view on ``can't-miss''
draft-eligible college players. This year, four are considered in
that category: Florida State wide receiver Peter Warrick, Penn
State defensive end Courtney Brown, Penn State linebacker LaVar
Arrington, and Alabama tackle Chris Samuels. Without commenting
specifically on any of them, Belichick said the two biggest
variables in the success of any player are time and money, ``the
two things they don't have in college,'' according to Belichick.
``You can't predict how those two factors will affect them. You
can't predict that. You've got to try and project it.'' . . . Old
friend Charley Armey not only has a new Super Bowl champion's ring
but he also has been handed a new contract making him the general
manager of the St. Louis Rams. Armey now will have final say in all
personnel matters, while Jay Zygmunt will become club president and
handle contracts and salary cap issues. Armey said he will work
closely with new head coach Mike Martz on all personnel decisions.
``You've got to get the head coach the players he needs,'' Armey
said. ``It has to be the right fit for him. It can't just be who
you like. I try to take the emotion out of the personnel business
and put the personality of the coach in the forefront. The player
has to fit the coach.'' . . . Browns quarterback Tim Couch has
slapped on an additional 13 pounds this offseason and not all by
lifting weights and drinking MET-Rx. ``Chicken and fish instead of
the cheeseburgers and cookies I used to eat,'' Couch says of his
new diet . . . Couch would love to be dieting on a feast of Warrick
pass receptions, but Browns coach Chris Palmer says Brown may be
just as significant a draft pick. Palmer said Warrick was
originally his leading draft candidate, but he's now also looking
at Brown and Arrington, in part because of Cleveland's woeful
defense. If Cleveland should take Brown or Arrington, Washington
would likely take the remaining Nittany Lion and Samuels, allowing
Warrick to slip to Cincinnati at No. 4. One wise NFC personnel man
insisted that the Bengals would be the big winner in that scenario.
``There's only one impact player in this draft and it's Peter
Warrick,'' he said. ``He's so much better than those other two
guys, it isn't even close. A skill player has to be good in only
one play in 65 to make an impact on the game. Those other two will
be good players, but Warrick is the only one this year who can
change the game.'' . . . The Patriots are in for a treat when they
face the 49ers at the annual Hall of Fame game in Canton, Ohio. All
living members of the Hall have been invited for the league's NFL
Century celebration. Normally 10-, 20-, and 30-year anniversary
inductees are invited back, but this year all 138 living members
will be asked to come . . . Players' Association regional director
Clark Gaines, a Jets running back 20 years ago, was not impressed
by the way Parcells handled the Jets situation. ``Bill Parcells was
his own worst enemy last year,'' said Gaines. ``He showed why a
general manager can't also be the coach.'' Gaines then went into a
mythical conversation between Parcells the coach insisting he
needed a backup quarterback (read Rick Mirer) and Parcells the GM
saying they shouldn't waste the money. ``How can there be any
objectivity in that?'' asked Gaines. ``He made a decision (to bring
in Mirer) that came back to haunt him.'' . . . Gaines also ripped
the Buffalo Bills' claims that they had to let defensive end Bruce
Smith go for salary cap reasons. ``That's bull,'' said Gaines.
``They knew a year ago they were in trouble. (GM) John Butler
doesn't know that, he should lose his job. They didn't go to Bruce
Smith and ask him to renegotiate a year ago. They asked him to take
a paycut at the last minute knowing he wouldn't. They wanted to
retool their team. They decided to go in a different direction when
they got rid of Smith. Look what they did after that (cutting or
refusing to re-sign running back Thurman Thomas and wide receiver
Andre Reed). What did the cap have to do with them retooling their
team? If that's what they're doing, have the intestinal fortitude
to tell the player. Don't blame it on the cap.'' Butler did just
that however. ``When I had to let Bruce, Thurman, and Andre go, I
had to think about whether or not I wanted to stay in this
business,'' Butler insisted this week. ``It's not supposed to end
like that with Hall of Fame players who helped make your team so
great. It was a very difficult thing to do.'' . . . One thing that
made it easier was the presence of end Marcus Wiley, whom Butler
believes is ready to blossom into a superstar pass rusher.
</P>
<P>
   Playoffs, or else
</P>
<P>
   Al Davis isn't the only owner putting the heat on his coach to
get into the playoffs. Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga said this week
that not even the loss of Dan Marino should keep his team out of
the postseason. ``To me, we've got to make the playoffs,'' Huizenga
said. ``To me, worst case, we've got to get into the playoffs. If
we don't, we'd have to examine why.'' (Read new head coach Dave
Wannstedt gets fired)'' . . . The Dolphins may be carrying this
Marino farewell a bit too far. They intend to keep his locker under
glass as a salute to what he meant to the Dolphins . . . Broncos
owner Pat Bowlen knows well the impact of losing a future Hall of
Fame quarterback, having lived through it last year with John
Elway's retirement. What Bowlen knows is that the Dolphins don't
yet know how much they've lost. ``The only thing I can say at the
moment is they're underestimating the effect it will have,'' Bowlen
said. ``I never would have guessed the total impact (Elway's
retirement) would have on the Denver Broncos in every area, even
off the field, (like) leadership in the clubhouse. Players look to
Dan Marino the way they did Elway, as the leader. The loss of that
presence means more than anyone can imagine.'' . . . New Saints
coach Jim Haslett was less than pleased to read the comments of
running back Ricky Williams in a recent Sports Illustrated article,
but his wife helped him get a new perspective on it. ``My wife
pulled out an article with some things I said about Buffalo when I
was 22,'' Haslett laughed. ``I ripped the city and all that kind of
stuff. She said, `Now you go tell him he was wrong.' He's young. He
was built up to be the king. The media didn't want to talk to
anybody else, and he didn't handle it all too well. I just want to
see him come in and run with the football.'' Haslett went back and
reviewed tape of Williams's games at Texas and also spoke with the
university's sports information director about how to best handle
him. But the best news he got regarding Williams came from newly
acquired free agent quarterback Jeff Blake. ``Jeff and I talked
about Ricky last week,'' Haslett said. ``He said, `Don't worry
about him. I'll take care of it.' '' . . . Haslett did learn one
thing though after reading Williams's comments about how his new
coach did not seem concerned about him as a man when the first
thing he asked him was if he'd been working out. ``Coaches don't
say, `How you doing?' '' Haslett said. ``They say, `You been
working out?' Now when I see somebody, the first thing I say is,
`How you doing?' '' . . . Williams is scheduled to meet with the
New Orleans media soon to clarify his feelings. Haslett said the
interview would not be done with Williams's helmet on, as was
Williams's practice last season.

CORMIER'S RAGS TO RICHES STORY IS RHEAL DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was still a child herself when she began to indulge the
dreams of her own children. Jeannette Cormier, who grew up in a big
French-Canadian family, was 13 when she had her first baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father used to say,'' Rheal Cormier said, ``that my mother
could get pregnant from eye contact.''
</P>
<P>
   By 19, she was the mother of five, bagging lobsters in the
Paturel factory and tending to her family while her husband,
Ronald, was away for days at a time, hauling lobsters up and down
the Atlantic coast in his truck.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannette Cormier could never say no when her sons, Rheal and
Donald, came into the kitchen of their trailer home, asking to
borrow a cup of flour. In a place where summer was only a rumor, no
one in tiny St. Andre, or nearby Cap-pele, or perhaps in all of the
province of New Brunswick, loved to play baseball as much as her
little boys.
</P>
<P>
   So, if they needed some flour to draw their bases and foul lines
on the pavement outside, she would never say no. And she would look
the other way when the boys would practice their aim by throwing
rocks at the mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer?'' said Rheal Cormier, bronzed from a winter he spent
in his home on Florida's east coast, followed by six weeks in Fort
Myers preparing to pitch for the Red Sox. ``I know it's not long.
Maybe from the middle of June to the second week of August, I
think.''
</P>
<P>
   But in that coastal ocean village hard off the Northumberland
Straits, the weather mattered little to the Cormier boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to play baseball in the snowbanks, sometimes when it
was minus 10,'' Rheal Cormier said. ``I remember one man who used
to drive up and down our street, watching us play. We'd be playing
catch in the snow, and he'd yell at us, `What, are you guys crazy?
What are you thinking about?' ''
</P>
<P>
   There were maybe 250 people in all of St. Andre. Why didn't they
play hockey, like other Canadian boys?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were too poor,'' Cormier said. ``We couldn't afford to play
hockey. If my parents bought equipment for one of us, they would
have had to buy equipment for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Cormier is poor no more. As the only lefthander in the Red Sox
bullpen, he is due to make a salary of $2 million this season.
Jeannette Cormier, living in the house built for her by her son,
doesn't have to bag lobsters anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Cormier, who is 64, could have retired, too, like his son
has urged him, but he's now hauling logs part-time, because work is
what he does.
</P>
<P>
   There are some back in Cap-pele who begrudge Cormier his
success. You have money now, they tell him, but you'll always be
from Pee-Pee street, the derisive name those more fortunate had for
tiny St. Andre.
</P>
<P>
   And you know something? Cormier, who is as modest and humble and
self-effacing as anyone in the Sox clubhouse, tells them they're
right. He wouldn't want it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel bad about the area I lived in,'' he said. ``I
cherish every moment we had.''
</P>
<P>
   All of his brothers and sister still live there. It is only a
matter of time, Cormier said, that he moves back. His wife,
Lucienne, is a native, too. She was 14 when they met in high school
in Shedioc. She went to Paris and studied at the Sorbonne, then
came back and married her ballplaying beau. They've been together
eight years now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get really emotional when I talk in town,'' Cormier said.
``In church, they brought me up front once and I started crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have done so much for me. When I'm done, I'd like to do
something for them.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an improbable tale, this story of the kid who first saw
Fenway Park when his dad brought him along on one of his lobster
hauls to Boston and made it to the big leagues via a detour through
Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Art Pontarelli now scouts for the Colorado Rockies, but he was a
coach at the Community College of Rhode Island when he first
started running a clinic in Moncton, the capital city of New
Brunswick. That's where he first encountered an undersized lefty
who was self-conscious about being one of the few French-speaking
players on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think they wanted me there,'' Cormier said.
</P>
<P>
   Pontarelli wanted him, though. He coached Moncton's team in a
national tournament of teenage players _ Matt Stairs, Oakland's
bashing designated hitter, was on that team _ and Cormier helped
pitch the team to the championship. Pontarelli brought both Donald
and Rheal to play for him in Rhode Island. They lived with him that
first year. When Rheal told him he couldn't afford to come back a
second year, Pontarelli helped him land a scholarship at the
University of New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left after a week,'' Pontarelli says now with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Cormier, who didn't like the coach's approach in New Haven, went
back to St. Andre and chopped wood for several months until he had
scraped enough money together to go back to CCRI. With Donald
Cormier playing second base, CCRI went to the Junior College World
Series for the first time in school history and finished third.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Rheal Cormier was a member of the Canadian Olympic
team. More significantly, he was drafted by the St. Louis
Cardinals, who made him their sixth pick in the 1988 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Within three years, Cormier was in the big leagues with the
Cardinals, and in 1992 he was in the St. Louis rotation, going
10-10 with a 3.68 ERA. He first came to the Red Sox in 1995 with
outfielder Mark Whiten in the Scott Cooper trade, and helped the
Sox win a division title.
</P>
<P>
   But that winter, Dan Duquette traded him to Montreal as part of
the package that brought Wilfredo Cordero to the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Cormier hurt his elbow and underwent
reconstructive surgery that essentially sidelined him for two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette brought him back as a free agent a year ago last
January. Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan thought he'd have to begin the
season in Pawtucket, but Cormier surprised everyone by making the
team out of camp and was one of the team's most reliable performers
last season, appearing in a career-high 60 games, going 2-0 with a
3.69 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like this is a second life for me,'' Cormier said of
his recovery from elbow surgery. ``I never thought I'd come back to
where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   And one day, as surely as Jeannette Cormier still has a sack of
flour, he will be back in St. Andre.

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending March 25 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other

BRUINS SETTLE FOR TIE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's officially and mercifully over.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's 2-2 tie with the New York Rangers assures that the
Bruins' and Rangers' seasons will end next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   By coughing up a 2-1 lead with 1:20 left in regulation and
settling for a tie, the Bruins cannot catch Montreal for the eighth
playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   It marks the first time in Pat Burns's 11-year NHL coaching
career that he will not reach the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's contest featured two teams near the bottom of the
Eastern Conference. The black clouds covering these clubs are so
huge, it's surprising anyone could see the ice.
</P>
<P>
   When the regular season ends, the Rangers will be retooled and
the Bruins reevaluated.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers already have fired their coach, John Muckler, and
general manager Neil Smith. They paid for their players'
underachievement and a bloated payroll that brought no bang for
their 61 million bucks.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rangers were auditioning for jobs in other places, the
young Bruins were auditioning for future jobs here.
</P>
<P>
   For example, defenseman Nick Boynton, last year's first-round
pick, made his NHL debut after being recalled from Providence.
Another milestone came in the form of forward Jay Henderson's first
NHL goal.
</P>
<P>
   Boston took a 1-0 lead at 16:06 of the first period. Mikko
Eloranta gunned the puck into the New York zone and it caromed off
the end boards and in front of the net to Kirk McLean's right.
Henderson gathered the puck and banked a shot off the netminder and
in.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers pulled even on the power play at 9:06 of the second.
With Kyle McLaren in the penalty box for cross-checking, New York
defenseman Brian Leetch dished a pass across from the right point
to Theo Fleury. Fleury's one-timer hit John Grahame in the glove
and the puck dropped to the ice. Adam Graves, who was battling Don
Sweeney in front, backhanded the rebound home.
</P>
<P>
   Antti Laaksonen, who was recalled with Boynton Saturday morning
for his fourth stint of the season with the big club, gave the
Bruins the lead again at 12:55. Andre Savage centered a pass to
Laaksonen, who was skating down the slot, and Laaksonen rapped it
past McLean for his third goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' fortunes took a nosedive in the third period, an
occurrence that has been as regular this season as the sun rising
in the morning. Through the first 13 minutes 15 seconds of the
nailbiting third, the Rangers were desperately trying to climb back
in and had outshot Boston, 10-1. Grahame weathered the storm but
the Rangers kept coming and tied it with 1:20 remaining in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Mike York, who 14 seconds earlier was stopped by Grahame on a
point-blank chance, did the damage with his 26th goal of the year,
sending it to overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good effort,'' said Burns.

PLUCK EARNS HENDERSON THIS PUCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Years from now, the puck will be proudly displayed over the
fireplace. And Bruins left wing Jay Henderson will have fun telling
his family about how he got his first goal in the National Hockey
League.
</P>
<P>
   It put the Bruins in front Saturday, 1-0, 16:06 into the first
period against the New York Rangers at the FleetCenter, in a game
that ended in a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, called up three games ago from the American Hockey
League's Providence Bruins, his sixth elevation from the Bruins'
top farm team, also picked up an assist, his third, 12:55 into the
second.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-11-inch, 188-pounder had 12 shifts (lasting 10:09)
and took two shots, one each in the first and second periods. But
it was his goal that had everyone's interest.
</P>
<P>
   Mikko Eloranta was skating over the blue line and took a shot,
missing to the left, and the puck bounced to Henderson just behind
the net. He flipped it in front, and it went off Kirk McLean and
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a lucky goal,'' he said. ``Mikko made a great
play, he missed the net, and it was a lucky bounce off the end
boards. I was hoping it would come up more than it did, and I
decided to throw it back up front to the guys going to the net. It
made a nice little bounce off the goalie. It wasn't the prettiest
goal I'll ever score, but I'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson notched an assist on the goal by Antti Laaksonen, a
one-timer from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   As they have all season long, however, the Bruins allowed a late
goal, with 1:20 left in regulation, when Mike York tied it. It was
the 26th time the Bruins have gone to overtime this season, with
Saturday their 19th tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think there was anything wrong,'' said Henderson of
the events leading up to the late New York goal. ``I thought we
played very well defensively. Unfortunately, they scored in the
last two minutes. I guess (things like that) have been going down
all season and it's tough they scored in the last two minutes. I
thought we played well and we deserved a better outcome than we
got.''
</P>
<P>
   It's happened too often, and the Bruins have only one win in
overtime against six losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do have to learn to play in the last two minutes,'' said
Henderson. ``You've got to keep the puck in their end if you can.
The puck bounced out and they got a nice goal out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we played, we didn't give them much. They're a veteran
club and they scored a late goal and I'm sure that's not what were
looking for but for us, I thought we played a hell of a game. Any
time you allow a goal in the last two minutes of any period,
especially at the end of the game, it's frustrating. We deserved a
better outcome than we got.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said he was relaxed, partly because there are so many
Providence players with Boston (eight in all).
</P>
<P>
   ``(It was) nice and comfortable. We know all the guys,''
Henderson said. ``It's a little different than the end of the year
when you're not familiar with the faces here.''

KWAN BACK ON CUTTING EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICE, France _ She had heard the whispers for months. That she
was washed up at 19, that she was crazy even to think of mixing
skating and classes at UCLA. But Saturday night, before a crowd of
more than 9,000 at the Palais des Expositions, Michelle Kwan
silenced her critics by climbing out of third place and snatching
back the world crown she lost to Maria Butyrskaya last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people said, `She's over, she's deteriorating,' ''
said Kwan after she won her third title in five years. ``It felt so
great to skate well.''
</P>
<P>
   No woman ever had regained her title twice, and no one since
China's Chen Lu in 1995 had come from third to win. Kwan did it
despite skating first in the final group, beating two Russians with
no English-speaking judges on the panel and four from former
socialist countries. And she did it by pushing herself to the limit
and daring Butyrskaya and Irina Slutskaya to match her.
</P>
<P>
   When the 27-year-old Butyrskaya went wooden-legged in the
spotlight and Slutskaya failed to land either of her two
triple-triple jump combinations, Kwan was back on top of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first performance where I went on the ice and
pushed and pushed and pushed through the four minutes,'' said Kwan,
the first woman since Katarina Witt (in 1987) to win three titles
and the first American since Peggy Fleming in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, regaining her title was a tall order. Before the
International Skating Union added a qualifying round, any skater in
the top three could claim the title by winning the long program.
But once Kwan finished second to Slutskaya in her Wednesday
qualifying group and third in Friday's short program, she not only
needed to win Saturday night, she needed Butyrskaya to finish
third.
</P>
<P>
   Butyrskaya, who hasn't won a major event all year, was capable
of imploding and Kwan's camp knew it. ``Maria is a beautiful
skater,'' coach Frank Carroll said. ``But sometimes, she chokes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, her rivals weren't the issue. Kwan was. She hadn't skated
a clean short and long program in a major event since the 1998
Olympics in Nagano and hadn't done it at the world championships
since she beat Chen for her first title in 1996 in Edmonton,
Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old Slutskaya had beaten Kwan at this year's Grand
Prix final by landing two triple-triple combos. And Kwan had to
crawl out of third place to outpoint high-schoolers Sasha Cohen and
Sarah Hughes to retain her US title after falling in the short
program.
</P>
<P>
   If Kwan wasn't up to the mark here, she knew she could miss the
world podium for the first time in five years. So she abandoned
classes after Nationals, went to the rink, and worked herself back
into global form, focusing on the triple-triple she knew she'd need
to win here. ``I'd been saying that I needed to up the ante, but to
say it is easier than to do it,'' Kwan said. ``I have to do what I
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan had been skating brilliantly at her new practice rink in El
Segundo, within buzzing distance of the LA airport. All she had to
do was duplicate it here. ``Let it go,'' Carroll urged his pupil.
</P>
<P>
   She landed a perfect triple loop, hit the triple lutz-double toe
that has bugged her in the past, then nailed the triple toe-triple
toe that she'd once backed off. ``Every time I went into a jump and
thought, `Oh geez,' I went forward instead of holding back.'' Kwan
said. ``I didn't want to have anything left at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went through the triple salchow, triple flip, triple lutz,
seven triples in all. Kwan absorbed the standing ovation, skated
off in triumph, then went to the kiss-and-cry area and watched the
judges pointedly leave room for the Russians. ``I was feeling great
until the marks went up,'' she said. ``Then it was ugh-ugh-ugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Once she saw the 5.6s and 5.7s instead of 5.8s and 5.9s, Kwan
was resigned to finishing third or worse. There were still five
skaters left, including Butyrskaya, Slutskaya, homegirl Vanessa
Gusmeroli (the 1997 bronze medalist), and the 14-year-old Hughes,
who ended up fifth despite being woefully undermarked. ``I didn't
watch,'' Kwan said. ``I was trying to keep my mind off the skating.
It was a long 30 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   When she heard the marks, though, Kwan could guess at what
happened. Butyrskaya, who didn't even try a combination,
double-footed one salchow and popped another and landed only five
triples. And Slutskaya triple-doubled twice when two triple-triples
would have given her the title after she missed the Russian team
entirely last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy I'm second but I'm angry at myself that I'm not
first,'' said Slutskaya, who was second behind Kwan in 1998 at
Minneapolis. ``But I came back and I'm happy about that and I don't
finish last.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan has as much silver as she needs, finishing second in 1997
and 1999. This year, she wanted the top step again. ``I think I
cried 5,000 times today,'' said Kwan, after listening to ``The
Star-Spangled Banner'' with her hand over her heart and a tear
trickling down her cheek. ``It's more satisfying this time. This
may never happen again. This moment, you have to cherish it.''

WOMEN NOT AFRAID TO FACE CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Most of Saturday afternoon was spent on lofty
comparisons. The country's two best women's basketball programs
were 36 hours away from meeting _ for the third time this season _
and people wanted historical perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Would this UConn-Tennessee national championship game be
equivalent to the one in which Larry Bird and Magic Johnson
participated in 1979? Would it be Ali-Frazier? AOL-Microsoft?
Cain-Abel? Will a good performance Sunday night help sear the
women's game into the national consciousness?
</P>
<P>
   As you can see, when it comes to women's basketball, the
questions seem to go from left to right. As in: How can women do
what men already have done? Based on what we know about the Huskies
and Volunteers, the flow of that question needs to be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Right to left: How can men do what these women already have
done?
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies and Volunteers have shown everyone how to take fear
out of sports. They play in different conferences and are not
required to play one another during the season. But they did it
twice this season _ one win apiece _ and will meet at the First
Union Center Sunday night to play, as classic Southerner Pat
Summitt, the Tennessee coach, says, ``the sugar game.''
</P>
<P>
   This is revolutionary in college basketball and football.
Athletic directors, coaches, and athletes talk about ``meeting
challenges'' and ``overcoming adversity'' so much that it has
become numbing. So numbing that we often miss the obvious: It is
rare when they actually fulfill their words and embrace the most
difficult challenge.
</P>
<P>
   No team in the men's Final Four would ever schedule a
championship-level team twice if it didn't have to. The best
Division 1 football teams wouldn't do it, either. There obviously
isn't an equal amount of cash in the women's game as there is in
the men's, but Geno Auriemma and Summitt still didn't have a lot to
gain by scheduling each other during the season. Both have a
significant fan base, television exposure, and recruits who dream
of playing for them. Both have national titles.
</P>
<P>
   So why do it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I crazy? Is that what you're saying?'' Summitt said with a
laugh Saturday. She said she spoke with Auriemma and that they both
had reservations about the home-and-home series. Imagine the
psychological advantage one of them could have had if it had come
into this game 2-0 against the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we did it,'' Auriemma said. ``But it surely wasn't
like, `Wouldn't it be great if we play three times a year?' Because
after a while, that will get old, too. The rest of the country will
go, `We hate both of you guys.' Now half the country likes us, the
other half likes Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   Me? I like both of them. I like it when programs don't find
excuses to avoid each other. I think their ``dream'' matchup is
even more intriguing because they already have played twice and it
isn't clear which team is better.
</P>
<P>
   The fearlessness of both teams is not the only thing the men can
copy. Even though I often become nauseated by the annoying NCAA,
the organization is correct to call these women student-athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee boasts a 100 percent graduation rate. The Volunteers
also have a brilliant freshman point guard named Kara Lawson. Her
brilliance goes beyond her 235-pound bench press. She was reading
at a fourth-grade level when she entered kindergarten. She says she
has a philosophy paper due on Monday. (Talk about accepting
difficult challenges. Lawson's topic _ same-sex marriages _ cannot
be classified as an easy one.)
</P>
<P>
   UConn has its brainiac-in-residence, too. Auriemma says
sophomore forward Asjha Jones is his smartest player, on the court
and off. ``She's got a great mind,'' Auriemma said. ``You know,
she's just very bright.'' Jones is much quicker than some of the
people who ask her questions. So when she gets a particularly tired
one, she is likely to give a Now-think-about-what-you-just-asked-me
stare.
</P>
<P>
   As for the game itself, I won't be surprised if both teams
approach 100 points in regulation. The Huskies have Big East Player
of the Year Svetlana Abrosimova, a 6-foot-2-inch forward who
probably has more all-around skills than anyone on the floor. The
Vols have Player of the Year Tamika Catchings, who dominated in a
Friday night win over Rutgers, even if she scored only 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   Most followers of the game realize that most of the old left to
right questions are irrelevant. These women are playing basketball
and it's not a polite version of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee center Michelle Snow said she would compete against
her mother if Mom was standing between her and the national title.
She also said that she didn't appreciate the comments Auriemma and
Shea Ralph made about the Vols during one of Auriemma's coach's
shows. Snow said the team taped the ``disrespectful'' remarks and
may watch and listen before Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they need to use that as motivation, that's their choice,''
Auriemma said. Later, in so many words, he said the Vols need to
get a life.
</P>
<P>
   These teams respect each other, mostly because they have to.
They were 1-2 in 1990s winning percentage. They are 1-2 in the
national polls. They are 1-2 in recruiting. (Who is No.1? Depends
on whom you're rooting for.)
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee has a dig at UConn in its media guide called ``Tale of
the Tape.'' It compares national titles (6-1) and Olympians (10-1).
Auriemma dug at Tennessee's ``P.R. machine'' when it comes to
attendance and adding sarcastically, `` &UR; '' &LR; Tennessee is obsessed in
being No. 1 in everything they do.''
</P>
<P>
   If you left these two alone, they probably could produce a new,
highly rated provocative talk show. They clearly don't like each
other. Fine with me. At least they aren't afraid to face each other
on the court.

WALLACES WIN AS A FAMILY

<TEXT>
<P>
   What a weekend it was for the Wallaces.
</P>
<P>
   They were all winners, in their own right.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Kenny Wallace, 36, the youngest of the three
brothers, earned a spot in the front row, joining pole-sitter Steve
Park, for the start of the Food City 500 NASCAR Winston Cup race at
Bristol, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Then last Sunday, Mike Wallace, 41, the second-oldest, won his
second NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series race of the season from the
pole position at Bakersfield, Calif. It was the same day Kenny
started up front and recorded a Top 20 finish _ his best of the
season _ and oldest brother Rusty, 43, won at Bristol, marking the
50th Winston Cup triumph of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an absolute pleasure to have us win on the same day,
along with Kenny starting in the front row for the Bristol race,''
said Mike, whose victory in the Dodge California Truck Stop 250 at
Mesa Marin Raceway helped him match his two-win total of a year ago
and top the $1 million mark in NCTS earnings. ``Rusty and I spoke
(Tuesday) a little bit and congratulated each other. He's getting
ready to go to Texas, and I have testing planned.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Craftsman Truck Series has an open date this weekend,
the Winston Cup Series will be making its Texas whistlestop for the
Primestar 500 at Texas Motor Speedway near Fort Worth, where, no
doubt, the Wallaces will be riding a tidal wave of momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great weekend for us (at Bristol),'' said Kenny
Wallace, driver of the No. 55 Square D Chevrolet Monte Carlo owned
by Andy Petree. ``It was our best showing of the season, and it
puts us back on track. I'm happy with our top-20 finish and we hope
to continue to qualify well for each race.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Rusty? His 50th career victory couldn't have been any
more momentous. After all, it came on the same track, the .533-mile
bull ring at Bristol Motor Speedway, where Wallace recorded seven
previous victories, including the first of his Winston Cup career
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``It meant so much to me,'' said Rusty, driver of the No. 2
Miller Lite Ford Taurus. ``I've been trying for so long to get that
No. 50, and I got it at my favorite racetrack. I love all these
racetracks, but Bristol has been my home.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wallace said he had his doubts about whether he'd ever get
No. 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to be almost where it was a jinx,'' Rusty said. ``We
kept talking about No. 50 and the wins just wouldn't come. Some
weird things would happen. Like Daytona, we had such a great run in
the Daytona 500 and I really thought if we could have got out of
the pits we could have won that race, because track position was
the most important thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let that slide and we got to Rockingham and a new track
record (for qualifying),'' he continued. ``We had a great race car
there and then the lugnuts came loose and we lost a lap having to
pit under green and I let that one slide.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace was not about to let that happen at Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the radio and I said, `Don't let this one get screwed
up,' '' he said. ``I said, `I want it. This is an important race
for me.' (Crew chief) Robin (Pemberton) was really up on the pipe.
He was on the gas making sure everbody was doing their job right.''
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, Wallace tied Ned Jarrett and Junior Johnson on
NASCAR's all-time win list. Wallace said he chatted with both
NASCAR legends during a roast last Friday night for the retiring
Darrell Waltrip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kept having flashbacks to the early '80s, when I won
all those races and we had all the fun and everything was a little
bit more fun back in those days,'' Wallace recalled. ``But then
when I hit 47 and 48 wins and then 49, I started thinking, `Man,
I'd really like to have that 50th. That would be a special deal.'
''
</P>
<P>
   That it came at Bristol _ where his baby brother Kenny started
on the front row _ on the same day his younger brother Mike won his
truck race at Bakersfield, certainly made it all the more special.
</P>
<P>
   Road to recovery
</P>
<P>
   Almost two months removed from the horrific truck crash he
survived at Daytona, Geoff Bodine will make his first track
appearance at Sunday's race at Texas Motor Speedway. Bodine, who
suffered a concussion, a cracked vertebra, fractures to his right
wrist and elbow, and facial lacerations, hopes it will be the first
step toward a comeback aimed at the NAPA Auto Parts 500 at
California Speedway in Fontana. ``I'm feeling really great,''
Bodine said Tuesday during the NASCAR Winston Cup media
teleconference. ``I'm getting ready to go work out. I've been doing
that a week and a half now. I feel a lot better than I've felt in
the last few weeks. It's amazing how my recovery has gone.''
Initially, Bodine said he was in a constant state of grogginess
from all the pain medication, ``But I've been getting out more the
last two weeks, and this last week I've started feeling very good.
People say I look good and sound good, and I'm looking forward to
seeing everybody this weekend at Texas. We're anxious to see
everyone and get back to the track.'' Asked about his violent
crash, in which his truck was totaled, nine fans in the grandstands
were injured by flying debris, and a 120-foot section of catchfence
along the frontstretch was ripped apart, Bodine said, ``When that
wreck started, I thought it was going to be a normal little wreck
into the wall, no big event. When I hit the wall, it knocked me
unconscious. Right up until that point, I still thought it was
going to be a normal-type thing. I didn't think I was going to get
hurt or come so close to death like I did. I didn't think it was
going to be so traumatic.'' . . . Officials at Texas Motor Speedway
averted disaster when the track and, more important, fans camped
out for Sunday's race were spared injury and damage Tuesday when
tornadoes ripped through the Fort Worth area. ``We were very lucky
that the storms missed us,'' said TMS general manager Eddie
Gossage. ``The speedway sustained absolutely no damage and our fans
in the campgrounds, as well as employees, are fine.'' Gossage
indicated when track officials first learned of severe weather
moving through the area, security personnel were dispatched to
patrol the campgrounds and warn fans to seek cover. ``We were
concerned for the safety of our fans,'' he said. ``We had rain, but
the most severe weather was 20 miles or so to the south and east of
us. Getting to our fans as a precaution was a priority. We are
always cognizant of the potential for severe weather here in North
Texas and will always work to try and make our fans as safe as
possible.'' . . . A calamity of another sort befell former Winston
Cup driver Ernie Irvan when his Mooresville, N.C., home was
destroyed by a fire last Saturday. The fire, which is under
investigation, erupted while Irvan and his wife, Kim, and their two
children were returning from a family vacation in the Bahamas. ``I
feel real lucky that we were not in the house at the time,'' said
Irvan, who lost the entire contents of his home, including a trophy
room that contained all his racing memorabilia. ``I think it will
take a bit of time before we really can react to what has happened
to our home. It is really hard to lose everything. However, we will
continue to move forward with our life.'' . . . Dale Earnhardt
spent Thursday patrolling Interstate 65 near Birmingham with
Alabama state troopers, stopping unsuspecting but law-abiding
motorists and giving them tickets to the April 16 DieHard 500 at
Talladega as part of a race promotion and safe driving campaign.
Although Alabama state troopers ride in Ford cars, Earnhardt agreed
to do the promotion only if he could do so in a Chevrolet, noting
his allegiance to the GM auto maker as driver of the No. 3
Goodwrench Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``I don't think it would have
been politically correct for me to ride in a Ford,'' he joked.

ATHLETES LEFT OUT IN THE COLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICE, FRANCE _ Even though everybody agrees that Russian skater
Elena Berezhnaya should have read the label before taking the
bronchitis medicine that cost her a chance at a third straight
world pairs title last week, it's time that sporting federations
drew a distinction between ``Sudafed positives'' and stimulants
designed to improve performance.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, winter athletes get congested all the time. Yet most of
the drugs that make them feel better (and which anyone can buy at
the local pharmacy) containe ephedrine. Not massive amounts. Small
amounts. ``We never thought the medicine would improve their
artistry, or the skill of their jumps or the height of their
throws,'' said Tamara Moskvina, who coaches Berezhnaya and partner
Anton Sikharulidze.
</P>
<P>
   Caffeine is taboo, too, but only in massive amounts. A few cups
of coffee or a 2-liter bottle of Coke won't get an athlete banned.
Neither should a normal dose of cold medication. Meanwhile, the
federations are losing the big war against steroids, testosterone,
EPO and human growth hormones _ the stuff that makes the difference
between a gold medal and fourth place.
</P>
<P>
   Save the formalities
</P>
<P>
   Look for the International Skating Union to make the top 20
skaters exempt from the hated qualifying round at next year's world
championships _ as long as they compete in their continental
championships. Another proposal, less likely, is to allow skaters
to start from scratch once they've qualified. ``If it's just to
qualify, I'd land my first two jumps and walk through the rest,''
muses US champion Michael Weiss. Though the quallies count for only
20 percent, they matter significantly in the final tally. When
Michelle Kwan finished second in hers here and third in the short
program, she all but put herself out of contention for the gold
medal . . . No chance for Tara Lipinski to defend her Olympic crown
in Salt Lake City, even if she asks to have her eligibility
restored. No pros allowed, says ISU president Ottavio Cinquanta.
``Never, ever,'' he vows. ``They leave the ISU and decide to skate
outside. No possibility. One hundred percent excluded.'' . . . If
figure skating is a sport, not an art, why is the artistic mark the
tiebreaker in the long program? ``If we both lift 60 kilograms and
you do it smiling, you are better than me,'' Cinquanta reasons.
``That is why the artistic mark is more important.'' . . .
Three-time men's skating champion Alexei Yagudin on the post-Worlds
letdown: ``In 4 1/2 minutes your season is over and you are
completely dead. You are working six to eight months to be dead.''
. . . This year's US figure skating championships in Cleveland set
records for both attendance (118,000 at Gund Arena for the week)
and profits (expected to be nearly $1 million). That's the
benchmark for next year's event at the FleetCenter, which will be
the first nationals held in Boston since 1962, when the site was
BC's old McHugh Forum . . . The heat will be turned up gradually
for the US women's ice hockey team at this week's world
championships in Ontario. They'll start Monday with the Germans and
face the Russians on Tuesday before meeting the Finns on Thursday.
If form holds, the Americans will play the Canadians (who beat them
last year after losing in the Olympics) in Sunday's final . . . The
NHL and the international ice hockey federation aren't any closer
to getting the pros back to Olympus for 2002. European associations
are still pushing for increased transfer fees for players who sign
with NHL clubs and the league doesn't want the issue linked to the
Games. Next meeting will come at next month's world championships
in Russia. Back on the bench as US coach there will be Lou Vairo,
who directed the Americans at the 1984 Olympics in Sarajevo. He's
been USA Hockey's special projects director for the past eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   One more for the case
</P>
<P>
   By winning the Algarve Cup in Portugal recently, the US women's
soccer team grabbed the only major trophy it lacked. Though the
Americans won two World Cups and an Olympic gold medal, they were 0
for 5 at the Algarve, with two losses in the final. Sweet irony for
Brandi Chastain, whose penalty kick was the only goal in the
crowning victory over Norway. Her PK off the woodwork cost her
teammates last year's title match with the Chinese . . . The
shakeup at the US Olympic Committee continues under new chief exec
Norman Blake. Latest to leave (after only nine months) is deputy
marketing director Dave Ogrean. Blake plans to flatten and
streamline the organization and has hired a firm to bring in
outsiders as his top aides . . . Next step toward Olympus comes
Sunday for Fall River judoka Joe Felton, the ex-Detroit Lion. If he
wins a medal at the Rotterdam tournament, he earns the right to go
head-to-head for the Olympic heavyweight spot with top rival Martin
Boonzaayer at the US championships later this month. If not, Felton
gets a final chance two weekends from now at the British Open,
where he won bronze last year. Already on the squad are Lawrence's
Jim Pedro and Alex Ottiano . . . Looks like any straight arrow with
a bow-and-arrow can make the US men's Olympic archery team. Two of
the original three are already gone _ Shane Parker for cheating
(firing two extra arrows) at last year's trials and now double gold
medalist Justin Huish for possessing marijuana with intent to sell.
Though he pleaded not guilty, Huish gave up his spot to avoid
creating a circus around the team. That leaves Vic Wunderle as the
lone ranger; Rod White and Butch Johnson are the replacements. The
good news for Huish is that he's got a wild card for the 2002
Canadian snowboarding team.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the Charles . . .
</P>
<P>
   Boston won't be getting this summer's US Olympic canoe-kayak
trials after all. The federation had wanted to use the stretch on
the Charles between the Harvard (i.e. Mass. Ave.) and BU bridges,
but ran into permit problems with the MDC, which would have needed
to halt river traffic on a June weekend. The federation wasn't
interested in Worcester's Lake Quinsigamond (perennial site of
rowing's Eastern Sprints), since it wanted big-city exposure. So
it'll use Chula Vista, Calif., because it's a ready-to-use venue on
a protected reservoir . . . The US freestyle wrestlers, who picked
up two more Olympic berths at the last-chance qualifiers, will be
one of three countries (with Russia and Ukraine) sending a full
eight-man team to Sydney. The greco-roman side, which picked up one
more spot, will send four . . . How badly does the IOC want the top
soccer players at Sydney? Badly enough to ask the international
federation to grant more over-23 exemptions and to reschedule some
European cup matches that conflict with the Games. In return,
president Juan Antonio Samaranch is offering to move the 2004 Games
in Athens from mid-August to the end of July to avoid clashing with
the beginning of the European club season. That would be a problem
for the Athens organizers, though, since July there is hotter and
more crowded . . . Dominique Moceanu won't be among the 15 elite
gymnasts invited to Bela Karolyi's Houston boot camp this month.
But she's made such ``amazing progress,'' the US technical
coordinator says, that she's been asked to the next one in May.

HINGIS TURNS TABLES ON DAVENPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. _ The litle kid (``finally . . . I'm so
happy'') got back at the neighborhood bully.
</P>
<P>
   The stalked one, Martina Hingis, chortled, ``Now I'm the
hunter!''
</P>
<P>
   This may require some interpretation. Hingis, the teen tyke who
at last beat up on her towering tormentor, Lindsay Davenport,
Saturday, 6-3, 6-2, in a whirlwind 58 minutes to win the Ericsson
Open, has been stalked by two people, on and off the tennis court.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport has been hounding and haunting Martina for a year,
whipping her five straight times and seizing her No. 1 ranking
early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday, a man described by Hingis as ``strange . . . maybe
a little crazy'' was arrested by Miami police for trespassing and
stalking (both misdemeanors) at the tourney site, Crandon Park.
</P>
<P>
   He, Dubrayko Rajcezic, a 45-year-old Croat, has professed a
romantic interest in 19-year-old Martina through mail, faxes, and
conversations. She said, ``I told him I already had a friend and
was very happy. I said I didn't want him around so close, and the
police took care of it. I wasn't too concerned because of my
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Her current great-and-good friend happens to be husky Pavel
Kubina, whose sporting tool is a crooked stick with which he toils
for the Tampa Bay Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, now I'm the hunter,'' Hingis said, smiling. ``I'm No. 2,
like Lindsay was, and now I'm after her.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport didn't indicate she would call the cops to restrain
Hingis as they have Rajcezic, who was released on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten will try to handcuff
another favorite, Pete Sampras, in the male showdown Sunday
afternoon. Sampras hungers, having been deprived of his foremost
love (a title) since November.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, the reigning 6-foot-3-inch Wimbledon and Australian
champion, who has an eight-inch and four-year edge on 19-year-old
Hingis, seemed gone with the wind that gusted throughout the palm
tree-ringed stadium. She couldn't control her usually lethal
groundies, which sailed into the net or beyond the lines for a gang
of unforced errors, accounting for 40 of Hingis's 57 points.
Hingis's goofs totalled 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ugly,'' Lindsay said, shrugging. ``When Martina won the
first four games, I started to feel like Monica (Seles, whom Hingis
whomped, 6-0, 6-0, in the semis). Then I won the next three games.
If I'd got to 4-4 . . . well . . . but she broke me (to 5-3), and
she was fine again. She wasn't visibly frustrated anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   For such a cool cookie, Hingis was surprisingly unable to bury
her anxiety over the way Davenport had been punching her out. She
confessed an inability to deal with Long Lindsay, and appeared
soundly psyched out.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday she handled the wind well, retrieving brilliantly
and pressuring Davenport to go for too much. ``The stronger,
dangerous hitters, like Lindsay, the Williamses (1999 finalists
Venus and Serena), and Mary (Pierce) seem to have trouble in the
wind. I like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking more today, making sure I got my first serve in
(Hingis had 72 percent, compared to Davenport's 51).''
</P>
<P>
   Notably cerebral as a player, Hingis has gone through a period
of trying to outbash rather than outbrain her more sinewy rivals,
but she says that's over, and thinking is back in style for her.
</P>
<P>
   She and Davenport reached 2-2 in the second set, whereupon
Hingis ran the asphalt table, adding this one to her 1997 title
here, to the cheers of 13,529 patrons. She not only ended her own
domination by Davenport but severed the loser's 21-match winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``No excuses, but I felt heavy, flat,'' Lindsay said. ``I had a
hard time beating Sandrine (Testud in a game) that ended after
midnight Friday morning (6-1, 6-7 (4-7), 7-6 (7-5)), and I didn't
recover as well as I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The bully got bullied this time, but, as the kid says, ``We're
gonna play a lot more, and I'm on the hunt again.'

HAS LOWE SAVED BEST FOR LAST? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Derek Lowe is the Red Sox closer, the man who will be
entrusted with the ballgame just about any time the Sox have a slim
lead in the ninth inning. It takes a certain kind of stuff and a
specific personality to handle the role. Lowe thinks he has the
tools.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe is Nuke LaLoosh with great control. He's 6 feet 6 inches, a
bony 200 pounds, with a great sinkerball and all the character of a
class clown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's loose out there, all right,'' says veteran third baseman
John Valentin. ``He's always asking me, `Val, what should I throw
this guy?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to kid around,'' says Lowe. ``I'll talk to the ball.
I'll talk to myself out there. On this team, everyone has their own
attitude. You play 162, you gotta stay loose. I like to flip the
ball in the air. Those are my antics. I try to remember that it's a
game and do the same things I've been doing since high school. For
me to change at this stage would be crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have a history of flamboyant closers. In the days before
closers were All-Stars _ pampered with lofty status and bogus
``saves'' _ Dick Radatz would finish a game, then raise his arms
over his head. Radatz was ``The Monster'' and he made a career out
of striking out Mickey Mantle with the bases loaded. John Wyatt,
who came on board in '67, spoke his own language and made news by
getting conked on the back of the head by a catcher's throw to
second base.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had no true closer in 1975. Dick Drago and Jim
Willoughby shared the chore, but when it came down to the ninth
inning of the seventh game of the World Series, rookie Jim Burton
got the ball. Eleven years later, John McNamara kept handing the
baseball to a soft rich kid with scared eyes. Calvin Schiraldi spit
the bit in both Games 6 and 7.
</P>
<P>
   Flash Gordon in 1998 was the best closer the Sox ever had.
Dennis Eckersley and Rod Beck came here after putting out fires in
other cities. And now Lowe is the guy who gets the ball at the end
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Used in long and short relief last year, he pitched 74 innings,
compiling a 6-3 record with a 2.63 ERA. He walked only 25 and
fanned 80 in 109 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm ready for the season,'' Lowe acknowledged.
``As far as closing goes, I got a little glimpse of it last year,
but I really only had like seven or eight true saves. A lot of 'em
were three-inning saves, which really aren't crunch-time saves. But
it's gonna be exciting. The main thing is, I have to pitch my game.
My game is ground balls and make 'em hit it early. I'm not
necessarily gonna try to strike anybody out. But in the last two
years, I've pitched in a lot of tight games, including the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe was 1-1 in the Division Series against the Indians, then
gave up only one run over 6 1/3 innings in three ALCS appearances
against the Yankees. He struck out seven Yankees and walked only
two. When Gordon went on the shelf with arm surgery, he was handed
the closer role. No Beck. No questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   The hard sinker is easy to spot. So is the goofiness. Lowe has
fun. He has an easy laugh. He plays catch with teenagers who hang
around the Sox practice site. When a 9-year-old Jimmy Fund patient
walked around City of Palms Park with a ball in his hand, Lowe
strapped on the catcher's gear and caught the courageous kid.
</P>
<P>
   Good closers don't take the losses too hard. They hear the boos,
answer the media, then forget about it. It's the only way.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you have to do,'' says Lowe. ``When you mess up a
game, you may have to pitch the next day. You're gonna get that
ball every single time your team is close in the ninth inning. You
have to have a quick memory _ good or bad. I think that's where my
laid-back attitude is gonna help me because I really don't get too
high or too low. Being around Eck and Flash, and Rod, I see they
are confident, but they're not arrogant. They just know they're
gonna get the job done. I'm hoping to get that confidence from the
team because when Gordon was here, every time he got the ball in
the ninth inning, we knew we were gonna win. That comes with going
out there and proving you can do the job over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   Sox manager Jimy Williams says, ``To me, Derek did a fine job
last year. What really helped him was being in the middle early in
the year. We had Gordon, then we used Wakefield. I think it matured
him.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Sox are so pleased, they reportedly are putting the
finishing touches on a four-year, $10 million contract for the
closer.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe was originally drafted by the Mariners. In a trade that is
assuming Dennis Johnson-for-Rick Robey dimensions, he was acquired
along with Jason Varitek for the inimitable Heathcliff Slocumb. A
bustout as a starter (``that disappointed me, but I was 3-13 as a
starter, so I understand'') Lowe's proven to be gold in the
bullpen. He's had a fair spring and should get the ball Tuesday in
Seattle if Pedro Martinez is ahead of the Mariners after eight.
</P>
<P>
   He says he's happy to return to Seattle now that the Mariners
play in Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I had a career ERA of 7.50 in the Kingdome,'' says
Lowe. ``I watched the implosion last week and had a smile on my
face. The new park is much more pitcher-friendly. It's nice to go
to Seattle not having to pitch in the Kingdome.''
</P>
<P>
   He pledges not to complain when he's hunted and hounded after
surrendering his first walk-off piece of the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, it's gonna happen. But I enjoy the people in
Boston. Every game means something. If you're struggling, you hear
about it and you should hear about it. But when you're having
success, it's a great place. It doesn't matter if it's April, June,
or September. And that's fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   It's April. Starting Tuesday, the games count. And the Sox are
counting on Lowe to finish.

ANGELS RELEASE CANDIOTTI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The Angels finalized their opening day roster
Saturday and the final cut was the unkindest cut of all for rookie
manager Mike Scioscia, who released pitcher, friend and former
teammate Tom Candiotti.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the move was a surprise since Candiotti,
invited to camp as a non-roster player, had showed he'd recovered
from off-season knee surgery and served as an insurance policy for
the Angels youthful staff. On the other hand, Candiotti is 42.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what you want to call it --- odd man out, old man
out,'' said Candiotti after the Angels' 8-7 loss to the Padres at
Qualcomm Stadium. ``It didn't work out. It was a crowded situation
--- in the end, what's working against you is your age.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, who played with Candiotti for the Dodgers in 1992, had
hinted Friday that Candiotti would be a valuable veteran presence
in the bullpen and said he wasn't afraid to use the knuckleballer
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an easy day,'' Scioscia said. ``He's a friend and
I have the utmost respect for him. He can still pitch, but we have
a lot of good arms. There was no room to keep him. I'd love to have
a role for him, but he was insurance that was too expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Candiotti was the victim of Mike Fyhrie, who was one of the few
Angels pitchers to shine this spring, and Derrick Turnbow, a
live-armed rookie who was plucked from the Phillies organization
under the Rule V draft and must spend the season with the Angels or
be offered back to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Fhyrie, a right-hander from Ocean View High and UCLA, had a 2.08
ERA, three walks and allowed opponents to bat just .220 against him
in 13 innings this spring. Turnbow, who spent last season at
Single-A Piedmont, allowed two runs in two innings Saturday but
they came when center fielder Edgard Clemente misplayed Jake
Thrower's fly ball into a two-run triple.
</P>
<P>
   Candiotti, who contacted the Angels this winter because of his
relationship with Scioscia and pitching coach Bud Black, a former
teammate in Cleveland, had no complaints about the spring. He got
plenty of work (a 6.85 ERA in 22 1/3 innings), threw reasonably
well considering the thin air of Arizona harms knuckleball pitchers
and isn't ready to conclude his 14-year big league career just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the year I had (a 7.32 ERA with Oakland and Cleveland)
and the surgery, I didn't know if I was going to be able to
compete,'' Candiotti said. ``I think I showed that I could.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels will start the season with 12 pitchers: starters Kent
Bottenfield, Ken Hill, Jason Dickson and Scott Schoeneweis, and
relievers Fhyrie, Turnbow, Troy Percival, Al Levine, Shigetoshi
Hasegawa, Kent Mercker, Lou Pote and Mark Petkovsek.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker is the only left-hander in the bullpen, but the shape of
the staff figures to change in the next month when Ramon Ortiz,
Jarrod Washburn, Tim Belcher are due to come off the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels purchased the contracts of Mercker and utility
infielder Benji Gil after Saturday's game. Gil is one of six
infielders, joining Gary DiSarcina, Troy Glaus, Adam Kennedy, Mo
Vaughn and Scott Speizio. Bengie Molina and Matt Walbeck are the
catchers and Garret Anderson, Darin Erstad, Tim Salmon, Orlando
Palmeiro and Clemente are the outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, who have committed 38 errors this spring, didn't
have a good day in the field. Besides Clemente's misplay, second
baseman Kennedy let Wiki Gonzalez's two-out, bases-loaded grounder
get under his glove for two runs that tied the score in the eighth
and Gil, at shortstop, made two poor throws in the ninth inning ---
the final one pulling Matt Walbeck off the plate, allowing Eric
Owens to score the winning run. ... Mo Vaughn hit a fifth inning
grand slam, his fourth homer of the spring, while Garett Anderson
added a solo homer, his sixth of the exhibition season. ... Angels
pitchers allowed two homers Saturday, giving them the major league
lead this spring with 51. Entering Saturday's games, Florida had
allowed 50, Arizona 49 and Boston 48 ---- those are the only teams
that are within 6. ... The Angels play Cal State Fullerton today at
1 p.m. at Titan Field in their final tuneup for Monday night's
regular-season opener against the Yankees at Edison Field.

PITINO IN A SCHOOL DAZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Goodness knows, it's a risky proposition taking Rick Pitino at
his word these days. But barring any subtitles when he speaks, we
will take that risk, with the understanding that maybe he means it
only when he says it.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday's rambling, almost Belichickian Q &AMP; A was
revealing in many ways. Do we believe Pitino got religion on the
plane ride after all he has seen this season? Maybe. Do we believe
he will leave next year if his team again misses the playoffs?
Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   What struck me, however, was Pitino's reference to Florida coach
Billy Donovan and what Pitino says moves him the most as a coach.
My conclusion: Rick Pitino should get back to college, pronto. He
is never, ever, going to find in the NBA the ``gratification'' he
seeks as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what he said when asked about his future: ``My decision
will be based on a reality that hit me this week, as I was watching
Billy Donovan up on the podium speaking, as I was watching his team
sacrifice. I started all night thinking about him as like a
Pillsbury doughboy in 1986 and looking at him out there, I was
amazed at how much polish he had and how he has gotten his young
team to sacrifice. And I realized, although it's very small, I had
a small part in his life (as Donovan's coach at Providence).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to give some thought process of whether I'm making a
difference in the lives of athletes. Because that's where I get my
gratification. I've been to four Final Fours. And that's nice. It
really is. But, I look at what I accomplished in developing
athletes as basketball players and as people, and that's where I
get my gratification as a teacher. What I'm saying is if there
comes a day where I don't feel I'm teaching all of those things,
then I will look at myself and say, `Maybe it's (time for) a change
in scenery.' ''
</P>
<P>
   If he really wants to affect the lives of his players on and off
the court, it is not going to happen in the NBA. More to the point,
neither Paul Gaston, nor any other owner, wants or expects that of
a coach. Character development simply is not a criterion for an NBA
coach. It may be important to Pitino, but the NBA is not about
``making a difference'' in athletes' lives; it's about making a
difference in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   It's entirely understandable that Pitino wants to make such an
impact at this level. As a pure coach, he might have a chance if he
didn't have himself as a player procurement director. But as a
coach/guidance counselor/therapist, he has no shot. He says that if
it doesn't work for him in Boston, he will seek a pro job
elsewhere. But who would hire him? Pitino would have to surrender
money, power, and buzz, and that's assuming that any team would be
interested in him after what has happened in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino also keeps saying that he wants no part of college
basketball, that he's disturbed by where it is going and, well,
where would he go and what else could he do? He has won his title.
So what? Why not another? He could be the first coach in NCAA
Division 1 history to win a title at different schools.
</P>
<P>
   He also could go where he could put on all his hats and ``make a
difference,'' where he could mold players who are in the moldable
stage of life, where he could charm boosters and alumni, talk up
recruits, and be what he wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   College ball is where he should be because it has what he truly
wants.
</P>
<P>
   Miles ahead
</P>
<P>
   The consensus of the scouts and general managers at last
Wednesday's McDonald's All American festivities was that
6-foot-8-inch Darius Miles of East St. Louis, Ill., emerged as the
clear favorite to be the first high schooler picked in the 2000 NBA
draft. The only thing that could prevent that would be if Eddie
Griffin came out and if Miles blew all his interviews. That's what
happened two years ago to Rashard Lewis, who lasted until the
second round because he had poor visits. Scouts liken Miles to a
Tracy McGrady-type player who can fill up a box score. He's also
apparently not interested in going to school, even though he has
committed to St. John's. Right now, depending on which
underclassmen come out (Stromile Swift, Chris Mihm, and Marcus
Fizer are the big undecideds; Fizer has a press conference
scheduled for Monday at which he is expected to go pro), Miles
could be a top 10 pick. As for the others, Griffin seems intent on
spending some time at Seton Hall. Gerald Wallace, Mario Austin,
DeShawn Stevenson, and Alton Ford are seen now as fence-sitters who
would likely go mid-to-late first round. (Ford committed to
Houston, but coach Clyde Drexler has left, so his situation has
changed.) Jerome ``Buddy'' Harper, meanwhile, still is college
shopping and, scouts say, should keep at it. One GM described
Harper's pro prospects now as ``ludicrous'' . . . This was a big
week for dustups. We had the suspensions/nonsuspensions in Boston.
We had Vernon Maxwell and Gary Payton fighting in Seattle. We had
Karl Malone and Jerry Sloan exchanging unpleasantries to the point
where Sloan skipped the post-game news conference for the first
time in his 14 years as coach of the Jazz. The Mailman passed it
off as two competitive guys going at it. And on Thursday, we had
Antonio Davis and Charles Oakley wondering why Vince Carter and
McGrady are getting all the touches on offense. Geez, by Friday,
the Celtics were a comparative Tranquility Base . . . How's this
for cheap: Lionel Hollins, who took over as Vancouver's coach in
December, still is being paid his assistant's salary. He went
public with his situation last week and it looks like he's caught
between a rock and two owners. The present owner is getting out and
figures he'll simply sit on it. The prospective new one has said
it's not his problem. The Grizzlies, meanwhile, have bottomed out
big time after a few, encouraging stretches. They have lost 15 of
16 heading after dropping Friday night's game with the Knicks, but
needed only one victory in their last 12 games to set a season
record for wins: 20 . . . When the NBA Board of Governors convenes
for its annual April meeting, one issue will be the grandfathering
of all those big, pre-maximum contracts to make them less
susceptible to the upcoming luxury tax. ``There's definitely an
issue there,'' says Indiana GM David Kahn. How might it work? Well,
in the case of Kevin Garnett, perhaps his ``luxury tax'' number
would differ from his real number, with the former being whatever
the maximum would be under the new system. Garnett, Shawn Kemp,
Juwan Howard, Alonzo Mourning, and Shaquille O'Neal are some of the
big contracts signed before the new system went into place . . .
With Orlando hoarding all its cap money and hoping to make a big
hit, we asked Penny Hardaway if there's a downside to playing in
Hooterville as ``the man.'' He knows. So does Shaq. Both got out.
``Part of the problem with me and Shaq is that there were huge
expectations that we brought on ourselves for playing so well,''
Hardaway said. ``I can't speak for Tim Duncan or anyone else, but
the situation didn't work out for me and Shaq. I know they have a
new coach and a new system there, so I can't say how it will all
work out. My experience and Shaq's experience was the same. There's
a lot of pressure on you down there to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Magic reassessment
</P>
<P>
   The more you see the Magic's Darrell Armstrong, the more you
understand just how valuable he is to that team. Pitino calls
Armstrong ``one of the dominating players in our league at what he
does. You don't think of him that way, but you have to give him a
lot of credit. If you look at what he does for his team, he's a
dominating point guard.'' First-year Orlando coach Doc Rivers sees
the same qualities. ``He plays so hard, every day,'' said Rivers.
``And if your best player is also your hardest worker and wants to
practice hard, everyone else falls in line.'' But the reason the
Magic acquired Anthony Johnson was because Rivers was worried about
Armstrong falling apart. Alas, there's another big guard on the
Orlando roster: Chauncey Billups, who, lest we forget, came over
along with Ron Mercer from Denver. He's out for the year, but, he
insists, not out of options. ``Orlando wouldn't do the trade
without me in it,'' Billups said. ``They want a big point guard for
the Eastern Conference. Darrell is 31. And they're thinking to make
his career longer, they want me to be that sixth man, (to) give me
the opportunity here. I know Doc likes me because he sees a lot of
him in me. I think it'll be a good situation.'' Said Rivers, ``I'd
like to talk to (Billups). I think he'd like to stay here. He came
here to rehab when he didn't have to. He could have stayed home in
Denver. That says a lot to me. But he's also not playing, so it's
difficult to judge.'' . . . One of the real, stick-to-it stories
this year has unfolded in Milwaukee with Darvin Ham. He had brief
stints with Denver, Indiana, and Washington and spent last season
in Spain. When Scott Williams ``plateaued'' (George Karl's
description), the Bucks coach turned to the energetic Ham, who was
signed as a free agent last September. He's still starting. Asked
how he maintained his optimism, Ham shrugged and said, ``I just
prayed. I knew when the time came, I'd be prepared to take
advantage. It's hard, going from place to place, not knowing where
you're going to be the following year. But all you can do is stay
focused. There's only about 435 of us in this league and there's
millions of guys who want our jobs. So I can't complain if I'm on
the active roster, inactive roster, whatever. I just have to make
sure I'm there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sizin' 'em up

players will declare for the draft. Excluded are players who have

BOURQUE A MOST VALUABLE ADDITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Ray Bourque we've seen the last three weeks in Colorado
were the Ray Bourque we saw here for the first five-plus months of
1999-2000, the former Bruins captain no doubt would be the Norris
Trophy winner and the Bruins, no doubt, would have a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the 39-year-old Bourque (7-5_12 in 12 games with
the Avalanche) looks like Larry Murphy redux, playing with
enthusiasm and effectiveness, as if the thin air of Colorado
cleansed his soul and erased a decade from his birth certificate.
Murphy looked worn out and lost with Toronto in the spring of '97,
Maple Leafs fans booing his every move. Swapped to the Red Wings at
the trading deadline, he was shaking a Stanley Cup jubilantly above
his head three months later, and yet another (No. 4 in his career)
in the spring of '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``A perfect case,'' said the humble Murphy, ``of how a rising
tide lifts all ships.''
</P>
<P>
   With a week to go in the regular season, and ballots just being
filled out for trophy winners, Bourque has no shot at a sixth
Norris. More important to him, no doubt, is a realistic chance of
shaking that Cup. The Blues' Chris Pronger will be the hands-down
Norris winner, perhaps by unanimous vote, and his superlative play
in the second half is worthy of Hart Trophy (MVP) consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Someone stop the music right now, please, and roll the calendar
back a decade. Bourque collected 84 points in the 1989-90 season,
playing 76 games, unloading 310 shots from the backline. Not that
it factored in the balloting, because awards are based solely on
the regular season, but he also led the Bruins to the Stanley Cup
finals, their last visit to the championship round.
</P>
<P>
   No one meant more to his team that season than Bourque, and
that, folks, is the definition of the Hart Trophy _ ``the player
adjudged the most valuable to his team.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Bourque won the Norris Trophy and Mark Messier, with
45 goals and 129 points, won the Hart. Bourque finished No. 2. A
travesty? Not really. Messier was still a strong, vibrant player
for the Oilers, and the belief here is he was a greater piece to
the Oiler dynasty than Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   But, again, no one meant more to his club than Bourque. Gretzky
was out of Edmonton in 1989-90, but Messier was still surrounded by
Jari Kurri (93 points), Glenn Anderson (72 points) and Esa Tikkanen
up front, Steve Smith and Kevin Lowe on defense, and the Grant
Fuhr-Bill Ranford combination in the cage. Messier could be joined
by two or three of those guys in the Hall of Fame. Those Oilers
erased the Bruins, 4-1, in the finals, by an emphatic 20-8 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque finished second to Cam Neely (92 points) in scoring that
season, followed by Craig Janney (62) and Bob Carpenter (56). And
let's not forget, the Bruins finished with 101 points _ 11 points
more than the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   So why did Messier win the Hart? For one reason: Bourque was the
clear-cut Norris choice and the members of the Professional Hockey
Writers' Association, then and now, view the Norris as the MVP for
defensemen. The last backliner to win the Hart was Bobby Orr, and
if current wisdom prevails, Orr will remain the last.
</P>
<P>
   History aside, the pick here for MVP is Florida's Pavel Bure.
Take him out of that lineup, and the Panthers are, at best, around
.500, perhaps out of the playoff picture. Remove Pronger from the
Blues and you've still got a respectable club. In fact, the MVP of
the Blues is netminder Roman Turek, whose success is partially
linked to the 6-foot-6-inch, 25-year-old Pronger.
</P>
<P>
   Until we see a defenseman who meant more to his club than
Bourque in 1989-90, all other blueliners can get in line, including
the talented Mr. Pronger.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the picks for this season's awards:
</P>
<P>
   Vezina Trophy (top goalie) _ Turek. No one got more out of the
'99 expansion draft than St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Calder Trophy (top rookie) _ Scott Gomez, New Jersey. He got the
early jump on Philadelphia's Simon Gagne.
</P>
<P>
   Selke trophy (top defensive forward) _ Steve Yzerman, Detroit.
His first, but shouldn't he have more by now?
</P>
<P>
   Lady Byng Trophy (gentlemanly play) _ Paul Kariya, Anaheim.
Imagine if he had a temper?
</P>
<P>
   Adams Award (top coach) _ Joel Quenneville, St. Louis. Great
goalies make great coaches, but it took more than Turek.
</P>
<P>
   A New York minute
</P>
<P>
   The dismissals of Neil Smith and John Muckler in New York
weren't a shock, but the abruptness was startling. MSG president
Dave Checketts said he needed to send a message to the players and
the fan base, underscoring a third straight season without a
playoff berth couldn't be tolerated. Now what? It will be up to the
new GM to pick the coach. Look for ex-Ranger role player Glen
Sather to get a feeler, but that's an annual right of spring for
Slats. One day, though, he may finally get fed up with the tight
purse strings in Edmonton _ and no fewer than 37 limited Oiler
partners _ and take someone up on one of these offers. Early word
along Broadway had ex-Blueshirt Gretzky consulting ownership on
Smith's successor, but the Great One batted that one down right
away. If asked, Gretzky no doubt would endorse Pat Burns, provided
the Bruins ax Burns when the smoke clears here in the Hub. Another
likely landing spot for Burns would be Philadelphia, if Roger
Neilson, now being treated for multiple myeloma, is unable to
return next season. The Blackhawks, also likely to change behind
the bench when the season ends, wouldn't have Burns on the shopping
list . . . Lost in the blur of three-plus overtimes last Sunday at
Albany: St. Lawrence's winning goal was set up by the forechecking
of freshman center Jim Lorentz, son of the former Bruin who was
part of Boston's 1970 Cup-winning squad. The senior Lorentz lives
in suburban Buffalo and is a color commentator for Sabres'
telecasts on the Empire Network . . . No one in the NHL handles the
puck like Boston University freshman netminder Rick DiPietro.
Forget the old adage of a goalie as a third defenseman. DiPietro
looks like a fourth forward. The pro game will change his style _
the red line will mitigate long breakout passes _ but he sure is
fun to watch around the cage . . . Ex-BC Eagle Bill Guerin enjoyed
the BU loss and couldn't wait to call Oiler teammate, and
ex-Terrier, Mike Grier. That Commonwealth Ave. rivarly never dies .
. . Is this the summer that an NHL team takes a serious run at
Northeastern head coach Bruce Crowder? . . . The Canucks have four
games to go, including Sunday's matinee in Chicago. Donald
Brashear, skated last week for the first time since being felled by
Marty McSorley's stick and could be available Wednesday vs. the
Kings. Meanwhile, the Canucks have inched into a fight for the No.
8 seed in the Western Conference. The key? ``The guys are working
hard, and I give a lot of credit there to the coaching staff, for
melding these players into a unit,'' said GM Brian Burke. ``Second
would be (netminder Felix) Potvin _ he's been outstanding _ and
third would be Mess (Mark Messier).'' According to Burke, he told
Messier prior to the trade deadline that the club likely would not
pick up his option ($6 million) for 2000-2001. ``We don't know what
we're going to do,'' said Burke. ``But in fairness to Mess _ so he
could decide what he wanted to do _ I felt I had to tell him how we
were feeling. And it's been a testament to his character that he
didn't bail on us. Without him, we're not in this thing. He's been
the lead dog.'' . . . Provided Pronger wins the Norris, Detroit's
Nicklas Lidstrom likely would finish runner-up for the third
straight season. Ex-Bruin Brad Park, then with the Rangers,
finished second three straight years (1970-72), overshadowed by
Orr. Yzerman on Lidstrom: ``He's the best player I've played with
in my 17 years in Detroit.'' Yzerman, by the way, may be sidelined
with a wrenched knee until the start of the playoffs . . . Imagine
a Bruins team next season that had both Aaron Downey and Martin
Grenier in the lineup. Downey had 401 penalty minutes last year
with Providence and Grenier 479 with Quebec (Junior A). Are you
ready to rumble?
</P>
<P>
   Home away from home
</P>
<P>
   Development plans aren't finalized, but it appears the key
elements _ including ice surface, dressing rooms and about 4,000
seats (the golds) _ will be intact when Maple Leaf Gardens is
refashioned into a condominium and entertainment complex. The
Leafs, now in the sparkling Air Canada Centre, will use it as a
practice rink and passersby will be able to take in their workouts
. . . Don't rule out Devils GM Lou Lamoriello as Rangers GM. If
Lamoriello doesn't have autonomy under the Devils new ownership,
he'll probably take a hike from Exit 16W . . . The deal that sent
Doug Gilmour to the Sabres also included $3 million to help the
Sabres pay Gilmour . . . Colorado insisted on Dave Andreychuk as
part of the Bourque trade and wouldn't have tossed Sami Pahlsson
into the mix if the Bruins didn't part with the one-time prolific
scorer. It was curious then, but even more curious now. Headed into
Sunday's matinee with Dallas, Andreychuk has only 2 points (both

hasn't changed one bit.'' . . . Burke's read on the goings-on in
New York, where he feels Smith walked the plank after carrying out
ownership's orders to bring in high-priced free agents: ``I just
wish that everyone who is dumping on Neil now would just remember
one thing: 1940. He brought honor and glory to that franchise, and
then he gets fired because ownership says he overspent? How does
that work? Smith and Muckler end up taking the blame. The people
there who should be embarrassed are the players who took the money
and didn't perform. The guys who got their heads chopped off did
their best, and I don't think those players can say the same.''

MICROSOFT AND U.S. UNABLE TO REACH ANTITRUST ACCORD

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After four months, mediation efforts between
Microsoft and the government were abandoned Saturday, making it
likely that the presiding judge in the trial will issue his
decision in the long-running antitrust case in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came from the court-appointed mediator, Richard
A. Posner, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago, who
said in a statement, ``I regret to announce the end of my efforts
to mediate the Microsoft antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   ``After more than four months,'' he added, ``it is apparent that
the disagreements among the parties concerning the likely course,
outcome, and consequences of continued litigation, as well as the
implications and ramifications of alternative terms of settlement,
are too deep-seated to be bridged.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, the trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson,
postponed a decision in the case to give the parties one more week
to reach a settlement. In his findings of fact in the case, issued
in November, Jackson found that Microsoft had used its monopoly
power to threaten and bully allies and competitors alike, stifling
innovation and competition in the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   Because those findings were weighted so heavily against
Microsoft, he is widely expected to find the company in violation
of antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   The only real uncertainty will be how many of the govern- ment's
allegations he supports.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which has gone on for nearly a year and a half, will
now consider court-ordered remedies in- tended to force Microsoft
to change its business practices or even re- structure the company.
With the fail- ure of mediation, Microsoft's hopes of averting a
punitive outcome will almost certainly hinge on an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The judge will then consider court-ordered remedies, probably
after holding hearings and receiving a recommendation from the
plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   This evening Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, said he had spent
``hundreds of hours'' on the settlement negotiations, adding: ``We
went the extra mile to resolve this case, but the government would
not agree to a fair and reasonable settlement that would have
resolved this case in the best interests of consumers and the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates added: ``Ultimately, it became impossible to settle
because the Department of Justice and the states were not working
together. Between them, they appeared to be demanding either a
breakup of our company or other extreme concessions that go far
beyond the issues raised in the lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, in a statement, said: ``We would have
preferred an effective settlement to continued litigation. But
settlement for settlement's sake would be pointless. We could agree
only to a remedy that effectively solves the competitive problems
detailed in the court's findings of fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and the government had been exchanging proposals and
counterproposals over the last week, under a carefully scripted
schedule set by Posner. The Justice Department sent its latest
proposal to Posner late in the week, and the judge passed it on to
Microsoft. A lawyer who was close to the talks said Microsoft would
not agree to the government's latest demands.
</P>
<P>
   When Posner saw Microsoft's counterproposal, he declared the
talks dead.
</P>
<P>
   The 19 state attorneys general, who are partners in the suit,
were unhappy both with Microsoft's offer and with the Justice
Department's response. Saturday afternoon, before Posner's
announcement, one official said the ``views of some attorneys
general differ'' from those of Joel I. Klein, the assistant
attorney general in charge of the Justice Department antitrust
division. Several attorneys general, this official said, ``have
severe misgivings about some of the concessions Microsoft has
convinced Judge Posner that the governments ought to make.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the state attorneys general sent Posner their own set
of additional and separate demands, including what they said were
stronger terms for enforcing the proposed agreements. Although
other participants in the talks disagreed, Microsoft said the
additional demands from the states were the death blow to the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard-liners won,'' one Microsoft executive said. The
company and the Justice Department, he added, had reached agreement
on a number of elements in a possible settlement, though further
negotiations were needed. But after the states weighed in with new
demands, he said, it became clear that the gap between Microsoft
and the plaintiffs was too wide to be bridged.
</P>
<P>
   One person involved in the talks said Microsoft's response on
Friday was ``not even close'' to the Justice Department proposal.
Microsoft, this participant said, insisted on its unrestricted
freedom to bundle software _ like Internet browsing software _ to
its industry-standard Windows operating system, which was a key
element in the case.
</P>
<P>
   One attorney general, Richard A. Blumenthal of Connecticut,
said: ``We sought common ground, but the differences between us
were unbridgeable. We are now ready to return to the courtroom with
the same aggressive and determined approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer industry leaders expressed relief at the news that the
talks broke down. For the last two days they had been pressing the
Justice Department to toughen its proposed sanctions, which they
said would have done little to restrain Microsoft from abusing its
market power. The Justice Department, in response, had been telling
these executives that they did not fully understand the
government's position.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday evening, Ken Wasch, president of the Software and
Information Industry Association, a trade group, said: ``The
Justice Department and the states successfully litigated this case
for two years, and now they are going to continue pursuing the goal
of restoring competition to the software industry in the courts.''
He and other executives said they preferred to send the case back
to court, where a finding that Microsoft violated the nation's
antitrust laws is expected.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among the major points in the final draft of the proposed
agreement put forward by the Justice Department were these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft would be required to establish a uniform pricing
schedule for the Windows operating system so the company could not
use price discrimination to penalize companies that defy its will.
</P>
<P>
   _ The company would be prohibited from tying any of its products
to Windows by sales contract, though it would still be free to
integrate applications or features into the program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft would be forbidden to strike exclusive contracts
with other companies, as it did with Internet service providers who
were asked to feature Microsoft's Web browser and none other.
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft would be required to share technical information
about its products without discrimination with any company that had
a right to it.
</P>
<P>
   _ The company would also be required to disclosure the software
interfaces that allow programmers to like their programs to
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft would no longer be allowed to raise the price of
older versions of Windows as soon as a new one is released, a
tactic to prompt faster migration to the new version. The company
would have to support the old version, and sell it at the same
price, for three years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Computer manufacturers would be allowed to license the source
code to Windows so they could modify it, allowing them to change
opening screen uses see when the turn the computer on. They could
also modify the program to feature program they prefer, such as a
different browser. But Microsoft would disclaim any responsibility
for offering technical support for those parts of the program that
have been changed, or affected by the changes.
</P>
<P>
   One official said Posner had been receiving e-mail messages and
telephone calls from numerous state officials over the last several
days, complaining that their interests were being ignored and
warning that there could be no settlement without the states'
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Posner noted: ``I particularly want to emphasize that the
collapse of the mediation is not due to any lack of skill,
flexibility, energy, determination, or professionalism on the part
of the Department of Justice and Microsoft Corporation'' Nowhere
did he make mention of the states.

2ND CHANCE FOR KILLERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Women imprisoned for killing the men who beat them
could be released under a new law that lets them use longtime abuse
as their defense.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, signed March 24 by Gov. Jane Hull, lets inmates
petition the Board of Executive Clemency to review their sentences
if they were convicted before a 1992 law requiring courts to
consider evidence of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were tried like they just killed a stranger on the
street, without any consideration for the history of the
relationship or how desperate battered women get when they see no
other way out,'' said Bahney Dedolph, director of public policy for
the Arizona Coalition Against Domestic Violence, a non-profit
group.
</P>
<P>
   Women such as Carol Herriman, 52, who was sentenced to life
after she shot her abusive husband as he sat on the toilet in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Or Lisa Shannon, 33, who was sent to prison for 18 years for
asking a co-worker to beat her husband to death in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   And Susan Brune, 40, who said she killed her married boyfriend
in self-defense in 1988. She, too, got life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Elaine Richardson, D-Tucson, who wrote the legislation,
said these women and probably a half-dozen others in Arizona
prisons may be freed, given the changes in law and attitudes toward
domestic violence since their convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They deserve the chance to tell their stories,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time inmates have had such an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a law written by Richardson allowed 24 inmates to seek
review of their sentences, but only six, including Herriman, met
the criteria for a hearing:
</P>
<P>
   The inmate suffered from battered person's syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   There were at least three corroborated acts of domestic violence
by the victim.
</P>
<P>
   The inmate committed the offense as a direct result of past acts
of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Only the victim died or was seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Just one of the six won release. Sandra Reid, who had been
sentenced to life in prison for killing her abusive father while he
slept in 1985, left prison after 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   The new law is aimed at cases like Herriman's. She was denied
release three years ago because she was charged with murder and
conspiracy. The first law didn't allow for conspiracy charges; this
one does.
</P>
<P>
   Herriman was convicted in 1988, four years before Arizona juries
were told to consider how a ``reasonable person'' would react to
abuse in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   State prisons hold 95 women convicted of murder. The Department
of Corrections doesn't track whether the killings were tied to
domestic violence, spokesman Michael Arra says. So, how many
inmates will apply for a hearing this time is only a guess.
</P>
<P>
   Since the battered-person defense was allowed in 1992, some
women who killed abusive husbands and boyfriends have been
sentenced to probation or were never charged at all.
</P>
<P>
   In early December, police decided not to arrest, and Maricopa
County did not file charges against, Stephanie Dunn, who stabbed
her husband to death and claimed self-defense. The couple had a
history of violence.
</P>
<P>
   A FAIRNESS ISSUE &QL; 
``I do not condone murder in any way or form,'' Richardson said.
``But this is a fairness issue. You can't have a different method
of being tried depending on whether you commited the act before
1992 or after.''
</P>
<P>
   These women admit what they did, even if they don't remember the
details. Often, Richardson says, these things happen in stupors of
alcohol and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic violence, still considered one of the most
underreported crimes, was once thought best handled by anyone other
than the police.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Ferraro, associate director of the women's studies
program at Arizona State University and an expert on violence
against women, says victims often suffer from low self-esteem,
feelings of shame and guilt and a sense that they are trapped in a
situation they can't escape.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro often is called to testify about the impact of domestic
violence on women. In fact, she testified for Brune and Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   These are women who, because of years of abuse, sometimes think
it's a situation of kill or be killed, Ferraro says.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Imbordino, who heads the family violence division of the
Maricopa County Attorney's Office, says the 1992 law changed how
police and prosecutors handle cases of those who assault or kill
their abusers.
</P>
<P>
   People are better now at reporting domestic violence, whether it
is in their own home or a neighbor's, Imbordino says. So, there is
a better record in deciding whether to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years down the road when the wife says, `I had to kill him
because he was going to beat me again,' there is something to
document that,'' Imbordino said.
</P>
<P>
   And now, police often tape interviews with victims, either video
or audio, and take photographs of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are all things they didn't routinely used to do,''
Imbordino said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's bill had the support of the Arizona Association of
Chiefs of Police.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors, however, still are hard to convince that domestic
violence is a valid defense for killing one's abuser.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are more sympathetic because of the publicity,''
Imbordino said, ``but they still require us to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro says jurors still have little sympathy for domestic
violence victims who don't run when they have the chance and even
less for those who are minorities, or use alcohol or drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always ask, `Why not just walk out the door?'' Ferraro
said, adding that women are 14 times more likely to be killed by
their abusers after they leave.
</P>
<P>
   Brune and Shannon were turned down during the first round of
clemency hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both cases,'' Ferraro said, ``the board (members) said they
believed they were battered, but it didn't justify what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   SUBJECT NO LONGER TABOO &QL; 
Thirty years ago, she says, no one talked about domestic violence.
Twenty years ago, people may have talked about it, but only in
whispers.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed, says Dedolph of the Arizona Coalition
Against Domestic Violence, particularly since 1994, when the trial
of O.J. Simpson in the stabbing death of his ex-wife thrust the
issue of domestic violence into American living rooms and Congress
passed the Violence Against Women Act.
</P>
<P>
   The federal act provided money to improve law enforcement,
prosecution and victim services in domestic violence cases. For
Arizona, it has meant more than $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   When Richardson first pushed bills dealing with domestic
violence in 1993, she couldn't muster one vote. Now, she gets
little resistance, and other lawmakers introduce their own.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro said the use of the so-called battered-woman syndrome
defense actually started in the early '80s, though not widespread
until the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The ``battered-woman'' defense is actually self-defense with
evidence of domestic violence and a documented pattern of victim
responses and characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   RISKY DEFENSE &QL; 
Whatever the name, less than a third of victims who use it are
acquitted. It requires proof that the victims reasonably believed
they were in immediate danger of death or great bodily injury.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it freed Reid, the only inmate paroled under Richardson's
first bill.
</P>
<P>
   During her trial in 1986, Reid was not allowed to tell the
jurors about her years of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of
her father, Lewis Trimble. Without review of her case, Reid, now
43, would have gotten out in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us condone murder as a solution,'' Dedolph said.
``However, I do believe there are some situations in which victims
felt they had no other choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Inmates will be notified of the reviews by Sept. 1 and have 90
days to apply. The clemency board must finish all reviews by June
30, 2001. &QL;

TWIN BROTHERS ARE FOUND SHOT TO DEATH, THEIR BODIES DUMPED ON A
BROOKLYN STREET
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla.)   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nineteen-year-old twin brothers were found shot in
the head early Saturday, their bodies dumped into the middle of a
residential street in the Gravesend section of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony and Charles DiGirolamo, who would have turned 20 next
week, were found in front of 1794 West Fifth St. by a passer-by
about 4:25 a.m., said Sgt. Elias Nikas, a police spokesman. Their
bodies apparently had been dumped from a car in the middle of the
one-way street, near the corner of West Fifth and Quentin Road. The
twins lived on East Second Street in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the two men, who the police said were identical twins,
had been shot once in the temple, the authorities said. The police
said they had no suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said Charles DiGirolamo was free on
bail in connection with an assault case in Brooklyn stemming from a
stabbing in a Sheepshead Bay nightclub, but they could provide no
details.
</P>
<P>
   Two federal law enforcement officials said that when the
brothers were in their early teens, in the mid-1990s, they had been
involved with a group of drug dealers who worked for James Galione,
an organized crime figure who was associated first with the Bonnano
crime family and later with the Lucchese group. Galione, who was
known as Froggy or Frog Eyes, according to the authorities, pleaded
guilty in 1997 to murder and drug charges. The two brothers were
not charged in connection with that case, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers' family could not be reached by phone for comment
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Charles DiGirolamo also was a suspect in the August 1999 killing
of Peter Lanza, a Brooklyn man who was found shot in his apartment
in Gravesend, his hands bound and his head covered by a pillowcase,
a senior investigator said. Lanza, who had a criminal record for
drug and fireworks possession dating to 1992, was on probation at
the time of his killing and was wearing an electronic monitoring
bracelet.
</P>
<P>
   The two brothers had also been identified as material witnesses
in the 1998 killing of a young woman in a sandwich shop in Pinellas
County in Florida, the authorities said. The two brothers, along
with three other men from Brooklyn, had driven to Florida in April
of that year, an investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the other men, Robert A. Pasquince, walked into a Subway
sandwich shop in Pinellas County, jumped over the counter and
demanded money from Ann Marie Sherman, a 24-year-old single mother
who was working her first night as an assistant manager, the
investigator said. He forced her and another employee to lie on the
floor. ``He threatened to kill Ms. Sherman and she begged him not
to, but he did,'' the investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   Pasquince took $277 from the cash register and fled. He was
later convicted of first-degree murder, the investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Florida investigators ever had an
opportunity to question the brothers in connection with the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   The police found the bodies Saturday after a passer-by called
911 and said there were two men bleeding from the head in the
street, Nikas said. One of the brothers was pronounced dead on the
street, while the other was taken to Kings County Hospital, where
he died.

   LOS ANGELES _ It was the middle of the night but it wasn't
merely a nightmare. The opening-day images beaming back from Tokyo
last Wednesday really did show umpires wearing caps embroidered
with ``MLB.''
</P>
<P>
   Little things mean a lot in baseball and that little logo
symbolizes the game's shrinking soul.
</P>
<P>
   MLB is not the name on a can of coffee. MLB is short for Major
League Baseball, the sport's corporate name.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago it was rare and strange to see major
league baseball written with capital letters. Major league baseball
wasn't a product in shrink wrap, it was the dream of any
red-blooded American boy, a religion.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball had this special edge on all the other professional
sports. The NBA, NHL and NFL needed such stock-ticker
abbreviations. They were always having to fight off challengers -
the ABA, the WHA, the USFL. The first thing every fledgling soccer
league did was to test-market its initials - MISL? MSL? MLS?
</P>
<P>
   You weren't a factor unless you stretched the alphabet - PGA,
WTA, NASCAR. Now even racehorses have initials - the NTRA, whose
executives behave as if establishing a ``brand name'' is a step
toward the sports big time.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball never needed a brand name. It was bigger than that. It
was just baseball. You'd hear people say they're NBA fans, NHL fans
or NFL fans. Nobody ever said, ``I'm an MLB fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wrote a book called, ``MLB is a Funny Game.'' Nobody in a
movie said, ``There's no crying in MLB.'' It wasn't ``MLB,
motherhood and apple pie.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner didn't profess to act ``in the best interest of
MLB.'' But now that's exactly what Bud Selig seems to have in mind.
Bud Selig, the CEO.
</P>
<P>
   More and more you read Major League Baseball, with the capitals,
in official publications, in television graphics and in
undiscriminating newspapers. And lately it's just MLB.
</P>
<P>
   But until the base umpires at the Chicago Cubs-New York Mets
games in Japan put on their MLB caps instead of the traditional
``NL'' and ``AL'' hats, I don't remember that symbol making its way
onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   If this is a regular thing, it's an unpleasant reminder that not
only are baseball teams all about business anymore, so is the game.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about the labor politics that have resulted in a
weakened umpiring corps falling under the authority of the
commissioner's office instead of under the separate control of the
National and American leagues.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about the further blurring of the line between the
two leagues.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about baseball's - make that MLB's - effort to extend
its following across the International Dateline.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to say there's anything wrong with corporations,
which obviously have their place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   That place just doesn't happen to be on a baseball diamond.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate mentality applied to running a baseball league
means constant attempts at self-justification. Who, except an
executive with too many blank lines on his desk calendar, would
come up with this plan to break the National League into four
divisions and leave the American with three and a wild card?
</P>
<P>
   When the commissioner's office suspended John Rocker, the move
was justifiably protested. If the Atlanta Braves wanted to suspend
him, that would be fine. The Braves are Rocker's employers.
Baseball is not.
</P>
<P>
   But the boys at Major League Baseball probably don't see it that
way. Rocker is just a member of the firm. So is everybody else on
the field.
</P>
<P>
   If this makes you as uneasy as it makes me, maybe the solution
is to wear MLB caps in protest. That's MLB for minor-league
baseball.

MYSTERY GROUP ENTERS STATE POL ITICS

   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - A secretive group of New York financiers plans to put
as much as $100,000 behind a single candidate for Arizona's 1st
Congressional District primary in September, a race that promises
to be one of the most tumultuous in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Club for Growth, dedicated to electing fiscal conservatives
to Congress, plans to back Jeff Flake, a former director of the
Goldwater Institute who agrees with the group's views on cutting
capital gains taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP primary field is already teeming with outspoken
personalities, including Sal DiCiccio, a frequently dissenting
member of the Phoenix City Council; state Sen. John Huppenthal,
R-Chandler, a conservative education activist; Tom Liddy, a lawyer
and son of Watergate figure G. Gordon Liddy; and businesswoman and
lobbyist Susan Bitter Smith, a former member of the Scottsdale City
Council.
</P>
<P>
   According to a spokesman for the Club for Growth, the group's
members may pump thousands of dollars into the race in television
ads, along with the $100,000 in contributions earmarked for Flake's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll raise as much as it takes to win (the Sept. 12
primary),'' said Leila Bate, executive director of the Club for
Growth, regarding the group's effort in the predominantly eastern
Arizona district. ``We want him to win. And if he needs additional
help, we're committed to do that.'' &QL; 
A MYSTERY INSIDE AN ENIGMA
</P>
<P>
   The Club, many of whose leaders have Wall Street pedigrees, has
raised more than $2 million while remaining shrouded in mystery,
refusing to release its full membership list. According to
columnist Robert Novak, it is prepared to spend $10 million to
unseat moderate Republicans in favor of ones more to its liking.
</P>
<P>
   One of the incumbents who has found himself in the bad graces of
the Club for Growth is Arizona Congressman Jim Kolbe of Tucson.
Other moderates include GOP Reps. Marge Roukema of New Jersey, Jim
Greenwood of Pennsylvania, Jack Quinn of New York and Greg Ganske
of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Flake, who also has received the endorsement of the district's
outgoing incumbent, Rep. Matt Salmon, has proudly listed the Club
for Growth's endorsement on his Web site. And he already has begun
receiving the group's checks in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are serious about this,'' Flake said, adding that his was
the only unanimous endorsement from the organization's board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should help,'' Flake added, in what could be an
understatement. Novak reported that the Club could spend as much as
$500,000 in the race on any candidate it endorses. &QL; 
RAISED EYEBROWS
</P>
<P>
   Larry Makinson, director of the Center for Responsive Politics,
said the emerging prominence of political groups such as the Club
is troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could buy the election,'' Makinson said. ``They are
basically saying, `Damn the limits, full speed ahead.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Makinson said that by engaging in both issue advocacy ads and
the bundling of hard-money contributions, the Club for Growth comes
perilously close to crossing one of the bright lines of campaign
finance law, which prohibits coordination between candidates and
third-party groups that spend money independently of the
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bate said that the Club is aware of the prohibition against
coordination between candidates and groups that engage in
independent expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is definitely a consideration, and we do not want to cross
that line,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why we are not communicating with our candidates at
all,'' Bate added, ``except to the extent that we send bundled
contributions, so that we reserve the right to do issue ads
independently.'' &QL; 
THE KOLBE QUESTION
</P>
<P>
   In addition to coming to the aid of tax cutters in swing
districts, the organization is targeting moderate Republicans whom
it considers are opposed to tax cuts or in favor of government
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Bate said Kolbe is no longer a target of the group. But she
would not rule out future action against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really our freshman year, and we want to target very
carefully who we choose (to oppose and support),'' Bate said.
``That's not to say we are not going to keep an eye on Kolbe; at
this point . . . we haven't ruled anything out.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Rosenblum, a spokesman for Kolbe, said the group's
decision to target the Arizona congressman is off the mark because
the Tucson congressman scores well on ``99 percent of their
(fiscal) issues.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a source close to Kolbe, the group was persuaded to
back off after a number of his supporters called to complain.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have asked the group to cease its targeting of
incumbents is House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, who strenuously
objected that the group's efforts threatened to unravel the GOP's
attempts to maintain its already-tenuous majority status.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether it was appropriate for the group to consider
targeting Kolbe, Flake demurred, saying that he believes in Kolbe's
record but also that he supports the group's right to criticize a
member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have every right to do so, but in Kolbe's case _
Kolbe, from my standpoint, has been quite good on fiscal issues,''
Flake said. &QL; 
OPPONENTS REACT
</P>
<P>
   The out-of-state group's intervention and its threatened
involvement in Kolbe's race also has rankled some of Flake's
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Liddy, who said he was unaware of the group until recently,
said, ``I'm a little bit surprised that Jeff Flake is willing to
take $100,000 of (out of state) money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it translates to except out-of-state
money,'' Smith agreed. ``I would be a little concerned if I were
(Flake). They are amassing money, but their first priority is to
knock off some sitting Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's kind of interesting that nobody knows who these
guys are,'' DiCiccio said. ``It's like the Pace Picante commercial:
`Noo Yo-ark City?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But in a measure of the influence of money in congressional
races, even those who are now critical of the group once sought its
endorsement. Realizing what an infusion of $100,000 could mean to
their aspirations, both DiCiccio and Smith contacted the Club for
Growth seeking its support.
</P>
<P>
   They both were rebuffed. &QL;

OPEN SEASON DECLARED ON DUMB PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - Arizona politicians are well aware of how stupid the
majority of you people are. But, being politicians, they've failed
to act on it, at least until last week. That's when your luck ran
out.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The state Legislature finally figured out a way to make your
dimwittedness work for them and their cronies.
</P>
<P>
   They passed a resolution that will add to the Nov. 7 ballot a
proposal requiring all voter initiatives dealing with wildlife
management to pass by a two-thirds majority, rather than the usual
51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the plan say they simply want to leave wildlife
management to the ``experts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to take politics out of it,'' Brad Kerby told me
Friday, April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Kerby is chairman of a group calling itself Arizonans for
Wildlife Conservation. It's a collection of hunters, outdoorsmen
and others who believe there's a conspiracy of do-gooders in our
state trying to prevent grown men from wearing fluorescent orange
jumpsuits in public.
</P>
<P>
   And also from shooting animals.
</P>
<P>
   Kerby happens to be an attorney as well, making him a expert at
manipulating dumb guys. For example, columnists.
</P>
<P>
   He told me the proposal being put to voters in November isn't
meant to rob us of the sacred notion that ``majority rules.'' He
also said requiring a ``supermajority'' for an issue like wildlife
management doesn't set a bad precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it'll make it a lot more difficult for regular folks to
have a say in the matter, but he believes it's even more important
to have wildlife decisions made by ``people who have greater access
and more exposure and more connection with the wildlife itself, and
more appreciation for the challenges wildlife face.''
</P>
<P>
   When you put it that way, it sounds like a thoughtful,
well-reasoned approach to a difficult problem.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's what they're hoping it'll sound like to all us
nincompoops.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, democracy is messy. It doesn't rely on experts. It
relies on amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   On us.
</P>
<P>
   If we were going to pass a bunch of laws saying we should let
experts decide things, I'd like to believe even knuckleheads like
us would pick an issue slightly more important than hunting and
fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Health care, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   If experts were important, we'd let doctors make the decisions
about medical care instead of insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Or education.
</P>
<P>
   If experts were important, we'd let educators decide what our
kids learn, not politicians or political appointees.
</P>
<P>
   One of the experts supporting the special two-thirds rule for
wildlife initiatives is state Game &AMP; Fish Commission Chairman Hays
Gilstrap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our wildlife are at the mercy of whatever might happen,
politically,'' he said, adding that initiatives affecting our furry
friends should require a two-thirds majority because animals don't
have a voice in the political process.
</P>
<P>
   Neither do poor people, but we don't require a two-thirds
majority before passing laws that make their lives rougher.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the legislators who went along with this wildlife scheme
are confident you'll fall for it.
</P>
<P>
   They figure you're not capable of seeing through a politically
motivated campaign claiming to take ``politics'' out of an issue.
</P>
<P>
   How could Arizona politicians know with such certainty that
Arizona voters are gullible enough to fall for something like that?
</P>

IN GAME OF ATTRITION, GATORS WEAR DOWN THE TIRED TAR HEELS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Florida is a young, exuberant basketball team
that loves to run and trap and press. But when the game gets
gritty, the Gators get greedy.
</P>
<P>
   Ask North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels threw their size, experience and tradition at
Florida. The Gators snapped back. In fact, there was little Florida
could not handle on its way to a relentless 71-59 victory over
North Carolina here in the RCA Dome that showed why Florida (29-7)
is in the national championship game. It meets Michigan State here
on Monday night for the title.
</P>
<P>
   Florida threw a trap at North Carolina _ on the court and in the
Tar Heels' minds _ that turned the game its way. The Gators
pressured Carolina all night with a variety of full-court presses,
and the result was 17 Carolina turnovers. It made sure the game was
played with speed and pace, the way Florida likes it.
</P>
<P>
   And, most of all, Florida baited Carolina into serious foul
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Joseph Forte and forward Jason Capel fouled out in the
final minutes for Carolina. Both played most of the second half in
foul trouble. So did point guard Ed Cota. Even center Brendan
Haywood (20 points, 12 rebounds) played a long time with four
fouls.
</P>
<P>
   It was Florida's quickness, and its deep bench, that pushed
Carolina to fouls and to the brink. The Florida bench outscored
Carolina's by 37-2. While nearly all of the Carolina starters
played at least 35 minutes apiece, Florida kept rotating, using its
numbers, remaining fresh and putting the Tar Heels in a bind.
</P>
<P>
   Balance was Florida's staple. Three players (Mike Miller, Udonis
Haslem and Brett Nelson) scored in double figures and Florida shot
38.7 percent from the floor. Carolina was limited to 33.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina had won seven straight games over teams from the
Southeastern Conference. But Florida was too balanced, too focused,
too fresh. It matched Carolina in rebounds and showed its quickness
with nine steals, compared with only three for Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Ten Gators played 13 or more minutes. All 10 scored.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing for the final 16 minutes 5 seconds of the first
half, North Carolina began the second half with flair. The Tar
Heels were the more energetic team and turned a three-point
halftime deficit into a 45-42 lead. But Florida regrouped and
bounced ahead, 60-54, with 7:07 left. A 3-pointer from forward
Major Parker and a basket from Nelson provided the scoring, and the
lift that Florida needed.
</P>
<P>
   From there, with many of Carolina's starters in foul trouble, it
became a game of attrition.
</P>
<P>
   Which team had enough left to survive? To impose its will? To
reach the final?
</P>
<P>
   That would be Florida.

SPORTS COLUMN: A CHILDHOOD DREAM FOR TWO COMES TRUE

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ There are not many good arguments anymore for
staying in college for four or five years, passing up the pros.
Such a mercenary cesspool at this level where the blind lead the
blind.
</P>
<P>
   But the game has its moments.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night in the happy but subdued Michigan State locker
room, Mateen Cleaves and Morris Peterson offered a compelling
result _ if not an argument _ for sticking it out. Cleaves, the
Spartans inspirational point guard, was 1 of 7 and scored 11 points
in Michigan State's 53-41 victory over Big Ten Rival Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, Cleaves' friend from Flint, carried the day with 20
points in a clutch performance.
</P>
<P>
   Now Michigan State is a victory away from capturing the
Spartans' first national championship since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans have to go through a hot, young Florida team to
complete a dream season. After Saturday night's victory, Cleaves,
jumping the gun, said that a matchup between Michigan State and
Florida might be the matchup of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Two days ago Peterson was attending his grandmother's funeral.
Clara Mae Spencer, 72, died at home in Mississippi after a stroke
she had had weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson answered questions _ ``Were you thinking of her? Did
she inspire you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, when the game was hard, I was tired, I didn't think
about her,'' Peterson said. He even joked that his grandmother's
spirit may have guided in a couple of his shots.
</P>
<P>
   The grieving will come on Tuesday, after the basketball is over.
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for Saturday's victory over Wisconsin came from
imaginary playground games Peterson and Cleaves had played as
children on the playground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about this ever since we were little kids,''
Peterson said. ``I'd be Jalen Rose, he'd be Steve Smith or I'd be
Magic and he'd be Greg Kelsor. We played like that all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   This time last year, Cleaves flirted with going to the NB A. The
decision to come back, ultimately, had to do with whether he was
ready for that level or not.
</P>
<P>
   But the carrot dangling to lure his return to Michigan State was
winning a national championship, playing for a national
championship. Playing for it with his childhood friend was
compelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why he came back,'' Peterson said. ``For this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The quality of the game that got them there was forgettable.
Cleaves even laughed when someone asked him what he thought the
game looked like to a national television audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people probably turned the game off and on,'' he
said. ``It was ugly. But I don't care, really. I don't get hung up
on statistics and how things look. I get hung up on winning. And we
won.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a team gets the luck of the draw _ we all do, now and
then. Planets and stars aligned
</P>
<P>
   That is what happened to Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers crushed Tarkanian's Fresno team, caught Arizona
without its star player, whipped a young Louisiana State team that
had never faced their type of defense before. Then they defeated
conference rival Purdue by a point and here they are.
</P>
<P>
   The road ended Friday night with a thud against a granite wall _
the same granite they had crashed into three times.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941 Wisconsin won the championship by defeating Washington
State, 39-34.
</P>
<P>
   Same ugly game. On Saturday the Spartans led by just 19-17 at
the half, a score just shy of the intermission score in the 1941
championship game when Wisconsin was ahead by 21-17.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, with an ideology not so far removed from 1941,
Wisconsin banged and bruised the Spartans.
</P>
<P>
   There was talk about odds catching up to Michigan State. They
had defeated Wisconsin three times this season: 61-44 in February,
59-54 at East Lansing and 55-46 in the Big Ten tournament.
</P>
<P>
   How can you beat one team four times?
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Michigan State was simply better. With Cleaves scoring
11 points and providing defense, Morris Peterson providing the
spark for the offense, Michigan State was better.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this time, Cleaves finished third in player of the
year voting behind Wally Szczerbiak and Elton Brand.
</P>
<P>
   He may not be that close this year but he will be playing for
the national championship Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Now the two friends can think about those crazy days in the park
where one pretended to be Jalen and the other was Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Not a lot of basketball players get to live out dreams like
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've met so many people through basketball,'' Cleaves said.
``I've met some of the greatest basketball players in the world. A
lot of them have never played for the national championship; a lot
of them have never even gotten close.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this is a moment I really want to cherish.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson attended his grandmother's funeral on Thursday; he'll
play with Cleaves Monday night for a championship.
</P>
<P>
   So rare that childhood dreams come true.

KINGS CLINCH PLAYOFF SPOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _An hour later, the dressing room was quiet, but Luc
Robitaille still could hear the cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Of all milestones he reached this season, Robitaille said the
only thing that ever mattered was the reaching playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Kings finally qualified Saturday afternoon with a
2-1 victory over the Mighty Ducks at the sold out Staples Center,
Robitaille hung around.
</P>
<P>
   Rookies might think this happens every year, but for the Kings
it was just the second time in the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``And man, does it feel good,'' said Robitaille, who played his
1,000th game and scored his 1,100 point this year. ``For so many
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Like goaltender Stephane Fiset, who overcame two major
injuries this season to give perhaps his finest performance against
the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   -- Or first-year coach Andy Murray, the long-time NHL assistant
who was spurned by the Ducks a year ago but came here on a platform
of hard work and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   -- And even Ian Laperriere, the undersized enforcer who scored
the winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think back to last year and how sad everything was and now
everything is so great,'' Laperriere said. ``Even tonight, we came
back. That's what we've done all season. It's nice to say it's not
over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings practice today before leaving for Phoenix, where they
play Monday night. They have four games left. The first round of
the playoffs opens April 12 or 13 and they are expected to face the
Detroit Red Wings, who are fourth in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the Kings (37-30-11) came back from a first period
where they did not even take a shot at Ducks goaltender Guy Hebert.
That hadn't happened to them since November 1997 in a game against
Florida. But they won that game, too.
</P>
<P>
   When the Kings opened the second period still sluggish and
trailing 1-0 on by Teemu Selanne, Murray called timeout and
blistered his team.
</P>
<P>
   The game was televised by ABC and cameras caught the beet-faced
Murray tearing into every player who looked his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were well into the second period and we hadn't shown up
yet,'' Murray said. ``Why wait until the end to call a timeout. The
game was right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a minute later, newcomer Kelly Buchberger took the Kings
first shot after a pass by Glen Murray and beat Hebert to tie the
game at one.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was a lift, but the momentum shifted for good just
seconds later on a flurry in front of the Kings net.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kariya took aim at Fiset and unloaded from the slot. Fiset
made the stop but was sprawled on the ice when the puck popped out
to Ed Ward in front.
</P>
<P>
   Ward had a wide open net, but his shot was stopped by the skate
of Kings center Bryan Smolinski.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the save of the game, maybe the season,'' Fiset said.
``I had no chance and if they score they retake the lead. This was
a big game for them, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks came in three points from the eighth and final playoff
spot in the West.
</P>
<P>
   They still have two games remaining with Nashville and one with
Chicago, the two worst teams in the conference. They close out the
season next Sunday against the Kings in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are such a talented team, you have to keep pressure on
them all the time,'' Robitaille said of the Ducks. ``We wanted to
get this done tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The game-winning goal came exactly at the eight minute mark of
the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Without injured scorers Ziggy Palffy and Nelson Emerson out of
the lineup, Murray knew goals were at a premium. Assistant Mark
Hardy suggested adding Laperierre as a second center on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Corkum won the faceoff. Defenseman Aki Berg swung the puck
to Jaroslav Modry who fired from the right point. Hebert made the
stop but Robitaille took a poke at the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Laperriere also was parked in front and lifted the puck over
Hebert's left shoulder to make it 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about that,'' Laperriere said. ``They made a goal scorer
out of me. I guess this year, anything is possible.''

NBA DRAFT COULD BE INTERESTING _ IN 2001
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ready or not, only 87 days separate us from David
Stern's plaintive wail of ``With the first selection in the 2000
NBA Draft, the Los Angeles Clippers select ...''
</P>
<P>
   OK, the Ping-Pong balls won't speak until May 21, but history
and karma conspire to remind us that the injury to first-pick bait
Kenyon Martin virtually guarantees a Clipper lottery triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Or would they still lose by winning?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it may seem a bit premature or even irresponsible to
contemplate this year's lottery roll call, so we've decided to go
completely cuckoo by mulling the 2001 draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Tyson Chandler draft.
</P>
<P>
   Gotcha.
</P>
<P>
   Well, in addition to Chandler _ the marvelously bouncy, 7-foot
junior from Dominguez High _ the 2001 draft expo could yield a
relative bonanza. (The word ``relative'' is attached because, every
year, the self-anointed smarties of draft evaluation claim the
current talent pool is just begging for a siege of chlorine.)
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, a few college prospects actually began
threatening to remain in school. Maryland forward Terence Morris
has pledged his senior season to the screaming desperation of Terps
coach Gary Williams. Iowa State point guard Jamaal Tinsley doesn't
seem to care that several NBA scouts have accused him of being a
top-five talent right now.
</P>
<P>
   Tinsley has decided to achieve seniority as a Cylone.
</P>
<P>
   Texas center Chris Mihm may choose a fourth term in Austin. LSU
sophomore forward Stromile Swift, who jumps with the alarming
quickness of an abundantly caffeinated intern, has all but declared
an embargo on his inevitable leap into the draft's top five.
</P>
<P>
   Another downshift in the going rate was provided by Arizona
center Loren Woods, who has committed to a fifth year in college.
</P>
<P>
   Such news is just ducky to the big thinkers of sports journalism
and a few general managers whose jobs could be compromised by their
inability to tell if the aforementioned scholars can play or not.
</P>
<P>
   They will enter the standard plea of ``He's not ready,'' thereby
chucking the responsibility back to the likes of Arizona coach Lute
Olson. Lute has declared that the 7-foot-1 Woods a cinch top-seven
selection if he went professional now requires another year of
seasoning before attempting the brain surgery of an NBA rookie
year. Coincidentally, the ~ &QL; {]3

SMOLINSKI MAKES KEY PLAY FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _The biggest play in the biggest game belonged to
Bryan Smolinski, who is going to the playoffs in his first season
with the Kings after missing the last four years with the New York
Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski stopped a potential go-ahead goal by the Ducks Ed Ward
in the second period of Saturday 2-1 Kings' victory by sticking out
his skate in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really remember the play,'' Smolinski said. ``I just
remember that we didn't want to hang (goaltender Stephane Fiset)
out to dry after the great effort he had given.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward's shot came on a rebound of a blast by Anaheim's Paul
Kariya with 5:13 gone in the second. Moments earlier, the Kings
finally took their first shot of the game and Kelly Buchberger tied
it at one. But the momentum still was up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski knows a little about momentum shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, with the first line depleted by injuries,
Smolinski's second unit carried the offense.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past 22 games, he has one empty netter and a two-goal
game against the Ducks on March 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need Bryan Smolinski to be better,'' Kings coach Andy
Murray said earlier in the week. ``He is an excellent player who
really has contributed for this club. But I probably shouldn't say
that since he is in the final year of his contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski was traded to the Kings last July with Ziggy Palffy.
Even with the scoring drought, he has 20 goals and 56 points.
</P>
<P>
   But the best part of the season clearly lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to get that playoff spot,'' he said. ``It's so
tough when you're left out year after year. These guys have played
so hard all season.''
</P>
<P>
   Goal scorer: The Kings didn't get Kelly Buchberger from Atlanta
for his scoring. They got him for for his grit and the lessons he
learned helping Edmonton win three Stanley Cups.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchberger now has two goals in his last two games,
including the tying goal Saturday. It came at 4:29 of the second
period and was the Kings first shot of the game.
