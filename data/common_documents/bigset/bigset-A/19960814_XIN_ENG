<HEADLINE> EC Approves Humanitarian Aid to Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
approved a package of humanitarian aid worth some 5.3 million
U.S. dollars for civilians affected by the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The aid will enable the World Food Program (WFP), the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and
non-governmental organizations from Belgium, France and Italy to
carry out a coordinated program until the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The aid, channelled via the European Community Humanitarian
Office (ECHO), brings overall EU humanitarian aid for Chechnya to
44 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
ECHO is targeting Chechen civilians who fled the country
because of the 20-month war between Chechen separatists and
Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
It plans to channel aid to about 110,000 displaced people and
refugees in the surrounding republics of Ingushetia and Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that more than 100,000 people inside Chechnya
face food shortages and that up to half the population of about
1.2 million need medical care.
</P>
<P>
Outside Chechnya, UNHCR and WFP estimated the total number of
refugees and displaced people in Ingushetia, Dagestan and North
Ossetia at 112,000 in February this year. This does not take into
account those who have since left their villages because of
fighting.
</P>
<P>
ECHO, which was set up in 1992, is responsible for managing
humanitarian aid to all non-European Union countries.

<HEADLINE> Supporters Against Zimbabwean Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU PF
supporters today converged outside President Robert Mugabe's
office protesting against the party's imposition of a mayoral
candidate for the forthcoming Chitungwiza mayoral elections.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, mostly women in party garb, came to Harare
from the dormitory city of Chitungwiza, about 30 km from the
capital, and handed in a letter to Mugabe's office listing their
grievances against party candidate Andrew Jiri.
</P>
<P>
They handed in their first protest letter last friday.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators marched to the party headquarters after told
the president could not immediately respond to the letter as he
was locked in a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Jiri, who is acting mayor, is accused of corruption,
maladministration and nepotism.
</P>
<P>
Imposation of candidates against the will of supporters has
cost ZANU PF the mayoral seat in Mutare, the largest city in east
Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Teenagers Banned From Bridge Work After Worker Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Workers under 18 have been banned
from working on a major Danish construction project after a
17-year-old Frenchman died after falling from a section of the
bridge on Saturday, the Agence France Presse news
agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The victim's French employer, GEC-Alsthom-SCEM has refused to
comment on the accident until a full inquiry by police and labor
protection officials is completed.
</P>
<P>
But the Italian COINFRA company, which is in charge of metal
construction of the 100-meter high Grand Baelt Strait Bridge,
defended working conditions on the bridge and called the accident
"mystery," because another worker was walking ahead of the
victim.
</P>
<P>
The company said that the floor of the bridge was stable and
the railings were 130 centimeters high.
</P>
<P>
The 18-kilometer bridge, one of the longest in the world, will
link the island of Seeland, where the Danish capital Copenhagen is
situated, with continental Europe. The bridge, designed for both
trains and automobiles, is to be completed by 1998.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A disease called kalaazar
has killed more than 30 people in Kafta area of northern Tigray
region of the country, the Ethiopian News agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted local health official Mulay Ambaye as saying
that the disease transmitted by a certain species of fly was
first understood as tuberculosis following its outbreak a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
A team of professionals sent to the area by the Addis Ababa
University has now identified the disease as kalaazar.
</P>
<P>
Mulay warned unless the government sought effective solutions
to the problem, the disease would threaten the lives of many
others.
</P>
<P>
Kalaazar, locally known as Gizwa, first errupted in the area
three decades ago. It occasionally errupts in lowland areas and
the spread of the disease aggravates in September and October.

<HEADLINE> Kazakh Ecologists Urge Clean Up of Major Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A group of Kazakh ecologists
today urged the government to tackle the worsening pollution in
the country's second largest lake, a report in the newspaper
Kazakhstan Pravda said.
</P>
<P>
The Balkhash Oz lake in southeastern Kazakhstan has become a
huge trash can where some 9,000 tons of waste are dumped every
year, the report quoted ecologists as saying.
</P>
<P>
Neglect has seriously damaged the lake's ecology. Only around
6,000 tons of fish are caught in the lake every year, compared
with some 18,000 tons 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The ecologists blame the government's poor record on cleaning
up the lake on financial constraints and the lack of a
comprehensive and unifying plan.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Meets With Christopher on Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana met with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher today
at the NATO headquarters to discuss how the IFOR can provide a
secure environment for the upcoming elections in Bosnia in
September.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place the day after Solana's trip to Sarajevo
and the day before Christopher hosts a meeting of the Bosnian,
Croatian and Serbian presidents in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Solana, with
Christopher aside, said, "We are now facing a crucial moment, the
moment of the elections, the moment in which the citizens in
Bosnia-Herzegovina will have the opportunities to elect their
representatives, in which people, instead of looking back the
past, can look forward into the future."
</P>
<P>
He said NATO would fully cooperate with the OSCE (Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe) to ensure a secure
environment for the conducting of elections.
</P>
<P>
"The IFOR (peace Implementation Force) will do its best so that
no violations are committed to the Dayton agreement," Solana said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said that during their meeting today both he and
the NATO secretary general reaffirmed their intention that all the
parties in Bosnia should fully comply with the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the importance of ensuring the freedom of
movement so that refugees can return to their hometowns to vote.
</P>
<P>
He told the reporters that the IFOR will provide its logistical
facilities for the preparing of elections, particularly for
establishing voting stations, distributing voting forms and lists.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Solana and Christopher also discussed
issues beyond the IFOR and Bosnia, namely NATO's enlargement
process, the adaptation of the alliance and NATO-Russia relations.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Poses Greater Threat to Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Army Chief of Staff
Amnon Lipkin Shahak warned today that Hezbollah are posing a
greater threat to Israel with new 40-kilometer-range rockets.
</P>
<P>
Shahak told Knesset (Parliament) Defense and Foreign Affairs
Committee that Hezbollah have stockpiled hundreds of new Katyusha
rockets in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The 240 mm calibre rockets are posing a "significant threat" to
Israel as they could attack targets as far as Akko and Carmel near
Haifa, the second largest city of Israel, Shahak said.
</P>
<P>
He accused Iran of providing training services for Hezbollah
forces, and Syria of having given the go-ahead to resume attacks
against Israel since the Operation Grapes of Wrath.
</P>
<P>
Israel launched the massive Operation Grapes of Wrath in April
to retaliate against Hezbollah Katyusha rocket attacks at
northern Israel, killing over 200 people and wounding about 400
others.
</P>
<P>
But the operation has so far failed to halt the Hezbollah
attacks despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement which forbids
attacking civilian targets from either side of the border.
</P>
<P>
Also at today's meeting, Shahak cautioned against the
increasing number of Palestinians who are allowed to enter Israel
to work as part of the measures to ease the closure on the
territories.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are thousands of Palestinians who have
entered Israel without work permits, causing serious security
problems. He recommended that no more work permits be issued to
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Shahak also pointed out that uncertainties existed among the
Palestinians in the self-rule areas as they grew increasingly
angry at both Israel and the Palestinian National Authority
because of the closure and absence of progress in the peace
process.

PARIS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The drugs seized by Mauritanian

<HEADLINE> UK Defense Ministry Admits Nuclear Weapon Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Ministry of Defense
has, under growing pressure, admitted that there had been
accidents involving nuclear weapons at American air bases in
Britain in the 1950s, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
Despite the admission, a spokeswoman of the ministry dismissed
the accidents as "minor" ones and clung to its long-standing
insistence that "there has never been an accident involving damage
to a nuclear weapon in the UK."
</P>
<P>
This follows recent repeated allegations by the Campaign for
Nuclear Disarmament (CND) that there were a series of such
accidents in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The CND has produced alleged British and American documents
which its says prove that there were a number of nuclear accidents
at American air bases in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The most serious accident was at Greenham Common in August 1957
when an aircraft loaded with nuclear weapons caught fire and the
air base was subsequently closed for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
"We have asked the Americans for any information. But we repeat
that there have been no nuclear accidents involving the releasing
radioactive material in the UK," the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
"At the most we are talking about scratches to nuclear weapons.
Somebody might have dropped it a foot onto the ground, which would
probably not even result in a scratch, but it is classified as an
accident," she added.
</P>
<P>
However, the CND remained adamant Monday night that the
accidents had led to radioactive contamination, saying "there's
absolutely incontrovertible proof that a nuclear weapon was
involved in an accident."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition Labor and Liberal Democrats have
called on the government to "come clean." John Reed, Labor's
defense spokesman, warned that the Ministry of Defense "should
have learned that a cover-up becomes a bigger story in the end."

<HEADLINE> Iran Announces Objection to Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday formally
objected to the proposed global treaty banning nuclear tests,
further clouding the prospects of sending the treaty to the United
Nations General Assembly for signing in September.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said his country
"can't accept the treaty", which he said failed to reflect the
concerns Iran shares with other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"We want a serious text," said Zarif, after his trip to The
Hague where he filed suit against the United States in the
International Court of Justice for imposing sanctions against Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran is demanding a timetable for nuclear disarmament in the
preamble to the treaty, and the exclusion of espionage and human
intelligence as triggers for on-site inspections against potential
treaty violations.
</P>
<P>
It objects that the treaty does not include a wider commitment
to total nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
It also wants Israel to be included in the Western group for
the election of Executive Council members of the future treaty
organization, and not in the Middle East group of countries.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, there is not a consensus on the text", Zarif told
reporters, although Western countries are pushing for the
submission of a final report from the Conference on Disarmament in
Geneva, which is negotiating the draft treaty, to the UN General
Assembly in New York.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which has been under negotiation since January
1994, has also met strong opposition from India, which is still
threatening to block the consensus needed for the treaty's
transfer to the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
However, the United States has said that it could find a way to
bring forward the final report to the UN General Assembly even
without a consensus.
</P>
<P>
Zarif called such an approach "a dangerous precedent" and
appealed for additional negotiations. "We still have a month", he
said.
</P>
<P>
He complained on Tuesday that many outstanding issues have
been on the table for a long time, but there has not been any
attempt to resolve them.

<HEADLINE> UK Producer Price Rises at Lowest Rate for 29 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The price of goods leaving
British factory gates last month rose at the slowest rate for
almost three decades, boosting the government's hopes of low
inflation in the months to come.
</P>
<P>
According to figures from the Office for National Statistics
Monday, producer output prices fell in July by 0.1 percent, the
third successive monthly fall. This took the annual rate to 2.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Underlying output prices, which exclude the volatile elements
of food, drink, tobacco and oil, also fell by 0.1 percent last
month. This was the first monthly drop for core goods since 1973,
and it pushed the annual price increase to 1.5 percent, the lowest
rate of growth since 1967.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, input prices, the cost to industry of imports and
raw materials, fell 2.2 percent in the year to July. Excluding
volatile items, it fell 6.7 percent in the year, the largest drop
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury welcomed the data as "exceedingly good figures"
which "underscored the low inflation prospects" set out in the
Chancellor's summer economic forecast.
</P>
<P>
But some economists fear that the low price pressures might not
feed through if consumer demand surges over the next year,
tempting shops to raise prices.

<HEADLINE> Europe Telecoms Deals Rise After Deregulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of mergers and
acquisitions in Europe's telecommunications market grew by 12
percent to 67 percent in the first half of 1996, and were worth
6.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Broadview Associates carried in
today's Financial Times, the high level of activity reflects the
impact of European deregulation of telecommunications and the
figures also reflect further growth in the wireless sector and
consolidation in the cable communications business in particular.
</P>
<P>
One major deal in the cable communications sector is the 514
million dollar acquisition by the Swiss-based Cablecom Holding of
Rediffusion of Switzerland, which was put up for sale by Alcatel,
its French parent.
</P>
<P>
Other large deals included International CableTel's 331 million
dollar purchase of NTL, the former transmitter, engineering and
research arm of Britain's Independent Broadcasting Authority, and
Singapore Telecom's withdrawal from the UK cable television
market.
</P>
<P>
The first half of 1996 also saw 17 deals in the wireless
telecommunications sector, continuing the high level of activity
seen in recent years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Among them, Vodafone, the Britain's cellular telephone group,
exercised its option to increase its stake in SFR, France's second
biggest mobile telecommunications company, to 16.5 percent from 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
Other deals included Airtouch's acquisition of a 13.6 percent
stake in Pronto Italia, Deutsche Telekom/DeTeMobil's acquisition
of 48.5 percent of Russikaya Telefonnaya Kompanya and CWB Coital
Partners' acquisition of an undislosed stake in Ionica, the UK
telecoms group.
</P>
<P>
Broadview stressed in its report that since 1992 European
groups led by France Telecom, which has made 16 acquisitions, have
been the main acquirers of telecommunications services companies.
</P>
<P>
"These transactions suggest a stragegy focused on high
growth/high margin business outside France to replace the
inevitable loss of revenue in its increasingly competitive
domestic market," the report added.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela would attend 72-year-old Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe's wedding to Grace Marufu, 42, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said in Cape town
today that Mandela would return home the same day.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano would be the best man at
Mugabe's wedding, while Botswana President Ketumile Masire and
Namibian President Sam Nujoma are also expected at the function.
</P>
<P>
The wedding, to be attended by more than 6000 guests, is to
be held at Mugabe's country's residence.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe's first wife, Sally, died in January 1992 after a long
fight against a kidney ailment.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe was already married under Zimbabwe's traditional law to
Marufu, a former secretary in his office.
</P>
<P>
The planned church wedding indicated Mugabe had smoothed over
differences with Roman Catholic leaders who criticized his
relationship with Marufu.
</P>
<P>
Marufu and Mugabe have a daughter, 9-year-old Bona, and a son,
7-year-old Robert.

<HEADLINE> Internet Banking Threatens Traditional Banks' Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The market for Internet banking
is poised to grow sharply in the next three years, affecting the
competitive advantage enjoyed by traditional banks as demand for
Internet banking services increases.
</P>
<P>
A survey of Internet banking by Booz-Allen and Hamilton,
international management consultants, has found that 154 European
banks already have sites on the World Wide Web, with sites
increasing at a rate of nearly 90 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
But use of the sites is growing faster, and almost all the
banks that have an Internet presence plan to upgrade both the size
and capacity of their sites and the level of services they offer.
</P>
<P>
The survey found the cost of an average payment transaction on
the Internet was 13 cents or less. This compares with 26 cents for
a personal computer banking service using the bank's own software,
54 cents for a telephone banking service and l.08 U.S. dollars for
a bank branch.
</P>
<P>
That means costs for Internet banking run at only 15-20 percent
of income, compared with an average cost:income ratio for the
banking industry of about 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The cost advantages are just so huge that there would be no
reason not to try it out," said Michael Berger, of Booze-Allen's
financial services team.
</P>
<P>
Booz-Allen said the Internet poses considerable threats to
traditional banks, both because it costs them more to set up Web
services and because it neutralizes many of their competitive
advantages.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it will be easier for customers to pick and choose,
and harder for banks to differentiate their Web sites from their
competitors', including non-banks which can bundle financial
services together on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Begins New Round of Maneuvers in Persian Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- About 5,000 soldiers, airmen
and other military specialists are heading to the Persian Gulf to
take part in land, sea and air exercises in a way to show off
U.S. military power in the region.
</P>
<P>
They will join the 21,000 American troops already there, among
which 15,000 are on 20 warships in the Persian Gulf and nearby
waters.
</P>
<P>
The exercises include:
</P>
<P>
1, "Intrinsic Action 96-3", in which 1,200 army soldiers from
Fort McPherson, Georgia, and Fort Hood, Texas, rush to the former
battlefields of Kuwait to show how quickly they can deploy the
armored tanks and weaponry stored there.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, one of a series of maneuvers conducted by U.S.
troops since Saddam Hussein's forces were driven from Kuwait
during the 1991 Gulf war, began over the weekend and will last
through December.
</P>
<P>
2, "Rugged Nautilus", primarily a naval exercise that involves
about 2,000 servicemen and women. It started in July and will last
through August to test their ability to rapidly organize U.S.
military forces in the area.
</P>
<P>
Planes, ships and troops on the ground will be part of the
exercise, which will also test electronic warfare capabilities.
</P>
<P>
3, "Airpower Expeditionary force Qatar", in which 1,000 Air
Force men and women have deployed to the strategic sheikdom in the
middle of the Persian Gulf, along with 34 fighter and support
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, which began in June and will end later this
month, includes F-15 fighters from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base
in North Carolina and Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, F-16
fighters from Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina, and KC-135
tankers from Grand Forks, North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
4, About 1,200 engineers, military police and air traffic
controllers are going to Saudi Arabia to help build a remote
desert refuge from terrorist attacks for 4,000 U.S. troops who
will move from the northern city of Dhahran.
</P>
<P>
Iran has said such exercises are "provocative acts", and
claimed last week that U.S. warplanes violated its air space twice
during the ongoing activities, but Washington denied the
complaints.

<P>
PYONGYANG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) reaffirms its stand on opening its
airspace to all international civil aircraft by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Korean Central News Agency quoted a spokesman of the DPRK
General Bureau of Civil Aviation as saying on Monday that the DPRK
"will welcome and actively help the passage of all civil airliners
through its airspace."
</P>
<P>
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced on
August 2 that the DPRK will allow all international civil
aircraft to pass through its airspace as of December this year.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that since joining the International Air
Passage Agreement in January last year, the DPRK has discussed
with the IATA guarantees of safe passage for international civil
aircraft through DPRK airspace and measures on other practical
issues.
</P>
<P>
"This is patent proof that our measures to open the airspace
are being promoted in real earnest at the practical stage," said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
However, he denounced some "dishonest forces" for slandering
the DPRK by spreading false information about its stand on open
airspace.
</P>
<P>
The IATA and world civil aviation companies believe the opening
of DPRK airspace will greatly cut the flight time, fuel
consumption and help save expenses.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Newspaper on Kajiyama's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) severely criticized Japanese Chief
Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama for his recent remarks on the
making of a law to cope with "the Korean refugees."
</P>
<P>
These remarks are "the most disgusting provocations against
Korea," said the Rodong Sinmun, a DPRK official newspaper, today
in a commentary.
</P>
<P>
The paper pointed out this in fact is part of a plot by the
Japanese reactionaries to legalize their armed suppression of the
Korean people and their organizations in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of business leaders in Japan's Yamanashi
Prefecture on August 8, Kajiyama claimed, "if a war breaks out on
the Korean Peninsula, a mass of refugees are expected to come to
Japan."
</P>
<P>
"Street or guerrilla wars are expected when they, with
organizations in Japan, are internally divided and equipped with
arms," he added, thus advocating a law to cope with what he images
might happen.
</P>
<P>
The commentary pointed out, the law Kajiyama advocates is one
for war because Japan has made every preparation, except a law, to
legalize its new aggression and military expansion overseas.
</P>
<P>
The commentary recalled the visit to the Yasukuni shrine by
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and other senior
officials has drawn fierce condemnation from the Asian nations
that suffered greatly from Japanese imperialism during World War
II. Therefore, the Korean people are deeply concerned with
Kajiyama's remarks at this time, said the commentary.

<HEADLINE> Japan, South Korea Hold Talks On Exclusive Sea Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan and South Korea started
talks here today to try to solve a territorial dispute over a
group of islands which lie within their respective 200-mile (370
kilometers) exclusive economic zones.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have long been at loggerheads over the
ownership of the group of islands known as Tokdo in Korean and
Tekeshima in Japanese, which lie in the Sea of Japan and are
claimed by both.
</P>
<P>
Tensions mounted earlier this year after both sides declared
their 200-mile exclusive zones provided for under the
U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea. The law obliges
signatories to respect a 200-mile exclusive economic zone off a
nation's coasts, including those of outlying islands.
</P>
<P>
However, no part of the sea between South Korea and Japan is
wider than 400 nautical miles, making it necessary but difficult
for the two sides to negotiate boundaries.
</P>
<P>
The talks came after an agreement in June when Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto met South Korean President Kim Young-Sam on the
resort island of Cheju.
</P>
<P>
The disputed islands are one several sticking points between
the two countries. In a two-day meeting which ended in Seoul last
Friday, South Korea and Japan failed to reach an accord over a new
fishing region prompted by the UN convention which allows
exclusive maritime economic rights.
</P>
<P>
South Korea insisted that uniform Northeast Asian fishing rules
should be established, while Japan suggested the two countries
should first conclude a new bilateral fishing pact.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Workers under 18 have been banned
from working on a major Danish construction project after a
17-year-old Frenchman died after falling from a section of the
bridge on Saturday, the Agence France Presse news agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The victim's French employer, GEC-Alsthom-SCEM has refused to
comment on the accident until a full inquiry by police and labor
protection officials is completed.
</P>
<P>
But the Italian COINFRA company, which is in charge of metal
construction of the 100-meter high Grand Baelt Strait Bridge,
defended working conditions on the bridge and called the accident
"mystery," because another worker was walking ahead of the victim.
</P>
<P>
The company said that the floor of the bridge was stable and
the railings were 130 centimeters high.
</P>
<P>
The 18-kilometer bridge, one of the longest in the world, will
link the island of Seeland, where the Danish capital Copenhagen is
situated, with continental Europe. The bridge, designed for both
trains and automobiles, is to be completed by 1998.

CAIRO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Sudan today appealed to all
international organizations and U.N. relief agencies to offer
emergency aid to its flood victims, according to Egypt's Middle
East News Agency (MENA).
</P>
<P>
The appeal for aid came from the Commission for Humanitarian
Assistance under Sudan's Ministry of Social Planning, which said

Nile overran its banks around the town of Poshala, 600 kilometers
southeast of the capital city Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
In Sudan's White Nile province, floods and torrential rains
have destroyed about 326 houses and several schools, government
buildings, water stations and hospitals. A large number of cattle
were also killed in the floods, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the appeal was announced, the World Food Program
organization dropped some 60 tons of cereals and other food stuffs
to the afflicted villagers, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The organization said it would continue the aid for a month.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Peres Lashes Out at Netanyahu's Settlement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli opposition Labor Party
leader Shimon Peres today accused the hardline Likud government
of playing the double game with the Palestinians while allowing
the settlers to increase settlement activities, Israel Television
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Peres made the statement while addressing a special Knesset
(parliament) session which was dominated by a heated debate on the
government's decision Monday to permit some 300 caravans to be set
up in the settlements in the West bank.
</P>
<P>
Peres said that settlements are not a legal but a political
issue. He added that "it is possible to settle, but is it
desirable?"
</P>
<P>
The former labor prime minister observed that the government
has drawn up a policy enhancing settlement activities, which will
inevitably be converting Israel into a binational state.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Sarid, a left-wing Meretz Member of Knesset, charged
that the 300 caravans were just the start of a massive settlement
campaign by the Likud government.
</P>
<P>
"It is only the beginning. We know that the plans of the new
government is to add about 50,000 to 60,000 Jewish inhabitants to
the occupied territories in two years," said the former Labor
government minister of environment.
</P>
<P>
About 2 million Palestinians live in the West Bank and Gaza, in
addition to 145,000 Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
At a cabinet meeting on August 2, the Likud government decided
to lift the Labor government's self-imposed freeze on settlement
activity, paving the way for the settlers to start legal
construction in the existing settlements.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that the
government had not yet decided on whether to permit new
settlements to be built or not.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Attend Mugabe's Wedding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela would attend 72-year-old Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe's wedding to Grace Marufu, 42, on Saturday, the
South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said in Cape Town that
the president would return home the same day after the function
in Katuma, Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano would be the best man at
Mugabe's wedding, while Botswana President Ketumile Masire and
Namibian President Sam Nujoma were also expected to attend, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
The wedding, to be attended by more than 6000 guests, is to be
held at Mugabe's country residence to distinguish it from state
functions.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe's first wife, Sally, died in January 1992 after a long
fight against a kidney ailment.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe was already married under Zimbabwe's traditional law to
Marufu, a former secretary in his office.
</P>
<P>
The planned church wedding indicated Mugabe had smoothed over
differences with Roman Catholic leaders, who criticised his
relationship with Marufu. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) today again called on the international community
to provide aid for the victims of flood disasters in the country.
</P>
<P>
Pak Dong Chong, general delegate and ambassador of the DPRK to
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO), made the appeal at a press conference here
today.
</P>
<P>
Pak said that for the past several days, the southern province
of Hwanghae and the northern province of Kangwon, including the
city of Kaesong, were hit by serious floods causing heavy damage.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rainfalls of 475-730 millimeters have flooded many areas,
causing an estimated loss of 1.7 billion U.S. dollars and killing
116 people, said the ambassador quoting provisionary statistics in
the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
He said that since 1994, natural disasters have inflicted a

<HEADLINE> Incorporation of UNITA's Fighters into Army Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The work to select and
incorporate fighters of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) into the national army has been
extremely slow, a government spokesman complained today.
</P>
<P>
Higino Carneiro of the joint commission for the peace process
told the national radio here that so far only 1,500 UNITA
soldiers have been chosen while 26,300 men should have been
selected to be incorporated into the national unified army.
</P>
<P>
The solution to the military issue will be impossible by
August 15 and the repatriation of militarymen thus will not start
on August 26 due to the reason, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
However, Carneiro said, 58,737 UNITA fighters have assembled
at 15 points throughout the country and the work is still going
on and by August 15, 63,000 men will have gone there in
accordance with an agreement reached by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government and UNITA signed a peace pact in Lusaka
in November 1994 which calls for ceasefire to the 19-year civil
war and incorporation of ex-fighters of UNITA into a national
army and the formation of a government of national unity.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today sent a happy birthday greeting to Cuban
president Fidel Castro, who turned 70 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his congratulatory message, Mandela said for the government
and for himself personally, the occasion was a reminder of the
"selfless" efforts of the Cuban people under Castro's leadership
in support of the liberation of South Africa in particular and
southern Africa in general.
</P>
<P>
"Please be assured that you are in our thoughts as you
celebrate this important milestone in your life," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government had provided the African National
Congress (ANC) with "selfless support during its anti-apartheid
struggle.
</P>
<P>
The ANC had also expressed, on several occasions, its
gratitude to Castro and the Cuban government and showed its
solidarity with Cuban people in the light of the decade-long
economic embargo imposed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Mandela also invited Castro, despite
pressure from some western countries, to pay a state visit to
South Africa later this year. enditem

<HEADLINE> Namibian Fishermen Affected by Poor Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of workers in
Namibia's fishing industry will lose jobs and soon join the ranks
of the unemployed following a second poor fishing season, the
South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 10,000 seasonal fishermen working at the Walvis
Bay industry came from other regions, especially northern
Namibia, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The poor fishing harvest was also reportedly caused by some
environmental factors, making fishes to move away from
traditional fishing grounds off the Namibian coast.
</P>
<P>
According to Chairman of the Walvis Bay Chamber of Commerce
Stephan Hrywniak, 70 percent of the economic activity at the
harbor town stemmed from the fishing industry.
</P>
<P>
+I don't see economic growth this year. There is no rain and
no fish, and both contribute to the country's gross domestic
product,+ said Hrywniak.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Pelagic Fishermen's Union of Namibia is also
concerned about the serious situation and described the season as
the poorest in many years.
</P>
<P>
Union Chairman Petro Germishuys said most members are facing
financial crises and have given up hope of keeping their jobs.
</P>
<P>
All Pelagic companies and private boat owners have met to work
out a plan to assist out of work fishermen, attempting to help
some survive to the next season, said Germishuys.

<HEADLINE> Talks on Liberia to Deal With Warlord's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Talks scheduled for Wednesday on
the disarmament of Liberia's warring factions will also consider
allowing ethnic Krahn faction leader Roosevelt Johnson to return
home from Ghana, Ghanaian Foreign Minister Obed Asamoah said
today.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, Johnson, who was at
the center of the latest renewed fighting in Liberia, has been in
Ghana since May when the US flew him out of Monrovia, capital of
Liberia, for peace talks and refused to fly him back.
</P>
<P>
he left Accra, capital of Ghana, on Monday night with a
Ghanaian delegation to attend a meeting of the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS) Committee on Liberia in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Johnson's presence at the meeting ''will be significant
because all the other faction leaders in Liberian crisis will be
there,'' Asamoah said, quoted by the report.
</P>
<P>
He said that the meeting in the nigerian capital of Abuja
would determine how to return Johnson safely to Monrovia ''to
enable him play a role in advancing the peace process''.
</P>
<P>
The latest fighting broke out in Monrovia on April 6 after
Liberia's Provisional Ruling Council dominated by main faction
leader Charles Taylor tried to arrest Johnson on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
The fighting eased at the end of May and the rival factions
agreed in Abuja last month to disarm in readiness for elections,
following threats by ECOWAS leaders to withdraw west African
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the talks this week will bring
together faction leaders and ministers of the nine-member ECOWAS
Committee on Liberia to discuss disarmament and possibly set a
date for elections.
</P>
<P>
The faction leaders have failed to keep more than a dozen
peace accords they signed to end the six-year civil war in
Liberia. They have agreed to follow the Abuja peace accord signed
last year, and this is considered as a result of the mediation by
Nigeria, which took over the ECOWAS presidency last month.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian forces and Chechen
rebels reached an agreement tonight to introduce a full-scale
cease-fire, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It said the agreement was reached by acting commander of
Russian troops in Chechnya Konstantin Pulikovsky and the rebels'
military leader Aslan Maskhadov in the Chechen village of New
Atagi, 25 kilometers from the Chechen capital of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two sides should cease fire in the
entire Chechnya beginning the middle of the night between
Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the Russian authorities have not confirmed or denied
the information. The Itar-Tass news agency reported earlier
today that representatives from the two sides were meeting in
Chechnya's flat country to decide on the venue and time of the
forthcoming talks between Pulikovsky and Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian Security Council Secretary Alexander Lebed
took part in a meeting with Defense Minister Igor Rodionov,
Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov and Secretary of the State
Commission on the Chechen Settlement Sergei Stepashin to discuss
"new approaches to the Chechen settlement," Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mikhail Demurin said today
that the ways of the Chechen settlement should be worked out on
a political basis.
</P>
<P>
Chechnya may be granted the widest autonomy, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said, "The world community
acknowledges the principled position of the Russian leadership
on the settlement of the Chechen conflict on the basis of
recognizing Chechnya as a constituent part of Russia."

LAGOS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The consumer price index in
Nigeria came up to 2626.4 in May, an increase of 5.5 percent from
the previous month, the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS) said
today.
</P>
<P>
The index is adopted to measure changes in the average level
of retail prices paid by consumers in both urban and rural areas
of a country.
</P>
<P>
The FOS attributed the increase to substantial price rise of
food items, up 7.3 percent in May on a monthly basis, in addition
to that of personal household items and the cost of education
materials.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the urban area, 6.1 percent, is higher than
that of 5.4 percent recorded in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
On a yearly basis, the composite index of consumer price went

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- French government officials today
urged the holding of a "non-exclusive" dialogue among all
factions in Burundi at a meeting with Burundi's new Foreign
Minister Luc Rukingama in Paris.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that high officials of the
ministry today also urged Burundi's army to adopt "a correct
behavior," and expressed their concern over the safety of former
Burundian leaders now hiding in foreign embassies of Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi-dominated Burundi army staged a pustch on July 25 to
oust President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, an ethnic Hutu. Since
then, the Burundian army has repeatedly accused Hutu rebels of
committing atrocities against Tutsi civilians.
</P>
<P>
France calls on the new authorities of Burundi to "make
commitments very quickly to a dialogue including all components of
Burundi without exclusion to negotiate an institutional
consensus," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Paris insists on "the necessity of finding without delay an
appropriate way out for and the indispensable guarantee of
security of" former Burundian leaders taking refuge in foreign
embassies, he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Stresses Economic Diplomacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The government of
Tanzania is reviewing its foreign policy with a view to
emphasizing on economic diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Moving his ministry's 1996/97 budget at the National Assembly
in Dodoma, Central Tanzania today, Minister for Foreign Affairs
and International Cooperation Jakaya Kikwete said under the move,
Tanzania's embassies are expected to lure investments home.
</P>
<P>
He said at the same time the domestic front would be expected
to work with various institutions to look for markets for locally
produced goods.
</P>
<P>
The new policy would focus on trade exports and tourism
promotion, ask for soft foreign aid, and negotiate for
cancellation of Tanzania's foreign debts and economic
investments, said Kikwete.
</P>
<P>
He said the new policy called for close cooperation and
acceptance from the public, particularly government organs,
public firms, businessmen and the media.
</P>
<P>
The minister also informed the parliament that the three
signatories to the East African Cooperation (EAC) -- Tanzania,
Kenya and Uganda -- have made their currencies convertible to
boost business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He said under the arrangement which became effective on July
1, citizens of the three countries could now trade in their local
currencies after changing their money in central banks.
</P>
<P>
This is a big achievement to all the peoples of the three
neighbors, taking into consideration the cooperation was just
five months old, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the foreign minister expressed disappointment over
the growing ethnic violence in Burundi and Rwanda despite
countless diplomatic efforts to end the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is particularly concerned over the crisis because of
humanitarian grounds and the burden it is shouldering in caring
for fleeing refugees, whose number has reached 800,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Organization of African Unity, Kikwete urged the member
states to settle their arrears to make the body meet its immense
obligations.

<HEADLINE> American Activists Give Medicines To Iraqi Hospitals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Three Americans today handed out
badly needed medicine to children's hospitals in Baghdad, defying
the U.N. sanctions and an American ban on travel to Iraq by
U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Kelly, Richard McDowell and Bradford Lyttle, members
of a group called Voices in the Wilderness, delivered the
medicines worth 8,000 U.S. dollars to the hospitals in the Iraqi
capital.
</P>
<P>
"It's never a crime to try to prevent a child from suffering,''
said Kelly.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in six months for the group to defy the
U.S. ban. They risk up to 12 years of imprisonment or a fine of
one million dollars fine for violating the U.N. sanctions and the
American ban.
</P>
<P>
Last March, they took medicines to hospitals in Baghdad and the
northern cities of Mosul and Kirkuk.
</P>
<P>
Medicines are in critically short supply in Iraq after six
years of sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council over
it 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Workers to Be Deported from Libya Escape from Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- About 400 workers of Arab and
African nationalities recently escaped from a Libyan camp in
Tripoli, and took refugee in the Sudanese consulate, Egyptian
Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The workers were held in the camp for lack of work permits,
according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
The camp is one of several camps where Libyan authorities
gather illegal workers before they were deported.
</P>
<P>
The consulate contacted the Libyan authorities and managed to
resolve the crisis by agreeing to return the workers of Sudanese
nationality home.
</P>
<P>
Libya has been deporting foreign laborers without proper work
permits in order to free up jobs for its own people.
</P>
<P>
Libya says it cannot afford to pay foreigners because of
U.N. sanctions imposed in 1992 for its failure to surrender two
men suspected of being involved in the bombing of a Pan Am
passenger Jet.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan authorities have deported thus far over 40,000
Sudanese people home, according to MENA.

<HEADLINE> IFOR Inspects Bosnian Serb Military Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 13 (Xinhua) -- IFOR inspected the Bosnian Serb
military site near Han Pijesak today and was satisfied with what
they had seen so far.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug news agency quoted IFOR spokesman Lt. Col. Paul Brook as
saying in Serb town Banja Luka today that the IFOR inspection
would continue on Wednesday and that is why its troops would
remain on a state of high alert.
</P>
<P>
IFOR troops began the inspection of the military site east of
Pale this morning in line with an agreement reached Monday at a
meeting between IFOR representatives and Serb leaders.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed that the inspection be completed within 48 hours
at the latest.
</P>
<P>
Commander of IFOR ground forces, British General Michael
Walker, and acting Republika Srpska President Biljana Plavsic flew
together to the site, 60 kilometers northeast of Sarajevo, for a
joint inspection this morning.
</P>
<P>
The inspection was joined by Serb assistant commander of the
general staff, General Milan Gvero, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
Brook said the degree of alert of the IFOR troops would depend
on the degree of possible tensions.
</P>
<P>
He said the alert would not be lifted immediately after the
completion of the inspection but on the basis of the evaluation of
the situation in individual areas.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR forces throughout Bosnia were placed on a higher alert
Monday because of "indications that American forces may be a
target of Islamic terrorists' attacks," as a NATO official who
asked not to be identified said Monday.

<P>
TIANJIN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The largest port city in north
China opened a rarely-used sluice yesterday to divert floods from
neighboring Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The main tributary of the Haihe River, which is used to divert
the floods into the sea, runs through the downtown area of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Zhang Lichang made the decision on Tuesday at the sluice
site after consulting officials in charge of flood relief and the
river administration.
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, local authorities have invested
substantially in the treatment of the tributary.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring Hebei Province has been hit by torrential rains
recently with many rivers there seriously flooded.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin will share the burdens of Hebei Province and help

<HEADLINE> National People's Congress to Conduct Inspections on Labor Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of
China's National People's Congress will send five Labor
Law-enforcement inspection teams to four provinces and an
autonomous region of China soon.
</P>
<P>
The inspection will cover Jiangsu, Jilin, Guangdong and Gansu
provinces, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The first session of the law-enforcement inspection teams was
held in Beijing today, during which the minister of labor,
officials with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the
Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate
gave reports on the Labor Law.
</P>
<P>
Safety awareness among laborers and enterprises has been
greatly enhanced since China's first labor law went into effect on
July 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
A group of systems, including those for labor contracts,
minimum wage, and labor inspection, are being or have been
established. Various types of labor reform, including that of the
social insurance system, have been deepened.
</P>
<P>
Some local leaders and business managers downplayed the law,
thinking that it might have a negative influence on the local
investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Labor standards are difficult to be uphold in some
economically-unsophisticated regions, and cases including forcing
employees to work overtime, frequent accidents, physical
punishment, and hiring child workers, have been frequently
reported in foreign-invested enterprises, private enterprises, and
township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The inspection teams will focus their efforts on these problems
and require the self inspection of ten other provinces and
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Ni Zhifu, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, is supervising the inspection. He said
during today's session that the effectiveness of the law will play
a very important role in establishing a stable and harmonious
labor relationship.
</P>
<P>
He urged the governments at various levels and places to attach
importance to the inspection work.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Offers Apology to Wartime Sex Slaves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today offered his "most sincere apologies and remorse"
to all Asian women forced into sexual slavery for the Japanese
military before and during World War II.
</P>
<P>
This was Japan's first written apology to women forced into
brothels by the Japanese army, but stopped short of saying the
state would pay compensation.
</P>
<P>
"As prime minister of Japan, I extend anew my most sincere
apologies and remorse to all the women who underwent immeasurable
and painful experience and suffered incurable physical and
psychological wounds as comfort women," Hashimoto said in an
official letter of apology to "comfort women" in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He said Japan "should face up squarely to its past history and
accurately convey it to future generations."
</P>
<P>
"Comfort women", a phrase given by the wartime Japanese
military, refers to women forced at gunpoint to serve in
battlefront brothels for soldiers. The estimated 200,000 "comfort
women", came mainly from Korea, the Philippines and some other
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
In the letter of apology, Hashimoto admitted Japan's moral
blame for disgracing Asian women, top government spokesman Seiroku
Kajiyama told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The letter was delivered to the Philippine women today together
with a lump sum payment from the Asian Women's Fund, a private
organization backed by the government set up to collect money
to compensate former sex slaves.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also admitted the former Japanese Imperial Army's
involvement in the sexual slavery, while expressing his resolution
to restore the reputation and dignity of the women, Kajiyama
said.
</P>
<P>
The contents of the letter will be sent to South Korea and
China's Taiwan, where former sex slaves are opposing the private
fund and demanding direct compensation from the Japanese
government. Payments to victims there are still pending.
</P>
<P>
Japan had long refused to acknowledge the army's involvement in
the notorious "comfort women" affair until. But the government
finally admitted the military's involvement in 1993 and issued a
vague apology.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Launches War Against Water Hyacinth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Uganda started a 120 million
U.S.Dollars project Monday at Owen Fall in Jinja, eastern Uganda
to deal with water hyacinth, "The New Vision" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a source in the Department of Fisheries as
saying that new machinery, purchased with 1.2 million U.S. Dollars
from the Netherlands and the local market, will arrive this month
and will be tested and commissioned in September.
</P>
<P>
The operation was launched by Vice-President Specioza Wandira
Kazibwe. The Vice President said that the Ministry of
Agriculture, Uganda Electricity Board, the Madhvani group, Jinja
municipal council and the Ministry of Local Government will
participate in the operation against the weed. Equipment
including a hyacinth harvester and a tractor already began work
near Owen Fall, the only hydro electric power station in Uganda,
which is often under siege of the weed since 1994 and has been
interrupted several times due to the plant.
</P>
<P>
Water hyacinth is a native weed in south America where it has
been put under control because of its natural enemy, weevils. But
in Africa, water hyacinth spreads rapidly and strangled 90
percent of the shoreline of rivers. Hyacinth now blocks shipping
and causes disruption in water pumping in Lake Victoria and other
lakes in Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Family Income Rises Slightly in 1993-94 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The median total incomes of
families in Canada increased slightly between 1993 and 1994, yet
remained far short of their 1990 levels.
</P>
<P>
The median total income for lone-parent families, most of which
are headed by women, rose 1.3 percent to 14,900 U.S. dollars in
1994, according to the figures released today by Statistics
Canada.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the median income for husband-wife families,
including those living common-law, increased by 0.6 percent to
34,900 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Canadian family incomes have been caught in a downward slide
since 1990, the federal fact-gathering agency noted in the
release.
</P>
<P>
Despite the modest increase in 1994, the median income for
lone-parent families was still 9.5 percent below its level in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the median income for husband-wife families in 1994
was 6.2 percent below its 1990 level.
</P>
<P>
Overall, all families in 1994 had a median income of 31,600
U.S. dollars, a 0.5 percent increase over the previous year. That
was 7.3 percent below the level of 1990.

OTTAWA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Three Canadians were killed
when a freight train carrying hazardous materials slammed into a
chain of runaway rail cars in the Rocky Mountains foothills, local
newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 73-car Canadian National Railway (CN) train burst
into flames Monday night in an isolated area 200 kilometers west
of Edmonton, Alberta, after colliding with about 20 grain cars.

Two of the victims, whose remains were pulled from the burned
wreckage late Tuesday, are believed to be crew members. And
the third was identified as a friend of the operators.
</P>
<P>
Railway officials are trying to determine how about 20
unattended cars left a railway yard and rolled 10 kilometers
downhill to smash into the Vancouver-bound freight train.
</P>
<P>
Rick Boyd, vice president of CN, wouldn't speculate on whether
employee negligence caused the grain cars to enter the main
line. He said vandalism was also a possibility.

<HEADLINE> Dell Computer Earnings Jump 58 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Dell Computer Corporation,
one of the major PC makers in the U.S., reported late Tuesday a 58
percent increase in earnings for its second fiscal quarter, far
exceeding Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
Its earnings indicated the new strength in the personal
computer market, on which many analysts cast doubts.
</P>
<P>
For computer makers that can survive in a highly competitive
environment, a cycle appears to have begun in which users --
particularly corporate customers -- are replacing their PCs with
more powerful models, according to a report by the New York Times
today.
</P>
<P>
Dell's surprisingly strong earnings report was a result of its
direct sales to customers. The company also ships the machines
without a retail middleman. And even in the retail portion of the
PC market, the computer superstore chain CompUSA recently reported
strong quarterly results indicating that the trend toward more
powerful PCs was being driven by experienced buyers, not novices,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Dell reported that for the quarter that ended on July 28, it
had earnings of 103 million U.S. dollars, or 1.05 U.S. dollars a
share, compared with 65 million U.S. dollars, or 66 cents a share,
in the corresponding period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Sales grew 40 percent to 1.69 billion U.S. dollars in the
quarter, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Editorial: Building Beautiful Homeland with Joint Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- An editorial carried in
Thursday's "People's Daily" calls for joint efforts to build a
beautiful homeland.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, entitled "Build a Beautiful Homeland with Joint
Efforts" marking the ending of the 30th International Geological
Congress today in Beijing, describes the congress as a "grand
gathering" of geologists around the world at the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
"The congress has opened a new page in the history of the
development of Earth sciences," it says.
</P>
<P>
At least 7,000 geologists from more than 110 countries and
regions throughout the world gathered in Beijing to discuss the
strategy of geological development and to build a frame for
developing modern geology, it says.
</P>
<P>
Natural resources and environmental protection are the
fundamental needs for human existence and development, and have
been a common concern of people all over the world, the editorial
says.
</P>
<P>
Key topics at the congress were the evolution of the earth and
geological issues. Participants also turned their attention to the
relationship between mankind and the atmospheric layers, dike set,
and continental structures, thereby pushing earth sciences to a
multi-discipline study that includes environmental protection, it
says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial points out that with over-population and the
rapid development of modern industries, human beings are facing
potential energy and resource shortages, environmental pollution
and natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
"The answer lies in earth sciences," it says.
</P>
<P>
It says China has paid close attention to the issues of
resources and environment protection, and also earth sciences.
</P>
<P>
Chinese geologists have discovered 168 mineral resources in the
country, it says, adding that China has also made great
achievements in environmental protection and disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
However, it states, because of its large population, China has
a limited average per capita possession of natural resources,
compared with other countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Chinese government has put the issues of
resources and environmental protection high on the agenda of its
program for the coming decades and the Ninth Five-Year Plan, it
says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that the congress will help China boost the
prosperity of its earth sciences and promote the implementation of
its strategy to invigorate economic development through science
and technology.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has paid close attention to the congress
during its sessions. President Jiang Zemin met the delegations and
representatives who attended the congress, and Premier Li Peng
spoke at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Massacre Survivors Demand Compensation from Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Three Chinese survivors of the
1932 Pingdingshan Massacre filed a lawsuit against the Japanese
government today in Tokyo demanding compensation of 20 million
yen (about 200,000 U.S. dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
The three are Fang Surong, 68, from Kunming, Yunnan Province,
Mu Desheng, 71, and Yang Baoshan, 73, from Fushun, Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs have accused the then Japanese government of
violating international law by killing civilians in wartime. They
are demanding that the current government compensate them for
their suffering.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 Chinese civilians were killed by the Japanese army
in one day in Pingdingshan in central Henan province in 1932.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese army invaded north east China in 1931 and from
there launched an invasion into other parts of China. The Japanese
were driven out of China in 1945.
</P>
<P>
The head of a team of Japanese lawyers acting for the Chinese
told reporters that the massacre is little known in Japan because
the government has been withholding facts regarding Japan's
wartime atrocities, including the 1937 Nanjing Massacre in which
300,000 people were slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said it is now time to prove the state's
responsibility for these atrocities through the courts.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's mining giant Bindura
Nickel Corporation said here today that the worldwide slump in
demand for stainless steel has affected nickel prices.
</P>
<P>
A company report said world stainless steel production was
only expected to recover towards the end of the year or early in
1997, said the report.
</P>
<P>
High production of stainless steel during the first half of
this year had not been matched by demand, it added.
</P>
<P>
"Nickel prices have reflected this situation by falling
sharply in July and are unlikely to show any sustained
improvement until the market recovers," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Bindura's nickel sales declined by 12 percent to 5,190 tonnes,
while turnover went up by nearly 10 percent to 49.1 million U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
And after-tax profit fell by 6.7 percent to 11.4 million U.S.
Dollars, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Preparing to Supply Water to Jinmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Fujian Province can solve the
water shortage problem in Jinmen, an island in the Taiwan Straits,
but Taiwan authorities must first remove a man-made barrier that
is blocking assistance.
</P>
<P>
Chen Guoliang, director of the Fujian provincial water
conservation and hydroelectric department, pointed out that
Jinmen is in short supply of water, and residents there are
demanding help from Fujian.
</P>
<P>
However, Taiwan authorities are opposed to this, say that
Fujian will be sending "united work water" to Jinmen, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
This fear is groundless, he stressed, adding that supplying
water to Jinmen is in the best interests of the people there, and
has nothing to do with politics.
</P>
<P>
The Fujian provincial government established a group to
supervise a water supply project to Jinmen last year, and
feasibility studies were conducted by experts, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The experts concluded that Fujian has an abundant source of
fine-quality water, and for the province to supply water to Jinmen
is feasible and economical, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that during a seminar on flood and drought prevention
held in Fuzhou in July 1995, experts from the two sides agreed
that the best way to solve Jinmen's water shortage is for Fujian
to offer assistance.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that in order to meet the demands of Jinmen
residents, Taiwan authorities should begin negotiations between
officials from both sides in charge of the water projects.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Indonesia Launches 'Blue Sky' Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
encouraging the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) in public and
private vehicles as part of the efforts to control air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Adopting the romantic word 'blue', the government has recently
launched a national campaign called 'Langit Biru' or 'Blue Sky',
which aims to improve the quality of air in the country's big
cities.
</P>
<P>
A study has rated the Indonesian capital of Jakarta as the
third worst city in the world in terms of air pollution, after
Bangkok and Mexico city.
</P>
<P>
The 'Langit Biru' program, which will be implemented in major
industrial cities such as Jakarta, Surabaya and Denpasar, intends
to increase public awareness on the need to reduce the level of
poisonous gas emitted by engines.
</P>
<P>
Two major sources of pollution are identified by the program:
industrial plants and motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Environmental experts have been calling on the government to
concern about car exhaust and the emissions from factory chimneys
as the country's industrialization program moving full steam
ahead, and more city folks owning and driving cars.
</P>
<P>
In dealing with industrial pollution, the program has enlisted
43 companies, which have signed a commitment stating that their
emission levels will not exceed official standards.
</P>
<P>
The program also calls for closer monitoring of industrial
emission and stricter standards in the future.
</P>
<P>
In dealing with pollution from motor vehicles, the program
encourages motorists to switch to environment-friendly fuels such
as compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG).
</P>
<P>
"Using CNG in cars is more efficient and is environmentally
safer than using gasoline or diesel oil," Minister of Environment
Sarwono Kusumaatmadja said when launching the program.
</P>
<P>
Besides being environmentally safe, the use of CNG in public
transportation is cheaper, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Thus, control over motor vehicles includes diversifying every
source by shifting from gasoline to CNG -- claimed to produce less
poisonous gas emissions compared to regular kinds of fuel --
starting with public transportation such as taxis.
</P>
<P>
However, there are problems such as the shortage of CNG filling
stations and converter mechanisms that need to be solved before
vehicles could shift to the use of CNG.
</P>
<P>
In facing with the problems, officials sources said, the
Jakarta governor and mayors of Bandung (West Java), Semarang
(Central Java), Surabaya (East Java) and Denpasar (Bali) have
pledged to conduct cooperation with Pt. Otobas Karya Pratama (OKP)
on the development of CNG filling stations in the five major
cities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a total of 250 Kosti taxi owners in Surakarta and
Semarang have also signed an agreement with Pt. OKP company to
distribute CNG.
</P>
<P>
According to Jakarta Governor Surjadi Soedirdja, air pollution
in Jakarta mostly comes from industries and motor vehicles. At
least 2.7 million cars and buses pour into the streets every day
with high poisonous gas emission.
</P>
<P>
Soedirdja said that public transportation in Jakarta should no
longer use fuel oil with high poisonous gas emission rate.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta will develop a mass transportation system which is
relatively environment-friendly, he added.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out that it will take a lot more than mere
appeals to the conscience of factory owners and car owners to
maintain the quality of the air that the people breathe. Stronger
laws and regulations, in addition to measures to ensure
compliance, are what Jakarta and other big cities need to keep the
sky blue, they added.

<HEADLINE> Earth Hit by Six Big Meteorites In Past 65 Ma: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Six large meteorites have
plunged to Earth in the past 65 million years, sparking disasters
throughout the world and even the extinction of dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made in Beijing today at the 30th International
Geological Congress by Ouyang Ziyuan, a senior research fellow
from the Geochemistry Institute under Chinese Academy of
Sciences. He chaired today's discussion on the impact of
meteorites on the Earth.
</P>
<P>
The meteorites reportedly fell during periods dating back 65
million years, 34 million years, 15 million years, 2.4 million
years, one million years and 700,000 years.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese geologists have tried to search for the remains of the
meteorites' impacts, because the classification of the different
periods depends on environmental, climatic and biological
changes," Ouyang said, adding that a meteorite with a diameter of
one km and above could cause a global catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
The dust that was stirred up when the meteorites struck the
Earth may have stayed in the atmosphere for nearly 1,000 years,
blocking the sun and creating an ice period that would have killed
plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
The heaviest impact occurred in Mexico Bay 16 million years
ago, when a 10 km-diametered meteorite with a diameter of over 200
km struck the Earth.
</P>
<P>
"The impact is similar to the explosion of a 1,000 T-H-Bomb,
causing the extinction of 70 percent of all biological things,
including dinosaurs," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The meteorites have fallen in five known areas -- Mexico Bay,
North America, Germany, South Pacific Ocean and Africa -- but the
location of the sixth is unknown. Meteorological remains have been
discovered on the Loess Plateau in northern China.
</P>
<P>
Several ground conditions are needed to judge the existence of
a meteorite, such as a high iridiam content, an irregular
cobalt-to-nickel ratio, irregular isotopes of oxygen and carbon,
residue from fires, and meteoritic pits.

<HEADLINE> Sino-German Cooperation in Continental Scientific Drilling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- China and Germany signed an
agreement here today to cooperate in continental scientific
drilling (CSD) activities in east China's Anhui and Shandong
Provinces, which will allow both countries to probe the geological
mysteries of the earth and search for new energy sources for the
next century.
</P>
<P>
The Dabie Mount Areas in central Anhui Province, as well as the
southern part of Shandong province, where China's north and south
plates join, are proved to have great mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Germany will provide to China
technologies for deep-well drilling, well logging, surveying, and
drill sampling.
</P>
<P>
Germany will help China train up to seven drilling experts
every year in the coming five years, and will work with China to
co-sponsor an international conference on scientific drilling in
May, 1997, with the help of the Germany-based International
Continental Drilling Program.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Rolf Emmermann, director of Potsdam-based Geo Forschungs
Zentrum, said that China has many unique geological environments,
especially the Dabie Mount Area -- the world's largest
high-pressure metamorphic zone -- which will aid in the study of
the earth's inner regions.
</P>
<P>
Min Zhi, an official from the Ministry of Geology and Mineral
Resources, said that Germany has advanced technologies and rich
experiences in CSD, and he believes that the cooperation between
two countries will promote China's CSD program.
</P>
<P>
CSD, which formed in the 1960s, aims to further research of the
Earth's inner space and search for mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
Prof. W.S. Fyfe, the former president of the International
Union of Geological Sciences, said that scientific drilling will
not only advance current geological study, but relieve future
demands for energy resources.
</P>
<P>
The CSD program has helped geologists further their
understanding of earthquakes, global warming and other geological
hazards, and has also led to discoveries of many abiogenetic oil
and gas, metal ore and geothermal resources near the Earth's
mantle.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Calls for Enhanced Productivity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A country's sustained economic
growth can only be ensured by the efficient use of available
resources which should benefit the people and attract the outside
market, said Zambian President F. Chiluba today.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks in a speech read for him by
Minister of Labor and Social Security Newstead Zimba at a
national workshop for productivity improvement in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The government should not be finger-pointed for the nation's
productivity ills while at the same time no amount of decrees can
possibly force people to be more productive, Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government has made major irreversible
strides to improve productivity in the country.
</P>
<P>
There are extensive privatization, liberalization, foreign
investment interest and significant competition which replaced
the large public sector, price and foreign exchange controls,
foreign trade controls, an isolated economy and little foreign
trade that his government inherited.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is a step towards the formation of a national
productivity council which will serve as an important element in the
strengthening of the capacity of the Zambian manufacturing industry
to contribute towards economic growth.

</P>
<P>
This activity, which will last for one month, marks the first
time for the people of Hong Kong to truly participate in
governmental affairs.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the smooth progress of the activity, the secretariat

The Selection Committee has the responsibility of choosing
candidates for the first SAR Chief Executive as well as the
provisional legislature. It will be composed of 400 members from

<HEADLINE> Lambs Provide A New Dawn For Poverty Hit Jin (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Jin Caixia, 29, a farming woman
of China's Hui nationality never had dreams of becoming rich. Now
she has had the courage to get a bank loan to raise lambs, run a
small shop, and organize a troupe in northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Jin Caixia's success benefits from the United Nation's Women,
Population and Development project, which is aimed at helping
women in poor areas slam the door on poverty.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the UN has invested 10 million US
dollars to support the project, and more than 20,000 poor women
like Jin Caixia have benefited from it.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, a household's economic community, composed
of poor women, has been set up. In it women are encouraged to save
money bit by bit until they have enough to meet the terms for a
loan. Through saving money, women have learned how to save and use
money.
</P>
<P>
Each of the community members deposits a certain amount of
money every month. When their collective savings are enough for a
loan, the member can get the loan in proportion to her own savings.
</P>
<P>
Jin Caixia deposited ten yuan (one US dollar equals 8.3 yuan)
every month. When her savings amounted to one hundred yuan, and
her community's total reached some 3,000 yuan, she got a loan of
650 yuan from the group fund.
</P>
<P>
With the loan, Jin bought two lambs in 1994, and the following
year she bought another one with the money she earned from selling
baby lambs. One year later she returned the first loan and got
another loan to open a small shop which gives her a profit of more
than 1,000 yuan per year.
</P>
<P>
The project also provides opportunities for women to learn
reading and writing. In the community, many women for the first
time learned to write their names and ages, and tried to express
their ideas by drawing pictures.

<P>
Difficulties they face are not only their poverty and
illiteracy, but also pressure coming from their families. However,
most of them have tried hard to stick it out.
</P>
<P>
Jin Caixia said that since she took part in the community, she
and her husband have both changed. She would not bear children
again, and her husband promised to smoke less in order to save
money. He also began to take care of the children and to cook,
which previously was the daily routine for Jin.
</P>
<P>
Women in Jin Caixia's village - Guomiao Village - who are
becoming rich have started to assist other poor villagers to set
up household businesses.
</P>
<P>
Today the village has built a row of new red-brick houses and a
hard-pitch basketball field on which women often play ball games
with men.
</P>
<P>
Huo Chunmei, head of the women's association of Guyuan county,
said that there are 32 women's groups with a circulating capital
of 1.8 million yuan. And 85 percent of the women have got
non-illiterate certificates. The women give eight artistic
performances and ball games each year.
</P>
<P>
Jin Caixia and her village development are not the only
successful example in the 35 poorest Chinese counties where the
WPD projects are carried out.
</P>
<P>
In another village in neighboring Qinghai Province, Song
Guixiang, 32, is running a household aquiculture business after a
local bank gave her a loan.
</P>
<P>
"I now can read newspapers. I want my children to live a better
life in the future" she said, with a sense of pride in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
Although China has achieved great success in wiping out
poverty, there are a total of 328 poor counties in the country,
where women have not yet been fully liberated from poverty.
</P>
<P>
The practice of household economic community has proved a very
effective way to end poverty, which is worth popularizing across
China and other developing countries, according to an official of
the United Nations Population Fund.

<P>
JAKARTA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Mountain Merapi in central Java,
1,200 kilometers east of Jakarta, on Tuesday afternoon started
emitting hot lava toward its western slope, promoting the people
living in the area to get ready for evacuation.
</P>
<P>
Mas Atje Purbawinata, head of the Yogjakarta Volcanology
Directorate Office, said today that the lava which continues to
flow out of mountain Merapi as far as 1.5 kilometers from its
crater goes down to Krasak, Kuning and Boyong rivers.
</P>
<P>
Until early today, Merapi spewed thick fumes at least 49 times
also, Antara news agency quoted Purbawenata as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said warnings were already issued to people living in the
declared dangerous areas.
</P>
<P>
"There is a serious danger as Merapi could spew hot volcanic
debris any time," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the staff assigned to monitor the volcano keep a
24-hour observation. At least five monitoring posts are
maintained in Jrakah, Babadan, Ngepos, Selo and Kaliurang.
</P>
<P>
Mountain Merapi is one of the 127 volcanoes classified as
active in Indonesia which has a total of 500 volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
Its last eruption in November 1993 killed more than 60 people
and caused significant property damage. More than 6,000 people

<HEADLINE> Historian Refutes Dalai Lama's Speech at British Parliament (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Dalai Lama's propaganda in the
United States, Europe, and in Australia is intended to back
"Independence of Tibet" and to internationalize the Tibet issue, a
prominent Tibetan historian said here today.
</P>
<P>
This was the comment of Doje Cedain, secretary-general of the
China Tibetology Research Center in Beijing, who noted that Dalai
Lama's "attempt will never succeed, because the Chinese people,
including the Tibetans, are resolutely opposed to such treason
against the national interests."
</P>
<P>
The 71-year-old Tibetologist said that "the Dalai's lies can
only deceive those who do not know the truth."
</P>
<P>
A good example of this, according to Doje, was the Dalai Lama's
claim last month at the British Parliament, that "in my efforts to
seek a negotiated solution to our problem, I have refrained from
asking for the complete independence of Tibet," while in the same
speech he said, "Historically and according to international law,
Tibet is an independent country under Chinese occupation."
</P>
<P>
Doje said that the central government will not have talks with
the Dalai Lama unless he puts a complete halt to his separationist
activities and gives up the pursuit of "Independence of Tibet" in
both words and deeds, because this is a basic principle of a
sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
Doje was once chairman of the government of the Tibet
Autonomous Region. In addition to his research work at the
Tibetology Research Center, he works for People's University of
China.
</P>
<P>
He has compiled the "Collections of Archives and Historical
Documents Relating to Relations Between the Tibet Locality and the
Central Government since the Yuan Dynasty".
</P>
<P>
"China's sovereignty over Tibet in fact should never be
doubted. My book contains a large number of historical documents,
in Tibetan, Mongolian, Manchu, and Chinese, which prove that Tibet
is an unalienable part of China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If Tibet was not part of China in the Yuan Dynasty, why did
the central government take the dimensions of fields, register
households, collect taxes, impose duties and appoint officials in
Tibet?" he asked.

<HEADLINE> Historian Refutes Dalai Lama's Speech In British Parliament (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Historical records in Tibetan also show that the central
government has exercised sovereignty over Tibet, he said. When the
central government, led by the Kuomintang in 1931, prepared to
convene a national congress, the 13th Dalai Lama decided to send
representatives to attend. And the local government in Tibet in
1946 sent representatives twice to similar national conferences,
records show.
</P>
<P>
"Those records are still in the Tibetan Archives Hall," Doje
said, adding that, "If Tibet was not part of China, why did
Tibetans become members of China's National People's Congress
Standing Committee (China's parliament)? The 14th Dalai Lama even
does not have this common knowledge!"
</P>
<P>
The renowed Tibetan scholar said that the history of the 14th
Dalai Lama itself also proves the central government's authority
over Tibet.
</P>
<P>
His exemption from Golden Urn lot drawing procedure to
determine the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama, his
installment on the holy throne, and his political power were all
the result of permission by the Nationalist Government, the
central government at that time, Doje said.
</P>
<P>
"Why do the international anti-China forces still make a fuss
over the question with an answer already at hand? They want to
separate Tibet from China. The 14th Dalai Lama, in order to get
support from them and to please them, has gone too far down the
separatist road," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The attempts to achieve 'independence of Tibet' have not
succeed thus far, and will never succeed," Doje said, "because the
Chinese people will not stand for it."

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Two-thirds of Australia's small
business proprietors believe the country's economy is at a
standstill, the latest Yellow Pages Small Business Index said.
</P>
<P>
The quarterly survey, covering 1200 small business across
Australia, found that the number of small business proprietors who
consider the economy was growing was offset exactly by those who
believe the economy was contracting.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that small business confidence has fallen
significantly from the immediate post-federal election euphoria.
</P>
<P>
Only 43 percent of proprietors surveyed were confident about
the coming 12 months, down from 57 percent in the May survey.
</P>
<P>
"Not only has the post-election euphoria reversed, but small
businesses are saying that in the period immediately before the
federal budget, their sales are flat and the economy is at a
standstill," index economic adviser John Marsden said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Only 22 percent of small business proprietors surveyed believed
the Howard government's policies were supportive, well down on 42
percent in the last survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that one of the major reasons for these
negative perceptions was that the government policies were seen to
be having a detrimental effect on consumer confidence, which led
to lower consumer spending.

<HEADLINE> HK Civil Servants Unions Disappointed at Government Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Several civil servants
associations have openly criticized and expressed disappointment
over the Hong Kong government's guidelines on their participation
in the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
Hui Kwok-hung, chairman of the Hong Kong Senior Non-Expatriate
Officers' Association, said the guidelines were too rigid and they
might prevent civil servants from taking part in the election of
the chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
"I can't see any conflict of interest in choosing the chief
executive," Hui said.
</P>
<P>
Another major union, the Chinese Civil Servants Association,
also denounced the guidelines. Peter H Wong, its president, said
that not all directorate officers are involved in policy-making.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the guidelines of the Hong Kong government will
prevent them from participating in the nomination to the Selection
Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said the Hong Kong government should have consulted with the
civil servants unions on the matter of the Selection Committee
before they formulated the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines issued by the Civil Service Branch of the Hong
Kong government on Tuesday said that directorate officers,
administrative officers, police officers and information officers
would not be permitted to serve on the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Makes Achievements in Developing Economy: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto said today that her government has made
achievements in developing the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing to the nation on the celebration of 49th
Independence Day of Pakistan, Bhutto said the government had
brought down the budget deficit to 5 percent in the 1995-96 fiscal
year from 8 percent before.
</P>
<P>
"The present government has paid back one billion rupees (285
million US dollars) of foreign debt," she said, adding that a
number of steps have been taken to attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
"After the end of the Afghan war, the foreign aid to Pakistan
was stopped and the government had to widen the tax net to
increase its income," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
The government has proposed the Agriculture Wealth Tax in the
budget and the provinces have also promised to levy these taxes,
she added.
</P>
<P>
The levy of General Sales Tax was necessary as only 800,000
people out of 130 million population in Pakistan pay taxes, she
noted.
</P>
<P>
The government has also taken measures to eradicate poverty and
solve the problem of unemployment in the country, she said.
</P>
<P>
The government has provided 600,000 gas connections in rural
areas and has electrified 18,000 villages, she added.
</P>
<P>
She expressed her confidence that the development of the
country's economy will continue moving forward in the future.

<HEADLINE> Men Advised To Change Lifestyle To Prevent Urinary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Men with mild urinary problems
were advised to make lifestyle changes rather than visit doctors,
an Australian health advisory body said.
</P>
<P>
In draft guidelines released here today, the National Health
and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) said, 40 percent of men aged
over 45 years experienced problems with urination, ranging from
frequent visits to the toilet to incontinence.
</P>
<P>
But NHMRC working party chairman Geoffrey Hirst said the common
problems rarely caused any serious health problem and many men
unnecessarily worried that the symptoms indicated they had
prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
Hirst urged the Australian Government to launch an education
campaign to allay men's fears about prostate cancer and to
publicize lifestyle changes which could help to ease the urinary
problems.
</P>
<P>
Lifestyle changes recommended in the draft guidelines include
reducing fluid intake at specific times to reduce the need to go
to the toilet at inconvenient times, drinking less coffee, tea and
alcohol and using distraction techniques and mental tricks.
</P>
<P>
The draft guidelines said the patient's level of bothersome
symptoms was the best indicator of the need for treatment, and
doctors should put great emphasis on reassuring men worried about
developing prostate cancer.

<HEADLINE> Museum on Ho Chi Minh Trail to Be Built </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A museum on the legendary
2,000-kilometer-long Ho Chi Minh trail during the Vietnam war will
be built with the approval of Vietnam's defense ministry, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The museum is to be erected at a commune of Ha Tay province,
about 15 kilometers west of Hanoi, where most of the liberation
army units during the war were stationed before southward
operations along the Ho Chi Minh trail or Truong Son road.
</P>
<P>
The museum will serve as a center to study the history of the
Truong Son Army Unit and a tourist spot in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
As planned, the museum will have large-sized sections to house
paintings, reliefs and exhibits on the trail. It will also include
a huge model of the Truong Son Mountain and the trail.
</P>
<P>
The construction is due to begin in this October and will be
completed in late 1999 on the 40th anniversary of the Truong Son
Army Unit.
</P>
<P>
The Ho Chi Minh trail was a strategic supply route between the
the rear area in the north and the front line in the south of
Vietnam during the anti-U.S.war which ended in 1975.
</P>
<P>
It was first opened in early 1960 by a group of military
divisions known as Group 559 or the Truong Son Army Unit.
</P>
<P>
The trail runs zig-zag on both the eastern and western sides of
the Truong Son Mountain serving as a natural border between
Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Reports Good Livestock Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region has reported a good livestock output for 12 years running
thanks to the appliance of science and improved grasslands.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistical report shows that the region had 64
million head of livestock in stock by the end of June this year,
an increase of three million over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia is expected to produce 1.7 million tons of meat,
eggs and milk, and 63,000 tons of wool this year. The annual
income of herdsmen this year will average 1,900 yuan per capita.
</P>
<P>
Located in a high altitude and cold area in northern China,
Inner Mongolia is frequently hit by natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
To boost the output of livestock, the regional government has
employed a grassland contract responsibility system, which has
aroused herdsmen's enthusiasm in animal breeding.
</P>
<P>
It also has helped herdsmen to improve livestock-breeding
conditions, to learn skills, and to adjust their production in
line with the market needs.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the number of livestock in the region has remained
at 55 million head, and the output of fur and wool ranks first in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Financial Situation Favorable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has reported a smooth
financial situation for the past half year period, with the city's
position as the national financial center strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Bank deposits registered an increase of 50.6 billion yuan,
while the outstanding loans rose 19 billion, over the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
The individual savings deposits maintained a sharp increase
during this period, as the amount climbed 29 percent, or 36.7
billion yuan to 176.4 billion yuan at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
Removal of the anti-inflation interest rate, interest rate cut,
and the bullish securities market resulted in a stronger growth in
current deposits, which is conducive to the formation of direct
capital-raising channel.
</P>
<P>
The securities market in Shanghai reported a transaction volume
of 602 billion yuan during this period, 2.8 times last year's
figure.
</P>
<P>
The number of listed stocks hit 256 by the end of June, up 36
over last year, lifting the total market value more than 60
percent to 410 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
A total of 29.7 billion US dollars of foreign exchange were
traded during the January-June period, with the exchange rates
fluctuating within a reasonable range.
</P>
<P>
The total trading on the national inter-bank money market stood
at 127.6 billion yuan during this period.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, 180 foreign financial institutions have
opened branches or representative offices in Shanghai, with the
total assets of the 39 financial branches double last year's
amount to well over 10 billion US dollars, obtaining an 1.5
billion US dollar deposit and 7 billion US dollars of outstanding
loans.
</P>
<P>
For the past six months, Shanghai's position as the national
financial center was strengthened as a unified interbank money
market took shape, and the People's Bank of China has adopted open
market operation in the city's bond market.

<HEADLINE> Cultural Relics, Historical Records in Tibetan Temple (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- When did Tibet officially fall
under the administration or control of the Chinese government as a
region or province?
</P>
<P>
According to historians who have done researches at Sagya
Temple in eastern Tibet, it was about the middle of the 13th
century, at the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1386).
</P>
<P>
The temple, which is located 450 km west of Lhasa, has long
been about as renowned as the Dunhuang Grottoes in northwest
China's Gansu Province for its large collection of Buddhist
scriptures, valuable porcelains, and vivid wall paintings dating
back nearly a thousand years.
</P>
<P>
From Xigaze City west, it is hard to believe that Sagya County,
40 km southwest of Gazeul Mountain, was once the political and
cultural center of Tibet because of the bleak hills and barren
mountains.
</P>
<P>
In 1264, Kublai Khan, who founded the central administrative
power of Yuan Dynasty, unified Tibet and granted 13 Khri-skors
(administrative units each with 10,000 households) in Tibet to
Phagsba, Sakypa Dagchhen (head of the Sagya Sect), as a
tribute. The emperor also gave him a certificate and the
seal. Later, the Yuan emperor granted the three major parts of
Tibet (eastern and western Tibet and the Qamdo area) to Phagsba as
another tribute on the occasion of the second passing on of
Buddhist canons. Phagsba went back to Tibet in 1265 and took
power, and later appointed chieftain of the 13 Khri-skors as
rulers.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese records, Sagya Pandita's nephew Phagsba
went to see Kublai Khan in 1253. This young visitor pleased him so
much that as soon as he was made Khan he asked Phagsba to be his
spiritual guide, or national mentor, as a reward for his
adaptations of Tibetan and Brahman scripts to spoken Mongolian.

NANCHANG, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A wide-range air transport
network is being formed in Jiangxi province in east China, with
the provincial capital of Nanchang as its center.
</P>
<P>
An official with the provincial civil aviation authorities said
a total of 17 air routes are being operated to cities such
Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Xiamen, and the number

</P>

<P>
Three other airports in the province, in Jiujiang at the foot
of the famous Lushan Mountain, Jingdezhen and Ganzhou, have had
their telecommunications, navigation and instrumental landing
equipment improved to meet international standards. The three are
projected to handle 500,000 to 800,000 passengers by the end of
the century.

Phagsba made a series of laws and conducted a census before
setting up a regional government under the aegis of the Chinese
central government in 1268.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the 130,000 households to enlarge Sagya
Temple, with the aim of developing Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
Sagya Temple's appearance is that of a castle built in the
style of the Yuan Dynasty, with 10-meter-high stone walls, with
dozens of small blockhouses arranged along them, and a large
watchtower at each of the four corners.
</P>
<P>
The temple buildings are painted red, white, and black,
symbolizing the three great Buddhas -- Kwan Yin, Goddess of Mercy,
and two other deities.
</P>
<P>
The temple buildings are an interesting mixture of the styles
of the Han, and ethnic Mongolian and Tibetan minorities. The most
famous of them is the 5,500-sq.m. "Lakangqinmu" Palace, which is a
repository of 40,000 books containing Buddhist scriptures.
</P>
<P>
The books are stacked in three-meter by 20-meter cabinets. The
precious teachings were recorded by hand using a liquid mixture
compounded of gold, silver, cinnabar, and ink.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the temple also has an incredible collection of
manuscripts of Buddhist scriptures that are unique in the world,
printed on parchment made of Bodhi-tree leaves.
</P>
<P>
A significant number of the books in Sagya Temple's collection
of Buddhist scriptures were printed by Beijing's Religious
Printing House in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and were carried to
Tibet under the protection of military forces from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In fact, these kinds of Buddhist books can be found everywhere
in the temple. According to an old Tibetan proverb: "The temple
wall may tumble down, but the books still stand."

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto today showed her confidence in maintaining the
political stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the nation here on the occasion of the 49th
Independence Day of Pakistan, Bhutto said, "some people are trying
to spread despair and disappointment in the country, but they are
bound to fail."
</P>
<P>
"It is unfair to create artificial crisis to grab power," she
stressed, adding that although the opposition has a role in the
democratic system, it should wait till the next election.
</P>
<P>
Benazir Bhutto, who assumed the premiership in October, 1993,
through election, has a five-year tenure according to the
Pakistani Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto criticized the present opposition leader Nawaz Sharif
for fomenting instability in the country through agitation.
</P>
<P>
"They plan to resort to politics of strikes and intend to stir
confusion between the government and the judiciary, armed forces
and the President," she said.
</P>
<P>
"But people of Pakistan will foil their designs," she noted,
adding that the sound economic and diplomatic situation had united
people around her government.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani armed forces have performed their role laudably
and have always been found ready to combat any foreign aggression
or put out internal terrorism, she said.
</P>
<P>
"The era of dictatorship is over and the rigged polls are
gone," she stressed, adding, "now Pakistan has shown to the world
that it has succeeded in establishing democracy in the country."

There is also a large collection of historical relics in the
temple, including imperial edicts of Chinese emperors, scripts
from the imperial court, and a variety of utensils for temple use.
</P>
<P>
The temple's greatest treasure is a gigantic conch which was
given to Phagsba by the Yuan emperor. The conch is stored in a
black box and is only used for the Dharma-Ghosa on significant
occasions.
</P>
<P>
The temple is also renowned for its Buddhist sculptures and
frescoes which record the legend of Phagsba, working scenes of
ethnic artists while they were building the temple, and religious
tales.
</P>
<P>
According to the frescoes, the popular Hada, a silk scarf
presented as a token of respect by Tibetans, was first used by the
Han people as a symbol of the Great Wall, and was brought to Tibet
by Phagsba.
</P>
<P>
The frescoes are evidence that clearly shows the subordinate
relationship of Tibet to the Chinese central government
historically.
</P>
<P>
A monk told Xinhua that no relics had ever been stolen there
and nor had any fires and other destructions occurred there
thanks to the good and meticulous care they were given.
</P>
<P>
"The temple has been under state-level protection since 1961
and is historical evidence of China's unification," he said.

<HEADLINE> Another 350 Civilians Released by Rebels in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, Aug 14 (Xinhua) -- Over 350 civilians were released
by rebel forces on Tuesday at Sierra Leone's second largest city
of Bo while peace talks were still going on, military sources
confirmed here today.
</P>
<P>
This put the total number of released civilians to 1,110, said
the officials. Earlier, on Monday, over 750 civilians had been
released by Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels.
</P>
<P>
The civilians, mostly women and children, were ferried across
the Sewa River in dugout canoes from an RUF base at Nyama village
to the towns of Baoma, Yamandu and Gerihun near Bo.
</P>
<P>
Relief workers who are offering humanitarian assistance to the
refugees said the released civilians appeared malnourished and
sick while they were screened by security officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Information Minister George Thomas was quoted today
by state radio as saying that surrendered rebels "should have no
fear of being prosecuted" by the government.
</P>
<P>
"The government is strongly committed to restoring peace and
prosecuting RUF rebels is not on the agenda," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"We are avoiding all actions that would send the wrong signals
to RUF rebels in the bush," he added, saying that peace talks
were still going on between the government and the RUF rebels.
</P>
<P>
Both were seeking a final solution to the five-year-old war
experienced by the west African country.

<HEADLINE> Palang Dharma Party Urged to Reconsider Its </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa said today that his coalition government will continue
to function despite the withdrawal of the Palang Dharma party.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Palang Dharma party to reconsider its decision to
quit the seven-party coalition.
</P>
<P>
Thaksin Shinawatra, leader of Palang Dharma, this morning
announced his party's withdrawal from Banharn's government and
distributed to reporters copies of a letter which was delivered to
the prime minister around midnight last night.
</P>
<P>
Thaksin gave no reason for the pullout but said that
considering the interests of the whole people the party leadership
believed that under the present circumstances it was no longer
suitable for the party to stay on in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Palang Dharma party was not happy with
Banharn's failure on Tuesday to approve bank license applications
made by three business groups and reference of the matter to the
finance minister.
</P>
<P>
Palang Dharma, which had hoped that Banharn would push ahead
the matter, complained that the cabinet's position on the matter
was unclear and that Banharn procrastinates on serious economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet on Tuesday decided to leave the bank license
approval process to the finance minister after Justice Minister
Chalerm Yubamrung alleged that the three business groups applying
for bank licenses had each paid 750 million baht (30 million US
dollars) as kickbacks to get their license.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Thaksin was pushing the matter because his
brother-in-law is a shareholder in one of the three groups.
</P>
<P>
Key opposition MPs said that Palang Dharma's withdrawal
signifies that the Banharn government has come to a time that
changes must be made.
</P>
<P>
Palang Dharma's pullout left the government with six parties,
with a total of 209 seats in the 391-seats house of
representatives.

<HEADLINE> Clothing Costs Expected To Go Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The cost of clothing across
China is expected to go up by almost 50 percent this year, a new
survey has shown.
</P>
<P>
In urban areas, residents will be spending 45.71 percent more
on clothing, and those in rural areas, an increase of 56.58
percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that this is mainly due to improved living
standards in rural areas and the fact that peasants are tending to
buy clothing instead of buying cloth and making clothes themselves.
</P>
<P>
Few people like polyester products, with 47.86 percent of urban
and rural consumers tending to choose pure cotton clothing, 35.31
percent, cotton blends, and 15.04 percent, wool products.
</P>
<P>
Analysts think that consumers have become more "picky" with the
variety of goods now available and are not much interested in
so-so items. Fashionable, comfortable, and stylish clothing is the
most popular.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that per capita spending on clothing in 1995
was 16 percent more than the previous year's figure, reaching 568
billion yuan (about 68.4 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
China plans to produce 10 billion items of clothing in the next
five years and clothing purchases per capita will increase to 2.9
pieces from the current 1.8.

SHANGHAI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Ten penguins from the Japanese
city of Kyodo are spending Shanghai's hot summer comfortably in
the water with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Zoo in the western part of the China's biggest city
has improved its living facilities for the animals with support
from various social groups.
</P>
<P>
The activity of adopting animals in 1992 highlighted Shanghai
residents' affection for animals, and provided the zoo with a
large pool of funding.
</P>
<P>
Among 450 species of animals in the zoo, more than 40 kinds of
rare animals including pumas, zebras, red-crowned cranes, giant
pandas, sea lions have already been adopted.
</P>
<P>
Social groups, including American, Canadian, Thai and Hong
Kong's joint-ventures, are providing for the adopted animals and
investing in the scientific studies of the animals.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the well managed zoo, the animals are all enjoying an
easy life in spite of the summer heat, and have attracted large
groups of domestic and foreign tourists.

<HEADLINE> 20th Anniversary of TAZARA Commencement Marked in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The last 20 years have been
monentous for the Tazania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA) and
the raiway has now start to forge forward aggressively and making
profits, though modest, thanks to the efforts and determination
of all TAZARA workers, including our evergreen Chinese friends.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Zambian Minister of Transport and
Communication D. L. Lupunga in his message on TAZARA's 20th
anniversary. The message was made public here today.
</P>
<P>
Lupunga said that ''Over the past 20 years, i am delighted to
report that TAZARA transported about 20 million tons of cargo''
thanks to the efforts of the workers, management and the board of
directors of TAZARA who have done a good work to enable the
railway to servive.
</P>
<P>
However, TAZARA in the past 10 years has experienced a decline
in traffic performance mainly due to political changes in South
Africa and intensified competition from other modes and in
particular raod transportation systems because of the open market
economic policies in both countries and the rest of the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
''It is important for all of us to reflect on our achievements
and also assess the work that lies ahead of us. Only in this way
shall we be able to plan coherently for our work, as our tasks
ahead are heavy,'' Lupunga said.
</P>
<P>
''The importance of TAZARA extends beyong the borders of
Tanzania and Zambia. It is a special railway right from the
beginning. This is a SADC (southern african development
community) project which is designed to increase not only the
economic independence of Tanzania and Zambia, but also that of
all southern and central African states,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
The railway, built with Chinese aid 20 years ago, obviously is
going to face hard time in the future. It is expected that
competition for trafic will intensify. Various measures are being
taken and these are mainly under the umbrella of the TAZARA
commercialization, a restructuring program which aims at
transforming the organizatin into a commercially viable
institution.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Stand on Drive Against Business Kickbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Thailand wants to see details of
a proposed international agreement against business kickbacks
before deciding where it stands.
</P>
<P>
A report on the issue, prepared by the United Nations Economic
and Social Council, is scheduled for discussion by the UN General
Assembly later this year.
</P>
<P>
The council's report follows a proposal by the United States
last year for an agreement to counter illegal payments made to
clinch international contracts. The Americans want to protect
their investment and ward off competition.
</P>
<P>
But the assembly called for the report as Japan and some
eastern European countries opposed the idea.
</P>
<P>
According to a source of the Thai Commerce Ministry, Thailand
wanted to see the report before adopting a position. The Thai
government also wanted to follow progress on the issue at other
international forums, particularly the World Trade Organization
(WTO) which is considering a proposal to study business
corruption.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has pressed for an international agreement at the UN
and through the WTO, but Thailand was likely to join other ASEAN
members in voting against the proposal, the source said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN members also object to the U.S. proposal for the WTO to
agree on fighting business corruption.
</P>
<P>
It was not certain the report would be accepted by the
assembly, the source said, adding even if it were accepted, UN
members were not bound by it.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Deflation shows its face in France with the prices of fresh
vegetables, energy products, clothes, televisions and housework
equipments lowering in July. This deflation, however, reflects the
state of extreme languor of the French economy, which has been
confirmed by other economic indicators such as unemployment,
growth and investment.
</P>
<P>
-- The Implementing Force (IFOR) in Bosnia have tried twice in
the past few weeks to capture Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic, who has become an invisible man in Pale.
</P>
<P>
-- Jack Kemp has been charged with the job of winning back the
support of American women, who are inclined towards Bill Clinton.
Meanwhile, Colin Powell has become the new centering point of the
Republican Party with his calls for social justice and against all
kinds of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The policy of rapprochement adopted by Turkey towards Iran
and Iraq is worrying Western countries. The United States has
condemned an important gas contract signed between Ankara and
Teheran during the visit by Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan to Iran last week. Meanwhile, a ministerial delegation of
Turkey is in Baghdad for restoring political and economic ties
with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
-- The German economy is showing bad figures with government
budget deficit amounting to 44.63 billion marks (30 billion U.S.
dollars) in the first seven months this year. Federal spendings so
far this year have risen by 14.4 percent while state revenues
increased by only 5.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Germany's state debts rose from 1,000 billion marks (658
billion dollars) in 1990 to 2,000 billion marks (1,316 billion
dollars) in 1995. A lowering of interest rates by German banks
and an increase of taxes by the government are expected to
alleviate the pressure.

<P>
BANGKOK, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Palang Dharma (virtue force)
party has again resolved to pull out of Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa's seven-party coalition government over dispute on
awarding bank licenses.
</P>
<P>
The party's decision, made last night in protest at what the
party termed as an 'ambiguous' decision of the cabinet, is
expected to be made public today.
</P>
<P>
After a tense, four-hour meeting on Tuesday, the cabinet
'acknowledged the Finance Ministry's selection process' of bank
license applications by three business groups and decided to set
up an investigatory panel to look into bribery allegations by
Justice Minister Chalerm Yubamrung.
</P>
<P>
Chalerm alleged before the cabinet meeting that the three
business groups had each paid 750 million baht (30 million US
dollars) as kickbacks to get their bank license applications
approved.
</P>
<P>
Palang Dharma party had wanted the prime minister to push ahead
with the licenses, rather than leaving the matter to the finance
minister to decide.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Thaksin Shinawatra, leader of Palang
Dharma, wanted the prime minister to push ahead with the approval
of the licenses because his brother-in-law was a shareholder in
one of the applicant group.
</P>
<P>
Palang Dharma sources said Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa
had failed to take a clear position on serious economic problems
and that his procrastination on the bank license issue made
matters worse.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Bankers Encouraged To Open Branches in Hainan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The governor of south China's
Hainan province, Ruan Chongwu, says that the special economic zone
island will welcome Taiwanese banks with open arms to increase
ways of raising funds for Taiwanese businesses there.
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese bankers are welcome to start branches or financial
companies in the province, said Governor Ruan during a meeting
with a Taiwanese business delegation recently. He said that the
move will help increase financial support for economic
co-operation.
</P>
<P>
"The two islands can have a wide range of co-operation in
tropical agriculture, processing, and tourism, combining Hainan's
natural resources and market potential with Taiwan's advanced
technology and capital," he said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese investors have had high economic yields in investing
in Hainan's tropical agriculture, and there is still great
potential in its fledging processing of natural gas, natural
rubber, and aquatic products.

<HEADLINE> Motion Of Planets Related To Rise And Fall Of Human Civilization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Were the fall of the Roman
Empire and the outbreak of the French Revolution decided by any
astrological events?
</P>
<P>
Although that sounds ridiculous, there could in fact be a sort
of connection between the planets' motion and catastrophes that
have befallen civilizations on the earth, according to scientists
at the 30th International Geological Congress.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Xu Daoyi of the Geological Institute of the State
Seismological Bureau, and Prof. Wang Erkang of Nanjing University,
told the congress that when the earth is on one side of the sun
and the eight other planets are on the sun's other side and at a
field angle of less than 70 degrees with the earth, the resultant
movement of the nine planets will exert a very strong influence on
the environment of the earth.
</P>
<P>
Research shows that six major periods of natural disasters
occurred immediately after such planetary movement in winter, and
three or four of the most serious catastrophes ever occured were
accompanied by planetary movement with a field angle of less than
47 degrees, such as those which occurred around 2000 B.C., 1000
B.C. and in the 17th century A.D.
</P>
<P>
These catastrophes involved the disappearance of nomads in the
Sahara Desert, the collapse of Cretan and other ancient Aegian
civilizations and the outbreak of the French Revolution, with the
latter characterized by continuous drops in grain output.
</P>
<P>
A planetary angle of less than 70 degrees around the fifth
century A.D. resulted in a rare cold climatic change, which drove
nomadic nations southward, and the Roman Empire and China's Jin
Dynasty were both overthrown by nomadic invaders.
</P>
<P>
According to scientists, the earth revolves around the mass at
the center of the solar system, but not the sun as the core, and
the mass at the center deviates from that of the sun when the nine
planets simultaneously gather to one side, resulting in a change
in the radius of the earth's revolution.
</P>
<P>
If the resulting planetary movement happens in winter, the
winter months will be longer, while the summer is shortened,
causing a sharp drop in mean temperature all over the world.
</P>
<P>
K. Yanai, a Japanese researcher, also told the congress that
the smaller the field angle of the planetary movement, the colder
the global climate becomes.
</P>
<P>
He said that besides the nine planets' movement, the cycles of
other astronomical bodies also have a remarkable effect on the
natural environment of the earth, and a change in the earth's
rotation velocity and orbit, as well as the position changes of
the solar system in the galaxy, are possible external causes of
natural disasters on our planet.

<HEADLINE> China's January-July Tax Revenue up 22.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING,August 14 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial and commercial
tax revenue rose 22.4 percent year-on-year to 354.4 billion yuan
(about 42.7 billion US dollars) in the first seven months of this
year, the State Administration of Taxation said.
</P>
<P>
The revenue represented 58.8 percent of this year's national
target, according to SAT. The administration admitted that
problems exist though the overall level of tax collection is good.
</P>
<P>
In July, China collected 54.8 billion yuan in industrial and
commercial taxes, up 22.5 percent over the same month of last
year.
</P>
<P>
SAT said that tax collection was imbalanced between different
areas, with the year-on-year monthly increase rate standing over
30 percent in the northern Inner Mongolia and northwestern
Xinjiang autonomous regions, the provinces of Jilin, Shandong,
Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan and the cities of Shanghai, Harbin,
Qingdao, Wuhan and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing and the provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi and
Gansu, and the cities of Xiamen and Chongqing, the industrial and
commercial tax revenue grew less than 10 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
In the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous region, south China, and south
China's Hainan Province, the monthly tax revenue continued to drop
in July, both at a rate of 4.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Rapid growth in delayed tax payments by enterprises is an
outstanding problem so far this year, SAT said, pointing to the
fact that back tax payments by the end of July almost doubled the
figure at the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
"As the economic efficiency of state-owned enterprises keeps
deteriorating, our task to collect back taxes is extremely hard
this year," SAT said.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, serious flooding in Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang,
Guizhou and Anhui provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in the past months has produced a fairly great adverse
impact on tax collection in the areas, SAT added.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we must not be too optimistic about tax
collection," SAT warned, urging taxation departments nationwide to
make greater efforts to ensure that this year's tax target will
not slip out of reach.
</P>
<P>
SAT also said that tax rebates to exporters were valued at 6.38
billion yuan last month, up 99 percent over a year ago. The total
amount for the January-July period was up 31.3 percent over the
same 1995 period to 48.2 billion yuan, which is 74.2 percent of
this year quota.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Economy Shows Mixed Trend Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's economy showed a mixed
trend during the last fiscal year with the restrained money
supply, curbed inflation and a rising budget deficit, the
country's central bank said.
</P>
<P>
Inflation had been contained within one digit during the
1995-96 fiscal year that ended in mid-July, as a result of the
policy of monetary restraint, Nepal Rastra Bank said in a Tuesday
report on the country's macro-economic situation.
</P>
<P>
The price index was 9.2 percent in mid-July 1996, against
nearly 8 percent at the end of the previous fiscal year, it said.
</P>
<P>
Money supply during 1995-96 grew by nine percent as against
15.6 percent the previous year.
</P>
<P>
However, no marked improvement was noticed in the country's
overall fiscal condition, said the bank.
</P>
<P>
The country's total expenditure during the period rose by 14.7
percent to an equivalent of nearly 670 million US dollars, with
regular and development items up 11.2 and 16.8 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The higher growth in expenditure and a relatively lower growth
rate of revenue mobilization have resulted in a fiscal deficit of
146 million dollars, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The public revenue mobilization has fallen marginally short of
the target of 25 percent growth mainly due to the reduced rate of
import growth.
</P>
<P>
Total imports in the last fiscal year increased by 17 percent
against 27 percent the previous year, with a trade deficit of
about one billion dollars, representing a 19 percent rise as
compared with the 47 percent increase the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown of the growth of the trade deficit also was a
result of the improved performance of the country's export sector,
which exported 360 million dollars worth of goods in 1995-96, an
increase of 11 percent. In comparison, the country's exports
declined by 7.2 percent during the previous fiscal year, the
central bank said.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Implement Stricter Sanitary Standards for Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Health Ministry may
implement new sanitary standards for livestock slaughter in
October to safeguard meat from poisoning by the O-157 bacteria,
Kyodo News Service quoted ministry officials as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A study group of the Health and Welfare Ministry will draw up
guidelines in September to revise regulations of the relevant law,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The law would require 333 slaughterhouses throughout the
country to use bacteria-proof methods of butchering carcasses, to
inspect for bacteria in every stage of processing the meat and to
maintain detailed records, they said.
</P>
<P>
The new standards will be modeled after a U.S. hazard control
system for manufacturing food for space flights, they said.
</P>
<P>
The study group, which was set up in June, was supposed to map
out guidelines for meat in about one year, but decided to hasten
its work as food poisoning blamed on the O-157 strain of E. coli
bacteria spread, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The O-157 colon bacillus originally inhabits cattle intestines
and has been detected in about 0.2 percent of the livestock
examined in a previous ministry inspection, they said.
</P>
<P>
The latest outbreak of the O-157 food poisoning has claimed
nine lives and made more than 9,000 people ill nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Labor Disputes on the Rise in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, AUGUST 14 (Xinhua) -- The implementation of a Labor
Law has resulted in a substantial increase in the number of cases
involving labor disputes across China, according to the Ministry
of Labor.
</P>
<P>
China's Labor Law came into force on January 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that labor arbitration departments
throughout the country handled 23,000 cases involving labor
disputes in 1995, up 73 percent from 1994.
</P>
<P>
Courts handled 28,285 such cases last year, and another 18,118
cases in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Before the Labor Law went into effect, courts handled some
10,000 such cases on average a year.
</P>
<P>
According to Labor Minister Li Boyong, the Labor Law is
designed to protect the legitimate rights and interests or
laborer's, and advance stable and harmonious labor relations.
</P>
<P>
The law has been well received by employees and employers, he
said, adding that all of them now have the law to turn to for the
protection of their own rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
Employees and employers both have increased their awareness and
ability to protect their own rights and interests according to
law, he said.
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to labor disputes, an increasing number of
people seek arbitration, or go to courts for a solution," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, a major factor that has caused a sharp rise in
the number of cases involving labor disputes is that a number of
foreign-funded companies, private firms and township-run
enterprises seriously infringe on laborers' rights and interests.

<TEXT>
<P>
State-owned enterprises scored a 30 percent increase in such
cases in 1993 from 1992, whereas collectively-owned businesses
reported a 700 percent surge, and foreign-funded companies chalked
up a 600 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
According to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the
number of labor disputes between a group of workers and employers
has also shown a tendency toward a substantial increase over the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
There were 25,000 such cases in 1995, 74.6 percent more than in
1994, The cases involved 450,000 workers, up nearly 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guoxiang, vice-chairman of the All-Federation of Trade
Unions, said, "The rise in the number of cases involving labor
disputes, particularly those involving disputes between a group of
workers and the employer, has adversely affected the country's
economic growth, and caused many unstable factors as well."
</P>
<P>
Most cases involving labor disputes are caused by enterprises
breaking the Labor laws.
</P>
<P>
Labor departments, trade unions organizations, courts and other
departments are trying hard, and will continue to tighten
supervision over labor relations between employees and employers,
in a bid to reduce labor disputes and make sure that labor
disputes are solved fairly.
</P>
<P>
To date, 29 provincial-level and 2,800 county-level labor
supervisory departments have been set up throughout China. A
nationwide labor supervisory network is forming.
</P>
<P>
In handling cases involving labor disputes, courts at all
levels try to protect laborers' rights and interests so as to
facilitate the establishment of a new labor system under a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's
Congress, China's legislature, will soon send groups to all parts
of the country to look into the implementation of the Labor Law.

<HEADLINE> Xianyang Discovered Head Bone Fossil of Hairy Rhinoceros </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Head bone fossils of a hairy
rhinoceros, which became extinct 10,000 years ago, have been
discovered in Xianyang, in northwest China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The fossil is 83cm in length, with the biggest tooth weighing
22 kg, 5cm in length, and 10cm in width. A piece of "water
buffalo" head bone fossil, 1.5 meter in length and weighing 25 kg,
was also found in the area.
</P>
<P>
"It was the first time for such well-preserved head bone
fossils to be discovered in Shaanxi province," said Professor Xue
Xiangxi from Northwest University, who reached the conclusion
after she made an on-the-spot investigation of the fossils.
</P>
<P>
The hairy rhinoceros lived in a cold environment, but the
"water buffalo" used to live in a warm and humid climate. How
could the two animals with different living conditions co-exist in
the same area during the ancient time? The question aroused
scientists' interest.
</P>
<P>
Solving it will have a great significance for ancient-times
climate and environment research.

LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A ban on the private possession of handguns in Britain
appeared inevitable on August 13 after the Government let it be
known that it is ready to overrule Tory MPs who have opposed
prohibition and Labor promised laws to prevent people from having
firearms in their homes.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The overwhelming majority of postal workers want a ballot to
express their views on the pay and productivity deal rejected by
their union's executive committee, Royal Mail said on August 13 on
the eve of today's latest 24-hour stoppage of the postal service.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Supporters of the traditional family on August 13 threatened
to disown new school guidelines on moral teaching unless stronger
emphasis is given to the value of lifelong, heterosexual marriage.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- British men and women are drinking too much, and children
are still taking up smoking, in spite of the Government's targets
to make Britain a healthier nation.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Ministers are considering a manifesto examination pledge to
change the examination board system after a further sharp
improvement in the A level pass rate, due to be announced on
August 15. One option might be to amalgamate the four English
boards to dispel fears of head teachers choosing boards likely to
give the highest results.

<HEADLINE> Workshop on Rehabilitation of Displaced Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A four-day workshop opened
here yesterday to discuss situations of Ethiopia's displaced families
and street children and ways to resolve problems facing the displaced
people.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, Ethiopian Minister of Labour and
Social Affairs Hassan Abdela said that armed conflicts, political
unrest, economic stagnation, drought associated with famine had
left millions of families in Africa in abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
It is easy to see the presence of significant number of
destitute families roaming the streets of biggest towns in
Ethiopia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdela said that despite the absence of relevant information
on the exact size of displaced or dislocated people in the
country, the total number of such families is estimated at around
278,386.
</P>
<P>
He called upon all government and non-government
organizations, the united nations system and civil organizations
"to join hands in the effort to rehabilitate and reintegrate the
victim".

<P>
URUMQI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese mountaineer, who
became critically ill while scaling a mountain in northwest China,
is climbing back to good health, thanks to the Chinese army.
</P>
<P>
Tsutomu Watanabe, leader of a Japanese mountaineering party,
suddenly took seriously ill with stomach pains and fell into
unconsciousness on August 1. At that time he and his partners were
climbing Mount Muztagata in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Tsutomu was immediately sent to the No. 12 Ground Force Hospital
situated in Kashi, located in the western part of the region.
</P>
<P>
Matanabe was diagnosed as having a hemorrhage of the
gastrointestinal tract, and he became better after two day's
treatment.
</P>
<P>
But several days later, Matanabe took a turn for the worse,
losing a large amount of blood to less than one-fourth of normal
amount body level. The patient suffered from severe shock many times.
</P>
<P>
Several dozens Chinese army men with the same blood type
as Matanabe were called to the hospital and donated 2,000 ml
of blood for the patient.
</P>
<P>
Matanabe and his relatives all felt grateful for the selfless
spirit of the Chinese army men.

<HEADLINE> Internet Users in S'pore to Have Only Filtered Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Internet users in Singapore
will have only filtered access to the global computer network
starting from September 15, a measure the government takes to curb
objectionable contents on the net, the Straits Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
It said the date of September 15 is the deadline for the net
users to link their computers to special computers, called proxy
servers, at their Internet Service Provider's (ISP) end.
</P>
<P>
These servers will block access to sites which the Singapore
Broadcasting Authority (SBA) deemed objectionable, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Proxy servers are computers used mainly to speed up access to
the Internet users. They store or cache a database of
often-accessed material locally, it said.
</P>
<P>
A user's request for foreign-based material does not mean
sending an electronic request abroad to fetch it. It can be served
locally and this can cut access time by almost half.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the report said, proxy servers can also be
used as filters to block unwanted sites. They do this by checking
a user's request against a list of unwanted sites before granting
him access.
</P>
<P>
Many Internet users were concerned that the filtering would
lead to slow access, the Straits Times said, adding that 10 of 12
users it contacted shared this concern.
</P>
<P>
One expert agreed with some surfers, who noted that access time
might rise if the list against which proxy servers must check
became very big. But "at the moment, I don't see the filtering
process having an impact on the rate of access as the number of
blocked sites is still low," the expert was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
On the concern that proxy servers would retard access speed, a
Singapore Broadcasting Authority spokesman said, "Our objective is
not to slow down or impede the performance of the proxy servers.
We will hold regular discussions with the ISPs and will work with
them to monitor the performance of the servers."

<HEADLINE> New China Floods: Yellow River, So Far So Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- China's second longest river,
the Yellow River, has been hit by two major floods. But they have
caused no major damage, said a report by the State Flood-Control
And Drought-Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The record flood peak, measuring 94.73 meters, took place on
August 5. The second flood this month occured yesterday. Its peak
stood at 94.12 meters occured at three o'clock yesterday morning.
</P>
<P>
The two floods happened because of continuous heavy rain in the
area of the middle reaches of the Yellow River since the beginning
of the month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, heavy rain has pushed the water level of the Fengman
Reservoir in Northeast China to 261.55 meters, 1.05 meters higher
than danger level.
</P>
<P>
The water levels of the tributaries of the Haihe River, which
flow through Hebei Province and the coastal city of Tianjin, are
dropping slowly.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the Yangtze in its middle and lower reaches,
as well as the water levels of China's two biggest fresh water
lakes, Dongting and Boyang, are also dropping. However, their
water levels still stand 0.5-1.5 meters above alarm levels.
</P>
<P>
The flood-control headquarters started releasing reports on the
flood situation of China's major rivers and lakes in late June,
when the concentrated and heavy rain season began.

<HEADLINE> Developed Countries Urged to End Over-Consumption of Minerals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Big eaters in the western world
were warned today that the "banquet" will never last for ever.
</P>
<P>
Shortages of food and resources are likely to pose 21st century
problems for humans, rather than wars, the closing session of the
10-day 30th International Geological Congress heard today in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Robin Brett, newly elected President of International Union of
Geological Sciences, said in the closing address, that the major
problem facing the world over coming decades will be the world's
excessive consumption of food, minerals and fossil fuel resources.
</P>
<P>
Robin Brett claimed that during the next 20 to 30 years, the
world's major problems will be excessive consumption of resources
and population growth rather than wars, human rights and poverty.
</P>
<P>
He said, the developed world, especially North America,
consumes many more times its share of food, minerals and fossil
fuel resources. He said that gluttonous eaters cannot be wholly
blamed as they are not sufficiently educated to know about future
needs and think that the "banquet will never end".
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is high time to end the excessive
consumption, or people will pay the price for what they have done
in a period of time.
</P>
<P>
Robin Brett said the foundations of a solid economy are
minerals, water and fossil fuel resources. Countries have gone to
war for those three resources.
</P>
<P>
The developed countries can use fewer resources and the
developing world can impose tougher environmental standards in
extraction of resources. Geologists can help to improve the
environment and find water, fossil fuels and minerals, the
geologist suggested.
</P>
<P>
With the increasing world population, he said, the damage of
natural disasters for humankind has been increasing and the
resources become more difficult to find as well. Thus geology is
becoming much more important.
</P>
<P>
Robin Brett finally called on geologists to popularize
geological sciences and provide more information to the public.

<HEADLINE> Palang Dharma Party Quits Thai Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa said today that his coalition government will continue
to function despite the withdrawal of the Palang Dharma Party.
</P>
<P>
Banharn urged the Palang Dharma Party to reconsider its
decision to quit the seven-party coalition.
</P>
<P>
Thaksin Shinawatra, leader of Palang Dharma, announced his
party's withdrawal from Banharn's government earlier in the day
and distributed to reporters copies of a letter which was
delivered to the prime minister around midnight last night.
</P>
<P>
Thaksin gave no reason for the pullout. He only said that
considering the interests of the whole people, the party
leadership believed that under the present circumstances it was no
longer suitable for the party to stay on in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Palang Dharma was not happy with Banharn's
failure on Tuesday to approve bank license applications made by
three business groups and reference of the matter to the finance
minister.
</P>
<P>
Palang Dharma, which had hoped that Banharn would push ahead
the matter, complained that the cabinet's position on the matter
was unclear and that Banharn procrastinates on serious economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet on Tuesday decided to leave the bank license
approval process to the finance minister after Justice Minister
Chalerm Yubamrung alleged that the three business groups applying
for bank licenses had each paid 750 million baht (30 million U.S.
dollars) as kickbacks to get their license.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Thaksin was pushing the matter because his
brother-in-law is a shareholder in one of the three groups.
</P>
<P>
Key opposition MPs said that Palang Dharma's withdrawal showed
that the Banharn government has come to a time that changes must
be made.
</P>
<P>
Palang Dharma's pullout left the government with six parties,
with a total of 209 seats in the 391-member House of
Representatives.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank yesterday said
Zimbabwe's domestic debt is growing at a faster rate than its
foreign debt and called for the government to implement
appropriate fiscal policies to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Adressing students and lecturers at Africa University in east
Zimbabwe, World Bank's Deputy Representative to Zimbabwe, Kapil
Kapoor, said that excessive domestic borrowing was threatening
the growth of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Part of the government's problem which has pushed it into
borrowing from the domestic market is its failure to manage the
budget deficit, which soared to 10.1 percent of the Gross
Domestic Product during the year ended in June 1996,he said.
</P>
<P>
At the start of its first phase of the economic reforms
program, the government accepted targets set by donors which were aimed
at reducing budget deficit from 10 percent of the GDP to five
percent by the end of the program.
</P>
<P>
But, it had failed to meet the targets, resulting in budget
deficit exceeding 10 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Kapoor said while the interest rate on foreign debt during
the past 12 months declined from seven percent to two percent,
interest rate on domestic debt went up to 18 percent from 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the rate of growth of Zimbabwe's domestic debt
made it imperative for the government to serious consider ways of
reducing its borrowing from the domestic money market to finance
its expenditure, he said.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the problem of the escalation of domestic debt
growth, Kapoor suggested that the government needs to put into place
the right fiscal policies which would result in reduced the
government spending to bring down interest rates and inflation
which currently is around 24 percent.

<HEADLINE> Israel Alarmed by Threat of New Hezbollah Rockets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Mayors in northern Israel
today demanded an urgent meeting with Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai following reports that Hezbollah have acquired new
rockets with a range of 40 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Army Chief of Staff Amnon Lipkin Shahak Tuesday told
the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee
that Hezbollah (Party of God) in south Lebanon had received new
Katyusha rockets from Iran and thus posed a "significant threat" to
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
He warned that a greater number of Israeli targets in the
north, including towns like Akko and Karmiel, are now within the
reach of the rockets, which have doubled the firing range of the
conventional ones.
</P>
<P>
The towns in northern Israel were alarmed by this report and
their mayors demanded the government to take new measures to
ensure the safety of the residents there.
</P>
<P>
Ari de Castro, Mayor of Akko, was quoted by Israel Radio as
saying that the government should provide new aid to the northern
towns to build more shelters. He and other mayors of the northern
towns asked Mordechai to hold an urgent meeting with them to
discuss their security needs.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Karmiel Mayor Adi Eldar complained that the city
had not been notified by the government of the new threat from
Hezbollah. But he said that Karmiel, with a population of 40,000,
"is a relatively new city and we are very prepared as most public
buildings and homes have shelters."
</P>
<P>
According to Shahak's statements, Hezbollah has stockpiled a
large quantity of new rockets and ammunitions throughout the
villages in south Lebanon. He accused Iran of providing training
for Hezbollah and Syria of giving instructions to Hezbollah to
resume attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
"If they (Hezbollah) try to attack, it is likely that there
will be hits in the settlements in the north ... They have the
stamina for many, many days of battle," Shahak warned.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah recently escalated attacks against Israeli soldiers
in south Lebanon, though they have not fired any more Katyusha
rockets since a ceasefire deal was signed late April after
Israel's Operation Grapes of Wrath.
</P>
<P>
The 17-day massive military operation, launched to retaliate
for the Hezbollah's Katyusha rocket attacks on northern Israel,
killed over 200 people and wounded 400 others. But it failed to
eliminate the Hezbollah attacks against Israeli targets in south
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Two Foreign Finance Leasing Companies Set Up in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Two foreign-funded finance leasing
companies have been set up in Vietnam under a decision of the
governor of the state bank, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
One is the Vietnam International Finance Leasing Company with a
total capital of 5 million U.S. dollars jointly contributed by the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of Vietnam (19 percent), the
International Finance Corporation (15 percent), the Nippon Credit
Bank Ltd. of Japan, the Korea Industry Leasing Company (32
percent), and the Banque Francaise Commerciale (17 percent).
</P>
<P>
The other is Vietnam Kexin Finance Leasing Company which has a
capital of 10 million U.S. dollars from the Export-Import Bank of
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The two companies will begin operation in late 1996, and will
support the economic development in Vietnam by leasing machinery
and equipment to local enterprises who lack capital to develop
production.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Vietnam's Foreign Trade Bank and Agriculture Bank
established their own finance leasing companies. These companies
lease drilling machines, cement packaging line, industrial sewing
machines and other equipment to enterprises.

<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Focusing on its best assets --
seaports, fish, scenery and oil, East Chin's Zhejiang province
plans to build itself into a "maritime Economic giant" in the next
15 years, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
In the following five years, the province plans to set up three
sorts of bases in the East china Sea: for ocean breeding,
production and processing of seafood and medicine, and oceanology
research and experimentation, according to a document co-issued
recently by the province's ocean administration bureau and science
and technology committee.
</P>
<P>
And on Zhejiang's many islands, various types of services will
soon be established -- consultation in science and technology,
support services for producing, supplying and selling goods, and
safety precautions and insurance for development.
</P>
<P>
Scientists in the province will also strive to make advances in
eight technological fields: long-distance fishing and ocean
breeding, maritime gas and oil retrieval, engineering, use of sea
water, biological technology, use of ocean power, prevention of
maritime disasters, and improvements in remote sensing.
</P>
<P>
"Through our efforts, science and hi-tech factor will
contribute over 50 percent to the increase in our oceanic
industrial output by the turn of this century," said an official
with the provincial ocean administration bureau, adding the output
of Zhejiang's ocean industries will top 30 billion yuan (3.6
billion US dollars) in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Boasting 3,061 islands with more than 6,500 kilometers of
combined coastlines, Zhejiang has more than 500 berths and 58
seaports with links to more than 200 overseas ports.

<HEADLINE> Israel Cautiously Optimistic over Oil Prospect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The latest oil find between
Arad and the Dead Sea in Israel has shown promising results
and the Israel National Oil Company (INOC) is cautiously
optimistic about the prospect.
</P>
<P>
The oil flow at the site was registered at a rate of 600
barrels a day Sunday and Monday, The Jerusalem Post reported
today, citing INOC Managing Director Yaron Ran.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, INOC announced that the oil had been located above
another flow, which was discovered last year. The first find was
detected in sandstone strata at a depth of 2,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
This weekend's strike was some 50 to 70 meters closer to the
surface. On Friday and Saturday the oil flowed at 450 barrels a
day.
</P>
<P>
The new flow will be stopped this week and drilling will
begin at a slightly higher depth. If the next stage also
produces positive results, INOC says it intends to link the
three finds, which it hopes will lead to an economically
viable operation at the site.
</P>
<P>
The Infrastructure Ministry's Research Department says the area
 will have to produce 100,000 barrels. "Let's hope it carries on
that way," Ran said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the continuing site tests in the area, Israeli
oil experts remain hopeful that significant finds will be made at
sea.
</P>
<P>
In July, the government awarded the first five licenses for
drilling oil in Israel's deep waters in the Mediterranean.
The winning consortium, headed by Avner Oil and Gas Ltd.,
intends to drill at unspecified locations off the coast
between Haifa and the Gaza Strip by the end of the next
year.

<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A revolution in the smallest
room in the house is in the vanguard of sweeping changes announced
in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Municipal Government officials in the Chinese capital have
ordered a massive "spring clean" of the city's housing building
standards.
</P>
<P>
Out will go the squat-down toilets. In will come western-style
sit-down loos, complete with water cisterns.
</P>
<P>
Better off Chinese are already switching to pedestal basin
toilets, but the squat-down toilets still rules supreme in public
toilets.
</P>
<P>
The changes will be implemented in the Chinese capital during
the 1996-2000 period to improve living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Experts say this new standard is of an advanced nature, and
full of respect for humanity for residents.
</P>
<P>
According to a rule made public today by the local housing
department, all new apartment's bedrooms, living rooms and
kitchens should have natural light, while kitchens and indoor
toilets should have ventilation facilities.
</P>
<P>
Indoor pipes and lines should be properly concealed and
kitchens should have enough space for cupboards, extractor pipes
and heaters. Toilets should have pedestal basins, sinks and
bathing facilities.
</P>
<P>
Houses which face streets should have their doors and
windows soundproofed, as well as soundproof house walls. Every
apartment should have space for a washing machine and an
air-conditioner, and have drainage facilities.
</P>
<P>
Water, electricity and gas meters should be fixed outside the
apartments to avoid disturbing the residents.
</P>
<P>
The rule requires all governmental institutions, enterprises
and real estate companies to strictly abide by the new standard in
the future when building new apartments.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Sets World Record in Per Unit Area Wheat Yield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- People in a 'top of the world'
village are toasting a world record wheat harvest.
</P>
<P>
Shannan Prefecture in Tibet has already earned a name as the
region's granary. But when villagers from Kesong Village, Nedong
county, in Shannan went to gather their latest harvest even they
were greatly astonished.
</P>
<P>
The per unit yield for one season on a piece of their land
reached 1,005 kg per mu, or 15.075 tons per hectare.
</P>
<P>
According to Guan Shusen, a researcher from the Tibet
Agricultural Research Institute who just inquired from China's
State Science and Technology Information Institute, so far there
is no such high record of per unit area yield reported by other
places of the world.
</P>
<P>
The new record has been confirmed by the local agriculture
authority and the Tibet Agriculture Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Guan attributed the high yield to the perfect local geographic
conditions for wheat growing and the fine variety of wheat.
</P>
<P>
Shannan region is also the birth place of Tibetan nationality.
The first piece of farm land ever in Tibet, known as 'roof of the
world' was in Shannan.

<HEADLINE> Poll Puts Iliescu Ahead on Votes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The poll, conducted by the neutral public opinion poll
institute IRSOP, interviewed 1070 citizens aged 19 and over. It
showed that Iliescu would have a lead over two other opposition
candidates, Emil Constantinescu, chairman of the Democratic
Convention of Romania Alliance (CDR), and Petre Roman, chairman of
the Social Democratic Union (USD) and also a former prime minister.
</P>
<P>
As for the parliamentary elections, the CDR led by
Constantinescu would have 34 percent of votes, four percentage
points ahead of the ruling Party of Social Democracy (PDSR).
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, the other two poll institutes, IMAS and CURS,
released the similar results, the official news agency ROMPRES
said.
</P>
<P>
On July 26, Iliescu, 66, agreed to run for a second term in the
presidential elections to be held in November as the ruling PDSR
candidate.
</P>
<P>
But he made it a condition of his candidacy that there be an
anti-corruption drive in the ruling party, which was formed in
1993 by the Democratic National Salvation Front and several other
parties.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture Sector Higher Profit in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Income of agricultural workers
increased by 18.1 percent last year in Shanghai, 1.3 percentage
points higher than for people in the service sector.
</P>
<P>
According to an official in the city, this fact has completely
changed the idea that agriculture is not as profitable as other
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The official said that in the first half of this year, the
number of agriculture enterprises in Shanghai reached 2,374, 171
more than the last year.
</P>
<P>
"Among the agricultural enterprises 431 are overseas-invested,
39 percent more than last year", he said.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Agriculture, Industry and Commerce Group, once a
state-owned farm, was reported to have made a profit of 210
million Yuan or 25 million US dollars last year. The income of its
workers in the agriculture sector was 50 percent higher than the
average income of workers in other sectors.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the industrialization of crop
planting and paying attention to the economics of scale are the
main reasons for higher profits in the agriculture sector in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that fisheries now make the highest profit
in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Largest Habitat for Black Stork Found in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The largest habitat for black
storks in China has been discovered in northwest Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the Xinjiang Institute of Biology, Soil and
Desert under the Chinese Academy of Sciences confirmed, after
observation for five consecutive years, that the country's largest
group of black storks are at the Paman Reservoir, in the middle
reaches of the Tarim River.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma Ming, a scientist at the institute, the number
of the endangered birds have been between 90 and 110, which is
rare in not only China, but the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Researchers found that the birds' nests, shaped like a platform
and entrenched with poplar bark, are mostly on high poplar trees,
far from human reach. They will relocate if their domain is
frequented by people.
</P>
<P>
The storks lay and hatch eggs in mid-April, and the incubation
lasts some 31 days.
</P>
<P>
According to the research results, the storks migrate to the
reservoir in March and April, and their number is less than
20. Between May and July, the number reaches between 30 and
100. After July, they disperse along the river with the
young birds growing up and flood season coming.
</P>
<P>
Ma Ming analyzed that the sparsely populated areas provide very
good environment for the existence of the birds. In addition, in
extremely dry southern Xinjiang, the wetland spreads in a long
stripe and the water areas shrink in dry season. As a result, the
food sources are relatively concentrated, attracting the birds to
flock there.

<HEADLINE> 38 Monkeys Die of Electrocution in Kathmandu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 14 (Xinhua) -- About 38 monkeys were killed
in an electric short circuit accident near a Hindu temple here,
the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The monkeys were electrocuted on Tuesday morning when a
high-voltage live wire leading to a lamp post touched and leaked
electricity to the nearby barbed wire fence in the jungle where a
monkey community lives.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said most of the electrocuted monkeys were killed
as they attempted to pull off others dying on the electrified
fence near the Pashupatinath temple, where local Hindu people
often cremate the dead bodies of their relatives.
</P>
<P>
Monkeys are respected by people in this Hindu kingdom as the
incarnation of the monkey god Hanuman in the Hindu mythology.
</P>
<P>
Local major newspapers today carried a photo on their front
pages, showing that a sad small monkey was moaning over the
unexpected death of
one of its elders.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Does Not Fear Economic Sanctions Over Myanmar, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said today the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) does not fear economic sanctions by the United
States for accepting Myanmar as a member of the regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
However, Mahathir said ASEAN is confident that the U.S. would
not take such a punitive action as it has interests in the region,
including large investment in Southeast Asia and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think so... the United States has interests here. When
there is oil, they will come," Mahathir told reporters after
paying a farewell call on chairman of Myanmar's State Law and
Order Restoration Council Than Shwe here.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe who arrived here on Monday for a five-day official
visit will leave here for Pulau Pinang later today to continue his
visit to Malaysia before returning home on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether there was any objection among ASEAN members to
Myanmar's entry of ASEAN, Mahathir said "perhaps... but who don't
want Myanmar are the Western countries."
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has been the target of Western criticism for alleged
violation of human rights. The country obtained observer status in
ASEAN recently and is expected to become a member next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The central bank of Germany today
strongly criticized major western industrialized countries for
conniving at high fiscal deficits.
</P>
<P>
The Deutsche Bundesbank said in a report today that these
countries as a whole were spending more than they saved, resulting
in huge deficits.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that their fiscal deficits in 1980 were
equivalent to half of their gross national product in 1980, but
the ratio climbed to four-fifths in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that as capital demand in these countries
surpassed the amount of savings, the gap had to be met by
borrowing from other countries.
</P>
<P>
The bank urged the industrialized countries to make strenuous
efforts to cut their deficits.

Bulgarian Telegraph Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Apostol Apostolov, director of the newly-established exchange,

The exchange itself will possess 10 percent of the total bonds,
the Public Privatization Center six percent and official financial
bodies five percent, said the agency.

<P>
Foreign investors were free to buy as many stocks as they liked.
</P>

Apostolov said the original stocks from the Central Stock
Exchange could only be resold two months after appearing on the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
It is understood the U.S. Agency for International Development

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Following are the major
economic news briefs from Latin American countries over the past
few days:
</P>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA -- The Colombian government postponed for two
months the auction of two oil-yielding areas to 17 big
multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
The auction was postponed because Ecopetrol, the state-owned
petroleum company and present owner of the two areas, is unable to
provide geological information on one area known as Tocoragua.
</P>
<P>
CARACAS -- Venezuela faces the danger of more capital flight,
following that of 1994, because of rapid money liquidity, an
economic study showed.
</P>
<P>
The study, by university Professor Pedro Palma, says that
capital flight could wreck the economic stabilization and
adjustment program applied since April by President Rafael
Caldera's government.
</P>
<P>
About 40 percent more money was in circulation in July than in
January.
</P>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil's foreign debt has reached 159 billion
dollars, making it the biggest debtor nation in Latin America.
</P>

WARSAW, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Poland plans to increase fuel
prices next year to levy an indirect toll on road users, a Finance

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bumpy Road to Improved Pakistani-Afghan Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The strained relations between
Pakistan and Afghanistan have taken a turn for the better as
Islamabad decided to reopen its embassy in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
After three days of talks between a visiting high-level Afghan
delegation and Pakistani senior officials, both sides agreed to
end propaganda against each other at the official level.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique issued here Monday said the two countries
will cooperate closely in the Afghan peace process, the
reconstruction of Afghanistan, bilateral trade and trade with
Central Asian countries, and fighting terrorism and narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the signing of the communique will raise the
Pakistani-Afghan ties from rock bottom to a new high, which will
benefit not only the ongoing Afghan peace process but also the
stability and development in the region.
</P>
<P>
They added that the twists and turns in the Pakistani-Afghan
relations have strong connections with the situation in
Afghanistan and the region at large.
</P>
<P>
During its 10 years of resistance against the Soviet invasion,
Afghanistan received huge aid from neighboring Pakistan, which
also served as an important channel for international assistance
to flow into the Afghan battlefield.
</P>
<P>
After 1992 when Afghan guerrilla groups took power, the ties
between the two countries remained sound for two years. During the
period, Pakistan hosted several important meetings attended by
Afghan rival factions to seek peace in the war-torn nation.
</P>
<P>
However, rifts emerged in the relations after the mysterious
upsurge of the Afghan Taliban Militia at the end of 1994. Since
then, Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani had often accused
Pakistan of supporting the Taliban against his government.
</P>
<P>
Although Pakistan repeatedly refuted such accusations, it could
not prevent the relations from going downward as the Taliban
gained a string of victories on the battlefield in Afghanistan in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani-Afghan ties reached the lowest point last
September when thousands of anti-Pakistan protesters destroyed the
Pakistani embassy in Kabul, wounding the ambassador and many other
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Commentators said the strained ties between Pakistan and
Afghanistan are not conducive to the Afghan peace process, as
Pakistan remains a bridge between Afghanistan and the world.
</P>
<P>
The UN Afghan peace mission made its base in Islamabad and most
of the UN humanitarian aid goes into Afghanistan through Pakistan.
The vulnerable Afghan economy relies on the transit trade with
Pakistan and trade with other countries through Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Pakistan and the Central Asian countries
want to have closer economic cooperation, but the trade routes
must cross the Afghan territory.
</P>
<P>
The international community also needs help from Pakistan and
Afghanistan to fight against the terrorism and narcotics.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani-Afghan relations showed a sign of moving forward
in May when a six-member Afghan delegation led by Transport
Minister Abdul Saim visited Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
That was the first official contact between Islamabad and Kabul
since the burning down of the Pakistani embassy.
</P>
<P>
The visit made a major breakthrough in thawing out their
relationship as the Afghan side agreed in principle to reconstruct
the Pakistani embassy in Kabul and compensate for the damages.
</P>
<P>
When the Afghan Hezb-i-Islami leader, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar,
reconciliated with Rabbani and assumed the premiership of the new
Afghan coalition government in June, Pakistan sent an official
delegation to the oath-taking ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Since then, both Hekmatyar and senior Pakistani officials have
repeatedly expressed their readiness improve bilateral relations
in various areas.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, the new Afghan government sent its first
high-level delegation headed by Interior Minister Younus Qanooni
to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
During its three-day stay in Islamabad, the delegation held
talks with Pakistani President Farooq Leghari, Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto, Foreign Minister Sardar Aseff Ahmed Ali and
Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique said Pakistan and Afghanistan will fully
develop bilateral ties on the basis of the principles of
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, mutual respect
for each other's territorial integrity and national unity.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Increase Revenue From Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW August 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia will change its taxation
rates to increase its revenue by some six trillion rubles (about
1.14 billion U.S. dollars) in the second half of this year, Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said today.
</P>
<P>
At a Tax Bureau meeting today, Chernomyrdin said that the

About one-fourth of the total gross domestic production (GDP),
evaded taxation, and in the commercial and service sector, 40
percent of revenues dodged taxation.

<HEADLINE> Airliner Held Up and Robbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A gang of armed robbers held up an
arriving jet airliner at Perpignan today and escaped with a large
amount of cash from the aircraft's cargo.
</P>
<P>
The A320 airliner had just put down at 6.30 p.m. at the
southern coastal city after a flight from Paris, the AFP agency
said.
</P>
<P>
It was beginning its roll towards the airport terminal building
l.8 kilometers away when the robbers suddenly burst through the
airfield gates in three vans which had previously been in an
airport parking lot.
</P>
<P>
The vans raced towards the airliner and stopped in front of the
wheels. The robbers then unfurled a streamer ordering the pilots
to open the door of the cargo cabin.
</P>
<P>
The gangsters seized the packages full of cash and loaded them
in one van and drove away. They left two vans blocking the gate,
presumably to foil persuers.
</P>
<P>
All of the 167 passengers and six crew on board the airliner
were safe.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, airport staff were not aware of the
robbery because it happened near an oak wood which obscured the
scene from the control tower.
</P>
<P>
The police said the robbers were armed with handguns and rifles
and had forged license plates on the vans they left. Police did
not reveal the exact amount of cash taken, saying only that it was
"considerable -- large."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: German Labor Market Faces Bleak Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Labor market in eastern Germany
is now under increasing pressure as unemployment rate climbs,
part-time job opportunities drop and labor negotiations run into
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures published by the Federal Labor Office on
August 6 show that the number of jobless in the area increased by
28,000 in July to reach 1.147 million. Within the month, the
unemployment rate was pushed up from 10 percent to 15.4 percent,
and the figure for the Saxony-Anhalt state ran as high as 17.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, 127,000 lost their jobs in July to make the jobless
force reach 3.911 million.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the labor market fares the worst for the
young. Some 182,400 fresh school-leavers across Germany are
waiting for apprenticeship offers, which are scarce in view of the
stagnating economy.
</P>
<P>
While 85,000 out of the 120,000 young in the west could find
apprenticeship, only 8,500 of the more than 60,000 in the east
have the same luck.
</P>
<P>
Now, the federal government is discussing with employers in an
attempt to create 45,000 apprenticeships in September when the
next training season starts, but prospects do not look optimistic
as the latter have shown little enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
Things could be harder when "the Bonn austerity program" that
cuts funds on temporary jobs is implemented in the near
future. More than 100,000 temporary workers will be affected and
150,000 could likely join the jobless in the east, thus driving
the unemployment rate to the region of 20-30 percent in the
Saxony-Anhalt State alone.
</P>
<P>
To add to the difficulties is the tension in the labor
relations. Negotiations on pay raise and extended hours are tough
as workers in different areas have different demands. What is
more, the unions have threatened of strikes unless agreement is
reached soon.

<HEADLINE> 1 in 4 U.S. Working Parents Lack Sick Leave for Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- One in every four working
parents cannot enjoy sick leave when their school-age kids fall
sick, forcing them to either send ill children to school or risk
getting fire, a latest U.S. study found.
</P>
<P>
Parents who need sick leave the most -- those who have children
stricken with such chronic illnesses as asthma and those who are
poor -- are least likely to be entitled to staying home to care
for their kids.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly 60 percent of poor working parents had no sick leave
the entire time between 1985 and 1990," researchers reported in
the study carried in the August issue of Pediatrics, published by
the American Academy of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 percent of single mothers whose children suffered from
asthma had no sick leave between 1985 and 1990, the study found.
</P>
<P>
Out of all working single mothers, 28 percent lacked sick leave
during that period.
</P>
<P>
Between 1985 and 1990, 27 percent of poor families in the
United States averaged three weeks or more of family illnesses
whereas 23 percent of non-poor families had the same accumulated
period of family illnesses.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993, proved
no help to most parents in that it involves unpaid leave and
covers only major illnesses that require a hospital stay, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
But in most cases, children do not need hospitalization but
have frequent routine illnesses, it added.

<HEADLINE> German Volkswagen Doubles Profit in First Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- German Volkswagenwerk AG, announced
today that its net profit was 282 million marks (188.94 million
U.S. dollars) in the first half of this year, more than double of
the 113 million marks (75.71 million dollars) profit in the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The company, the biggest car maker in Europe, said its sales in
the first half were 50.5 billion marks (33.84 billion dollars) as
compared to 44.5 billion marks (29.82 billion dollars) in the same
period of last year. Pre-tax profit increased to 891 million marks
(596.97 dollars) from 616 million marks (412.7 million dollars) in
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The company's board of directors attributed the profit rise to
the increase of car sales, in foreign markets especially.
</P>
<P>
Driven by growing demands, production in Portugal and Asia had
risen 11.7 percent to 2.04 million units since the beginning of
this year. At the same time, domestic production only climbed 1.2
percent, to nearly 830,000 units.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with production, sales in western Europe and the
United States rose 17.1 and 15.7 percent respectively while
domestic sales were only up 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Volkswagenwerk AG registered 88.1 billion marks (59.03 billion
dollars) of sales last year. The company said higher sales were
expected this year.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Strives to Halt Spread of Cholera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, August 13 (Xinhua) -- An epidemic cholera in
northern Mongolia has so far killed six and infected 48 others
while another 853 have shown suspect symptoms since its outbreak,
Mongolian officials told Xinhua tonight.
</P>
<P>
Since the first cholera sufferer was found in remote Khoetol
county in northern Selenge province which borders Russia, the
epidemic has spread to Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator and some
areas near Khoetol.
</P>
<P>
To halt the spread and cure the infected, more than 600 medical
workers have been sent to infected areas by the special state
commission.
</P>
<P>
On August 10, the Mongolian government ordered government
officials in all levels and civil defence troops in the five
provinces of Central Aimak, Selenge, Bulgan, Darhan-Uul and Orhon
to be on the high alert. The governors were directed to take
precautions against the spread of cholera.
</P>
<P>
In Ulan Bator, the infected and those suspected are being
quarantined. The ambulances in the city's emergency center are on
standby 24 hours. The biggest open market in the city and some
vendor's stands have closed. Vehicles and pedestrians have denied
admission to main infected areas.
</P>
<P>
The special state commission has modified the domestic
transportation. International passenger trains via Mongolia will
not stop at any station to the north of Ulan Bator and airlines
special for tourists will not fly to the areas declared on the
alert.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Host International Machine Tools Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- An international machine tools
exhibition is to be held in Shanghai in October.
</P>
<P>
The five-day showcase event, opening on October 7, will have
more than 120 exhibitors from 10 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is jointly organized by the Shanghai municipal
government and the Hannover Messe International GMBH, a member of
the Deutsche Messe AG.
</P>
<P>
During the fair foreign companies will display the latest
technology, including computers and robots, for all kinds of
machine tools and metal-products manufacture and processing.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai was selected as the exhibit site because it is where
the country's major industrial factories are located, today's
"China Daily" quoted Wolfgang Lenarz, general manager of the
German company, as saying.
</P>
<P>
China is becoming an increasingly important market for Germany,
noted Lenarz.
</P>
<P>
Last year Germany sold abroad 7.7 billion deutsche marks worth
of machines tools, nine percent of which were shipped to China.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the attractive market in China, Germany will send a
high-calibre national delegation to the forthcoming Shanghai
event, added Lenarz.
</P>
<P>
China has now become one of the world's largest importers of
machines tools, and one of the biggest manufacturers of
metal-processing machines.
</P>
<P>
China imported at least two billion US dollars worth of machine
tools in 1995, ranking the second place in the world, after the
United States.

though he brought with him a proposal related to the promotion of
sales of Chilean fruits in the United States.
</P>
<P>
In March 1989, the United States suspended imports of all
Chilean fruits after some grapes were found to be poisoned with
cyanide.
</P>
<P>
The suspension incurred more than 200 million U.S. dollars in
loss on the part of Chilean fruit exporters.
</P>
<P>
Davidow also said at the press conference that the United
States will begin to study in mid-1997 the possibility of selling
advanced weapons to Chilean army, navy and air force.
</P>
<P>
The senior U.S. official came to Chile from Ecuador and his
tour will also take him to the Dominican Republic and Haiti.

<HEADLINE> Germans Drink Less Liquor, Survey Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Germans drank less liquor but more
soft drinks in 1995, a survey released here today shows.
</P>
<P>
The average German drank 166.4 litres of liquor in 1995, 10
litres less than 10 years ago, according to the survey by the
Munich Ifo Economy Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Of the liquor consumption, beer accounted for 138 litres in
1995, 1.5 litres less than 1994 and 13 litres less than 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The number of people rated as alcoholics was declining while
more and more young consumers turned to soft drinks, thus reducing
the overall liquor consumption by a large margin, the survey
showed.
</P>
<P>
It said liquor consumption would keep falling in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
The number of permanent drinkers aged between 20 and 40 was
estimated to drop by 5 million by the year of 2010.
</P>
<P>
Beer consumption per capita was estimated to reduce by eight
litres to 130 litres by 2010, the survey said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today appointed Sergei Yastrzhembsky as his new press secretary to
replace Sergei Medvedev.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky, 42, was Russia's ambassador to Slovakia after
serving as the chief foreign ministry spokesman in 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Moscow Institute for International Relations in
1976, he later received a doctorate at the Soviet Academy of
Sciences' Institute of the International Labor Movement.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky is thought to be close to Anatoly Chubais, who
was rehabilitated and brought back into Yeltsin's team after the
presidential election last month.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev, 37, was hired as the press secretary by Yeltsin in
March last year.
</P>
<P>
He was reported to have said he would take up a senior post at
the state-run television channel ORT, where he previously anchored
the main evening newscast and a weekly news program.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also named Valentin Yumashev, the general manager of
the military Ogonek magazine, as a presidential advisor on media
relations. Yumashev helped Yeltsin write the latest volume of his
memoirs.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also named Sergei Samoylov, Vyacheslav Romanov and
Andrei Logynov respectively as directors of bureaus of regional,
personnel and cooperation affairs under the presidential office.

<HEADLINE> Underground Banking Houses Banned: Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China, the
central bank, has urged its grass-root subsidiarires to work
closely with local police authorities to ban private, underground
banking houses.
</P>
<P>
Private, underground banking houses, which have appeared in
some provinces and cities, must be banned, the central bank said
in a recent circular.
</P>
<P>
"Such banking houses absorb funds from the public with promises
of high interest rates and then extend to borrowers at even higher
rates, thereby seriously harming financial order and social
stability," the circular noted.
</P>
<P>
The illegal financial activities of the private, underground
banking houses have violated the Commercial Bank Law, which
stipulates that no unit or individual is allowed to, without
approval from the People's Bank of China, engage in commercial
banking business, such as accepting deposits, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
The circular urged central bank subsidiaries, in respect of the
Commercial Bank Law and other relevant rules and regulations, to
cooperate with local police authorities to resolutely ban private,
underground banking houses, and confiscate their illegal income.
</P>
<P>
Criminal charges will also be filed if necessary, the circular
said.

<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- China's securities watchdog
reiterated a State Council ban on over-the-counter securities
trading, saying conditions for such trading are not yet ripe in
China.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of China Securities Regulatory Commission said
over-the-counter markets lack adequate regulations on listing,
trading, and information disclosure, which pose difficulties in
guaranteeing the rights of investors.
</P>
<P>
Over-the-counter trading has been revived in some areas, and
is becoming increasingly active in financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The commission spokesman stressed, "The securities market in
China still remains in a preliminary stage, and is not fully
prepared for such stock transactions."
</P>
<P>
He added the securities market should develop in an active, but
gradual manner, in line with the spirit of the country's "Ninth
Five-year Plan for Social and Economic Development and Long-term
Objectives for 2010".
</P>
<P>
Over-the-counter transactions refer to stock trading conducted
outside stock exchanges. The business allows investors to buy or
sell stocks directly through securities companies. In exchange
trading, investors can only trade through brokers.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Continue Corn Imports From Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will continue its corn
imports from Thailand to meet rising demand from the country's
animal feed producers, an Agriculture Ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
"For 1996 alone, Indonesia's import of corn from Thailand has
been projected at 1.6 million tons," Director General of Husbandry
Erwin Sutarto told the local press Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The demand for corn from domestic animal feed producers was
relatively high, forcing the government to import the commodity to
ensure their survival, Antara news agency quoted Sutarto as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia now has a total of 58 animal feed producers with a
combined production capacity of 5.4 million tons per year.
</P>
<P>
The contribution of domestic corn to animal feed production has
reached 2.5 million tons so far this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
To increase domestic corn production, the Agriculture Ministry
was introducing high-yielding corn in the provinces of north
Sumatra, Lampung, Central Java, East Java, West Java and South
Sulawesi under a special intensification program.
</P>
<P>
The country's corn plantation in the 1996-97 planting season
has been projected to cover an area of nearly 3.4 million
hectares.

BANGKOK, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's tapioca flour
industry is preparing to pounce on an opportunity to export to
Russia, which has opened its grain market to supplement low
harvests this year, the Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
A Thai trade mission visited Russia last week and said they had
succeeded in convincing Russian importers to buy Thai tapioca
products.
</P>
<P>
The delegation secured a deal under which Russian importers
would buy 10,000 tons of Thai tapioca flour, and two other Russian
companies also showed interest in buying 21,000-25,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The mission, including private and public sector
representatives, hoped that about 100,000 tons of Thai tapioca
flour will be shipped to Russia this year.
</P>
<P>
Russia is expected to import 250,000 tons of tapioca flour each
year worldwide in the future to produce sweeteners, textiles,
glue, paper alcohol, and food, the report said.

<HEADLINE> School Employs Computer Network for Student Enrollment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- China's colleges and
universities are enrolling students via computer networks, a new
practice in the country. A story in today's China Daily describes
how the work is done:
</P>
<P>
Lu Xiaoming and his assistant Xiao Wang from the admissions
office of Beijing's People's University of China used to spend
every August traveling across the country enrolling freshmen
students.
</P>
<P>
This year, they have no plans to travel. Instead, they started
their screening for possible candidates from the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region on Sunday in their Beijing office.
</P>
<P>
They began their work by turning on a PC. After several
seconds, the computer booted up "Windows" and Xiao Wang clicked
the icon of "Netscape," a well-known program for getting onto
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Via a modem linked with the computer, they were connected to a
remote computer system in Guangxi's regional Enrollment Office
2,000 kilometers south of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
With the right log-on name and password, Xiao Wang successfully
logged on to the database of Guangxi's enrollment system, and
downloaded information on the top 22 applicants among science
majors, since the university plans to enroll 18 science majors
from Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
After they disconnected from Guangxi, Lu and Wang discussed and
compared each prospective student. It took them almost two hours
before they decided to enroll 18 of 22 applicants and assigned the
applicants to their departments.
</P>
<P>
Wang then reconnected the system and began to fill in their
enrollment results in a prepared electronic form. When he clicked
the "OK" button, the fate of 18 students from Guangxi was
determined.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, four other students' information, which was still
kept in the database, would be reviewed by other prospective
colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
All the enrollment work of the university's liberal arts
freshmen in Guangxi was completed in the afternoon within six
hours, whereas in the past, it would take Lu and Wang at least
four days to travel to and from Guangxi by train and several days'
stay in Nanning, the region's capital.
</P>
<P>
There would be other frustrations as they had to rub shoulders
with a few hundred teachers from colleges and universities across
the country vying for candidates from Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
But this year, they became pioneers in trying
computer-networking as the computer-based enrollment became the
authorized operation in Beijing instead of the traditional manual
practice.

<P>
XI'AN August 14 (Xinhua) -- A special 5 million yuan fund
(600,000 U.S. dollars) for fighting corruption was established
recently in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, as another step in
encouraging officials at all levels to serve the people better as
public servants.
</P>
<P>
According to a report, wining and dining at public expense has
been basically stopped in the province. "The average volume of
business in mid- and high-level restaurants, which used to rely on
the use of public money, has now dropped more than 30 percent,"
said an official.
</P>
<P>
In Yan'an, known as the Chinese revolutionary base, the cost of
receptions has seen a drop of a third.
</P>
<P>
In Xianyang, the ancient capital of the Qin Dynasty
(221--206B.C.), 113 houses being illegally used by some officials
has been taken back, and the officials involved in the cases have
been penalized.
</P>
<P>
So far, 600 cases of corruption in the province have been
investigated and 628 cadres have been disciplined.
</P>

At the beginning of the year, the province made a decision to
cut one-third of its meetings, documents, and speeches by
officials in order to put the time and money to better use.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane "Cesar" which struck
Costa Rica last month caused more than 175 million U.S. dollars
worth of damage, said Security Minister Bernardo Arce today.
</P>
<P>
Arce, who also serves as the coordinator of the emergency
committee, delivered a report to the government council on the
damage caused by the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
"Cesar" did not touch down on Costa Rican territory as it
crossed over Central America from the Atlantic to the Pacific
through Nicaragua. But Costa Rica was the country that suffered
the most damage, due to the heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
The hurricane struck the region on July 27, killing some 40
people.
</P>
<P>
In Costa Rica, the greatest property damage caused by the
hurricane was the destruction of highways and bridges.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that about 2,000 kilometers of roads and 224
bridges will have to be repaired or rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
The South Pacific area of the country remains cutoff because
several stretches of the Panamerican and coastal highways, the two
main highways in the area, were washed away.
</P>
<P>
Municipal roads were also cut because of collapsed bridges and
landslides.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 homes needed to be repaired, rebuilt or relocated,
according to the report of the emergency committee.

</P>
<P>
Johnson's absence leaves Atlanta silver medalist Frankie

</P>
<P>
The Zurich grand prix will offer events winners between 7,000

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Test Ban Talks Run into Deadlock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The multilateral talks on a
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty apparently ran into a
deadlock on Tuesday in Geneva as India rejected the proposal to
submit a proposed draft treaty to the UN Conference on Disarmament
for final approval.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats emerging from a negotiating meeting on Tuesday
evening said that some non-aligned countries along with Russia had
proposed to draft a factual report forwarding the current draft
treaty to the Conference on Disarmament for final approval, but
India disagreed.
</P>
<P>
India said the draft treaty put forward by the Dutch chairman
of the negotiations Jaap Ramaker should not be submitted to the
disarmament Conference without a consensus approval at its ad hoc
committee charged with the mandate to negotiate the treaty.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, India is actually blocking the procedure to enable
the Geneva Conference to submit the treaty to the UN General
Assembly for signature in mid-September as widely expected.
</P>
<P>
Indian Ambassador Arundhati Ghose told reporters after the
Tuesday meeting that India was not opposed to the factual report by
the ad hoc committee, but the draft treaty.
</P>
<P>
India objects to the Entry-Into-Force (EIF) provision of the
draft requiring it -- along with Pakistan and Israel, the three
so-called nuclear threshold states -- to ratify the test ban
before it takes effect.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the EIF is there, we can not agree to let it
through," Ghose said.
</P>
<P>
Another country which spoke out against the draft treaty at the
Tuesday meeting was Iran, which said that the draft should be
reopened for further negotiations before any report could be
submitted to the disarmament Conference.
</P>
<P>
Iran wants Israel to be excluded from a list of
Middle-East/South Asian countries which may become members of the
treaty's executive council. It also demands a timetable for
nuclear disarmament and the exclusion of espionage and human
intelligence as the basis to trigger on-site inspections on
suspected test sites.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Stephen Ledogar told reporters that "it was
really deadlocked about the way ahead.... I did saw much hope at
the moment".
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources here, some 20 western countries
led by the Unites States are seriously considering to draft a
resolution to submit the draft treaty directly to UN General
Assembly as a way to bypass the holdout countries.
</P>
<P>
Informal consultations among different groups of countries will
continue on Wednesday morning before another full ad hoc committee
meeting scheduled for the afternoon.

<HEADLINE> IFOR Commander Satisfied with Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 13 (Xinhua) -- NATO-led peace Implementation
Force (IFOR) commander in Bosnia U.S. Adm. Joseph Lopez said today
that the inspection of the Serb military site at Han Pijesak had
been satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Lopez made the remarks after talks with Serb President Biljana
Plavsic in Serb stronghold Pale, Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Commander of IFOR's ground forces Michael Walker, who made the
inspection together with Plavsic earlier today, also told
reporters in Pale that he was convinced the base was in order.
</P>
<P>
Expressing satisfaction at the trip, Walker said "We gained
access to the site, we were given authority to go anywhere we
wanted to, so from that perspective it was a very useful visit."
</P>
<P>
Plavsic said she was pleased that problems were being settled
in this manner, and added that Republika Srpska would continue to
cooperate in the implementation of the Dayton accord.
</P>
<P>
The Serb soldiers blocked the IFOR troops from inspecting the
military site at Han Pijesac last Saturday, causing tensions
between the Serb authority and the IFOR. But under strong pressure
from the NATO, the Serbs finally agreed on Monday to allow IFOR to
tour the military site.
</P>
<P>
"IFOR is welcome to visit any of the Serb sites," Plavsic told
reporters in Pale.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on today's inspection with the IFOR commanders,
Plavsic said, "I can say that this was a good opportunity and
pleasant time to be there and I think that we shall not have in
the future any misunderstanding on something like this. If it
appears, we are here to solve that."

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Urges to Ensure Refugees Voting Right </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav institutions in
charge of registering refugee-voters for Bosnian elections today
called on the international community to help refugees exercise
their voting right.
</P>
<P>
Recent registration shows that Yugoslavia has more than 220,000
refugees from Bosnia with the voting right but about 20,000 of
them are wounded, ill or over 65 years of age and unable to travel
back to Bosnia to cast their ballots, the Yugoslav institutions
said in a letter.
</P>
<P>
The letter was addressed to High Representative for Bosnia Carl
Bidlt, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata, U.N.
Human Rights Rapporteur Elisabeth Rehn, OSCE Provisional Electoral
Commission Chairman Robert Frowick, the ICRC and other
international institutions, and sent by the Yugoslav commission
for refugee voting rights in Bosnia, Commissions for Refugees of
Serbia and Montenegro, Yugoslav Ministries of Labour, Health and
Social Policy, the Minister in charge of human and minority rights
and the Yugoslav Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the OSCE commission's rules did not enable
refugees to vote where they resided, which was normally the case
everywhere in the world when temporarily or permanently disabled
persons were involved.
</P>
<P>
"We face a real possibility of violations of basic human rights
of a number of refugees in the exercise of their voting right, as
envisaged by the electoral rules set by the OSCE Provisional
Electoral Commission," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE electoral rules specify that refugees must go to a
place in Bosnia where they would choose to live in the future and
cast their ballots there. If they vote abroad, they can only vote
for the parties and candidates in the place they lived before the
war broke out in April 1992, which actually makes many refugees
impossible to vote as they were forced to leave their hometown.
</P>
<P>
It urged international organizations to influence the OSCE
commission to enable all voters to exercise their voting right,
which it said "would be a step further in the overall
normalization of relations and conditions in the region."

<HEADLINE> Iranian President: No Good for Any Country To Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani said here today that it would not serve any country's
interests if it severs its relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to foreign diplomats here, Rafsanjani said with Iran's
unique resources in the region and its status worldwide, it would
not serve the interests of any single government to sever
relations with the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
His statements was in response to the tougher U.S. sanctions
against Iran which will punish non-American companies investing
more than 40 million U.S. dollars a year in Iran and Libya's oil
industries.
</P>
<P>
Despite the sanctions, Iran and Turkey signed on Monday a 20
billion dollar gas deal.
</P>
<P>
The deal further enhanced Tehran's confidence to thwart
U.S. efforts to isolate Iran, diplomatic sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Following Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's visit,
Syrian prime minister and Greece foreign minister will visit
Tehran soon, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
To counter the isolation policy of the United States, the
Iranian policy-makers have also launched a diplomat campaign to
improve relations with its neighbors, including Iraq, Pakistan,
UAE and other Arab states.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Tehran has resorted to diplomatic and legal
channels such as the United Nations and the International Justice
Court in the Hague in a bid to head-off the tremendous challenges
from the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani told the diplomats that Washington had frequently
tried to implicate Iran even in the smallest (terrorist) incidents
in the United States to "smear the face of the Iranian Islamic
government."
</P>
<P>
Europe was ignoring Washington's sanctions because the
Europeans as well as the world people have realized that
Washington pretended to be the sole government that enjoyed
the exclusive right to decisions for other governments, he
noted.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Deplores Clashes in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
on Tuesday strongly deplored the recent bloody clashes between
Greek and Turkish Cypriots and called upon both sides to renounce
violence.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Security Council strongly deplored the
incident and they condemned the killing of an unarmed civilian
during these clashes," said council president Tono Eitel of
Germany.
</P>
<P>
"The council members called upon both sides to renounce
violence. It was stressed that both sides bear responsibilities
for the events leading to these clashes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Eitel was speaking to reporters after closed-door council
consultations during which members were briefed on the violence in
Cyprus by Under-Secretary-General Chinmaya Gharekhan.
</P>
<P>
A Greek Cypriot demonstrator was killed and more than 70 people
on both sides were injured on Sunday when hundreds of Greek
Cypriot motorcyclists pushed across the U.N.-policed buffer zone,
and clashed with Turkish troops and Turkish Cypriot
counter-demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been virtually partioned since 1974, when Turkish
troops landed in the north of the island in response to a coup in
Nicosia. U.N. troops were sent in to monitor a buffer zone which
separated the country into two. The northern part is controlled by
the Turkish Cypriots and the southern part by Greek Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Refuses to Comment on Iran's Lawsuits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States, under the
pretext of "intelligence matter", refused on Tuesday to make any
comment on a suit, filed by Iran at a Hague-based Tribunal against
Washington's reported funding of covert action for "subversive"
operations in Iran.
</P>
<P>
"We are certainly not going to have anything to say about what
is an intelligence matter," said State Department deputy spokesman
Glynn Davies.
</P>
<P>
Iran submitted the case on Monday at the Iran-U.S. Claims
Tribunal, which charged the United States for its decision to
allocate $20 million to undermine and sabotage the Iranian state.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have said privately that the Congress in close
meeting authorized for the fiscal year 1996 about $18 million for
covert action designed to "Boost democracy in Iran", according to
Reuters.
</P>
<P>
Iran has also lodged a complaint with the tribunal against a
new U.S. law penalizing foreign companies that invest $40 million
or more in Iran's energy sector.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Geneva, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister
Mohammed Javad Zarif said: "Both these laws in the United States
represent great breaches of the U.S. commitments under
international law in general and its obligations with regard to
Iran under the Algiers accord."
</P>
<P>
After Iran's Islamic revolution, the United States sent ther
Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher to negotiate with
Iran and reached the well-known Algiers Accord in 1981.
</P>
<P>
According to the accord, Iran freed 52 Americans held hostage
in Iran and the two countries agreed to set up the Iran-U.S.
Claims Tribunal to settle reciprocal financial claims following
the severing of diplomatic relations between them.
</P>
<P>
The United States also pledged not to interfere in Iran's
internal affairs under the accord.
</P>
<P>
Zarif said Iran would reserve the right to compensation. "We
hope the tribunal will deal with this case as speedily as
possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
Davies told reporters the State Department had just received a
copy of Iran's first suit and officials had to study it before
filing a formal response.
</P>
<P>
He said: "it would be irresponsible to fire back at them based
on press statements."

<HEADLINE> New York Stock Exchange Considers Moving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The New York Stock Exchange
said Monday that it is considering a move from its historic
93-year-old Wall Street site.
</P>
<P>
The world's largest stock market says it is in the process of
examining the space and technical limitations of the building to
determine whether it needs to relocate to a larger, more modern
location.
</P>
<P>
The neoclassic design of the cavernous, marble landmark was
conceived by architect Gearge Post and dedicated on April 22,
1903. Two sites were being considered, including a 1.5
million-square-foot, 33-story building at 2 Broadway. The other
plan involves a new building on two piers just below the South
Street Seaport by developer Donald Trump.
</P>
<P>
Both sites are not far from Wall Street of lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
The New York Stock Exchange has been expanded greatly over the
past decades. It has more than 3,000 shares being traded every
day. On July 16, more than 680 million shares were changed hands,
setting a record for NYSE.
</P>
<P>
The market has experienced many ups and downs along with
economic development of the country and the world, as well.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Take Downturn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street slid
today as a series of strong economic readings aggravated recently
soothed worries about inflation, sending interest rates higher on
the bond market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 57.70 to 5,647.28, the
biggest drop since the big market downturn in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by more than a 7-to-4
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with its volume increasing
slightly to 338.35 million shares from 312.16 million in the
previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 2.51 to 352.62, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 5.57 to 660.20.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 12.53 to 1,125.74, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 2.73 to
549.79.58 points.
</P>
<P>
Before the markets opened, the Commerce Department reported
that consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in July, slightly above
expectations.
</P>
<P>
The government also reported that retail sales edged up 0.1
percent last month, and two private research groups reported
strong sales at the nation's stores in early August.
</P>
<P>
After the reports, the price on the 30-year Treasury bond fell,
sending its yield -- a major influence on borrowing costs -- to
6.78 percent, up from late Monday's 6.68 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rising yield and the increased worry over a possible Fed
rate hike helped pulled down stocks.
