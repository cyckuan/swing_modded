130 Fear Dead in Philippine Jet Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- An Air Philippines jetliner carrying 130 people
crashed in the southern Philippines Wednesday and rescuers said there were no
signs of survivors. The Boeing 737-200, which began its flight in Manila,
circled its destination city of Davao, 625 miles southeast of Manila, before
going down in a coconut grove on nearby Samal island, officials said. Emergency
crews arriving at the site of the still-smoldering plane said there were no
signs of survivors. If that turns out to be the case, it would the worst plane
crash in Philippine history.

Miramax To Distribute Films on Web
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A major Hollywood studio is joining the ranks of small,
independent filmmakers who make their movies available over the Internet.
Miramax Films, a unit of the Walt Disney Co., has signed an agreement with
SightSound.com to offer 12 full-length feature films on the Web. The studio's
films include such critical and commercial successes as ''Shakespeare in Love,''
''The Cider House Rules'' and ''Pulp Fiction,'' but the company said Tuesday it
hasn't been decided yet which titles would be made available, how soon or at
what cost.

Japan Banks Agree on Merger
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. and Mitsubishi Trust and
Banking Corp. agreed Wednesday to set up a joint holding company, which would be
the world's fifth-largest financial group. The two banks will form the holding
company and integrate their operations by April next year, officials said. The
alliance would have $837 billion in deposits and other assets. The move will
enable the banks involved to compete against other planned megagroups in the
financial industry. The new firm will also manage $433 billion in pension and
other trusts, since it combines two BOT-Mitsubishi subsidiaries -- Nippon Trust
Bank and Tokyo Trust Bank -- with Mitsubishi Trust.

McCain To Back S.C. Flag Removal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain intends to tell an audience in South
Carolina Wednesday he favors removing the Confederate flag from atop the state
Capitol in Columbia, and regrets failing to say so while campaigning for the
White House, according to Republican officials. The flag issue flared briefly
during the presidential campaign, when Bush and McCain were competing for votes
in the South Carolina Republican primary in February. The state is home to
thousands of veterans and has a strong conservative streak.

Cops Probe Cuban Mission Attack
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- District police said Tuesday they have launched a criminal
investigation into allegations that some 15 people from the Cuban diplomatic
mission here assaulted Cuban-American protesters who were demanding that
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez remain in the United States. Some of the protesters
suffered minor injuries in the fracas just before nightfall last Friday and were
treated at local hospitals. The disclosure came as the State Department summoned
a top Cuban diplomat here to express ''extreme concern'' over the beatings.

Fed Court Shuts Down Megan's Law
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A federal appeals court has ordered a freeze on sex
offender notifications in New Jersey until it has time to review the fairness of
procedures being used by officials who issue the warnings. U.S. District Judge
Joseph Irenas last week ruled that the state's Megan's Law guidelines, as
revised by Attorney General John Farmer, provided a reasonable system for
warning neighbors about sex offenders while making sure the privileged
information was not leaked to the community at large. But the 3rd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Philadelphia issued an order Tuesday saying it wanted to
review these facts for itself.

<HEADLINE> Leaders acknowledge that budget will not be done this week  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State legislative leaders say disagreement
between the Legislature and Gov. George Pataki over spending, debt
reform and other issues means a new budget will not be in place by
their self-imposed deadline.
</P>
<P>
   While deals were made on most aspects of the $78 billion
spending plan for fiscal 2000-01, negotiations bogged down late
Monday and little progress was apparent Tuesday at untying the
knot.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, the wall the bargaining process hit Monday night
caused enough of a delay to prevent legislators from being
presented with the budget for passage by sundown today, when
Passover begins. Legislative leaders had wanted to use that
deadline to compel lawmakers to approve a new budget.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant problem in negotiations, at least from the
governor's perspective, appeared to be the questioning by Pataki's
Budget Division whether longer-term spending estimates of some
legislative programs were accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The numbers that came out were different from different
perspectives,'' state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said Tuesday.
''Right now, the Budget Division doesn't seem to agree with
legislative (fiscal committee) secretaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Assembly charged that Pataki, a Republican, had
gummed up the talks by insisting on a proposal he made in January
to have homeowners get their rebate checks directly from the state
instead of from school districts under the ''STAR'' property tax
reduction program.
</P>
<P>
   The other player in the budget negotiations, Senate Republican
Leader Joseph Bruno, said Tuesday he agreed with the change because
it would make it harder for school districts to conceal tax
increases from local residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's much more honest,'' Bruno said on radio station WROW-AM
in Albany. ''It's much more upfront. It's what the Legislature and
the governor originally intended when they put that (STAR program)
in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused Pataki, however, of wanting to get credit more
directly for the STAR program, which the governor championed before
it became law.
</P>
<P>
   The governor was also pushing for debt reform measures.
</P>
<P>
   The budget is for the fiscal year which began April 1. This is
the 16th straight year that budget adoption has been late.
</P>
<P>
   Not approving a budget this week will delay the process until
May 1. Legislative leaders say they will not have their members
work between Passover and Easter, and lawmakers planned to take
next week off for their annual spring vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature is not scheduled to be back in session until May
1. Lawmakers earlier this month passed a temporary spending bill
which will keep the state solvent through April 30.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this week's failure, both Silver and Bruno insisted
Tuesday that virtually all of the budget had been negotiated and
agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think most of the work has been done,'' Silver said.
''Drafting has to take place over the next week or two. Some of the
differences have to be ironed out.''

<HEADLINE> NYC Orders Livery Safety Measures  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Alarmed by the recent killings of car service
drivers, the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission voted unanimously
Tuesday to require all drivers to install either bulletproof
partitions or digital security cameras in their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has pledged $5 million in a grant program
to help pay for the security devices in the private cars for hire.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's what the federation asked the mayor to do, and the mayor
has granted us our wish,'' said New York State Federation of Taxi
Drivers President Fernando Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   Seven drivers have been killed this year, and 11 were killed in
1999, according to police statistics. None of the drivers killed
this year had a partition, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said another driver was wounded Tuesday when a passenger
attacked him with a machete.
</P>
<P>
   Commission chairwoman Diane McGrath McKechnie said the grant
will pay for drivers to buy partitions, which cost between $250 and
$350, but will pay only up to $350 for cameras, which start at
$600. She estimated that about half of the city's 41,000 livery
drivers have neither security device.
</P>
<P>
   The only exception to the new rule will be for cars owned by
companies that cater to corporate clients and take only vouchers or
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also stressed to drivers that they must stop
picking up street fares, something only yellow cabs are allowed to
do so. Car service drivers must be dispatched to passengers, but
many flout the rule to make extra money. Of the seven drivers
killed this year, police say six were killed by passengers they
picked up on the street.
</P>
<P>
   The commission adopted the rule on an emergency basis for the
next 60 days. Before the temporary measure expires, the commission
will hold public hearings to make it permanent. Drivers have 30
days to comply.

<HEADLINE> New York City philanthropist a possible Conservative Partycandidate  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A New York City philanthropist is emerging
as a possible Conservative candidate in the U.S. Senate race that
now pits Hillary Rodham Clinton against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Gilder said state Conservative Party Chairman Michael
Long approached her last week to discuss a possible run as a
third-party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has not been my life ambition to run for office, but on the
other hand, nobody seems want to run for office anymore except
people who seem to make a profession of it. We citizens kind of get
left in the dust,'' Gilder said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She possesses conservative principles,'' Long said. ''She
could turn this into a three-way race.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Party has said Republican Giuliani is not
conservative enough. The mayor supports abortion and gay rights and
refuses to denounce what critics call ''partial-birth'' abortion.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican has won statewide office in New York without
Conservative Party backing since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Gilder, a private investor, co-founded the anti-tax group Change
New York with her husband Richard and currently serves as
chairwoman of the group. The couple were major contributors to Gov.
George Pataki's 1994 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   She said it would take ''a few weeks'' before she reaches a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a lot of evaluating to do,'' she said. ''This is a
very preliminary discussion to a possible 'yes' decision.''
</P>
<P>
   If she does run, Gilder said she would focus on education
reform. She is a staunch proponent of school vouchers and in 1997
put up $1 million of her own money to offer private-school
scholarships for students who attended the Giffen Memorial
Elementary School in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Gilder also said she supports congressional term limits and tax
reform and opposes abortion.
</P>
<P>
   She said her beliefs are ''totally at odds'' with the first lady
but added that Conservatives are ''unclear about just how committed
and in what specific way (Giuliani) is about some issues that
concern us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilder said she would be able to make a ''considerable
contribution'' to financing her campaign but said it is still
premature to discuss that.
</P>
<P>
   Long said his party is also looking at other possible candidates
but refused to identify them.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Guerrillas Free Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By MARGARITA MARTINEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- In a move the government said will help
promote peace talks, Colombia's second-largest rebel army on
Tuesday freed eight hostages seized a year ago in the hijacking of
domestic airliner. Five people are still being held.
</P>
<P>
   ''This deed is very important,'' peace commissioner Victor G.
Ricardo was quoted as saying by the official government news agency
ANCOL. ''In this way we are getting closer to promptly initiating
the (peace) process'' with the National Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure of the Avianca airlines Fokker 50 by guerrillas of
the leftist ELN was widely seen as an attempt to pressure President
Andres Pastrana's government into opening a peace dialogue with the
rebel group.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 46 people kidnapped on April 12, 1999, all but five have
now been freed. One died in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   ELN leaders had said they would seek ransom for at least some of
the kidnap victims, but it could not be determined whether any
money was paid to secure Tuesday's releases.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is like coming back to life,'' said Leslie Kally, who
turned 18 during her captivity. She carried a wooden staff painted
with 372 rings, one for every day she was held.
</P>
<P>
   ''But no one is free here,'' Kally said of her country, where
much of the countryside is controlled by armed outlaws --
principally leftist rebels and right-wing paramilitary fighters.
''In Colombia we are all prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   The handover occurred in an area known as Zona Azul in the
remote northeastern region that the ELN is demanding the government
clear of troops as a condition for peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The ELN, with an estimated 5,000 fighters, is one-third the
strength of the main rebel band, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC. Pastrana withdrew troops from a huge swath of
southern Colombia in November 1998 as a condition for peace talks
with the FARC that have moved glacially.
</P>
<P>
   Pressuring for a government troop pullout in its traditional
stronghold in the northern state of Bolivar, the ELN has also
dynamited dozens of electrical pylons in recent months, forcing
rationing for millions of Colombians.

<HEADLINE> MD: Elian Suffering Abuse  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Amid rising tension during the wait for a court
ruling in the Elian Gonzalez case Tuesday, a pediatrician advising
the government said the boy is being psychologically abused by his
Miami relatives and should be removed from their care immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''This child ... continues to be horrendously exploited in this
bizarre and destructive ambiance,'' Dr. Irwin Redlener wrote to
Attorney General Janet Reno and Doris Meissner, the commissioner of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   His comments were the first time someone on the government side
has criticized how the 6-year-old Cuban boy is being treated, and
were quickly attacked by doctors for the Miami relatives. The
government released the letter Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the boy's mental health intensified as all sides
waited for a federal appeals court in Atlanta to decide whether the
government should be kept from letting the boy leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives have been fighting for custody ever since
Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off the Florida Coast.
His mother and 10 others drowned in an attempt to flee Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives have defied government efforts to unite the boy
with his father, who flew to Washington on April 6 hoping to gain
custody.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has indicated it would await the court
ruling before acting. But many in the crowd outside the relatives'
home fear that federal agents would swoop in and take the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The tension spilled over Tuesday night as a man had to be
hustled away in a police car after angering the crowd. More than
100 people pushed and shoved him away from the home before police
intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was holding a sign that said 'Send Elian Home,''' the man
said before he was taken away. Cuban-American leaders called the
man a ''pro-Castro instigator.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the crowd also pushed a man off the block after he
yelled, ''The child should go back to his father,'' witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., had urged a crowd of nearly
200 to remain peaceful earlier. ''Violence is not an option.
Whoever threatens violence is an enemy, an enemy of this child.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on a gusty Tuesday afternoon, the boy's great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, and others stood on the roof of the home and flew
kites as Elian watched from the backyard slide. Earlier, as he
walked to the front of the home, protesters yelled, ''Elian, my
friend!''
</P>
<P>
   Redlener, a professor of pediatrics at the Albert Einstein
College of Medicine in New York City and an unpaid adviser to
Meissner, selected the three mental health experts who met briefly
with Lazaro Gonzalez and the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Redlener cited the family's ''frantic'' legal
maneuverings, their allegations that Elian was abused by his father
and a homemade videotape in which the boy told his father he did
not want to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''The current environment and the production of the videotape
last week reflect a profoundly disturbing and dangerous environment
for this child,'' Redlener said.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives have said Elian would suffer psychologically
if returned to Cuba. Outside their Little Havana home, doctors said
Redlener could not make a valid assessment without examining the
child.
</P>
<P>
   ''We denounce and strongly oppose statements made by individuals
who have been expressing medical or psychological judgment without
following the most basic rules of medical ethics and care,'' said
Dr. Jose Carro, president of the Cuban Pediatric Society in Exile.
</P>
<P>
   A child psychiatrist with no connection to the case said she
doubted there was physical abuse, but it was clear Elian is living
in a disruptive situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this fight was going on with adults, the child should be
completely insulated from it. And I can't imagine how this child
has been insulated,'' said Dr. Gabrielle Carlson, a pediatrician
and child psychiatrist in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tragedy,'' she said, agreeing with Redlener's
conclusion that the boy should be removed.
</P>
<P>
   The latest accusations followed a weekend of bitter allegations.
The Miami relatives filed an affidavit alleging the father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, abused his wife and son.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez, in turn said that his relatives were
abusing the boy and turning him against his father.

<HEADLINE> Braves 4, Phillies 3, 12 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- John Rocker received a standing ovation in his
return to baseball Tuesday night and the Atlanta Braves defeated
the Philadelphia Phillies 4-3 on Brian Hunter's pinch-hit homer in
the 12th inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker pitched a scoreless ninth after serving a two-week
suspension for derogatory comments against immigrants, gays and
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker charged from the bullpen with his trademark sprint in the
ninth inning of a 3-3 game.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone in the crowd of 34,903 rose to their feet on a
cool, windy night, welcoming back the closer who had 38 saves for
the NL champions a year ago before setting off a national
controversy with his infamous magazine interview.
</P>
<P>
   There were no organized protests at Turner Field and many held
up signs in support, including ''Rocker for President'' and ''Like
A Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker struck out Mickey Morandini to begin the inning, walked
Desi Relaford on a 3-2 pitch before finishing off the inning by
getting Kevin Jordan and Doug Glanville on flyballs to left.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the bottom of the ninth
and many of the fans left after the Braves failed to score.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter led off the bottom of the 12th with a homer into the
left-field stands against Carlos Reyes (0-1). Hunter will likely be
sent to the minors when Brian Jordan comes off the disabled list
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves escaped a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the 10th.
Rookie Luis Rivera struck out Mike Lieberthal on a 3-2 fastball and
got Morandini on a grounder to short.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera (1-0) pitched 2 2-3 scoreless innings for his first major
league win. The Phillies had only one hit after the fifth inning
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gant homered and Morandini drove in two runs for the
Phillies, who took a 3-1 lead to the seventh. The Braves rallied
against reliever Amaury Telemaco, who created his own problems with
two walks before Chipper Jones hit a two-out, two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker began warming up in the eighth while Mike Remlinger
retired the Phillies in order. The fans near the right-field
bullpen cheered wildly.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were also glad to get Rocker back after going 6-6
while he was suspended. In his absence, the makeshift bullpen went
1-4 with a 5.14 ERA and two blown saves.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies went ahead with an unearned run in the second after
Eddie Perez dropped a pop-up in front of home plate, allowing Rico
Brogna to reach second. He came home on Morandini's single against
Greg Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   Gant, who flied to deep left in his first at-bat, reached the
stands in the third with his second homer of the season, making it
2-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves cut the lead in half in the bottom of the third.
Robert Person walked two before giving up a two-out, run-scoring
single to Quilvio Veras.
</P>
<P>
   But the Phillies restored their two-run lead in the fourth by
leading off with three straight hits, including another RBI single
by Morandini. Maddux did a good job of damage control, retiring
Desi Relaford on a popup, then striking out Person and Doug
Glanville.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta starter went seven innings, allowing eight hits and
two earned runs while striking out five.
</P>
<P>
   Person allowed six hits and a run during his six-inning stint.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Braves returned home after a 2-4 Midwestern road trip
to begin a nine-game homestand, matching the longest of the season.
... Attendance was bigger than three of the Braves's first six home
games. ... The Phillies began a seven-game road trip. ...
Philadelphia has committed only two errors in its first 12 games.

<HEADLINE> Rocker Receives Standing Ovation  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- John Rocker returned to a standing ovation
Tuesday night, pitching a scoreless ninth inning in his first game
since rejoining the Atlanta Braves after a two-week suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 34,903 gave Rocker a big cheer when the reliever
sprinted in from the bullpen. One fan held up a sign that read:
''Rocker for President.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker struck out the first hitter he faced, Philadelphia's
Mickey Morandini, walked the next batter and then got two flyouts.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker left with the score tied at 3. When he exited after his
one-inning outing, many of the fans left Turner Field, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves eventually won 4-3 in 12 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all out of the way,'' said Braves outfielder Brian
Jordan, one of the reliever's harshest critics initially.
''Rocker's back. Hopefully, things will quiet down a little bit and
we can get back to baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps hoping to avoid another misstep, Rocker continued his
policy of refusing to speak to the media about the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Beat it, media,'' he barked at reporters who surrounded his
locker after the game. ''Are you deaf?''
</P>
<P>
   There was hardly a hint of protest before the game, with Rocker
hoping fans remember his fastball more than his comments about
minorities, gays and immigrants. Overall, it seemed just like
another nondescript, midweek contest game for a lot more reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker said he heard only one negative remark while traveling
with the Braves last weekend in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a big deal,'' Rocker told TBS for an interview that
aired before the game. ''I think when the team starts winning and
we get the ball rolling, all that will be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates made peace with the reliever during spring
training and he had already pitched in Atlanta during an April 1
exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before the season, I was thinking about this night the whole
time,'' catcher Eddie Perez said. ''But once the season started, I
didn't remember anything about it until you guys brought it up.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he talked with Braves broadcaster Joe Simpson for the
interview with TBS, owned by the same company that owns the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Most fans arriving at the ballpark on a cool, windy night were
ready to welcome the reliever back.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not one person walking who hasn't opened his mouth and
said something he regrets,'' said Sandra Seagraves, munching on a
snack in the picnic area beyond the center-field stands. ''He
picked the wrong time to say the wrong thing. Unfortunately, he got
crucified for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Charles, added, ''I'm going to stand up and cheer
like crazy when he comes in.''
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Lee of New Orleans, in town for a convention, said he
wouldn't cheer for Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ''Personally, I'm not going to cheer for someone who seems to be
a heck of a lot more prejudiced than he's letting on to be,'' said
Lee, who is black. ''I wasn't a big fan of him before and I'm
certainly not now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves planned to put Rocker right back into his familiar
role as closer. A year ago, he had 38 saves -- one short of the
franchise record -- and his absence was felt as Atlanta split its
first 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen went 1-4 with a 5.14 ERA and two blown saves while
Rocker was suspended. Former closer Kerry Ligtenberg, coming back
from a serious elbow injury, struggled with a 10.13 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing we really missed was having him in the game,'' Perez
said. ''That's what I've been thinking about since the season
began.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillies first baseman Rico Brogna wasn't looking forward to the
prospect of facing Rocker in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not thinking about all that stuff that happened over the
winter,'' Brogna said. ''He's a very good pitcher. He adds another
dimension to their team. He makes it that much more difficult for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Atlanta-area civil rights groups protested at Turner Field
during the offseason and urged the Braves to trade Rocker. But they
decided not to picket Tuesday, saying they will probably raise the
issue again when the Braves play host to the All-Star game on July
11.
</P>
<P>
   General manager John Schuerholz admitted having ''serious''
trade talks concerning Rocker before the season but said those
discussions ''died down.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm past all my dreaded days,'' Schuerholz said. ''It's a
baseball game. He's a baseball player who made inappropriate,
insensitive comments four months ago. Most adults are willing to
let it go.'' The Braves were beginning a nine-game homestand,
easing the transition for Rocker. The team's next road trip begins
April 28 in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The harshest reactions are most likely to come in New York,
where Atlanta meets the Mets in a four-game series beginning June
29.
</P>
<P>
   Already, photocopied fliers have been passed out at Shea Stadium
advertising ''John Rocker Battery Day'' for Atlanta's first series
in New York, where fans are still outraged by the pitcher's
infamous interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''Imagine having to take the 7 train to (Shea Stadium) looking
like you're (in) Beirut next to some kid with purple hair, next to
some queer with AIDS, right next to some dude who got out of jail
for the fourth time, right next to some 20-year-old mom with four
kids,'' Rocker told the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   He also said, ''The biggest thing I don't like about New York
are the foreigners. I'm not a very big fan of foreigners. You can
walk an entire block in Times Square and not hear anybody speaking
English. .... How the hell did they get into this country?''

<HEADLINE> Bulls Honor B.J. Armstrong  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The chants from the stands were almost deafening
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''B.J.! B.J.! B.J.!'' the fans yelled as B.J. Armstrong sat on
the bench, smiling. In his last home game, he would have loved to
have gone back out there one more time. But the knees that are
forcing him to retire wouldn't let him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very nice, very special for me,'' he said after the
Bulls' 93-89 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday night.
''These fans are special. I can only say again I appreciate them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard every one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   After 11 years, four teams and three championship rings,
Armstrong's career is almost over. The Bulls finish tonight in
Detroit, his home town, and he'll try to play despite swelling in
his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got some family coming, so I want to play for them,''
said Armstrong, fifth on the NBA's career 3-point shooting list.
''I just have to see how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   If Tuesday night was his last time on the court, though, it was
a great goodbye. The Bulls honored him in a pregame ceremony. His
wife, Jennifer, and his parents watched from half-court as a
five-minute video tribute played on the Jumbotron above the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls also presented a $10,000 check to the Infant Welfare
Society of Chicago in his name.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sad in a way, but I'm happy, too,'' he said. ''I've been
able to last this long and experience the experiences I've had.
I've lived the dream.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates had some parting gifts for him, too. When he
walked into the locker room before the game, there was a carved
wooden rocking chair by his locker surrounded by an electronic
stimulus machine, pain reliever lotion and some bandages.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong laughed when he saw it. Though he's only 32, his body
can't take the physical demands of the NBA anymore. He had two
surgeries on his left knee this year, and missed 54 games because
of knee injuries.
</P>
<P>
   His wife is also expecting their first child this fall, and
Armstrong said he wants to be able to spend time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ''For whatever reason, I've just always wanted to be a dad, just
wanted to be a parent,'' he said. ''I didn't want to be anything
else to my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was Chicago's first-round choice in the 1989 NBA draft
out of Iowa, and was on the 1991, '92 and '93 NBA title teams. He
was left unprotected in the 1995 expansion draft and was selected
by the Toronto Raptors, who traded him to the Golden State
Warriors. He was an All-Star in 1996, when he averaged 12.3 points
on 47 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   He also played for Charlotte and Orlando before signing a
one-year free-agent contract with the Bulls last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never would have imagined I'd be playing for 11 years, let
alone achieve the things I've achieved,'' he said. ''This is every
kid's dream. It's been far beyond my wildest dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been a terrific ride, one I'll always cherish.''

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 7, Rockies 1  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Bernard Gilkey hit a two-run homer and Armando
Reynoso shut down Colorado for eight innings as the Arizona
Diamondbacks defeated the Rockies 7-1 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso (1-2) gave up three hits, walked two and struck out two.
He kept the ball low, allowing only three fly balls to the
outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso started the game by retiring 10 straight batters, and he
also retired his final 10.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona broke open the game with five runs in the eighth, capped
by Luis Gonzalez's two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Colbrunn led off the Arizona fourth with a single against
Scott Karl (0-1). After a forceout, Gilkey hit a liner 417 feet
into the lower grandstand in left-center field.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Womack added a two-run triple off Stan Belinda in the
eighth. Jay Bell drove in Womack with his second double of the game
and Gonzalez homered off Jerry Dipoto.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso stopped the Rockies until Mike Lansing doubled with one
out in the fourth. After Larry Walker walked, Jeff Cirillo made it
1-0 with a sharp single.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Rockies' 25th consecutive run without a homer, a span
of 2{ games.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies put runners on second and third with one out in the
fifth. Tom Goodwin hit a liner to Bell that he caught just above
the dirt, and the second baseman flipped it to second to double up
Brent Mayne.
Notes: Rockies LF Darren Bragg may have stolen an out in the first
inning when he raced to the warning track and gloved a long fly by
Gonzalez. In replays, it appeared the ball popped out of Bragg's
glove and hit the ground. He was booed at the plate the rest of the
game. ... Gonzalez went 1-for-5, slumping to 3-for-37 since he
opened the season by hitting in five straight games. ... Reynoso,
who gave up 19 runs in the first inning of his 27 starts last year,
has not allowed a first-inning run this year in three starts. ...
Karl missed a chance to reach .500 in his career, falling to 50-52
in his 150th start.

<HEADLINE> Profit Reports Are Generally Strong  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE MEYERSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- One after another, leading names from the
battered technology sector are offering some reassurance that the
Internet boom is not a mirage -- and that some companies are in fact
profiting from it.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, IBM, America Online and Qualcomm all topped Wall Street
forecasts on Tuesday with their reports on profits and revenues
from the first three months of the year. Last week, in the midst of
the stock market's seemingly endless slide, Sun Microsystems,
Advanced Micro Devices and Yahoo! did the same.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, however, strong profits are no guarantee against
further market convulsions. Then again, it can't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the 500 companies that make up the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index have now posted their first-quarter results, and
more than 70 percent of them surpassed expectations, according to
First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Based on readings such as those, estimates of the overall profit
growth among the S&AMP;P 500 companies have been nudged higher. The
latest surveys of industry analysts by First Call and IBES now call
for them to post a healthy 12 or 13 percent gain in their combined
profits compared with the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But with so many companies, including heavy hitters like
Microsoft Corp. on Thursday, still yet to report, the profit
backdrop is filled with potential land mines.
</P>
<P>
   Since market sentiment is so fragile after all the theatrics of
recent days, investors may conveniently ignore a series of strong
reports if a few of the big names come up short.
</P>
<P>
   It helps of course, that popular market measures like the Nasdaq
composite index now sit well below the eye-popping record highs
reached back in March.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having seen so many speculative excesses wrung out over the
past few weeks, the market is not in as precarious position as it
had been,'' said A.C. Moore, chief investment strategist for
Dunvegan Associates in Santa Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But, he cautioned, even at post-plunge levels, stocks remain
very pricey compared with traditional valuations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The overvaluation is not going to be cured by a good earnings
season,'' said Moore, asserting that stocks are still priced 32
percent above fair value and 10 percent above excessive valuations
that preceded the crash of 1987.

<HEADLINE> Stars 4, Oilers 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Guy Carbonneau scored on a long wrist
shot early in the third period Tuesday night, lifting the Dallas
Stars to a 4-3 playoff victory over the Edmonton Oilers, despite
Bill Guerin's hat trick.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas took a 3-1 lead in the Western Conference series and can
advance to the second round with a win at home Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Oilers goalie Tommy Salo appeared screened by defenseman Igor
Ulanov when Carbonneau's shot from the high slot went over his
glove hand, breaking a 3-3 tie just 5:01 into the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas capitalized on Edmonton defensive lapses to take a quick
2-0 lead in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull scored on a rebound at 5:02 after the Oilers' Tom
Poti failed to clear the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk caught the Oilers running
around in their own end 48 seconds later and scored on a slap shot
from the point.
</P>
<P>
   But Guerin tied the game before the period was finished.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano gave the Stars a 3-2 lead in the second when he cut
through the slot and fired a rebound past Salo. The Stars continued
to swarm around the Dallas net, but couldn't put the Oilers away.
</P>
<P>
   With less than two minutes to go in the second, Guerin walked in
to the left of goalie Ed Belfour and hammered a long slap shot that
skipped over Belfour's glove hand and into the net.
</P>
<P>
   That sent the 17,100 fans at Skyreach Centre into a frenzy for
the second consecutive game. Hats, white foam noodles and foam
puckheads cascaded down to salute the hat trick.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Doug Weight scored three times in Edmonton's 5-2 victory
in Game 3 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd taunted Belfour early and often. They heckled him in
warmups, during the national anthem and throughout the game,
sarcastically chanting ''Belfour! Belfour!'' and waving a forest of
white foam noodles in his direction.
</P>
<P>
   Stars forward Blake Sloan was knocked out of the game early
after he was hit in the face with a stick. Edmonton center Todd
Marchant, believed to be the victim of a hard Derian Hatcher hit,
was out for the second straight game.

<HEADLINE> East Coast Actors Back Ad Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Board members of two actors unions have
authorized a May 1 strike against producers of television and radio
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   East Coast board members of the Screen Actors Guild and the
American Federation of Television and Radio Actors voted
unanimously Sunday to reject a final offer from the American
Association of Advertising Agencies and the Association of National
Advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The unions' West Coast board members followed suit Tuesday
night, also voting unanimously to strike May 1.
</P>
<P>
   The unions' combined membership of about 135,000 had voted in
March authorizing the unions to call a strike.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides can't agree on the pay structure for commercials
that run on cable networks or on use of commercials on the
Internet, the unions said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   A long strike could mean more reruns of commercials --
advertising companies have an inventory of commercials ready to go
for the short haul.
</P>
<P>
   If advertisers continue producing commercials during a strike,
they would most likely have to use non-union members.
</P>
<P>
   The unions have been working without a contract since March 31.
Both sides had agreed to extend the pact while talks continued.

<HEADLINE> OSU's Redd Announcement Nearing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Ohio State junior Michael Redd will
annouce next week whether he'll make himself available for the NBA
draft, his mother said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Haji, said Redd plans to make the announcement
during a news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As for the decision, ''That's his news to tell,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   WSYX-TV, citing unnamed sources, said Redd will declare himself
eligible for the draft. But he will not be signing with an agent so
he can withdraw a week before the draft if he doesn't like what
he's hearing on where he will be chosen, the station said.
</P>
<P>
   WBNS-TV and WCMH-TV also reported that Redd had made up his mind
but will not make his intentions known until Tuesday. Those two
stations said Redd's father, James, provided that information.
</P>
<P>
   Redd, 6-foot-6 swingman from Columbus West High School, has
until May 14 to declare his intentions to enter the NBA draft,
which is June 28 in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Redd averaged 17.3 points and 6.5 rebounds last season for Ohio
State (23-7), which lost to Miami in the second round of the NCAA
South Regional.

131 Fear Dead in Philippine Jet Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- An Air Philippines jetliner carrying 131 people
crashed in the southern Philippines Wednesday and rescuers said there were no
signs of survivors. The Boeing 737-200, which began its flight in Manila,
circled its destination city of Davao, 625 miles southeast of Manila, before
going down in a coconut grove on nearby Samal island, officials said. Emergency
crews arriving at the site of the still-smoldering plane said there were no
signs of survivors. If that turns out to be the case, it would the worst plane

   NEW YORK (AP) -- In an overhaul of its midsize Oldsmobile Bravada sport
utility vehicle, General Motors Corp. has come up with something a little
larger, a little less gas-thirsty and a little more powerful. The 2002 model
that goes on sale next year represents a major shift in GM's strategy for future
midsize SUVs. By taking old technology and wringing more performance from it, GM
hopes to cut production costs while delivering more of the key traits that SUV
buyers want. The model is to be shown Wednesday at news media previews for the

<HEADLINE> TLC mandates partitions or cameras for livery cars  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The recent rash of livery cab driver murders has
spurred the Taxi and Limousine Commission to require all drivers to
install bulletproof partitions or digital security cameras in their
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the tragedies over the last couple of months show us
we have to move and we have to move quickly to protect the
drivers,'' commission chairwoman Diane McGrath McKechnie said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   This year, seven livery drivers have been killed. In 1999, 11
were murdered. None of the drivers killed this year had a
partition, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Another driver was injured Tuesday when a passenger attacked him
with a machete, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission convened a special meeting to vote on the rule,
which it adopted on an emergency basis for the next 60 days. Before
the temporary measure expires, the commission will hold public
hearings to make it permanent. Drivers have 30 days to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Mateo, president of the New York State Federation of
Taxi Drivers, said the TLC's ruling was a victory for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's what the federation asked the mayor to do, and the mayor
has granted us our wish,'' Mateo said. ''I think it's a step in the
right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has pledged $5 million in a grant program
to help pay for the security devices.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath McKechnie, the TLC commissioner, said the grant will pay
for drivers to buy partitions, which cost between $250 and $350,
but will pay only up to $350 for cameras, which start at $600. She
estimated that about half the 41,000 livery drivers currently have
neither of the security devices.
</P>
<P>
   The only exception to the new rule will be for livery cars owned
by companies that cater to corporate clients and take only vouchers
or credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   The TLC also stressed to livery drivers that they must stop
picking up street fares. Only yellow-cab drivers are allowed to do
so. Livery drivers must be dispatched to passengers, but many flout
the rule and take street hails to make extra money.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven drivers killed this year, six were murdered by
passengers they picked up on the street, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A street passenger fatally shot livery driver Luis Francisco
Perez once in the back of his head Friday, making the 29-year-old
the sixth driver killed this year. On Tuesday, a huge funeral
procession made up of livery cars accompanied Perez's body from a
funeral home in the Washington Heights neighborhood where he lived
to the site of his death in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The procession then headed for John F. Kennedy International
Airport for the flight to Perez's native Dominican Republic, where
he was to be buried.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, two police officers on patrol in the Bronx saw
livery driver George Radhaes running after a man around 3:15 p.m.
at 190th Street and Grand Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Radhaes told the officers that he had picked the man up at
another Bronx location and that the suspect had pulled out a
machete and demanded money. There was a struggle, and Radhaes was
cut on the hand. He was taken to Montefiore Medical Center for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The officers chased the suspect, who was identified as Ignancio
Molina, 43, of the Bronx. He was in custody this morning.

<HEADLINE> Knights of Columbus building $10 million museum  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- The Knights of Columbus are building a
$10 million museum near their headquarters to showcase religious
art and teach people about the history of the 118-year-old group
and Roman Catholicism in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Also on display will be personal items and correspondence of the
Rev. Michael J. McGivney, a candidate for sainthood, who founded
the Knights of Columbus in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers will have access to archives, a library and rare
books. A theater and a gallery for touring art exhibits also are
planned.
</P>
<P>
   The museum will be free and open to the public, including area
school groups, Supreme Knight Virgil C. Dechant, the leader of the
1.6 million-member organization, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really want to appeal to the public at large,'' Dechant
said.
</P>
<P>
   Arts organizations in the area welcome the new attraction, said
Lisa Rovello, director of development and communication for The
Arts Council of Greater New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   The city already attracts about 2 million visitors a year to its
museums, galleries, theaters, concert halls, festivals and historic
attractions, Rovello said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is going to be an exciting addition to the great
range of cultural attractions greater New Haven has to offer,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Renovations of a three-story office building are underway, with
an opening planned for the fall and a grand opening ceremony
planned for next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Many exhibits will be relocated from a small museum in the
headquarters building that was inadequate to display the group's
holdings. Other items will be put on public display for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   Dechant said he hoped the museum would increase the number of
art works, artifacts and memorabilia donated to the group.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor John DeStefano said the museum will form a trinity of
attractions for visitors to New Haven who want to learn about the
Knights. Each year, Knights from all over the world come to the
city to see the headquarters building and St. Mary's Church, where
McGivney founded the organization and where he is entombed.
</P>
<P>
   The museum plan ''adds a sense of excitement about the city,''
DeStefano said.
</P>
<P>
   The Knights of Columbus are paying for the whole project. The
nonprofit service organization for Roman Catholic families does
charity work and runs an insurance program for members.

<HEADLINE> Researchers meet to look for answers in lobster dieoff  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A group of environmentalists and
scientists has come up with an action plan as they try to discover
why a record numbers of lobsters are dying in the western portion
of Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   According to lobstermen's estimates, about 90 percent of their
catch has been lost since September.
</P>
<P>
   The lobstermen traded ideas and suggestions during a two-day
''lobster health symposium'' that ended Tuesday. Both the
lobstermen and the scientists who attended the conference said
there is no readily identifiable single cause for the lobster
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The action plan developed by those who attended the conference
includes:
</P>
<P>
   --collecting more data on the lobsters
</P>
<P>
   --establishing a timeline to determine exactly when they began
dying, in what areas of the sound and in what numbers
</P>
<P>
   --implimenting a tagging program so lobsters can be tracked to
see if they are moving to the eastern part of the sound.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the lobstermen suggested their catch was killed by
pesticides that were sprayed in Connecticut and New York last fall
to combat the outbreak of the West Nile virus spread by mosquitoes.
The lobsters began dying in large numbers in September, just after
the spraying.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggested that the high mortality was caused by hypoxia --
low oxygen content in the water -- which has been a long-standing
problem in the sound. Still others said the lobsters may have
suffered from thermal stress because the waters may have been too
warm.
</P>
<P>
   Richard French, a veterinary pathologist at the University of
Connecticut, said testing done on about 300 lobsters since October
has shown that a parasite called a paramoeba is infecting the
lobsters. But UConn scientists are checking whether other factors,
such as pesticides, sewage treatment plant discharge, other
contamination, thermal stress or hypoxia are contributing to the
dieoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we don't know is what role those factors play in the
overall health of the lobsters ... so we don't have all the
answers,'' French said.
</P>
<P>
   French said healthy lobsters normally are able to fight off the
parasite, and scientists still don't what is making lobsters
susceptible to the parasite this time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bayer, executive director of the Lobster Institute at the
University of Maine, said the lobster population in Maine has not
been affected by the parasite. Even lobstermen in the eastern
portion of Long Island Sound have also been largely unaffected,
although they have reported an increase in the number of lobsters
with shell disease.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer, who also tested some of the dead lobsters taken from the
western portion of the sound, said he found an assortment of
bacteria in the blood of many of the lobsters, but not all.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, finding the cause is partly a process of
elimination,'' he said. ''We want to know what is different about
what happened in Long Island Sound this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Five lobstermen's associations also plan to collect dead
lobsters and sediment from the sound to submit to an independent
lab for additional testing. The testing is being funded by a New
York-based fisheries conservation group, FISH Unlimited Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Long Island Sound is the nation's No. 3 lobster market behind
Maine and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut brings in about 3.5 million pounds a year, while New
York brings in about 8.5 million pounds.

<HEADLINE> Scott Smith files motion claiming jury misconduct  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- The New Milford police officer
convicted of manslaughter for killing an unarmed suspect has asked
the trial judge to overturn the verdict because of alleged juror
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   In his motion Tuesday, Scott Smith's attorney, John Kelly, cited
nine instances of alleged juror misconduct during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Waterbury State's Attorney John Connelly, who tried the case,
said he was confident the conviction would stand. Smith is
scheduled to be sentenced on May 5.
</P>
<P>
   Smith originally was charged with murder after fatally shooting
Franklyn Reid, 27, in the back at point-blank range. He claimed the
shooting was in self defense. Kelly said the jury never reached a
unanimous verdict on the murder charge before discussing and voting
to find Smith guilty of manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Kelly said:
</P>
<P>
   --One juror displayed a badge to the jurors, stated that he had
law enforcement experience, that he knew about training police
officers received, and that the manner in which the defendant shot
and killed Franklyn Reid was improper and was not consistent with
police training.
</P>
<P>
   --One or more of the jurors stated they had served in the
military, had been in combat, that the defendant's shooting
Franklyn Reid was like being in combat but was not justified.
</P>
<P>
   -- Several jurors stated to the other jurors that they wanted to
have the court reporter re-read the defendant's testimony. The
other jurors refused to let the several jurors prepare a written
request to the trial judge to have the defendant's testimony read
to them.
</P>
<P>
   --Upon entering the jury room to begin deliberations, and before
deliberations had begun, one juror stated to the other jurors that
he had made up his mind that the defendant was guilty of murder. He
further stated he doubted that the other jurors would agree to find
the defendant guilty of murder so he would instead vote for a
manslaughter conviction and urged them to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   --One or more jurors brought notes or pieces of paper into the
jury deliberation room and either read or consulted these notes or
pieces of paper during deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   --One juror drove by the location where the defendant shot and
killed Franklyn Reid. The juror did this is an effort to determine
whether a witness who testified for the State and who was located
in a Sunoco Gas Station in close proximity to the scene of the
shooting could observe where the defendant and Franklyn Reid were
located prior to and after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   --One juror stated that he had shot and killed deer and that a
deer's legs were positioned in a certain way when it fell. The
juror compared the position of the deer's legs to the position of
Franklyn Reid's arms when he fell after he was shot and killed.
</P>
<P>
   --One juror, referred to as ''Rambo'', caused other jurors to be
fearful and intimidated them into a compromised manslaughter
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Litchfield Superior Court Judge Charles D. Gill could grant
Smith a new trial, or rule that the alleged statements were proper
in the context of heated deliberations.

<HEADLINE> Sheriffs fate to be decided by voters  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Connecticut voters will decide if the
jobs now overseen by the eight county sheriffs should be controlled
by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 147-2 Tuesday to place an amendment to the state
Constitution on the November ballot that would do away with the
sheriff system. The Senate overwhelmingly passed the measure last
week, and it does not need the governor's approval.
</P>
<P>
   On a 143-4 vote, the House also passed a bill that would put the
jobs done by sheriffs and their deputies under state agency
control. Those reforms would go into effect Dec. 1, but would be
contingent upon voter approval of the constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The reform bill, which also needs approval by the Senate and
Gov. John G. Rowland, would prohibit county sheriffs from raising
money from their employees and pressuring them to campaign against
the constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Lawlor, D-East Haven, said he's confident the
referendum will pass and the reforms will be in place by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sheriffs are finished -- over. Game over,'' Lawlor said.
</P>
<P>
   But the eight county sheriffs may be swept into the new system,
which would be overseen by the state's Judicial Department.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Judicial Branch, six of the eight county
sheriffs have been sworn in as Hartford County deputies.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's like having the governor appoint himself as a judge in
the middle of an election campaign,'' said Rowland spokesman Dean
Pagani. Rowland began pushing for the abolition of the sheriffs
system last year.
</P>
<P>
   New Haven County Sheriff Frank Kinney said sheriffs are
traditionally deputized in other counties.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't look at that as an auspicious occasion,'' Kinney said.
''It's just a tradition of the system. I have no intention of
moving to Hartford County or any other county.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the sheriff system say it is rife with corruption,
mismanagement and patronage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is important we eliminate the office of high sheriff as
soon as possible,'' Lawlor said. ''The office has outlived its
usefulness in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Annette Carter, D-Hartford, said the high sheriffs
aren't the ones creating the problems. She said reforms are needed,
but they could be done by keeping the current system in tact.
</P>
<P>
   ''We pass more laws up here that don't take care of the
problem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's son-in-law served as a supervisor in the Hartford
County sheriffs department.
</P>
<P>
   Under the reform bill, special deputies who now guard
courthouses and transport prisoners would be grandfathered into a
new system as judicial marshals. The deputies currently serving
legal papers such as subpoenas and summonses would be called state
marshals and work for the state as private contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Both judicial marshals and state marshals would maintain their
power of arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms would cost the state as much as $3.6 million,
according to the non-partisan Office of Fiscal Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Several scandals have shaken the sheriffs system in the past
year, including the alleged rape of a female prisoner being
transported in a New Haven County sheriffs van. In addition, two
county sheriffs have pleaded innocent to criminal charges. The
sheriff system is also under investigation by state and federal
agencies.

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 116, Clippers 100  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Steve Smith scored 24 points and Scottie
Pippen had 18 Tuesday night as the Portland Trail Blazers defeated
the Clippers 116-100 to run Los Angeles' losing streak to 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   In a game with nothing concrete at stake, the playoff-bound
Trail Blazers took the lead early and stayed in front by double
digits most of the rest of the way against the NBA's worst team.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers are 14-67.
</P>
<P>
   Portland had well-balanced scoring, with Brian Grant adding 15
points, Rasheed Wallace 14 and Arvydas Sabonis 12.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was 11-of-16 from the floor as the Trail Blazers shot 64
percent to Los Angeles' 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Anderson and Tyrone Nesby led the Clippers with 20 points
each. Lamar Odom had 15 points and Michael Olowokandi 10 points and
14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, behind from when the game was 2{ minutes old, cut
the lead to 59-49 early in the third quarter, but Smith and Pippen
then hit consecutive 3-pointers and Portland went on to lead 86-70
heading into the final quarter. Los Angeles did not threaten again.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers were up 57-45 at halftime, with Smith leading
the way with 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   Odom scored 14 for Los Angeles in the first half to keep the
game from turning into a runaway.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Taylor, the Clippers' top scorer this season at 17.1
points a game, missed his fourth game in a row with a sore left
ankle and might be unable to play when Los Angeles closes its
season on Wednesday at Seattle -- which would also be his final game
with the team. Taylor will leave as a free agent after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had eight points and Wallace seven as Portland outscored
Los Angeles 15-6 over the last six minutes of the opening quarter
to open a 36-20 lead. Smith had 13 points in the quarter and the
Trail Blazers shot 60 percent from the floor to 32 percent for the
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999-2000 Clippers, with one game left, are assured of being
only the second worst in franchise history. That distinction
belongs to the 1986-87 team, which lost 70 games.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was a sellout of 18,964 and the Clippers' first season
at the Staples Center was a box-office success by their standards,
as they drew a franchise-record 559,714, an average of 13,651 a
game.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The game was meaningless for the Trail Blazers as well as
the Clippers, although for far different reasons. Portland earlier
locked up the third seed in the Western Conference and home-court
advantage throughout the playoffs, with the exception of an
eventual series against the Lakers. ... With a victory over the
Nuggets in the regular-season finale Wednesday at Denver, the Trail
Blazers would reach 60 wins in a season for only the second time in
franchise history. The 1990-91 Portland team went 63-19, but lost
to the Lakers in the Western Conference finals. ... The Clippers
probably missed their best chance to end their latest losing streak
when they came up short Sunday in a 115-114 overtime loss to
Denver, Los Angeles' first overtime game of the year.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 5, Astros 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Todd Hundley hit a go-ahead two-run homer and
Adrian Beltre and Devon White also homered as the Los Angeles
Dodgers beat the Houston Astros 5-3 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Dreifort (1-1) pitched six innings, allowing three runs
and three hits, including Jeff Bagwell's tiebreaking solo homer in
the top of the sixth and Richard Hidalgo's two-run single in the
fourth. Dreifort struck out eight and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros started the winning rally in the sixth with a
one-out ground-rule double against Houston starter Octavio Dotel
(0-2). Hundley, played extremely shallow by center fielder Roger
Cedeno, cleared the fence with the next pitch just as Cedeno
arrived at the wall.
</P>
<P>
   White greeted Doug Henry with his third homer of the season
leading off the seventh to make it 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Shaw pitched the ninth for his fifth save.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre drove in the Dodgers' first two runs with a sacrifice fly
and a two-out homer that tied the score at 2 in the fourth. Before
that, Beltre had only three RBIs in 40 career at-bats against
Houston pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo gave the Astros a 2-1 lead in the top of the fourth,
singling to center on a 3-2 pitch for the only hit of the inning.
Dreifort issued a leadoff walk to Cedeno, who took second on
Dreifort's wild pickoff throw. Bagwell, whose fourth homer extended
his hitting streak to 10 games, was hit by a pitch before Ken
Caminiti advanced both runners with a groundout to first base.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel (1-1) allowed four runs and seven hits in six innings and
struck out 10, tying the career high he established last Aug. 6
against the Dodgers while with the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield of the Dodgers went 0-for-3 with two strikeouts
and was hit by a pitch, as he failed to get a hit for the first
time in 13 games this season. He had hit in 18 consecutive games,
including the final six last season.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Dodgers have not had consecutive games rained out at
Dodger Stadium since April 19-21, 1988, when their three-game
series with San Diego was postponed. ... With the AL and NL umpires
now operating under the same umbrella, longtime AL ump Joe Brinkman
worked his first game at Dodger Stadium since the 1978 World
Series. Derryl Cousins, in his 22nd season as a big-league umpire,
made his Chavez Ravine debut at third base.

<HEADLINE> 2 Disqualified in Wheelchair Race  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- It doesn't bother Jean Driscoll that two people
who don't need wheelchairs tried to compete in the Boston Marathon
wheelchair race. After all, they didn't get in her way.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly, if they had come forward and won prize money, a few
of us would be up in arms,'' Driscoll said Tuesday, a day after she
won her eighth Boston wheelchair race.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after Rosie Ruiz was stripped of her title because
she used a trolley as a shortcut, Marathon organizers disqualified
two able-bodied racers from the wheelchair competition. ''To the
best of my knowledge, that's never happened before,'' said Marja
Bakker, a member of the Boston Athletic Association's adjudication
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers don't release the names of those disqualified unless
they finish in the money. Neither is contesting the
disqualification, and B.A.A. spokesman Jack Fleming said it may
have been more a misunderstanding than an attempt to deceive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it was done with any sort of bad intent,'' he
said. ''I would hate, for the sake of these people, if the
impression was that they were trying to pull something over on the
disabled community.''
</P>
<P>
   The two apparently did not give an explanation, but they may not
have known it was not allowed. In Canada, for example, it is
neither uncommon nor against the rules for able-bodied athletes to
participate in wheelchair sports -- a ''reverse integration'' that
fills up leagues and helps the ambulatory understand what
wheelchair athletes experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of your elite wheelchair athletes say, 'Bring 'em on,'''
said Todd Hatfield, the program manager of Wheelchair Sports USA,
the national governing body. ''If they're willing to work that hard
-- typically they're carrying some extra weight, because of the legs
and so forth -- they might want the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I just can't imagine an A.B. (able-bodied) wanting to get
in and push a racing chair. I cannot see it. Those people must have
been very hardcore.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, wheelchair sports are limited to those
with ''any lower limb impairment that prevents you from competing
in the able-bodied analog sport,'' Hatfield said. Those who qualify
are further classified based on the degree of impairment.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, those who apply to enter the wheelchair race are
interviewed so they can be put into the right classification. ''The
people who work on that aspect really get to know them,'' Fleming
said.
</P>
<P>
   Six to 12 people are disqualified from the Marathon in a typical
year -- none more notorious than Ruiz, who was the top female
finisher in 1980 with a time that was then the third-fastest in
women's history. Officials determined she skipped part of the race
and, eight days after crowning her champion, stripped her of the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a California couple finished first in their respective
age divisions -- seconds away from record times -- but they didn't
look tired or sweaty enough to have run a marathon. When they
didn't show up on surveillance videotapes that had been added
because of Ruiz, they were disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   This year, race judges noticed the two wheelchair racers moving
around the starting line without any apparent impairment. The two
were allowed to race before being approached after they finished;
Bakker said one immediately acknowledged, ''I am not disabled.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The wheelchair division is for people with an impaired range
of motion. That's what it's for,'' Fleming said. ''We have a
division for people who can run.''
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll said she wasn't so much offended as surprised that
someone would choose to scrunch into a racing chair for more than
two hours.
</P>

   ''I don't think they're making light of (disabilities). I think
it's kind of funny they would want to cramp their legs up for 26
miles,'' she said. ''There's a level of comfort you need to be able
to do that.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Doesn't Expect Sydney Protests  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee
has played down the possibility of violent protests by Aboriginal
activists during the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Aboriginal leaders recently threatened violent demonstrations
following the leak of an Australian government report that
minimized the harm caused by a policy of taking Aboriginal children
from their families.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over what is known as the ''stolen generation''
was discussed Tuesday as Sydney organizers briefed the IOC
executive board on preparations for the Sept. 15-Oct. 1 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not expecting violent demonstrations,'' said Australian
IOC vice president Kevan Gosper. ''There may be some (nonviolent)
demonstrations. We hope not too many.''
</P>
<P>
   IOC leaders expressed confidence in Sydney organizers, who have
been under fire in Australia following a series of ticketing and
budget problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are pretty confident the organization is really
excellent,'' said IOC executive Jacques Rogge, who heads the
committee's oversight panel for Sydney. ''Overall, I'm confident
that everything that humanly could have been done has been done.''
</P>
<P>
   With less than five months before the opening ceremony, Sydney
still has to sell more than $120 million worth of tickets in
Australia to meet its budget.
</P>
<P>
   Knight said the next round of sales would begin in May.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very confident,'' Rogge said. ''We know there is great
interest from the Australian public.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney and the IOC moved Tuesday to defuse the dispute over
television access to Homebush, a public area that is the site for
most of the marquee sports for the Olympics, including track and
field, swimming, basketball and gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   Knight announced a compromise plan -- approved by the IOC -- to
allow a restricted number of non-rights-holding broadcasters to
film inside Homebush.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, Olympic officials will issue eight permits
per day to international non-rights-holders and eight to Australian
non-rights-holders.
</P>
<P>
   The permits will be issued on a rotating basis by the Olympic
Coordination Authority, a body of the New South Wales government
that controls the Homebush site.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcasters will be prohibited from filming inside the
stadiums, filing live reports or interviewing athletes outside the
venues.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney officials have cited crowd control as a main reason for
their decision to restrict TV access to the area.
</P>
<P>
   Under previously announced guidelines, all non-rights-holders
would have been banned from the entire Sydney Olympic Park area.
Among those affected were CNN, ESPN, Fox, Associated Press
Television News and Reuters Television.
</P>
<P>
   The rule would have restricted access to local Australian
rights-holders and NBC, which paid $705 million for exclusive U.S.
rights to the games.
</P>
<P>
   The ban led to official protests by TV companies and the threat
of possible legal action against Sydney Olympic officials.
</P>
<P>
   APTN managing editor Sandy MacIntyre welcomed Tuesday's
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a victory for common sense and enables the
international news organizations to report the news events that
surround every Olympic Games in a proper manner,'' he said. ''It's
the Olympic ideal that there should be access for all.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has accredited 140 non-right-holders for Sydney,
suggesting the competition will be fierce for the daily permits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to balance crowd management and the legitimate
interests of news media, while protecting our rights holders,''
Knight said. ''They have paid a lot of money for the rights and
don't deserve to be ambushed.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight acknowledged the plan won't satisfy everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's a fair compromise,'' he said. ''It's always a
balancing act. When you reach a compromise, you usually don't make
everybody happy. But it's almost always the best result.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Ninian Stephen, a former High Court justice and
governor-general of Australia, was appointed a member of the IOC
ethics commission.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen fills the seat vacated by Gosper, who resigned from the
ethics panel last month amid allegations he accepted excessive
hospitality from Salt Lake City bidders.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics panel was created last year to enforce a code of
conduct for IOC members following the bribery scandal centering on
Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. Stephen becomes
the fifth non-IOC member on the eight-man commission.
</P>
<P>
   Gosper, who denies any wrongdoing, remains under investigation
by the ethics panel for a ski trip his wife and two children made
to Utah in 1993 at the invitation of bid chief Tom Welch.

<HEADLINE> No Dress Rehearsal for Barkley  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Charles Barkley's big farewell will be in Houston
on Wednesday. There was no dress rehearsal in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley had flirted with the idea of making a cameo appearance
in the Rockets' game Tuesday night against the Suns, a team he led
to the NBA Finals in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's shoot-around, he said he would be in uniform but
wouldn't play. But the Rockets never even activated Barkley, and he
wasn't in uniform when the team took the court.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, when the lights were out for the introduction of the
Suns, he walked onto the court, hardly noticed by the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to take away from the game,'' Barkley said.
''I've been in the limelight really for 19, 20 years now. I wasn't
playing tonight. It wasn't about me. That's why I waited until the
lights went out.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the third and fourth quarters of Tuesday's game, Barkley
was introduced to the crowd, which responded with a huge ovation.
He tossed a basketball to the Suns' mascot, The Gorilla, who
performed one of his trademark dunks from a trampoline. Barkley
signed the ball and waved to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no gifts, and no serious ceremony. When Barkley
left the Suns in 1996, there were bitter feelings between him and
owner Jerry Colangelo, and that hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the fans have always been terrific here,'' Barkley
said, ''but I don't ever think the Suns organization appreciated
what I brought to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said earlier Tuesday that doctors believe because his
injured knee is only at about 70 percent its normal strength, it
would be too risky for him to play on consecutive nights, even for
just a minute or two.
</P>
<P>
   ''Charles doesn't have to prove anything,'' Houston coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. ''The guy's one of the greatest players to ever
play the game. We love what he's done for us.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me what makes sense is to have one final tribute at home.
Why take the chance of getting him loose here and then having a
back-to-back situation? That just doesn't make sense to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley called an end to his 16-year career after he ruptured a
knee tendon Dec. 8 in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But, after rehabilitation, he will make a final appearance in
the Rockets' last game Wednesday at home against Vancouver. He
wants to end his career by walking off the court, not being carried
off.
</P>
<P>
   A brief appearance in Phoenix had seemed fitting. That would
have allowed him to play his last three games in cities where he
played -- Philadelphia, Phoenix and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley has a home in Phoenix, and he played four seasons with
the Suns when he was in his prime. His first season with the Suns,
he averaged 25.6 points and 12.2 rebounds as Phoenix reached the
NBA Finals, where they lost to Chicago. It was as close as Barkley
would get to a championship ring.
</P>
<P>
   He said the injury has allowed him time to face life after
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though I had great sadness that I got hurt, it's kind of
been preparing me for what my life is going to be like next year,''
Barkley said. ''If I had played the entire season, I can honestly
say it would have been really hard and difficult the last month.''
</P>
<P>
   So now he goes back to Houston, to end it on his own terms.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just been fun. That's the only way to explain it,'' he
said. ''Not many people get to do something they really like to do
for a living. I'm so blessed to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I first started, I said I want to make a million dollars
a year and play for 10 years. My only goal was to take care of my
mother and my grandmother and obviously I've done that. Everything
else has been, 'Wow! Unbelievable!'''

<HEADLINE> Baseball Wants To Realign, But How?  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Bud Selig and his aides don't play rotisserie
baseball, they play rotisserie schedule.
</P>
<P>
   How about this alignment?
</P>
<P>
   How about that schedule?
</P>
<P>
   Just about everyone in baseball agrees there should be more
intradivision games and September matchups among contenders.
</P>
<P>
   How to do it is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why major league owners have put off a decision on
realignment until June. But the commissioner promises changes will
indeed be coming.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be some realignment,'' Selig said Monday night
after owners cut short their spring meeting, having completed their
agenda in one day. ''We'll go to an unbalanced schedule, rotate
divisions. Everything I wanted to do, I will do.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first 60 years of the 1900s, it was simple: each league
had eight teams, and each team played every other team 22 times for
a 154-game season.
</P>
<P>
   Then came expansion to 10 teams per league, and each team played
every other team 18 times for a 162-game schedule.
</P>
<P>
   When the American and National leagues increased to 12 teams
apiece in 1969, each league split into two six-teams divisions, and
there was a major change. Teams still had 18 games against division
rivals, but they cut games against teams in the other division to
12.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1977, came another major change as the AL increased to 14
teams and went to the so-called balanced schedule: 13 games against
division rivals, 12 against teams in the other division. For the
first time, interdivision games outnumbered intradivision games.
</P>
<P>
   ''A one-year experiment which lasted 23 years -- which is not
unusual in baseball,'' Selig said.
</P>
<P>
   Since each league split into three divisions in 1994 and
interleague play began in 1997, each schedule has become a
patchwork. Teams in the same city are home at the same time, teams
criss-cross the country on long road trips, intradivision games
dwindle.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest problem we've had is clubs really don't like the
schedule,'' Selig said. ''They've grumbled.''
</P>
<P>
   So Selig, working with Boston Red Sox chief executive officer
John Harrington, Philadelphia Phillies CEO Dave Montgomery and NL
senior vice president Katy Feeney, settled on this as the best
option for 2001:
</P>
<P>
   --Arizona would move to the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   --Texas would move to the AL Central.
</P>
<P>
   --Tampa Bay would move to the NL.
</P>
<P>
   --The NL would have four four-team divisions.
</P>
<P>
   --The AL would have six teams in the Central, four each in the
East and West.
</P>
<P>
   ''The National League works out pretty well,'' Selig said. ''The
only real negative one has heard is there's no wild card.''
</P>
<P>
   Under this plan, each NL team would play 20 games against each
division rival, AL East and AL West teams would play 18 each, and
AL Central teams would play 14 each against three division rivals,
15 apiece against the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Filling out the schedule would be interdivision and interleague
games.
</P>
<P>
   But teams in the AL Central object to a six-team division. And
some NL owners don't want to lose the wild card, which allows more
teams to remain in contention until the season's final weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's so much up in the air that has to be considered,''
Harrington said before updating owners. ''We'll let them think
about it, see where it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington says three plans remain under consideration, with
more possibilities ahead. Under most plans, the NL remains with 16
teams, but one has 15 teams in each league -- with at least one
interleague game nearly every day.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona owner Jerry Colangelo has been the biggest protester. He
doesn't want to leave the NL.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Diamondbacks and Devil Rays, the two newest teams in
the majors, can be forced to change leagues against their will.
Every other team has veto power over league shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The NL made a mistake putting Arizona there,'' Kansas City
Royals president Mike Herman said. ''That has to be corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   David Glass, the Royals new owner, was among the proponents of
radical realignment in 1997. In that plan, there would be major
shifts, with teams grouped geographically.
</P>
<P>
   Several traditional NL teams objected, not wanting to blur
distinctions and not wanting two teams from the same market in the
same division. That message got through to central baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do believe in geographical rivalries,'' Selig said, ''but
the leagues do have this history and tradition.''

<HEADLINE> Rockets 107, Suns 98  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Shandon Anderson tied his career high with 35
points as the Houston Rockets beat Phoenix 107-98 Tuesday night to
hurt the Suns' bid for home-court advantage in the first round of
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Hardaway's first triple-double since 1994 wasn't enough
for the Suns, who fell behind by 17 in the first half, battled back
to tie it in the fourth quarter, then were outscored 20-11 over the
final 8{ minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After losing two in a row at home for the first time this
season, Phoenix has fallen into a tie with San Antonio for the No.
4 spot in the Western Conference. Since the Spurs hold the
tiebreaker edge, the Suns' only hope is that San Antonio loses at
home to the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday and Phoenix wins at
Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's guards shredded Phoenix's defense. Besides Anderson's
big game, Steve Francis had 27 points, eight assists and seven
rebounds, and Cuttino Mobley added 24 points, 20 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley had considered making a cameo appearance in the
game. But he was in street clothes on the Houston bench to cheer on
the Rockets' sixth victory in seven games. Barkley plans to play
briefly in the Rockets' final game, Wednesday against Vancouver in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway had 20 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds for his third
career triple-double. Cliff Robinson also scored 20, 14 in the
second half. Randy Livingston added 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   Houston led 69-55 on Anderson's three-point play with 4:35 left
in the third quarter. Todd Day scored seven in a row, starting with
a 3-pointer, as the Suns outscored the Rockets 16-5 the rest of the
quarter to cut it to 74-71 on Robinson's 3-pointer with 17.8
seconds left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns finally caught Houston at 76-76 on Livingston's
three-point play with 10:44 to play. The game was tied twice more,
the last time at 81-81 on Hardaway's drive with nine minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson scored seven during a 14-2 spurt that put Houston
ahead for good 95-82 on Kelvin Cato's two free throws with 4:32
left.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson made two free throws and Moochie Norris sank a
3-pointer to put the Rockets up 86-81. Then, with 7:17 to go,
Francis drove the lane and banged into Livingston, who was called
for a foul. Day yelled at the official, who called a technical and
threw the reserve guard out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Francis made both free throws and the Rockets led 88-81.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix cut it to six twice, the last time at 98-92 on
Livingston's basket with 1:35 to go. But Anderson sealed the
victory with 1:12 remaining by hitting his sixth 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets were 12-for-22 from 3-point range, 8-for-11 in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights after being overwhelmed by Utah, the Suns came out
flat and fell behind in a hurry. The Rockets scored 13 consecutive
points, including a pair of 3-pointers by Mobley, to take a 24-12
lead. Anderson sank two 3-pointers and Mobley one to start the
second quarter to put Houston ahead 35-18.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Before the game, Phoenix coach Scott Skiles signed a
five-year contract reportedly worth about $2.5 million a year. ...
The Suns' Kevin Johnson wasn't in uniform again because of a groin
injury. He has missed three of the last four games and played only
eight minutes in the other. ... Barkley drew a huge ovation between
the third and fourth quarters when he was introduced, then he
tossed the ball to the Phoenix mascot The Gorilla, who performed
one of his trademark slam dunks from a trampoline. ... Francis was
10-for-12 from the field.

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gary Payton had 33 points, 11 rebounds
and 14 assists for his 10th career triple-double as the Seattle
SuperSonics clinched seventh place in the Western Conference with a
119-112 overtime victory over the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, 2-2 against Sacramento, secured the playoff spot with

than the eighth-place Kings. The SuperSonics are 31-20 against the
Western Conference, while the Kings are 25-26.
</P>
<P>
   Payton scored eight of his points in overtime as Seattle scored

assists for his 13th career triple-double. Jason Williams had 23
points, and Predrag Stojakovic 20.
</P>
<P>
   The SuperSonics (45-36) will open the playoffs in Utah, while

NBA's best record.
</P>
<P>
   Stojakovic made a jumper from the baseline with 0.5 left, tying
the score 107-107 and sending the game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   After Williams made his seventh 3-pointer to cut Seattle's lead
to 104-103, Payton made a turnaround jumper with 18 seconds left.
Williams' layup cut the lead to one point, setting the stage for
Stojakovic.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 97-92, the Sonics scored six straight, with the final
basket coming on a baseline jumper from Baker, putting Seattle
ahead 98-97 with 2:48 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics closed the third quarter with 15-6 run, assuming an
81-75 lead. Sacramento made one field goal in the final seven
minutes and didn't score in the last 3:19 of the period.
</P>
<P>
   In a wild second quarter, Williams made four 3-pointers over a
2:59 span as the Kings rallied to assume a 57-56 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Payton had nine points, six rebounds and five assists in
the opening period as Seattle led 33-25. ... Webber missed nine of
his first 11 shots and finished 8-of-26. ... Williams had a stretch
where he made six consecutive 3-pointers. ... Seattle starters
Lazaro Borrell and Shammond Williams played a combined seven
minutes.

<HEADLINE> Michigan Shooting Suspect Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GOODMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN PARK, Mich. (AP) -- A tenant at a senior-citizen
apartment house opened fire with a rifle Tuesday after he was
summoned to a meeting because of neighbors' complaints about his
vulgar language, authorities said. Two women were killed, including
a former city councilwoman who was delivering food to the needy.
</P>
<P>
   The man was taken into custody three hours later when police
stormed his apartment, said police Lt. Donald Gentner. He did not
resist and was not injured, but was on narcotics and taken to the
hospital for observation, he said. He was in fair condition.
</P>
<P>
   The man, identified by City Attorney Edward M. Zelenak as
Kenneth Ray Miller, had not been charged. Before he moved into the
subsidized housing, he wrote on his application that he suffered
from schizophrenia and was on antidepressant medication, the
Detroit Free Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Police spent several hours searching the 14-story building for
the gunman after the noon shooting. Other tenants were told to stay
in their apartments during the search of the high-rise, and
youngsters on the playground of an elementary school nearby were
hurried inside and kept there until parents arrived to pick them
up.
</P>
<P>
   Apartment officials had summoned the man to a meeting after
other residents complained of inappropriate language, said Phyllis
McLenon, deputy director of the Housing Commission in the suburb 10
miles south of Detroit. McLenon did not explain what she meant by
inappropriate language.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, the man ''was very dissatisfied and making
threats. ... He kept saying he wouldn't have this character
assassination and that he would take care of it,'' she told
WDIV-TV. ''He was very upset, and was very upset with some of the
ladies who were complaining about him.''
</P>
<P>
   McLenon said the man left the meeting Tuesday and was gone for
about 10 minutes, and then the building's maintenance man warned by
radio that the man was coming back shooting.
</P>
<P>
   One of the victims was Marilyn Higgins, 64, a former city
council member and a longtime Lincoln Park Housing Commission
member, Fire Chief Ernie Moon said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Higgins said he and his wife were delivering day-old
bakery items to needy residents in the building. They were in a
meeting room when the gunman entered, he aid.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the residents from the tower came down into the break
room and started shooting with a rifle and killed my wife,''
Higgins told the Free Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were all looking at him, when I realized he was shooting,''
Higgins said. ''I went to a room where I thought I could get to a
phone and my wife came down the hall after me. She started
hollering at him to stop doing that and he just shot her.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Higgins was elected to City Council in 1979 and
re-elected in 1981. A 48-year resident of Lincoln Park, she said an
activist for the aged and city preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Also killed was Alvita King, the medical examiner's office said.
</P>
<P>
   McLenon said King had filed a complaint a week earlier, the Free
Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said something really filthy to her,'' McLenon said. During
a 10-minute meeting about the complaint, McLenon told Miller that
his alleged remarks were inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Miller responded with complaints about King, saying she had been
feuding with him, McLenon said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women was shot in the face in the building office and
another was shot in the doorway, McLenon said. Some people ran to a
bathroom or scrambled under a desk to hide. ''He came in looking
for us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Sullivan, who lives on the 13th floor, said he had heard
some women complain about the man's language. ''I never heard him
use foul language but a lot of the ladies complained he was
vulgar,'' Sullivan said.

<HEADLINE> ABC Strikes Ratings Gold With Rerun  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- After all these years, Moses is still a big draw
on television.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's Sunday night airing of the 1956 Cecil B. DeMille epic,
''The Ten Commandments,'' was a ratings winner that helped the
network win the prime-time race for the 16th week in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ABC had been running ''The Ten Commandments'' annually from 1992
to 1998, but took last year off -- and it seemed to whet the
viewers' appetites for the Easter-season favorite. Viewership for
the Charlton Heston flick was 26 percent higher than it was two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' was the week's most-watched
show, drawing 28 million viewers to ABC on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After it plunged to 33rd place in the ratings even after
following an episode of ''Friends,'' NBC has canceled the new
Thursday night comedy, ''Battery Park.'' Another Thursday comedy,
''Daddio,'' is doing better.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's new Friday night reality show ''Making the Band,'' which
depicts the manufacturing of a musical act similar to 'N Sync or
the Backstreet Boys, has fallen flat. It drew only 6.8 million
viewers last Friday, ranking No. 70 for the week.
</P>
<P>
   On cable, Discovery's ''Walking With Dinosaurs'' documentary on
Sunday shattered its own all-time ratings record, set just last
month with ''Raising the Mammoth.'' The dinosaur special had 10.7
million viewers, the highest for a non-sports cable show this year.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, ABC had a prime-time average of 13.3 million
viewers (9.0 rating, 15 share). NBC was second with 10.3 million
(7.5, 13), CBS had 9.6 million (6.8, 12) and Fox had 7.5 million
(5.0, 8).
</P>
<P>
   UPN had 3.5 million viewers (2.5 rating, 4 share), the WB had
3.1 million (2.3, 4) and Pax TV had 1.2 million (0.9, 2).
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Nightly News'' and ABC's ''World News Tonight'' both
drew 9.9 million viewers last week (7.4 ratings, 16 shares). The
''CBS Evening News'' had 8 million viewers (6.1, 13).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of April 10-16, the top 10 shows, their networks
and ratings were:
</P>
<P>
   ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Tuesday), ABC, 18.7; ''ER,''
NBC, 18.2; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Thursday), ABC, 17.7;
''Friends,'' NBC, 12.8; ''Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' ABC, 12.1; ''60
Minutes,'' CBS, 11.0; ''Daddio,'' NBC, 10.9; ''The Ten
Commandments,'' ABC, 10.8; ''NYPD Blue,'' ABC, 10.7; ''Everybody
Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 10.0.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Gifts Estimated at $9 Mil  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE GUTTERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Three $1 bills in an envelope from Los
Angeles. Stock from a strip-club owner that may be worth several
hundred thousand dollars. A $25,000 check from an elderly woman in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   From a child writing ''here's my allowance'' to a bank cutting a
$128,000 check, the money came rolling in after the Columbine
massacre, the nation's deadliest school shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the amount given to charities to benefit the
victims of the massacre at Columbine High School and the bereaved
community range from $6 million to $9 million, possibly more. And
money is still coming in.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because these were children in a sense and because the images
being broadcast out of Columbine were so compelling -- that's the
only explanation I have for the response,'' said Kelley Cahill, a
vice president of Mile High United Way.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, school officials plan a private assembly, a public
memorial service and a candlelight vigil to mark the anniversary of
the rampage, in which two Columbine seniors fatally shot 12
students and a teacher and wounded 23 before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   United Way operated the Healing Fund, which was set up a few
hours after the April 20 attack to channel Columbine-related
donations. It took in $4.6 million, much of it accompanied by
sympathetic letters of donors from Colorado to Puerto Rico, Peru,
Japan and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Millions watched on television as students fled the school and
as shocked teen-agers and authorities struggled for answers that
weren't there.
</P>
<P>
   ''When these people were speaking for our community they were so
eloquent, and when you combine that with images like Pat Ireland
being pulled from the window -- it really reached people,'' Cahill
said. ''Many of the letters referred to the images and the
impression they made.''
</P>
<P>
   Cahill said about 80 percent of the donations to the Healing
Fund came from corporations and 20 percent from individuals. Half
came from Colorado and half from out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Where has the money gone?
</P>
<P>
   Of the Healing Fund's $4.6 million, half went to the two dozen
people injured and to other victims. The families of the slain
victims each received $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Four students with spinal-cord or brain injuries received
$150,000 each, and the families of the 21 other physically injured
children got $10,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly $900,000 went to outreach programs and other services
aimed to help the community around Columbine, including $755,000 to
the Jefferson Center for Mental Health and more than $21,000 to the
school district.
</P>
<P>
   Community programs received nearly $712,000. The largest Healing
Fund grant was $425,000 for the mental-health needs of Columbine
students, staff and the surrounding community. It pays for nine
full-time counselors for Columbine and its feeder schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Healing Fund wrapped up its work last fall, Cahill said,
clearing the way for a host of more specialized funds accepting
money donated with specific goals in mind, including individual
funds in victims' names.

<HEADLINE> D'Alema Coalition Seeks New Premier  </HEADLINE>
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Seeking to stave off a national election,
politicians from the governing center-left coalition sought
agreement on a candidate for premier to succeed Massimo D'Alema and
clear the way for his resignation today.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema, the first Communist to lead an Italian government, was
scheduled to address the Senate and then was expected to turn in
his resignation to President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi without asking
for a vote of confidence, parliamentary officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After 18 months as premier, D'Alema was paying the price for a
humiliating defeat in regional elections last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The victorious conservative forces, led by media magnate Silvio
Berlusconi, kept up their calls for a general election, seeking to
take advantage of their momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ''When a democratic country shows it has no confidence in its
government, you form another one after free elections,'' Berlusconi
said.
</P>
<P>
   The center-left is trying to hold on to power until it can
regroup in time for scheduled elections next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Ciampi rejected D'Alema's resignation when he first offered it
Monday, but the premier's own allies were now undermining his
ability to govern after 18 months in office.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema leads a coalition ranging from hard-line Communists to
liberal Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's balloting, Berlusconi's center-right alliance routed
the center-left, sweeping the affluent north and the region
including Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Consensus swelled among the center-left coalition partners to
try to avoid early elections by backing a new premier who would be
supported by Ciampi.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a new premier, a premier capable of communicating with
the new classes in the country,'' said a D'Alema coalition partner,
Pierluigi Castagnetti, a former Christian Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time they lose, the left of yachts and fancy chefs looks
at the middle classes in the north with surprised disgust,'' said a
commentary in Turin's La Stampa newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership of the Greens, another coalition partner,
formally proposed Treasury Minister Giuliano Amato, a former
Socialist premier, as their choice to lead the government to
parliamentary elections next year. Amato is widely respected abroad
and at home for helping Italy rein in its huge deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Another name mentioned as a possible premier was Antonio Fazio,
governor of the Bank of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding new elections could let a May 21 referendum go forward
to reform Italy's electoral system. The referendum seeks to abolish
the remaining 25 percent of seats elected by proportional
representation, blamed for the chronic instability of Italian
governments. D'Alema headed the 57th government in the past 55
years.

<HEADLINE> UN Warns on Angola Rebel Violations  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council is giving countries
accused of violating sanctions against Angola's UNITA rebels six
months to improve their records before deciding whether to impose
any U.N. penalties on them.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimously adopted resolution, the council warned Tuesday
that it would consider ''appropriate action'' against violators
based on accusations in a blunt report on breaches of the sanctions
and a continuing investigation by a new monitoring panel.
</P>
<P>
   While vague and lacking actual punitive measures, the resolution
marked the first time the council has formally suggested applying
''secondary sanctions'' for violators of U.N. embargoes, diplomats
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a groundbreaking report issued last month, an independent
investigation outlined the violations of the U.N. fuel and arms
embargo and ban on rebel diamond sales that enabled UNITA to
restart a 20-year-old war with the government in December 1998,
shattering a U.N.-brokered cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The report alleged that two African presidents, Blaise Compaore
of Burkina Faso and Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo, helped UNITA leader
Jonas Savimbi with arms and fuel shipments in exchange for
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   The report also accused Belgium of having such lax standards at
its Antwerp diamond market that rogue dealers were able to trade
UNITA gems with virtually no obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   The countries implicated have denied the allegations, defended
their records and challenged the report's evidence, noting that it
relied heavily on information provided by rebel defectors.
</P>
<P>
   Several, however, told the council on Tuesday that they had
taken measures to investigate the allegations by setting up
government commissions and committees.
</P>
<P>
   The independent panel report recommended a host of measures to
tighten the grip of sanctions around UNITA, including a three-year
arms embargo on countries that violated the weapons ban.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the sanctions committee for Angola, Ambassador
Robert Fowler of Canada, said the absence in the resolution of any
new embargoes shouldn't be seen as a lack of resolve by the
council.
</P>
<P>
   ''My own hope is that the Security Council will not need to
adopt such measures,'' Fowler said. ''That said, the draft
resolution before us makes clear the council's willingness to adopt
such measures if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution authorizes a five-person monitoring group to
continue to gather information about alleged violations and allow
implicated countries to report back on ways they are upholding the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-November, the council would review the monitors' reports
and ''consider appropriate action'' against violators.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said the vague phrasing would allow ambassadors to
take less punitive measures than sanctions, such as censure or
other diplomatic action -- or no action at all.
</P>
<P>
   Canada had wanted a tougher resolution, as did Namibia, which is
helping the Congolese government fight rebels who are reportedly
supported by UNITA.
</P>
<P>
   But France sought to weaken the call for sanctions on the
sanctions violators, concerned about its former colonies and the
precedent that so-called secondary sanctions would set, diplomats
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not by multiplying the pariah states that we will give
incentives to these to return to the straight and narrow,'' French
Ambassador Jean-David Levitte said.

<HEADLINE> First 3 Months Warmest in 106 Years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The first three months of the year were the
warmest in the nation in 106 years, according to the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The latest data also shows that June 1999 through March 2000 was
the warmest June through March period ever in the nation, NOAA
Administrator D. James Baker said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The January through March average temperature in the nation was
47.1 degrees. That is 1 degree warmer than the previous record set
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   One degree of difference is a ''very robust'' margin, said
Baker, adding that global data is still being assembled.
</P>
<P>
   A warmer earth means sea level could rise 20 inches in the next
100 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ignoring climate change and the most recent warming patterns
could be costly to the nation,'' he said. ''Small changes in global
temperatures can lead to more extreme weather events including,
droughts, floods and hurricanes.''
</P>
<P>
   That prediction of additional disasters concerns James Lee Witt,
director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are seeing extremes in weather that will impact us
physically, mentally and emotionally,'' said Witt, who joined Baker
for a news conference Tuesday on the New Orleans lakefront.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were in town for the weeklong National Hurricane
Conference.

<HEADLINE> US Tries To Boost Gun Buyback Plan  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To mark the anniversary of the Columbine High
School massacre, the Clinton administration wants to show what it
has done to curb gun violence in the year since America's worst
school shooting.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's favored gun control bill stalled in Congress, the
administration is touting a Department of Housing and Urban
Development program to encourage city housing agencies to buy and
destroy unwanted firearms. The gun buybacks give cash or gift
certificates ranging from $25 to $150 for each firearm handed over.
</P>
<P>
   HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo held a news conference Tuesday to
''announce in the memory of Columbine the Buyback America
program,'' which Clinton originally unveiled in November. Tom
Mauser, who became a gun control lobbyist after his son Daniel was
killed at Columbine, joined Cuomo via satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo urged more cities to join in the program, saying each gun
purchased meant ''one less accessible gun in circulation, one less
unwanted gun in a home, one less chance of tragedy, one step closer
to a safer, better America.''
</P>
<P>
   A total of 84 cities have signed up, accounting for about $3
million of the $15 million Clinton pledged. Many cities -- including
all in Colorado, Columbine's home state -- are passing on the
opportunity, however.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that local housing agencies must spend $100 of
their own drug-fighting money on the buyback program to get an
additional $43 for the buyback from HUD. Denver Housing Authority
Director Sal Carpio said he couldn't justify taking money from
existing anti-drug programs like security patrols and addiction
prevention for a buyback.
</P>
<P>
   Other agencies don't see guns as their biggest problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gun violence is not a huge issue for the residents of our
housing,'' said Virginia Felton, spokeswoman for the Seattle
Housing Authority, which did not apply for the program. ''We can
spend our resources more effectively in other crime prevention
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   HUD officials say the response to the idea has been much better
than expected, given how slow the government can work. Cuomo said
the 50,000 or so guns expected to be bought in the 84 cities is an
excellent first step for the three-year program, whose goal is to
get rid of 300,000 guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one ever said this program would buy all the guns in five
months,'' HUD spokesman David Egner said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Clinton's opponents on the gun issue are also
critical. The House has passed a Republican-backed measure that
would cut off funding for the program; GOP leaders say HUD does not
have the authority to spend anti-drug money on gun buybacks.
</P>
<P>
   And the president's archenemy on gun issues, the National Rifle
Association, says the money would be better spent elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anyone would really try to argue that they're
seeing long lines of violent criminals with guns turning in the
tools of their trade,'' NRA spokesman Bill Powers said. ''I think
most Americans would like to see their tax dollars go to tougher
enforcement of gun laws against bad guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have wasted no opportunity in
recent weeks to rhetorically pistol-whip the NRA and GOP-led
Congress over the gun control stalemate on Capitol Hill. A bill
that would require trigger locks on guns and background checks for
all purchases at gun shows has been stalled for more than six
months.
</P>
<P>
   ''The buyback is a good solution (to gun violence), but it's not
the entire solution,'' Cuomo said Tuesday. ''Child locks, trigger
locks are part of the solution. Gun control legislation (being)
passed by this Congress is part of the solution. Closing the gun
show loophole is part of the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA, which opposes the gun show provision and whose
executive vice president said Clinton was willing to accept a
certain level of killing to further his political agenda, does not
agree that buybacks are part of the solution to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do have a concern about using hard-earned taxpayer dollars
for these programs that, while they may be well-intentioned, don't
really address the problem of gun violence,'' Powers said.

<HEADLINE> Court To Decide on Miranda Warning  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- ''You have the right to remain silent'' -- a
police warning recited countless times daily and made familiar to
generations of Americans by movies and television -- is on trial in
the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing arguments today, the justices must decide whether
police still must warn criminal suspects about their right against
self-incrimination before questioning them.
</P>
<P>
   Such warnings have been required ever since the Supreme Court's
landmark 1966 decision in Miranda vs. Arizona, but a federal
appeals court ruling last year threw Miranda's future into doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Congress effectively
overturned Miranda when it enacted a 1968 law.
</P>
<P>
   The long-ignored law, known as Section 3501, means failure to
give such warnings no longer requires automatic exclusion of
incriminating statements as trial evidence, the appeals court ruled
in the case of a Maryland man accused of robbing banks in Maryland
and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration refuses to defend the 1968 law.
''Confidence of the public in the fairness of the criminal justice
system ... may be expected to suffer if Miranda were overruled,''
Justice Department lawyers have told the court.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the Miranda ruling blame it for letting some
criminals go free.
</P>
<P>
   They invoke a 1994 opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia, in which
he said federal prosecutors' failure to invoke Section 3501 ''may
have produced -- during an era of intense national concern about the
problem of runaway crime -- the acquittal and the nonprosecution of
many dangerous felons. ... There is no excuse for this.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices will take an initial vote behind closed doors
Friday, and their decision is expected by late June.
</P>
<P>
   The court, far more liberal 34 years ago than it is today,
sought to remedy ''inherently coercive'' interrogations by creating
bright-line guidelines in its Miranda ruling. Courts previously had
used a ''totality-of-the-circumstances test'' to determine whether
a confession or incriminating statement had been given to police
voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Section 3501 returns the law to pre-Miranda days, stating ''the
presence or absence'' of any factor such as a Miranda warning
''need not be conclusive on the issue of voluntariness.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dickerson of Takoma Park, Md., reportedly made several
incriminating statements to FBI agents after being arrested and
charged with seven bank robberies. He says he did not receive a
proper Miranda warning.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Dickerson nor the federal prosecutors who had opposed
his appeal to the 4th Circuit court focused on the 1968 law. But
University of Utah law professor Paul Cassell, representing the
conservative Washington Legal Foundation as a friend of the court,
sought to revive the dormant Section 3501. He won before the 4th
Circuit court, spurring Dickerson's Supreme Court appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The justices have received plenty of unsolicited advice in the
form of friend-of-the-court briefs.
</P>
<P>
   Among those arguing for the Miranda ruling's continued vitality
are the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers and the House Democratic leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Among those urging the court to uphold the appeals court's
ruling are the National District Attorneys Association, the
National Association of Police Organizations and 10 Republican
senators.
</P>
<P>
   Also siding with Cassell are 17 states: Alabama, Alaska,
Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi,
Nebraska, Nevada, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Utah and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Dickerson vs. U.S., 99-5525.

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma City Bombing Remembered  </HEADLINE>
By ROCHELLE HINES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The stone chairs at the new Oklahoma City
National Memorial stand in rows like tombstones, marking the place
where 168 people died five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There are big chairs for adults and 19 little ones for children.
All sit empty on glass bases over the green lawn once occupied by
the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannine Gist needs no reminder of the empty chair at her own
dinner table. But on the anniversary of the April 19, 1995,
bombing, these chairs bring her peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we first talked about building the memorial, I couldn't
imagine it could be a peaceful place,'' said Gist, whose
32-year-old daughter, Karen Carr, worked and died in the federal
building.
</P>
<P>
   Family members, rescuers and survivors planned to gather this
morning for a private dedication of the $29.1 million memorial. The
state Legislature on Tuesday approved the final $2.3 million needed
to finish paying for the tribute.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno were scheduled
to appear at a public ceremony later today.
</P>
<P>
   The site of the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil is a
picture of serenity now.

where rescuers scoured a three-story high pile of concrete and
glass for victims. An elm tree whose branches bore the impact of
the blast unfolds in a display of green.
</P>
<P>
   Just blocks away, one of the two men convicted in federal court
in the attack sits in an Oklahoma County Jail cell.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing conspirator Terry Nichols, who was sentenced to life in
prison, is awaiting a preliminary hearing on 160 state counts of
first-degree murder. Timothy McVeigh, who was convicted and
sentenced to death, is in a federal prison in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Across from the memorial, at the gutted shell of what was the
Journal Record newspaper building, a museum is being constructed
where visitors will be able to hear the bomb blast and learn more
about the victims. The museum is scheduled to open in November.
</P>
<P>
   The story will be told simply, without drama, museum director
Sunni Mercer said, pointing to one example -- a box holding keys
plucked from the crumbled federal building.
</P>
<P>
   Piles of these unclaimed house keys, locker keys, gate keys will
be on display, all speaking to the normal lives changed by an act
of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Gist, who helped plan the museum, wants visitors to know who her
daughter was and wants them to be changed, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like them to leave thinking 'If there is anything I can do
to make sure this never happens again, I will do it,''' she said.

<HEADLINE> Schools Concerned Over Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like many other schools preparing for this
week's anniversary of the Columbine High School shootings, Rich
East High School in Park Forest, Ill., will have extra police
officers on hand.
</P>
<P>
   But Cmdr. Patrick Fitzgerald, a city police officer who
coordinates school safety, said he's heard more from reporters
writing about Thursday's anniversary than from parents and students
who fear it may precipitate copycat violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things have been very quiet out here,'' he said. ''When we
take attendance on Thursday, we'll find out.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 20, 1999, two students at Columbine High in Littleton,
Colo., fatally shot 12 students and a teacher before killing
themselves. This year, education officials nationwide are taking
steps to prevent their schools from suffering the same fate.
</P>
<P>
   They've suspended students caught making threats, hired more
officers and volunteers for the day, canceled classes or major
school events and held meetings with parents and community members.
</P>
<P>
   ''The date has them worried about a lot of copycats or kids who
may try to send a very, very strong message,'' said Curt Lavarello,
executive director of the National Association of School Resource
Officers, a group of K-12 school officers that has nearly doubled
to 5,500 members in the last year. ''Let's face it, it's been
absolutely clear in the tragedies we see on school campuses that
these incidents can occur at any time, at any school.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Colorado Gov. Bill Owens will lead thousands in a
moment of silence at 11:21 a.m., the time the attack began. But the
school itself is on alert, with 24-hour police patrols and special
badges for anyone wanting to get in.
</P>
<P>
   ''Schools are under pressure to be prepared,'' said June Arnett,
associate director of the Westlake, Calif.-based National School
Safety Center.
</P>
<P>
   The safety center, which advises school security officers, says
its statistics show that youngsters are 99 times more likely to be
shot and killed on the street or at home than in school. And this
school year's 11 homicides and suicides -- even with the Feb. 29
shooting of Michigan first-grader by a classmate -- is well below
last year's tally of 26. But multiple-victim shootings -- such as
Littleton, Jonesboro, Ark., and Springfield, Ore. -- have
nonetheless left schools recently guarding against or preparing for
a major school-wide crisis.
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   --Four Anchorage, Alaska, students were suspended Friday after
allegedly threatening to use guns and bombs at Wendler Middle
School.
</P>
<P>
   --In Rush City, Minn., high school officials suspended four
students Thursday after saying the teen-agers threatened to take
over their school and shoot it up on the Columbine anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   --In Jay, Okla., where threats of gun violence prompted parents
to pull their children out of classes Friday, police are expected
to return to school halls this week, which also marks the fifth
anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But some officials fear they may be overreacting to perceived
threats.
</P>
<P>
   The year since the shooting has left schools open to critics who
contend they prefer SWAT teams to mental health counselors. Nearly
two dozen schools have tested Mosaic-2000, an FBI computer
profiling program that rates potentially violent students on a
scale of 1 to 10. And hundreds of officers trained at R.U. Ready
High, a school-shooting simulation at the Blackwater Training
Center in Moyock, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   These preparations are just as important as fire drills in
keeping children out of harm's way, said Kenneth S. Trump, owner of
National School Safety and Security Services, a Cleveland-based
school security consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ''You need some basic security measures in schools,'' he said.
''Why should we apologize for that?''

<HEADLINE> Post Office To Have Recall Posters  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alongside the FBI's ''Most Wanted'' list of
dangerous criminals, the corner post office will now display a
poster of the country's most notorious products.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission announced Tuesday it
would put up recall notices to alert the public to hazardous
products. About 33,000 post offices, where 7 million people go each
day to mail letters and ship packages, will get the new posters.
The first posters should be up later this week, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Commission Chairwoman Ann Brown said the posters -- with color
pictures of the recalled products -- will allow people to recognize
hazardous products around the house.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can get dangerous products off store shelves but the real
challenge is to get them out of families' homes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Francia Smith, vice president of consumer affairs for the U.S.
Postal Service, said postal officials decided to become involved
because ''we're convinced that this action will help prevent
injuries and save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As the one hand that binds this nation together, the Postal
Service is the communication network that reaches out to each and
every individual in this nation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from 32 states also will visit thrift stores to seek
out the recalled products, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The new outreach program was launched as the commission
announced its annual recall roundup, a list of products that were
recalled throughout the previous year. Among those making the list
and the posters include:
</P>
<P>
   --Pokemon balls from Burger King ''kids meals'' that can
suffocate children under 3. More than 25 million balls were
recalled in December after a 13-month-old girl and a 4-month-old
boy died.
</P>
<P>
   --Infant car seats and carriers made by Cosco that have handle
locks that can unexpectedly release, allowing the baby to fall to
the ground. The company sold 670,000 of the ''Arriva'' and
''Turnabout'' models before they were recalled in July because 28
youngsters were injured.
</P>
<P>
   --Plastic swimming pool ''divesticks'' sold under several brand
names that injured 12 children between the ages of 5 and 11 when
they landed on the sticks in the pool. Some 19 million sticks were
sold. They were recalled in June.
</P>
<P>
   --Portable cribs of the ''Playskool Travel-Lite'' model type that
can collapse and entrap a child. More than 11,000 cribs were sold.
There were several recall announcements in 1993 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   --Cedar chests made by The Lane Co. that have been blamed for
seven deaths of children who have become trapped and suffocated.
The chests were recalled in 1996, but 12 million were sold and many
of them remain unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can get more information about recalled products by
calling the commission's toll-free hot line, 800-638-2772, or by
visiting the Web site at www.cpsc.gov. To get a list of major
recalls, consumers can send a postcard to ''Recall List,'' CPSC,
Washington, D.C. 20207.

<HEADLINE> Summers Weighs GOP Tax Cuts  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers says
Republican tax cuts could consume more than $1 trillion of the
budget surplus over the next decade, but the GOP budget passed by
Congress hides that by only estimating the five-year cost.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without the discipline of 10-year horizons, it becomes easy to
adopt policies that tempt today but could raise serious risks over
the long term,'' Summers said in a speech Tuesday at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Summers said the $1.83 trillion GOP budget for fiscal
2001 envisions unrealistic government spending on programs other
than defense that is $20 billion below levels the Clinton
administration believes are necessary to maintain current service
levels and sets aside precious little to reduce the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''History suggests that unrealistic spending assumptions
threaten fiscal discipline in much the same way that unrealistic
economic forecasts threaten fiscal discipline,'' Summers said.
''They can lead to fixed commitments that lead to problems when the
lack of realism in the assumptions becomes known.''
</P>
<P>
   Those assumptions include a projected cost of up to $215 billion
over five years in GOP tax cuts. Summers said an estimate covering
only five years masks the ballooning cost in later years if the
cuts are phased in, as most tax measures are. In that case, he
said, the cost ''could possibly escalate as high as $1 trillion,''
far more than the $792 billion GOP tax cut vetoed last year by
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats have leveled similar criticism at the five-year,
$483 billion tax cut proposed by Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
Republican presidential nominee-in-waiting. Some analysts have
estimated its cost at $1.3 trillion or more over a decade, which
critics say would consume too much of the projected budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Summers pointed to statistics showing that millions
of middle-class Americans pay a lower percentage of their earnings
in federal income and payroll taxes than at any time since at least
the mid-1970s. Although tax collections as a percentage of U.S.
gross domestic product are at a post-World War II high, Summers
said that is driven by higher overall incomes, including money made
in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tax burden for most Americans is at its lowest in a
generation,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said
Republicans intend to continue pushing for broad tax relief and
accused the administration of ''always finding excuses'' to oppose
tax cuts and favor higher spending on government programs despite
the huge surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, the president wants to spend more money in
Washington. We want to give the money back to the taxpayers,'' said
John Feehery, Hastert's press secretary. ''We're going to continue
to work on commonsense proposals that bring about tax fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   The House already passed several major tax cut bills this year,
including one to ease the income tax ''marriage penalty'' paid by
millions of two-earner couples and one cutting estate taxes.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Woo an Industry at Odds  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the hunt for campaign cash, the Democratic
Party is looking to the high-technology sector, an industry at odds
with traditional party allies such as labor unions and trial
lawyers on some key issues.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hope to use the split to hinder Democratic fund
raising from companies in the technology focused, northern
California region known as Silicon Valley, which, unlike most
business groups, has divided its loyalties between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in high-tech companies has turned the industry into a
fertile source of campaign contributions. Already, computer
companies have made $8.5 million in campaign contributions since
Jan. 1, 1999, according to an Associated Press computer analysis of
data from the Campaign Study Group, a research organization that
provides data to the news media. These companies donated more than
the $8.1 million in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   And while most business groups lean Republican, the high-tech
industry has given slightly more than half of its money to
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Democrats find themselves caught between the industry and
their labor allies on the issues of permanent normal trade
relations with China and more visas for foreign, high-tech workers.
Labor opposes these measures; the high-tech industry supports them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the legal community fought unsuccessful battles
against limits on investor lawsuits, when Congress overturned
President Clinton's veto of legislation in 1995, and more recent
legislation imposing caps on lawsuits filed as a result of the Y2K
computer conversion.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question that Democratic relations with high tech
are a concern,'' said Jon Cuneo of the National Association of
Securities and Commercial Law Attorneys, whose political action
committee gave $13,607 to Democrats and none to Republicans last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats from Clinton and Vice President Al Gore to the party's
House and Senate fund-raising committees are making sure they know
the way to San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Gore, the all-but-certain Democratic presidential
nominee, helped raise $2.6 million for the Democratic National
Committee and $100,000 for his own campaign.
</P>
<P>
   During the first three months of 1999, the DNC took in $250,000
from Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen and $100,000 from Douglas
Carlston, chairman of Broderbund Software.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton headlined a $1.5 million Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee fund-raiser this month at the Palo Alto, Calif.,
home of AllAdvantage.com co-founder Jim Jorgensen.
</P>
<P>
   The DCCC, which raises money for Democratic House candidates,
received $66,542 from Microsoft -- including $56,542 worth of
software -- and $10,000 from AllAdvantage.com between January and
March. The National Republican Congressional Committee, which
supports GOP candidates for the House and plans its own Silicon
Valley fund-raiser this spring, got $160,000 from Cisco President
John Chambers, $80,000 from Microsoft and $10,000 from America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Hyatt, the DNC finance co-chairman who organized last
weekend's Silicon Valley affair, said the high-tech industry and
Democrats may not see eye to eye on everything, but do agree on
non-economic issues such as abortion, education and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a legitimate difference of opinion, but let's not let
the few things on which we disagree outweigh the far greater number
of issues on which we agree,'' Hyatt said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, George W. Bush's liaison to the high-tech community
mentions Gore's links to labor and lawyers while touting the Texas
governor's support of education and tax cuts, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The likelihood is the vice president will pander to both and
try to get away with it,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the
presumptive Republican presidential nominee. ''We'll be there to
remind them of his pander in the other direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway acknowledged Gore's support from
disparate interests. But he said: ''They all agree that Al Gore
will be better for working people and consumers and the economy
than George Bush with his irresponsible tax scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Democrats' traditional constituencies don't want the
party to get caught up in the Internet frenzy that has driven up
the stock prices of some dot-com companies -- a position they have
willingly backed with campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Between Jan. 1, 1999, and Feb. 29, 2000, the Association of
Trial Lawyers of America doubled its donations from the same period
two years earlier, giving $1.9 million to candidates, compared with
$985,300 in 1997-98, Federal Election Commission records show.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats received more than $8 of every $10, according to the
Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that studies
political donations.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions, meanwhile, have given Democrats 93 percent of
their $31.3 million in campaign contributions in the 1999-00
election cycle, records show.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Jet Crashes, 131 Aboard  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVAO, Philippines (AP) -- An Air Philippines jetliner carrying
131 people crashed Wednesday in the southern Philippines, and
officials said all aboard were believed killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 737-200 left Manila and was unable to land on its
first approach to Davao city because another plane was on the
runway, air traffic controllers said.
</P>
<P>
   It crashed into a coconut grove on nearby Samal Island as it
prepared to make another approach from the opposite direction, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot had not reported any problems, but it was foggy over
Samal, officials told The Associated Press. The Davao airport does
not have equipment for instrument landings.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency crews arriving at the site of the still-smoldering
plane said there were no signs of survivors. If that turns out to
be the case, it would the worst plane crash in Philippine history.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado also said there appeared to be
no survivors. He added it was ''too early'' to determine the cause
of the crash, but said ''there were indications there was cloud
cover in the area, a low ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane was completely destroyed except for a small portion of
its tail section. A priest sprinkled water over charred bodies as
he delivered last rites.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke from the crash could be seen from Davao, a thriving
commercial center 625 miles southeast of Manila.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said the plane left Manila carrying 131 people -- 124
passengers, including four babies, and six crew members and one
mechanic. A mechanic normally rides on the flight because the
airline does not have one in Davao.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said a maintenance check before takeoff found no
problems.
</P>
<P>
   At Davao's airport, relatives cried and hugged each other as Red
Cross personnel tried to comfort them.
</P>
<P>
   Planes, buses and ferries throughout the Philippines were jammed
Wednesday because of the start of Easter holidays, in which many
Filipinos return to their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
   The crash appeared to be the most serious in the Philippines
since a twin-engine plane slammed into the hills in the northern
part of the country on Dec. 7, killing all 17 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   In the country's worst air disaster ever, a Cebu Pacific DC-9
jet crashed in 1998 near the top of a fog-shrouded mountain in the
southern Philippines, killing all 104 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the country's airlines created since the industry was
deregulated several years ago have been dogged with safety- and
maintenance-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing began producing the 200 model of the 737 in 1966,
building more than 1,000 over the next 22 years before ending
production. The plane can carry up to 130 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing spokesman Sean Griffin said this plane was first put into
service 22 years ago. He said he didn't know when the 4-year-old
airline acquired it or whether this specific jet had any problems
previously.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was the third major transportation accident in the
Philippines in a week. April 12, an overloaded cargo ship carrying
more than 200 illegal passengers capsized after leaving Jolo in
southern Sulu province, killing at least 133 people.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a passenger ship struck an underwater fish trap and
sank south of Manila. All 137 people aboard were rescued.

<HEADLINE> Bush Eyes McCain for No. 2 Spot  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- George W. Bush has John McCain on his
mind, and is thinking about adding his former rival to the
Republican presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll give John McCain consideration,'' the Texas governor said
Tuesday, adding that the two may discuss the issue when they meet
next month. McCain aides instantly ruled out the idea, but it
renewed interest in who Bush will choose as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the speculation about the Arizona senator, Bush's
theme of the day was affordable housing. He went to a rebuilt home
in Battle Creek to unveil a proposal for $1.7 billion tax break for
developers who build single-family homes for low-income residents.
Then he traveled to Dearborn for a panel discussion on housing
issues with experts in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the talk shifted to politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he's said he's not interested, but until I talk to him
and find out how interested or not interested he is, I'll give him
consideration,'' said Bush of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''Talk like this is always flattering whether it's from Governor
Bush or (Minnesota Gov.) Jesse Ventura,'' said McCain spokesman
Todd Harris. ''However, Senator McCain has made it more than clear
that he is not interested in being vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the GOP argue that McCain would be an ideal match for
Bush, since his seven primary wins came largely from luring
independents and Democrats to the polls, which helped set turnout
records.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has always said he has no interest in being No. 2 and
would prefer to stay in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that insistence, Bush said the topic may come up May 9
in Pittsburgh when the two have their first meeting since the
primary season cooled.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I walk into the meeting, I'll take him for his word, but I
do want to visit with him,'' Bush said at a news conference. ''He's
been pretty outspoken about his opinions, but I really want to look
him in the eye and visit with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush added that ''there will be a lot of people who will be
given consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Michigan Gov. John Engler, was standing next to
Bush, who said that ''of course'' he would consider his fellow
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is routinely asked about a running mate and usually
deflects those questions. But when asked about Engler, he declared
on his own that, ''I'll give John McCain consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the politics, Bush offered his newest housing initiative,
a five-year program of tax credits worth up to 10 percent year on
the cost of building homes in low-income areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''The purpose of the program is not just to provide shelter, but
shelter that somebody can say 'this is mine,''' Bush said on the
lawn of a rebuilt home in Battle Creek. ''When you own a home, it
not only enhances the community, it makes the schools better
because you have a certain sense of stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Democratic rival Al Gore dismissed the new proposal,
arguing it was yet another example of Bush promising something he
hasn't delivered as governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''He keeps making promises he can't pay for'' because of Bush's
proposed $483 billion tax cut, said Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway.
''This is yet another issue where Bush has done nothing in Texas
but expects us to believe he would do as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Documents furnished by Bush's campaign said competition among
developers for the credits probably would drive the value lower
than the total of 50 percent over five years. Up to 20,000 homes a
year could be developed because of the incentives, the papers said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wrapped up his Michigan campaign swing with a $400,000
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Gore were taking today off.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Press Secretary Quits  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Reform Party's press secretary has
resigned, signaling a widening rift between presidential hopeful
Pat Buchanan and allies of party founder Ross Perot, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she resigned because she feels that the Buchanan
campaign is attempting to take over the party and is preventing her
from being able to do her job,'' said party secretary Jim Mangia,
who as a member of the party's ruling board was informed of Donna
Donovan's resignation Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan will remain chairman of the Connecticut Reform Party and
active in other leadership roles, Mangia and other senior party
officials told The Associated Press on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But her resignation was emblematic of deepening problems between
Buchanan, who joined the party last year, and longtime officials
just as it was recovering from other infighting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope we can still sit down and work things out with the
Buchanan campaign,'' Mangia said. ''This is an example of a
deteriorating situation that we have to start to try to remedy soon
or it will be too late,'' Mangia said.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan declined to comment, but officials said her resignation
would be effective Friday. Buchanan's campaign did not respond to a
request for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Following a party meeting in Nashville, Tenn., that turned into
a televised wrestling match between factions, a federal judge in
Virginia last month settled some of the party's infighting by
ousting Jack Gargan as chairman and replacing him with Pat Choate,
Perot's running mate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan and Choate have known each other for years and are
allies on trade and other foreign policies. Earlier this year,
Choate appeared at Buchanan's side during a press conference in
which the two urged the Clinton administration and Congress to
reject normal trade status for China.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that may have permanently inflamed Perot's allies on
the ruling committee, Choate also sided with Buchanan on the
location of the party's presidential nominating convention.
</P>
<P>
   Perot's supporters wanted it in Long Beach, Calif. Buchanan and
Choate, citing a competing religious convention and a lack of hotel
space there, pushed for Nashville. Perot's allies overruled that,
and the meeting is set for Aug. 10-13 in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, Buchanan reached out to the group and
invited them to his house for a peacemaking session, but a time and
place have yet to be established.
</P>
<P>
   Several Reform Party leaders said that peace may be far away.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan felt Buchanan was usurping her job of talking with
reporters and setting up media events. She also was one of several
leaders who have become uncomfortable with Buchanan's cross-country
drive to get on the ballot in dozens of states and control the
delegates admitted to the convention who will pick the nominee,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan was in Texas on Tuesday to begin a three-week drive to
get on the ballot there.

<HEADLINE> Philly, LA Study D.C. Protests  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF WILSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Saying they don't want any surprises when
presidential conventions come to their respective cities this
summer, Los Angeles and Philadelphia police officers attended the
World Bank demonstrations in Washington to learn firsthand the
latest tactics employed by protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators represented at least 100 groups allied to
protest the International Monetary Fund and World Bank loans to
Third World countries. There were more than 1,000 arrests on
Saturday, Sunday and Monday as demonstrators shut down parts of the
nation's capital but failed to halt the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, a representative of Global Exchange, a leader of the
Washington demonstrations, said the protest grapevine was
''abuzz,'' with rumors of plans for the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia and the Democratic National Convention
in Los Angeles this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the city's respective police departments say
they will be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did gather some intelligence down there regarding the
methods and means of the protesters,'' said Philadelphia Police
Commissioner John F. Timoney. ''We think we will be fully prepared
for any eventualities.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not anticipate any problems here, however, we clearly
will be prepared for whatever develops,'' said Los Angeles Police
Department Cmdr. David Kalish.
</P>
<P>
   The LAPD decided to take no chances after watching World Trade
Organization protesters overrun Seattle earlier this year. All
police officer vacations and discretionary days off have been
canceled during the convention period and officers have been
undergoing special training.
</P>
<P>
   The 9,600-officer LAPD is the lead agency in charge of keeping
the peace during the Aug. 14-17 Democratic convention at the
downtown Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, we are concerned,'' Kalish said. ''Therefore we have been
planning for well over a year for the DNC. We have a task force
that has been assembled to coordinate all planning efforts on
behalf of the Police Department.''
</P>
<P>
   A security perimeter will be established around the Staples
Center during the convention, but downtown will not be sealed off
and become an armed encampment, Kalish said. In fact, a protest
area will be set up a block away, and downtown workers will be able
to move about freely and conduct their business, Kalish said.

<HEADLINE> White Zimbabwe Farmers Vilified  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- With President Robert Mugabe vilifying
white farmers as the ''enemies of Zimbabwe'' and violence against
opposition supporters increasing, government critics are worried
the crisis could worsen ahead of parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians say Mugabe organized the occupation of
white-owned farms and other political attacks that killed four
people in recent days after the defeat of a constitutional
referendum in February convinced him his party could lose the
elections expected to be called in May.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been trying to create the conditions necessary for a
state of emergency, because that's the only way he can postpone
this election,'' said David Coltart, an official with the
opposition Movement for Democratic Change. ''There's no doubt at
all that he is behind all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview on Tuesday, Zimbabwe's 20th
anniversary of independence from white rule, Mugabe said that white
farmers' opposition to the proposed constitution ''exposed them as
our enemies, not just political enemies, but definite enemies in
wanting to reverse our revolution and our independence.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed constitution would have allowed the government to
seize the white-owned farms for distribution to landless blacks
without paying compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the referendum, landless blacks began
occupying white-owned farms across the country in what Mugabe
called a justified protest against white ownership of one-third of
the country's productive farmland.
</P>
<P>
   The occupations have become increasingly violent.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday a white farmer was shot and killed in an attack by
assailants toting assault rifles; another farmer was abducted,
beaten and released at a ruling party office; and a third farmer
had many of the buildings on his land torched, opposition leaders
and farm union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, two Movement for Democratic Change members were
killed in a firebombing and farmer David Stevens, an MDC supporter,
was slain by ruling party supporters. Five of Stevens' neighbors
were severely beaten by attackers demanding they confess to ties
with the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   With the country suffering from its worst economic crisis since
independence and the ruling party losing popularity, Mugabe is
trying to frighten the white farmers and their workers into
abandoning their support for the popular Movement for Democratic
Change, Coltart said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's absolutely desperate. He knows that he's playing his
final card now, the intimidation card,'' Coltart said.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, 40 to 100 attackers armed with AK-47s drove onto
a farm in western Zimbabwe and besieged the home of cattle rancher
Martin Olds. Attackers killed Olds, 42, in a gunbattle that lasted
nearly three hours, Coltart said. They then burned down his house.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, attackers with assault rifles, possibly the same
people, broke up an MDC rally of about 300 people in the nearby
city of Bulawayo, Coltart said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Commercial Farmers Union, which represents
most of the white farmers, said Monday that the government had
begun arming the squatters -- who previously had only axes, spears
and hunting rifles -- with submachine guns.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, attackers wearing ruling party T-shirts rampaged
across David Stobart's farm 25 miles north of Harare, torching
tobacco barns and workers' dwellings. Stobart and his wife fled
safely to Harare.
</P>
<P>
   The white owner of a small farm near Harare was abducted for
several hours Tuesday. Kevin Tinker, an active MDC member, was
assaulted and released after being taken to a nearby ruling party
office, said neighbor Hamish Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's verbal assault on white farmers during an interview
with state-run Zimbabwe Broadcast Corp. was a marked hardening of
his stance, even from the televised anniversary speech he had made
just minutes before.
</P>
<P>
   During that speech, he said he would work to broker a compromise
between farmers and the squatters, a stand that seemed to echo what
farm leaders said he told them Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But in his interview, Mugabe said he gave the farmers a
different message.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told them it required real transformation on their part in a
positive way for us to accept them as allies wanting to live side
by side. Until then we will continue to regard them now and in the
future as enemies of our people,'' Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
   Farm union leaders were ''angered and frustrated'' by Mugabe's
remarks, said David Hasluck, director of the union.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday, we appeared to have had a reasoned and constructive
debate on how to solve the problems we face,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe was now unlikely to honor promises to resolve the farm
standoff, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not serious about enforcing the law; he worries more
about electoral victory than what is really happening,'' said
Lovemore Madhuku, deputy chairman of the National Constitutional
Assembly, a coalition of opposition and reform groups.

<HEADLINE> CBS Castaways Battle for $1M Prize  </HEADLINE>
By BETH DUFF-BROWN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PULAU TIGA, Malaysia (AP) -- Catch fish with a bamboo spear, and
roast rats over an open fire. Help another castaway track down
water -- but don't sabotage your own chances for survival by calling
her a stupid cow.
</P>
<P>
   Outwit, outplay, outlast.
</P>
<P>
   That's the motto of a group of adventurous Americans who are now
vying for a million bucks on this little island off the coast of
Borneo.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen back-stabbing castaways, captured on film by camera
crews lurking behind palm fronds and coral reefs, are trying to
outfox each other as well as vipers, poisonous plants and other
natural perils.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to capitalize on America's obsession with reality TV,
CBS is throwing millions of dollars behind ''Survivor,'' which is
to air in 13 weekly episodes beginning May 31. The network chose
eight women and eight men -- a mix of personalities and professions
-- and turned them loose on this lush rain-forest island.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is like an extreme version of an office or a large
family,'' executive producer Mark Burnett told The Associated Press
during a two-day visit to the island, allowed only after agreeing
not to talk to contestants or reveal who remained halfway into the
six-week contest.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are out for themselves and only themselves,'' said
Burnett, creator and producer of the ''Eco Challenge'' series on
the Discovery Channel. ''Yet all 16 people will grow a bit stronger
and may discover who they really are out here.''
</P>
<P>
   The castaways are working together to survive, yet every third
night they hold secret ballots around a ''tribal council'' campfire
to kick out one contestant, who is escorted away by helicopter with
a consoling psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first men voted off the island had been overheard
saying something to the effect that the only thing stupider than a
woman was a cow. Big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ''The united women's front got that guy off the island right
away,'' Burnett said. ''They all mooed at him -- and he was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything is unscripted and the emotions are real. Not only are
the castaways competing for $1 million, their every action will be
judged by American viewers who could turn them into national
celebrities -- or just turn them off.
</P>
<P>
   On the 21st night, during the tribal council at which the number
of castaways was cut to nine, the sunburned, exhausted contestants
nervously chatted with host Jeff Probst and then marched off one by
one to blackball someone.
</P>
<P>
   ''We love to see ourselves represented in reality TV,'' said
Probst, who mediates the tribal councils and conducts on-camera
interviews. ''You start peeling away layer after layer and you get
at the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Hollywood ever really get at the truth?
</P>
<P>
   The survivors are indeed camping out on the beach beneath a
makeshift hut of hand-cut rattan and palm fronds. They're catching
their own fish and stomaching field rats for protein to conquer the
wilting heat and humidity.
</P>
<P>
   But though CBS on its Web site first promoted ''Survivors'' as
being filmed on a ''deserted'' island ''untouched by humans for
centuries,'' reports pointing out that park rangers live there and
a resort is under way forced the network to concede the island is
merely remote.
</P>
<P>
   And survivors do stand a chance of stumbling onto modern
production equipment. Tons of sound and lighting equipment have
been shipped in, generators keep the crew cabins and editing rooms
air conditioned, and satellite TV and rock music blares beneath the
neon sign at Survivor Bar.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you were really on a deserted island, you wouldn't be
participating in a water torture race,'' shrugged Probst. ''So,
it's a cool combination of game show and psychological drama. They
can vote you off simply because they don't like you or simply
because you're too good.''
</P>
<P>
   On the 21st night, the castaways ousted a woman who was by all
accounts one of the most likable and capable contestants. Several
other women appeared stunned and jumped up to hug her before she
dashed off.
</P>
<P>
   Probst said he was surprised at how devious the contestants had
become.
</P>
<P>
   ''When these people finally watch themselves, they're going to
be amazed at what went down here,'' he said. ''It's the ultimate
social experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting out, there was a 72-year-old retired Navy SEAL, a
38-year-old female truck driver and several attractive young
college students who romp around in sexy sarongs. There was Sonja,
a 62-year-old musician, and Sean, a 30-year-old neurologist who no
doubt will capture many female viewers.
</P>
<P>
   When the group is whittled down to the final pair, the last
eight kicked off the island will decide who becomes the celebrity
millionaire. Another half-million dollars will go to the losers,
with the first runner-up taking home $100,000 and the others
getting a share depending on how long they lasted.
</P>
<P>
   ''But they're all getting a multimillion-dollar experience,''
said Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   The show is based on a popular Swedish production, ''Expedition
Robinson,'' which has been filming in Malaysia for three years. The
producers of that show are still trying to live down the suicide of
the first contestant to be voted off the island.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett said he had ''zero'' concern about a copycat suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Of 6,000 applicants, CBS interviewed 800 people. Forty-eight
were then flown to Los Angeles for 10 days of grilling and six
hours of psychological tests. ''It's all in choosing people who are
really strong to begin with,'' said Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gene Ondrusek, the psychologist who greets the losers as
they are voted out, spends the night talking with them in a tent on
the beach and then flies back with them to Kota Kinabalu for
debriefing at a luxury resort.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try to prepare them for what may happen back home,'' said
Ondrusek. ''If they obtain the celebrity status which I think they
will, it may be as challenging as anything they've gone through
here.''

<HEADLINE> China Uncovers Trade in Women, Kids  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A police campaign to rescue kidnapped women and
children and punish those who snatch and sell them is shedding
light on a massive flesh trade stretching from remote villages to
modern cities, including Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese farmers desperate for brides buy them. Families
purchase sons to carry on the family line because birth control
policies restrict many couples to one child.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Communist Party newspaper, People's Daily,
police assistant director of criminal investigation Bai Jingfu said
widening gaps between rich and poor and inadequate law enforcement
were partly to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ''In some places, the masses have a weak understanding of the
law and do not believe that selling women and children is a
crime,'' Bai said.
</P>
<P>
   After taking power in 1949, the communists virtually eliminated
the flesh trade. Travel and residence controls helped, but they
have loosened over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 6,802 woman and 1,662 children were reported abducted
or missing in China, while police rescued 7,660 women and 1,814
children, according to government reports.
</P>
<P>
   Police busted a ring operating in the northern provinces of
Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Hebei that involved an extended family
of 14 people suspected of stealing and selling almost 1,000 babies
over the past three years, state media said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of women and hundreds of children have been rescued
since late March, according to media reports. Unknown numbers
remain hidden in villages, either forcibly confined or simply
resigned to their fates. Many children were too small when
kidnapped to remember their original parents or even know they were
''adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   After failing to find a bride by traditional means, Pan Jinshan,
an itinerant mine worker, bought his wife for $436, the state-run
Yangcheng Evening News said. His family managed for more than a
year to keep the woman hidden in Guwang, a village 55 miles from
the nearest town in the impoverished southwestern region of
Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
   Once the woman discovered she had been duped into a life of
virtual slavery, she tried to escape and the family locked her in a
windowless concrete shed, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   When the woman, whom the newspaper did not name, didn't become
pregnant quickly, Pan told his father to also have sex with her to
continue the family name. Thus began a nightmare of constant rape
that continued until villagers informed the authorities, the
newspaper said. Officials surrounded the farmstead, rescued the
woman and arrested Pan and his father.
</P>
<P>
   Many kidnap victims are young rural women tricked into leaving
home with offers of work as housemaids, waitresses or factory
workers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most widely reported cases was that of Kang Ming'e,
who was orphaned at age 8, abducted and sold to a gold mine boss at
age 12 and became a mother at age 13.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman, a middle school English teacher identified as
Miss Huang, was grabbed in a train station in Zhengzhou in central
Henan province in 1997. Kidnapper Li Xiuzhong, who has been
arrested and convicted, sold her to three different men before she
was rescued on April 1, the Beijing Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
   Jin Yi was snatched at age 13 on the way home from school in
Beijing. Sold for $338 as a future bride for a farmer's son in
eastern Anhui province, she spent seven years doing farm work,
laundry and cooking before informants tipped off police, the China
Women's News reported.
</P>
<P>
   Police and the government-affiliated Women's Federation did not
respond to requests for interviews on the anti-kidnapping drive.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of kidnappings, the use of violence and sometimes
murder to steal children from their parents, and the tendency of
gangs to be well organized and ruthless are all cause for alarm,
Bai said.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Inner Mongolia, a man who bought an abducted woman
from southwestern Sichuan province fatally stabbed a policeman
attempting to rescue her, the Xinhua News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown on kidnapping rings has coincided with recent
advances in police technology, particularly the use of DNA
databanks to identify suspects and match children with parents.
</P>
<P>
   The first reported success in using DNA analysis to match a
rescued child to his parents involved a little boy named Zeng Chao,
a migrant worker's son stolen at knifepoint by a gang from his
family's shanty dwelling in a Beijing suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Chao was sold to villagers in neighboring Hebei province.
</P>
<P>
   Migrant families make easy targets for kidnappers because they
often run stalls in crowded markets and are too busy to watch over
children playing or napping nearby.
</P>
<P>
   When police rescued 42 kidnapped children in Guizhou province in
January, hundreds of migrant families turned up looking for missing
sons and daughters. Police used DNA analysis to match family
members.
</P>
<P>
   One migrant worker from northwestern Gansu province got a
suspended three-year sentence in 1997 after his wife informed on
him for selling their 5-year-old son to a factory owner.
</P>
<P>
   After the mother died of illness last year, the father sold his
3-year-old daughter for $181 and his now 8-year-old son for $483 to
raise money to buy another wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''His future will be the law's wrath,'' the China Women's News
reported.

<HEADLINE> McCain To Back SC Flag Removal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- After tap-dancing around the issue during
his presidential campaign, Sen. John McCain is expected to tell
South Carolinians he favors removing the Confederate flag from atop
the Statehouse dome.
</P>
<P>
   McCain planned to speak to the South Carolina Policy Council
today and say his decision to sidestep the flag issue is one of the
biggest regrets from his failed campaign, according to Republican
officials, who declined to be identified by name.
</P>
<P>
   Upon leaving a town hall meeting in Galesburg, Ill., Tuesday
night, McCain said he planned to address several issues during the
visit, including the flag controversy. He refused to say what
position he would take.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will make those remarks tomorrow,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   His spokesman, Todd Harris, also refused all comment.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Rick Quinn, a Columbia Republican who
helped lead McCain's South Carolina campaign, said, ''I think he's
going to say he supports moving (the flag) to the soldier
monument.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, in the past has said he wants the flag to remain where it
is, but now supports moving it to the monument in front of the
Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges called McCain on Tuesday after he
heard reports that McCain would talk about the flag during his
visit was.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges spokesman Morton Brilliant said the governor wants to
talk to ''anyone who can help end the flag debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Brilliant said he did not know what was said in the telephone
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat-controlled state Senate voted last week to move a
square version of the rectangular flag that now flies atop the dome
to the monument. However, the proposal will face opposition from
both sides in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
saying the flag is a hateful symbol of slavery, has started a
tourism boycott of the state. Flag supporters say it is a symbol of
the state's heritage. The NAACP has rejected the compromise saying
it moves the flag to a more visible spot on the Statehouse grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The flag was an issue that dogged McCain and Texas Gov. George
W. Bush as they campaigned here in early February, with both men
saying it was best left to South Carolinians to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning Tuesday in Dearborn, Mich., Bush was asked about
McCain going to South Carolina to talk about the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, said he planned
to stick with his position of letting South Carolina determine the
flag's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe the people of South Carolina should decide this
issue and I believe they will,'' Bush told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would endorse any decision to remove the flag, Bush
sidestepped a direct answer, saying: ''I will endorse the fact that
they have concluded the issue.''

   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- One senator cherished the opportunity as
a high honor. Another was dismayed and cautioned that the world was
watching. Some agonized over the implications.
</P>
<P>
   State senators gave preliminary approval Tuesday to a bill that
would make Vermont the first state to legally recognize
relationships between gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping short of recognizing gay marriages, the measure would
enable gay couples to form ''civil unions'' that would entitle them
to all 300 or so rights and benefits available under state law to
married couples. A final vote is scheduled for today.
</P>
<P>
   The measure passed by a 19-11 vote. Republican Sen. Julius Canns
was among those who sought to derail the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of the United States and the world will judge our decision
today,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   But other senators were jubilant over the historic vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here I am with the opportunity to vote to extend civil rights
in our state,'' said Sen. Jean Ankeney, a Democrat. ''It is for me
a high honor and one I will always treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar measure has already passed the House, but that chamber
will have to consider changes made by the Senate. Democratic Gov.
Howard Dean has said he will sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's gay couples would still not be entitled to the federal
benefits available to married couples in such areas as taxes and
Social Security. And unlike marriage, civil unions might not be
recognized in other states.
</P>
<P>
   As dozens of people thronged the Statehouse -- packed into the
cramped Senate chamber and spilling out into the hallways --
senators debated whether civil unions would eventually led to gay
marriage or whether they would threaten traditional marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this bill passed, would it have the tendency to encourage
homosexuality?'' wondered Republican Sen. John Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the many opponents of the bill, Sen. James Leddy
said civil unions would not undermine his 28-year marriage -- or
anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing in this court decision, nothing in this bill,
nothing in the committed relationships of two people that presents
a threat to my marriage,'' the Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate debate lacked much of the passion displayed during 17
hours of debate last month in the House, where the Legislature's
only openly gay member spoke several times, drawing tears to the
eyes of many observers.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the legislation, wearing white ribbons to signify
their support for traditional marriage, stood shoulder-to-shoulder
with supporters wearing pink stickers favoring civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court set the stage for the legislation with
its unanimous December ruling that same-sex couples were being
unconstitutionally denied the benefits of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would create a status parallel to marriage by
allowing gay and lesbian couples to obtain a license from their
town clerks and then have their unions certified by a judge or
member of the clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Same-sex couples then would qualify for the wide array of
benefits available to married couples, from being able to make
medical decisions on behalf of their partners to qualifying for
certain tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The couples would have to accept the burdens, as well. To break
up a civil union, couples would have to go through Family Court to
obtain dissolutions, just as when married couples divorce. Couples
would have to accept the joint debts of their partners, as well.
</P>
<P>
   National groups quickly weighed in after the Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tragic day for the state of Vermont, for the Senate has
ignored the will of the people,'' Janet Parshall of the Family
Research Council said in a statement. ''But it's an even sadder day
for the state of marriage, for the Senate action today was a direct
assault on this sacred institution.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest gay rights organization cheered the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vermont is taking care of its gay and lesbian citizens in a
way that other states are not,'' said David Smith of the Human
Rights Campaign. ''Vermont is restating its commitment to fairness
by today's action.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure had attempted to derail it Tuesday with
the pair of constitutional amendments. One would have added to the
constitution the definition of marriage as a union between a man
and a woman. The second would have overturned the state Supreme
Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Neither amendment won a simple majority.

<HEADLINE> Panel Seeks Judge's Testimony  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional investigators want U.S. District
Judge Norma Holloway Johnson to ''clear the record once and for
all'' and explain why she assigned six Whitewater and Democratic
fund-raising cases to judges appointed by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Government Reform
Committee, asked Johnson to testify at a hearing about her decision
to bypass the traditional computerized random selection system and
make the assignments herself.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would like to give Judge Johnson an opportunity to clear
the record once and for all,'' Burton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Johnson delivered Tuesday, Burton said, ''The
committee's objective is to learn why the random selection process
was not used.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has said politics played no role in her decision to
assign the cases to expedite their disposition.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said it's unusual for federal judges to testify
before Congress. Under the constitutional separation of powers,
Congress can't meddle in what courts do. But Johnson is not immune
from inquiries on administrative matters, in the opinion of Stephen
Gillers, a New York University law professor.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has both a judicial function and an administrative
function as a chief judge, so I don't think the decisions she makes
are immune from inquiry by another branch of government,'' Gillers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said the committee, which has scheduled a hearing for May
17, ''intends to focus solely on the administrative process of the
case assignments and will not make any queries which go to the
substance of these or any other cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's administrative assistant, Joe Alexander, refused to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported last summer that Johnson bypassed
the traditional computerized system of randomly assigning cases in
two high-profile Democratic cases involving presidential friend
Webster Hubbell and fund-raiser Charlie Trie.
</P>
<P>
   It was later learned that Johnson also directed four other
Democratic fund-raising cases to Clinton appointees. The cases
stemmed from a Justice Department investigation into Democratic
fund-raising practices during the 1996 presidential election
campaign that uncovered illegal foreign donations to President
Clinton's re-election. Burton's committee also has been
investigating the donations.
</P>
<P>
   Under local court rules, which have since been dropped, Johnson
could assign complex or lengthy cases to other judges instead of
using the random lottery system employed in nearly all cases.
Critics questioned whether the special assignments in the six cases
created the appearance of political favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said in a letter to a newspaper last summer that she
made the special assignments in the Hubbell and Trie cases ''to
move the docket as expeditiously as possible'' and that politics
was ''never a factor.'' She hasn't spoken publicly about why she
bypassed the random assignment system in the other four cases.
</P>
<P>
   A special panel began an investigation last month into the six
case assignments on behalf of a judicial body that oversees judges'
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson refuses the Burton committee's request, the panel
could issue a subpoena ordering her to testify. ''We haven't even
crossed that bridge, because we hope that she will agree to
testify,'' committee spokesman Mark Corallo said.

<HEADLINE> Congress, Clinton Differ on Arms  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top Pentagon official says sale of advanced
destroyers to Taiwan would be considered if a study showed they
were required to defend the island against mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   Undersecretary of Defense Walter Slocombe went on television
Tuesday night to defend the decision President Clinton made the day
before, on the Pentagon's recommendation, to shelve sale of four
Aegis destroyers and other weapons to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton approved a package of weapons that Sen. John Kyl,
R-Ariz., said was just enough to assist Taiwan without antagonizing
China.
</P>
<P>
   Slocombe said the weapons approved by Clinton on Monday were
what Taiwan needs now. He acknowledged on the PBS ''NewsHour''
program that China had taken a combative stance toward the island
and said the Clinton administration was ''certainly prepared to
consider'' providing Taiwan with the destroyers if a study showed
they were needed.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican senators, clashing with the administration,
insisted the study was a dodge to avoid approving sales to Taiwan
that might upset China, which considers the island a renegade
province and not a potentially emerging independent democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Three Republican senators, including Majority Leader Trent Lott
of Mississippi, criticized Clinton's decision on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Their statements suggested a legislative showdown with the White
House loomed. But Lott made no overt move to try to force a vote on
the island's defense requests.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring his disappointment, Lott said the Clinton
administration should have done more to enhance Taiwan's security.
''I hope this latest decision will not be misunderstood by
Beijing's leaders as a green light for further threats against
Taiwan,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing the administration of misrepresenting a smaller arms
package it approved as robust, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said only
one of Taiwan's six major requests, Maverick missiles, was
approved. The package also included sophisticated radar capable of
spotting missile launches deep within China.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
said the administration has given Beijing ''a veto over Taiwan's
defense request.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., said in a separate statement the
administration had sent the wrong signal to Beijing -- that
intimidation will limit the type and quantity of arms sold to
Taiwan for its defense.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing bitterly resents the U.S. military relationship with
Taiwan. Diplomatically, the United States deals with Taiwan
carefully, avoiding any suggestion it is promoting independence for
the island.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said the
government had ''taken note'' of reports of the Aegis decision. Sun
repeated Beijing's position that the United States should ''stop
all arms sales to Taiwan, including the long-range warning radar
and Aegis, so as not to obstruct the improvement of China-U.S.
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   In Taipei, Taiwan's military spokesman, Kung Fan-ding, said
Taiwan wants ''to acquire any weapons that would help build up its
anti-missile defense.'' He refused to comment specifically on the
U.S. weapons sale until there was an official announcement.

<HEADLINE> White House Thinking Environmentally  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The potential environmental damage caused by
government construction along fragile rivers and coastlines would
play a larger role in the approval of levee, dams and other water
projects under a proposal being circulated by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed policy changes intended to preserve wetlands were
included in a draft memorandum from President Clinton that was
obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press. The memo was sent late
last month to several top administration officials for their
review.
</P>
<P>
   It is especially aimed at the Army Corps of Engineers, the
beleaguered agency that oversees river construction and flood
control but has recently been buffeted by charges that top
officials rigged data to make a $1 billion Mississippi River
lock-expansion project appear economically justified.
</P>
<P>
   Entitled ''Enhanced Protection of Wetlands and Water
Resources,'' the draft memo calls for environmental impact to
receive as much attention as economic benefit when new projects are
considered, likely meaning fewer would be approved.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen members of Congress from both parties, most of
them from the upper Mississippi River region, sent a letter to
Clinton objecting to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new revisions would make it impossible to build another
port authority, improve another levee or maintain existing drainage
structures,'' Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., said last week at a
Mississippi River Commission hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Though the proposal was in the works long before the allegations
about the Mississippi River project became public, Scott Faber with
the conservation group American Rivers said those charges make the
memo more timely.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rational for these changes is stronger than ever,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A corps spokesman did not return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official, speaking only on condition of anonymity,
said the document may well change ''before it goes final, if it
does go final.''
</P>
<P>
   The source said the primary intent was to modernize the corps'
review process and to ensure it has the best environmental and
economic analysis possible.
</P>
<P>
   The draft memo called for directing the Army secretary to revise
within 90 days the guidelines for assessing civil works projects,
reversing the policy established under President Reagan which
placed far more emphasis on a project's economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new guidelines, federal water project evaluations
would have to take into account all threats to the environment. In
addition, the corps would be required to create new wetlands in
place of those destroyed to the same extent required of private
developers. And the agency would have to coordinate with other
federal agencies working on projects in the same area.
</P>
<P>
   ''Federal agencies would avoid adverse impacts to wetlands, to
water quality, and to wildlife refuges, estuaries, coastal waters
and parks,'' the memo says.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal singles out flood-control efforts along the
Mississippi for particular concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''The benefits of flood damage reduction have come at great
expense to the floodplain and riverine ecosystems associated with
the Mississippi River, which we have come to know as 'America's
River,''' it says.

131 Feared Dead in Philippine Jet Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- An Air Philippines jetliner carrying 131 people
crashed in the southern Philippines Wednesday and rescuers said there were no
signs of survivors. The Boeing 737-200, which began its flight in Manila,
circled its destination city of Davao, 625 miles southeast of Manila, before
going down in a coconut grove on nearby Samal island, officials said. Emergency
crews arriving at the site of the still-smoldering plane said there were no
signs of survivors. If that turns out to be the case, it would the worst plane

China Uncovers Trade in Women, Kids
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A police campaign to rescue kidnapped women and children and
punish those who snatch and sell them is shedding light on a massive flesh trade
stretching from remote villages to modern cities, including Beijing and
Shanghai. Some Chinese farmers desperate for brides buy them. Families purchase
sons to carry on the family line because birth control policies restrict many
couples to one child. Speaking to the Communist Party newspaper, People's Daily,
police assistant director of criminal investigation Bai Jingfu said widening
gaps between rich and poor and inadequate law enforcement were partly to blame.

   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The first three months of the year were the warmest in
the nation in 106 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. The latest data also shows that June 1999 through March 2000 was
the warmest June through March period ever in the nation, NOAA Administrator D.
James Baker said Tuesday. The January through March average temperature in the
nation was 47.1 degrees. That is 1 degree warmer than the previous record set in
1990. One degree of difference is a ''very robust'' margin, said Baker, adding
that global data is still being assembled.

   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- In a move the government said will help promote

''In this way we are getting closer to promptly initiating the (peace) process''

independent filmmakers who make their movies available over the Internet.
Miramax Films, a unit of the Walt Disney Co., has signed an agreement with
SightSound.com to offer 12 full-length feature films on the Web. The studio's
films include such critical and commercial successes as ''Shakespeare in Love,''
''The Cider House Rules'' and ''Pulp Fiction,'' but the company said Tuesday it
hasn't been decided yet which titles would be made available, how soon or at
what cost.

Japan Banks Agree on Merger
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. and Mitsubishi Trust and
Banking Corp. agreed Wednesday to set up a joint holding company, which would be
the world's fifth-largest financial group. The two banks will form the holding
company and integrate their operations by April next year, officials said. The
alliance would have $837 billion in deposits and other assets. The move will
enable the banks involved to compete against other planned megagroups in the
financial industry. The new firm will also manage $433 billion in pension and
other trusts, since it combines two BOT-Mitsubishi subsidiaries -- Nippon Trust
Bank and Tokyo Trust Bank -- with Mitsubishi Trust.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee Executes Child Killer  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SHARP, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee executed child killer Robert
Glen Coe by injection on Wednesday, the first person to be put to
death in the state in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Coe, 44, was executed for the 1979 rape and murder of an
8-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee was the only Southern state that has not executed
anyone since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in
1976. The last execution in Tennessee was in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, Coe had twice come within 16 hours of being
executed. Both times, federal courts blocked his execution so they
could review his mental competence. A federal appeals court found
him mentally competent and the U.S. Supreme Court denied his latest
appeal on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A state Supreme Court gave the final approval for the execution
early Wednesday, overruling a lower court that had issued a
temporary injunction over the execution method.
</P>
<P>
   Coe's case has been in the legal system for more than 20 years
since he confessed to raping and killing Cary Ann Medlin in
Greenfield in western Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   He told authorities that he had intended only to rape her, but
then ''she told me that Jesus loves me, and that is when I got so
upset and I decided to kill her.''
</P>
<P>
   The then-23-year-old mechanic was arrested three days later as
he was about to board a bus for Georgia. The black shoe polish he
had used to dye his hair was still dribbling down his face.
</P>
<P>
   His attorneys contend Coe's confession was coerced and driven by
mental illness caused from years of physical and emotional abuse by
his impoverished parents.
</P>
<P>
   Some religious leaders had condemned the Tennessee Supreme Court
for scheduling the execution during the holiest week on the
Christian calendar and at the beginning of the Jewish Passover.
Wednesday is the first evening of Passover and four days before
Easter.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the state's high court said the justices chose
the date because it was one week from April 11, when the appeals
court found him competent.

<HEADLINE> NHL Playoffs Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- When the elation of winning an overtime
playoff game subsided, goalie Dominik Hasek began thinking about
the uphill task the Buffalo Sabres still face.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great feeling to win. It was a relief for a couple of
seconds,'' Hasek said, following Tuesday's 3-2 victory over the
Philadelphia Flyers. ''But one win doesn't mean too much. We have
to win three more.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek stopped 26 shots and Stu Barnes scored 4:42 into overtime
as the Sabres averted being swept out of the best-of-7
opening-round series. Down 3-1, the Sabres will travel for Game 5
Thursday at Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal was very simple, to win the first game and we go from
here. There's still lots of work left,'' Hasek said.
</P>
<P>
   Only two teams -- the 1975 New York Islanders and the 1942
Toronto Maple Leafs -- have rallied to win from a 3-0 deficit in NHL
playoff history.
</P>
<P>
   In other NHL games, New Jersey grabbed a 3-0 series lead over
Florida with a 2-1 victory over the Panthers. Dallas beat Edmonton
4-3, stretching their series advantage to 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff was hopeful the Sabres found a crack in
the Flyers' defensive curtain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always said when you're losing, you never know when
you're going to win again,'' Ruff said. ''And when you win a game,
you think you can win them all again.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Brown and Miroslav Satan each had a goal and assist for
the Sabres, who won despite blowing a 2-0 lead and overcame yet
another disputed goal.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Tocchet and Keith Primeau scored and Mark Recchi had two
assists for the Flyers, who have lost eight straight overtime
playoff games. Their last extra session win in the postseason came
in the 1995 conference finals against New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's disappointing anytime you have a chance to win the
series,'' Flyers forward John LeClair said. ''It's not the end of
the world. And nobody said we were going to beat these guys four
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   James Patrick set up the game-winning play when he kept the puck
in at the point. He fed a bouncing pass to Barnes, parked in the
slot. Turning toward the net and falling down, Barnes wristed a
shot that went into the top right corner.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just react at that point,'' Barnes said. ''I can't say I
even picked the corner. I just tried to get it on net, and
fortunately it went where the goalie wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres started strong, and were undeterred when Vladimir
Tsyplakov's goal was disallowed 28 seconds in as referee Dan
Marouelli prematurely blew his whistle.
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming that and memories of LeClair's controversial goal in
Game 2, the Sabres built a 2-0 lead when Satan scored on a
one-timer 1:03 into the second period.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers responded with a two goals, capped when Primeau
chipped in a shot over Hasek with 1:35 left in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Then the goalies took over.
</P>
<P>
   Flyers rookie Brian Boucher was especially sharp. His biggest
stop was getting his arm up to block Chris Gratton's shot from the
slot five minutes into the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ''They seemed to throw everything. You could tell they were
playing desperate,'' said Boucher, whose Flyers were outshot 34-28.
''This was a game we wanted, but we're still up 3-1 and we need to
gather ourselves, go home and give it our best.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres did not play a perfect game. At times, they seemed
intent on being eliminated. Ruff was incensed by the undisciplined
penalties taken by defenseman Alexei Zhitnik.
</P>
<P>
   Along with drawing a double-minor for cracking Daymond Langkow
across the side of the helmet, Zhitnik took a foolish elbowing
penalty with 38.2 seconds left in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Zhitnik was hooked down from behind by Recchi and retaliated by
striking Primeau with a forearm across the back of his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ''It should have cost us the game,'' Ruff said. ''One thing we
talked about was discipline. No foolish penalties, none. No
retaliation. The series should be over when we do something that
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers' power play has been deadly. Six of Philadelphia's
nine goals in the series have come with the man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The status of deposed Flyers captain Eric Lindros remains
uncertain because of lingering headaches. Lindros, recovering from
a Grade 2 concussion, was in Philadelphia, where he consulted by
phone with his neurologist, Dr. James Kelly of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know when he'll return,'' team spokesman Zack Hill
said. ''He's supposed to go to Chicago when he's symptom free. And
he is not symptom free.''
</P>
<P>
Devils 2, Panthers 1
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rafalski had a goal and an assist and New Jersey closed on
advancing to the second round for the first time in three years
after winning at Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Game 4 in the Eastern Conference series is Thursday at Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur stopped 21 shots, including 15 in the third
period. Mike Vernon made 38 saves for the Panthers, who got a goal
from Ray Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   Panthers star Pavel Bure, the NHL's regular-season leader with
58 goals, has yet to score in the series.
</P>
<P>
Stars 4, Oilers 3
</P>
<P>
   Guy Carbonneau scored on a long wrist shot early in the third
period, lifting visiting Dallas over Edmonton, despite Bill
Guerin's hat trick.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars can advance to the second round with a home victory
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull, Richard Matvichuk and Mike Modano also scored for
the defending Stanley Cup champions.
</P>
<P>
   Guerin was the second Oilers player to score three goals in a
game this series. Doug Weight did it in Edmonton's victory in Game
3.

131 Feared Dead in Philippine Jet Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- An Air Philippines jetliner carrying 131 people
crashed in the southern Philippines Wednesday and rescuers said there were no
signs of survivors. The Boeing 737-200, which began its flight in Manila,
circled its destination city of Davao, 625 miles southeast of Manila, before
going down in a coconut grove on nearby Samal island, officials said. Emergency
crews arriving at the site of the still-smoldering plane said there were no
signs of survivors. If that turns out to be the case, it would the worst plane
crash in Philippine history.

China Uncovers Trade in Women, Kids
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- A police campaign to rescue kidnapped women and children and
punish those who snatch and sell them is shedding light on a massive flesh trade
stretching from remote villages to modern cities, including Beijing and
Shanghai. Some Chinese farmers desperate for brides buy them. Families purchase
sons to carry on the family line because birth control policies restrict many
couples to one child. Speaking to the Communist Party newspaper, People's Daily,
police assistant director of criminal investigation Bai Jingfu said widening
gaps between rich and poor and inadequate law enforcement were partly to blame.

First 3 Months of Y2K Warmest in 106 Years

	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The first three months of the year were the warmest in
the nation in 106 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. The latest data also shows that June 1999 through March 2000 was
the warmest June through March period ever in the nation, NOAA Administrator D.
James Baker said Tuesday. The January through March average temperature in the
nation was 47.1 degrees. That is 1 degree warmer than the previous record set in
1990. One degree of difference is a "very robust" margin, said Baker, adding
that global data is still being assembled.

Colombian Guerrillas Free Hostages

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- In a move the government said will help promote
peace talks, Colombia's second-largest rebel army on Tuesday freed eight
hostages seized a year ago in the hijacking of domestic airliner. Five people
are still being held. "This deed is very important," peace commissioner Victor
G. Ricardo was quoted as saying by the official government news agency ANCOL.
"In this way we are getting closer to promptly initiating the (peace) process"
with the National Liberation Army. The seizure of the Avianca airlines Fokker 50
by guerrillas of the leftist ELN was widely seen as an attempt to pressure
President Andres Pastrana's government into opening a peace dialogue with the

released Wednesday. Japan, a previous leader, languished in 17th place in the
poll of business leaders conducted by the International Institute for Management
Development. The U.S. economy has turned in 108 straight months of growth,
surpassing the record of 106 months between February 1961 and December 1969, the

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- In an overhaul of its midsize Oldsmobile Bravada sport
utility vehicle, General Motors Corp. has come up with something a little
larger, a little less gas-thirsty and a little more powerful. The 2002 model
that goes on sale next year represents a major shift in GM's strategy for future
midsize SUVs. By taking old technology and wringing more performance from it, GM
hopes to cut production costs while delivering more of the key traits that SUV
buyers want. The model is to be shown Wednesday at news media previews for the

<HEADLINE> Drug Director Criticizes Journalist  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE CASS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- National drug policy director Barry McCaffrey,
a former Army general, is defending himself against allegations
that his troops committed war crimes in the Persian Gulf -- before
any accusations have been made publicly.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey is trying to head off a planned article by Seymour
Hersh for The New Yorker magazine that the retired four-star
general believes may contain ''alarming and defamatory
allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said Tuesday that Hersh, who won a Pulitzer Prize in
1969 for exposing the My Lai massacre in Vietnam, has been
spreading false stories during interviews with friends and former
military colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: assertions that troops led by McCaffrey killed Iraqi
prisoners of war and committed other crimes covered up by the Army;
that McCaffrey committed several unspecified felonies in the
Vietnam War; and that he acted inappropriately in developing the
Clinton administration's proposal for a $1.6 billion anti-drug aid
package for Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh said Tuesday he had no comment about work not yet
published. A New Yorker spokeswoman said the magazine stands by his
reporting but wouldn't say what the story was about.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey concedes he doesn't know what will end up in the
magazine, but accuses Hersh of malice and ''journalistic
stalking.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've gotten calls from dozens of friends over the last three
months reporting a series of accusations by Mr. Hersh ranging from
bike theft at age 11 to atrocities in the Gulf War,'' McCaffrey
said in a telephone interview. ''They are defamatory and sort of
frightening to my friends and family.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, McCaffrey wrote New Yorker editor David Remnick
last month ''to give notice that I cannot accept false statements''
and ''libelous attacks'' on the soldiers of the 24th Infantry
Division who served under McCaffrey in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to McCaffrey's Office of National Drug Control
Policy, made available by a McCaffrey spokesman, Hersh denied that
he was acting maliciously.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am simply going about my business, as I have for the past 35
years, asking questions, listening to answers and trying to verify
and assess what I've been told,'' wrote Hersh.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorker spokeswoman Perri Dorset said the magazine has begun
its normal fact-checking of the piece. ''Sy's a terrific reporter
who has a proven track record and The New Yorker stands by that,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, McCaffrey and Hersh haven't spoken.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said he won't give Hersh an interview but is willing
to take written questions. In the meantime, he has complained to
editors at The New York Times and The Washington Post, as well as
other journalists, about Hersh's tactics. The Post published an
account of the dispute Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said he began discussing the situation with a few
journalists after two reporters told him they had heard Hersh was
pursuing the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Raimondi, spokesman for the U.S. Army Criminal
Investigation Command, said Hersh had requested and received
records of investigations of alleged wrongdoing at the end of the
Gulf War. ''There was no criminal wrongdoing found,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Corps Gen. C.E. Wilhelm, commander of the U.S. Southern
Command, and other current and former military officers have backed
McCaffrey in letters to the magazine or written accounts of remarks
by Hersh they considered biased.
</P>
<P>
   Dorset said The New Yorker has received pre-emptive strikes
against publication before.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the first time it's happened,'' she said. ''Anytime
you're working with sensitive material, you have people trying to
protect themselves.''

<HEADLINE> Bill to clean up Filthy Five doesn't go far enough, critics say  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The state's five dirtiest power plants
would be forced to clean up or shut down by 2006 under a bill
passed by the House early this morning, but some lawmakers say the
proposal does not do enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is no victory by any stretch of the imagination,'' said
Rep. Christopher Caruso, D-Bridgeport. ''2006 is unacceptable. It's
disgusting to even consider this.''
</P>
<P>
   Caruso had pushed for legislation that would have required the
so-called Filthy Five to reduce their emissions by 2003. Doctors
and environmental advocates say limiting the number of pollutants
being spit into the air will cut childhood asthma and other
breathing problems in the communities surrounding the plants.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed 137-9 at 2 a.m. today, now heads to the
Senate. It would require fossil fuel power plants in Norwalk,
Bridgeport, New Haven, Middletown and Montville to cut their
production levels of nitrogen and sulfur oxides by 2003. If they
couldn't meet that deadline, the plants would be eligible for
extensions through Dec. 31, 2006.
</P>
<P>
   After a similar bill passed last June on a 68-67 vote in the
House of Representatives, it died in a legislative committee.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of last year's bill said it could have derailed the
electric deregulation law that required the power plants to be
auctioned by the end of the year. They said passing the legislation
would hurt the value of the plants.
</P>
<P>
   NRG Energy Inc. of Minneapolis paid Northeast Utilities $460
million for the Connecticut Light &AMP; Power plants in Montville,
Norwalk and Middletown. The sale also included a CL&AMP;P plant in
Milford.
</P>
<P>
   United Illuminating, which owned the New Haven and Bridgeport
plants, sold its plants to Wisvest Corp. of Milwaukee for $272
million.
</P>
<P>
   The companies say the are already in compliance with standards
set by the federal Clean Air Act. They said reduce their emissions
any more would be too costly and would force them to close, thereby
cutting off power to areas of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can predict the lights will go out, and we believe
them,'' Caruso said. ''Now they'll close their plants in 2006, and
you will not see the benefit of cleaning them up. We gave the
lobbyists what they wanted.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed in early trading on
Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 54 points in
the early going. Losing issues on the New York Stock Exchange hold
a 9-to-8 lead over gainers.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is ahead 29 points and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Stock Index is down a fraction.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has held the bar pretty high for many corporations
this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts' estimates for corporate earnings have generally been
pretty high. And, for the most part, those who've reported have
managed to exceed the lofty estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But that may not be good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as America Online, Intel and Lucent all were sent
sharply higher on Tuesday before they released their earnings
reports. They now are likely to lead a bit of a retrenchment on
Wall Street, as the market's ''buy the rumor, sell the news''
phenomenon occurs anew.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 54; Nasdaq Off 37  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened moderately lower today as
investors took profits from a powerful two-day run.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 54.22 at 10,713.20.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Nasdaq composite
index was down 37.26 at 3,756.31, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 6.48 at 1,435.13.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two sessions, the Nasdaq has risen 472 points and
the Dow average has gained 461, wiping out big chunks of the
crushing losses sustained last week. Financial markets will be
closed Friday for the observance of Good Friday, and with a long
string of volatile sessions behind them, some investors were taking
a pause ahead of the long weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, earnings reports drove the market. Companies are
nearing the peak of the reporting season, and while most companies
have reported very strong profit growth, investors have punished
those that have shown any hint of weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Today, IBM fell 8{ to 106|. The company said late Tuesday that
while earnings beat analysts' expectations, sales slumped 5 percent
in the first quarter, dragged down by a broad decline in products

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 11; Nasdaq Up 11  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were narrowly mixed today as investors
took some profits from a powerful two-day run but couldn't resist
bargain-hunting in the recovering technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 11.09 at 10,756.33.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators turned higher after falling at the
opening. The Nasdaq composite index was up 11.56 at 3,805.13, and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 2.33 at 1,443.94.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two sessions, the Nasdaq has risen 472 points and
the Dow average has gained 461, wiping out big chunks of the
crushing losses sustained last week. Financial markets will be
closed Friday for the observance of Good Friday, and with a long
string of volatile sessions behind them, some investors were taking
a pause ahead of the long weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, earnings reports drove the market. Companies are
nearing the peak of the reporting season, and while most companies
have reported very strong profit growth, investors have punished
those that have shown any hint of weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Today, IBM fell 7 15/16 to 107 3/16. The company said late
Tuesday that while earnings beat analysts' expectations, sales
slumped 5 percent in the first quarter, dragged down by a broad
decline in products ranging from desktop computers to mainframes to
hard disk drives.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, a bellwether technology stock, fell 5 3/16 to 123 13/16
after reporting first-quarter profits rose 37 percent. Intel
executives also predicted unusually high sales for the
traditionally sluggish second quarter, followed by accelerating
revenue and profit during the last half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Intel stock had risen sharply in advance of the report,
prompting investors to take profits today. Also, some analysts were
looking for higher revenue growth in the coming quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the renewed focus on earnings is the strongest
legacy of last week's rout. Many attributed the cataclysmic selling
to investors who drove stocks up too high on pure momentum, then
panicked on the fear that earnings wouldn't justify their high
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fundamentals do count, and will probably continue to drive at
least the near-term buying momentum within the marketplace,'' said
Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP;
Co. in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The market was little affected by a report that the U.S. trade
deficit shot up to a record $29.2 billion in February as Americans'
demand for foreign oil hit an all-time monthly high while sales of
exports dipped.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department said today the deficit widened by 6.5
percent in February. The deficit was bigger than the $28.9 billion

</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 309.60 million
shares, slightly behind Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, three stocks rose for every two that fell.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.29 to 489.38.

<HEADLINE> State senator sued for not coming through with state money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Organizers of a first-time music festival
are suing state Sen. Nancy Larraine Hoffmann for failing to deliver
$30,000 in state money they say she promised.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of losing the money, the Great Northeast Blues
Festival had to cut back from three days to two, festival lawyer
Stephen Lance Cimino said today.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Jan. 3 letter to festival director Kyle Shirley,
Hoffmann's office agreed to provide $30,000, Cimino said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are happy to inform your agency that you have been awarded
$30,000 from this year's New York State Legislative Memorandum
Item. Funds awarded to you are to be used for the 1999 music
festival. These funds have been appropriated to you via Senator
Nancy Larraine Hoffmann's efforts in obtaining moneys in her
district,'' the letter read.
</P>
<P>
   Sarkis Harootunian, Hoffmann's spokesman, said the letter was a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   A Feb. 4 follow-up letter to Shirley said the festival would not
receive any money because it declined the grant.
</P>
<P>
   Cimino said the festival never declined the money.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Cimino said, Hoffmann offered $6,000 but said the money
had to be spent on certain items. She also demanded that a member
of her staff be placed on the festival board, Cimino said.
</P>
<P>
   Harootunian said Hoffmann offered $10,000 in state and private
money with no strings attached but the festival board declined it.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute began in February when The Smith Advertising Group
Inc. filed a complaint against the festival and Hoffmann seeking
$5,395 it had not been paid for designing the festival logo and
other advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   In late March, the festival filed a cross-complaint against
Hoffmann, saying the senator alone was responsible for any money
owed to the advertising agency. The complaint also asked the court
to issue a judgment ordering Hoffmann to pay the $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Harootunian said Hoffmann will be represented by a lawyer from
the state attorney general's office because she is being sued as a
state official, not as an individual.
</P>
<P>
   Harootunian said the case is no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's in City Court, not even in Supreme Court,'' he said. ''In
the legal world, it's a small item.''

<HEADLINE> Court To Decide on Miranda Warning  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today considered the future
of Miranda warnings given by police -- words Justice Stephen G.
Breyer said ''probably 2 billion people throughout the world
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideological differences among the justices were on display as
they worked toward deciding whether police must continue warning
criminal suspects about their right against self-incrimination
before questioning them, warnings that typically begin with ''You
have the right to remain silent.''
</P>
<P>
   Such warnings have been required ever since the Supreme Court's
landmark 1966 decision in Miranda vs. Arizona, but a federal
appeals court ruling last year threw Miranda's future into doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Congress effectively
overturned Miranda when it enacted a 1968 law.
</P>
<P>
   During today's hour-long argument session, Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia repeatedly challenged the
idea that Miranda warnings are constitutionally required. If not,
failure to give them would not require automatic exclusion of
incriminating statements as trial evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But Breyer and Justices David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and
John Paul Stevens resisted attempts to disparage the 34-year-old
ruling, which Breyer called ''a hallmark of American justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Clarence Thomas, who remained silent, often votes with
Rehnquist and Scalia in criminal justice cases. If so, the court's
decision, expected by late June, will hinge on the votes of
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Both voiced concerns about the 1968 federal law, known as
Section 3501, but their questions and comments did not appear to
provide a sound basis for predicting their votes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is this court that will ultimately decide whether the
Constitution is satisfied'' by the law Congress passed in reaction
to the Miranda ruling, Solicitor General Seth Waxman told the
justices.
</P>
<P>
   Waxman, the Clinton administration's highest-ranking courtroom
lawyer, urged the justices to strike down the federal law because
''the case has not been made to overrule Miranda vs. Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   But University of Utah law professor Paul Cassell argued that
the Miranda ruling offered temporary guidelines only. ''We now have
appropriate congressional action,'' he said in urging the court to
rule that Section 3501 satisfactory protects criminal suspects'
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The long-ignored federal law was thrust into prominence last
year when a federal appeals court invoked it in the case of a
Maryland man accused of robbing banks in Maryland and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dickerson of Takoma Park, Md., reportedly made several
incriminating statements to FBI agents after being arrested and
charged with seven bank robberies. He says he did not receive a
proper Miranda warning.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Dickerson nor the federal prosecutors who had opposed
his appeal to the 4th Circuit court focused on the 1968 law. But
Cassell, representing the conservative Washington Legal Foundation
as a friend of the court, sought to revive the dormant Section
3501. He won before the 4th Circuit court, spurring Dickerson's
Supreme Court appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The court, far more liberal 34 years ago than it is today,
sought to remedy ''inherently coercive'' interrogations by creating
bright-line guidelines in its Miranda ruling. Courts previously had
used a ''totality-of-the-circumstances test'' to determine whether
a confession or incriminating statement had been given to police
voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Section 3501 returns the law to pre-Miranda days, stating ''the
presence or absence'' of any factor such as a Miranda warning
''need not be conclusive on the issue of voluntariness.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices have received plenty of unsolicited advice in the
form of friend-of-the-court briefs.
</P>
<P>
   Among those arguing for the Miranda ruling's continued vitality
are the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers and the House Democratic leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Among those urging the court to uphold the appeals court's
ruling are the National District Attorneys Association, the
National Association of Police Organizations and 10 Republican
senators.
</P>
<P>
   Also siding with Cassell are 17 states: Alabama, Alaska,
Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi,
Nebraska, Nevada, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Utah and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Dickerson vs. U.S., 99-5525.

<HEADLINE> Clinton returns questionable soft money; unclear if Giuliani will  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton's U.S. Senate campaign
will return $22,000 from a businesswoman linked to a drug
trafficker but it was unclear if Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's campaign
will return questionable money from another source.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's Washington-based fund-raising arm received a $100,000
donation from a firm that owns a company identified in 1998
documents as the nation's top dumper of toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The donation to the Clinton campaign was made by Vivian
Mannerud, whose Airline Brokers Co. runs charter flights between
Cuba and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Mannerud has been linked by congressional investigators to Jorge
Cabrera, who made a $20,000 contribution to the Democratic National
Committee in 1995 from a bank account in which he kept profits from
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are returning the money because the contribution was
inappropriate,'' Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said
today and urged the Giuliani campaign to do the same with money it
received from the Renco Group.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Mannerud reportedly promised Cabrera an invitation to a
Miami fund-raising dinner honoring Vice President Al Gore if he
gave the money. The DNC eventually returned the donation.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after attending the party, Cabrera was charged with
smuggling 6,000 pounds of cocaine into the United States. He
pleaded guilty last year and was sentenced to 19 years in prison
and fined $1.5 million. Mannerud was never charged with any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the mayor's Washington-based Giuliani Victory
Committee, set up to accept soft money donations which legally
bypass federal fund raising restrictions, received a $100,000 check
from the Renco Group.
</P>
<P>
   Among Renco's holdings is the Utah-based Magnesium Corporation
of America, which was cited in a 1998 federal Environmental
Protection Agency report as the nation's top dumper of toxic
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Renco is run by Ira Rennert, who has angered neighbors on
eastern Long Island by building the largest house in the Hamptons --
a 100,000-square foot beachfront complex in Sagaponack, complete
with 29 bedrooms, 40 bathrooms, two bowling alleys and a movie
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have speculated that Rennert, a strong supporter of
Orthodox Jewish causes, plans to convert the structure into a
religious center, but his lawyer has insisted it's just a really
big, single-family house.
</P>
<P>
   The Renco donation, found in campaign reports filed in
Washington, was transferred to the National Republican Senatorial
Committee, where The New York Times said today it would likely be
used to finance direct mailings for Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Serafin, a spokeswoman for Giuliani's campaign, declined
comment, saying, ''The contribution was given to the NRSC and
you'll have to call them for comment.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the national Senate fund-raising committee,
Stuart Roy, said because it was a corporate contribution it was
immediately transferred from the Giuliani Victory Committee to the
NRSC. He said the committee was ''looking into'' the toxic dumping
report about the Utah company and he couldn't immediately comment.
As for returning the money, Roy said, ''I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Giuliani Victory campaign no longer has the Renco
money, Wolfson urged Giuliani to return it. ''As Hillary Clinton
travels the state offering real proposals to clean up the
environment, Rudy Giuliani takes more than $100,000 from one of the
nation's worst polluters,'' Wolfson said. ''Rudy Giuliani should do
the right thing and return this toxic contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   During an appearance Tuesday, Clinton also questioned the
mayor's campaign payments of $1 million to conservative direct-mail
fund-raising guru Richard Viguerie. With Viguerie's help, Giuliani
has out-fundraised Clinton $19 million to $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss dismissed
criticism of Viguerie by saying, ''when the Clintons get in trouble
or need a scapegoat, they always blame the vast right wing
conspiracy.''

<HEADLINE> Bone Cement May Fight Osteoporosis  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN MANNING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Liquid cement injected into the fractured
vertebrae of osteoporosis sufferers can reduce pain and limit
disfigurement caused by the degenerative bone disease, researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment is one of only a few available to osteoporosis
patients for compression fractures of the spine -- other than
extended bed rest, said Dr. Gregg Zoarski, lead author of the study
by the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is going to become standard care for patients who
have pain from compression fractures,'' Zoarski said.
</P>
<P>
   Zoarski, director of Diagnostic and Interventional
Neuroradiology at the University of Maryland Medical Center, and
his colleagues followed 30 patients treated with the procedure,
known as vertebroplasty, for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Using X-ray imaging as a guide, doctors insert a long needle
directly into the damaged vertebra. The quick-setting cement, which
has the consistency of wet cake frosting, is then pushed through
the needle into the bone.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure is typically done on an outpatient basis, and
patients are commonly allowed to go home two to three hours after
it is performed.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of the patients studied said they experienced
significant pain relief after two weeks. Their responses were
compared to the answers they gave on the same questionnaire before
the procedure was performed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've kind of reached a critical mass where there is enough
science that has been done on this that it is really igniting among
doctors nationwide,'' said Zoarski, who presented the findings on
March 28 to the 25th annual meeting of the Society of
Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Ten million Americans have osteoporosis, a disease characterized
by deterioration of the bone that can lead to fragility and an
increased risk of fractures, according to the National Osteoporosis
Foundation. The disease is blamed for 700,000 vertebral fractures
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Vertebroplasty procedures have been performed in the United
States for only about two years, but have been used by doctors in
France for over a decade, said Dr. Kent Thielen of the Mayo Clinic,
who has performed the procedure for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The cement has been used for many years to patch hip fractures
and to repair other bones. The substance has already been approved
by the Food and Drug Administration, Thielen said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients have to be carefully selected for the injections,
Thielen said.
</P>
<P>
   Only those who are in severe pain, localized to the area of the
compression fracture, are eligible for the injections at the Mayo
Clinic. That translates to only one out of every seven patients he
sees, Thielen said.
</P>
<P>
   For those who do fit the criteria, the success rates with the
injections are high.
</P>
<P>
   ''The beauty of this procedure is that it seems to be successful
where there was nothing else for these patients before,'' Thielen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zoarski and Thielen said they have found no significant
long-term problems or side effects from vertebroplasty. However,
neither has been able to follow patients for more than a year since
the procedure is relatively new, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Devine, a 69-year-old Deal resident who suffered a
fractured vertebra due to melanoma, said he was able to stand
several hours after he had the injection.
</P>
<P>
   He had been restricted to bed rest for over a week with the
fracture, and was in so much pain that he had to be taken to the
University of Maryland Medical Center in an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right after the operation I felt 100 percent better,'' he said
late last month as he waited to be released from the hospital.
''I'm a real active guy -- a skier, a runner and a boater. To be
laid low like that was difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that apparent high and rapid success rate that Zoarski
says makes the procedure so valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the kind of thing where you get these little old
ladies who are up for the first time in weeks,'' he said, ''they
want to hug you and send you cookies in the mail.''

<HEADLINE> For Kids Who Need 'Harry Potter'  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA NOONAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Kids are clamoring for another installment of
Harry Potter, the unlikely young hero of the smash adventure series
by J.K. Rowling.
</P>
<P>
   But book four in the series, ''Harry Potter and the Doomspell
Tournament,'' published by Arthur A. Levine, isn't due out until
July 8. That's just three months for grownups, but it might as well
be an eternity for kids who cite the adolescent magician as their
main inspiration for reading.
</P>
<P>
   ''Harry Potter is still a major topic of conversation,'' said
Becky Whidden, manager of The Children's Book Shop in Brookline,
Mass. ''Kids want another book and parents want to keep their kids
interested in books.''
</P>
<P>
   So booksellers are doing their best to interest young readers in
other works that have similar themes of magic, fantasy and
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it's the perfect opportunity to revisit classic
fantasy books that captivated children way before Harry Potter was
a gleam in Rowling's eye.
</P>
<P>
   For kids ages 10 and up, ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' series
(HarperCollins) by C.S. Lewis is a must-read, said Whidden. First
released half a century ago, the stories about a set of British
siblings in a magical land blended religious themes and mysticism.
</P>
<P>
   Kids who love books are being steered to classics like ''A
Wrinkle in Time'' (Yearling) by Madeleine L'Engle, and J.R.R.
Tolkien's ''Lord of the Rings'' series (Ballantine). T.H. White's
''The Once and Future King'' (Ace Books), about the adventures of
Merlin and King Arthur, and Susan Cooper's award-winning ''The Dark
Is Rising'' series published by Aladdin Books are other options for
Harry Potter-crazed young adults, Whidden said.
</P>
<P>
   Kids under 10, too, can be wooed with fantasy-type books
featuring child heros who remind them of Harry.
</P>
<P>
   Second- and third-graders may enjoy ''The Dragonslayers
Academy'' series (Grosset &AMP; Dunlap), about a boy attending school
to slay dragons. Kids who read on a fourth- to sixth-grade level
might like the ''Half Magic'' series (Harcourt Brace) by Edward
Eagar, or Jon Scieszka's ''Time Warp Trio'' adventures (Puffin).
</P>
<P>
   ''Kids love them, they're hilarious and they can read them on
their own. Kids that age can't always read Harry Potter,'' Whidden
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other fantasy-adventures worth exploring include ''The Last
Unicorn'' (New American Library) by Peter Beagle.
</P>
<P>
   At San Marino Toy and Book Shop, where 1,500 people turned out
last year for a J.K. Rowling signing, dozens of customers have
already pre-ordered book four, which is expected to weigh in at a
hefty 700 pages. The anticipated price tag is $25.95 a copy.
</P>
<P>
   The store plans to throw a ''Midnight Madness'' party from
midnight to 2 a.m. on July 8 so customers can pick up their books
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had parents who said their kids blew through Harry
Potter and now they're having trouble,'' said store manager Anne
McGann. ''(Harry Potter) is a tough act to follow. ... The books
got kids to read, which is a blessing, but there's been nothing
since to grab their attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the new Harry hits the shelves, McGann said, she's been
turning kids on to books like ''The Thirteenth Floor'' (Yearling)
by Sid Fleichman, as well as older favorites by Roald Dahl and
fantasy master Lloyd Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   McGann said Eva Ibbitson's ''The Secret of Platform 13'' (Puffin
Books) and books like ''A Series of Unfortunate Events,'' a
HarperTrophy series about a family of orphans by Lemony Snicket,
are also hits.
</P>
<P>
   Other popular fantasy titles for kids as old as 14 include ''The
Golden Compass'' (Del Ray) by Philip Pullman, and ''The Castle in
the Attic,'' one book in a time-traveling series by Elizabeth
Winthrop from Yearling Books, she said.

<HEADLINE> Houston Expands Museum of Fine Arts  </HEADLINE>
By MEGAN K. STACK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- A museum hailed as the most significant step the
Texas art world has taken in decades welcomes visitors with the
broken sarcophagi and mythological torsos of ancient Rome, glowing
white and low in long columns of light.
</P>
<P>
   The sculptures throw shadows, while screened skylights filter
cool daylight and rowdy paintings call to each other across the
silent rooms of the new $83 million expansion building of the
Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The newly polished oak, granite and limestone Audrey Jones Beck
Building, designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Rafael
Moneo, opened its doors to the public last month.
</P>
<P>
   Its 39 new galleries give the century-old MFAH an exhibition
space that is among the six largest in the country, museum
officials say. Twentieth-century painting and sculpture, along with
Oceanic, African, Asian and pre-Columbian art, will continue to be
displayed directly across the street in the original museum
building.
</P>
<P>
   The Beck Building houses more than 40,000 works of European art,
from the Roman figures in the lobby and to the post-impressionist
paintings upstairs, and American art to 1945.
</P>
<P>
   In a downstairs hall, wings and robes of bronze statues are
frozen in air, the gleaming heads hung low or tossed back, cutting
ancient silhouettes against the limestone walls. The sight was
enough to halt the architect's steps at first sight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in reverence for the art,'' the 62-year-old Moneo said.
''I thought, 'I helped build this house for the Roman bronze.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wandering the stream of galleries after the scaffolding came
down, museum director Peter Marzio imagined himself inside a canvas
painted by 17th-century Dutch painter Jan Vermeer. ''It's light
that's there and not there,'' Marzio said. ''You can't describe it;
you can just feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are there: Robert Frank, Jackson Pollock, the
sensuous explosions of Georgia O'Keeffe. Panes of Tiffany glass
gleam in a dim gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside the stained-glass mural, Texas Association of
Museums President Jack Nokes nodded in satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most significant addition to the state's visual
arts in decades,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And finished not a moment too soon, according to MFAH curators
and trustees. In the older museum, the electrical lighting system
blinked, the roof leaked and the air conditioning was flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, though, was the tremendous overcrowding plaguing
the museum: canvases and statues were herded out of sight, in
storage, for lack of space.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been very strong, very deep,'' Marzio said. ''But now we
can finally show, in public view, that our collections are
extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   The two buildings loom across the street from one another in
Houston's oak-shaded Museum District. The new and old structures
are linked by an underground tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   The shape of the original building was born when International
style architect Mies van der Rohe designed a glass addition to a
neoclassical marble base. The two sides of the shell back into one
another; solid, opaque walls collide with the transparency and
sheen of glass.
</P>
<P>
   That museum space, with its crazy-quilt jumble of styles and
materials, has delighted some critics, exasperated others. When
Moneo set about creating the Beck Building, plenty of observers
wondered what kind of relationship would be born between the two
exhibition halls.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the 1996 Pritzker Prize for architecture, Moneo
was asked to design a new Houston exhibit space in 1992. Moneo
created the Museum of Modern Art in Stockholm, Sweden, the Miro
Museum in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, and the Thyssen-Bornemisza
Collection in Madrid. He now is working on the new addition for the
Prado in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   His task in Houston was to free the existing museum. ''It was
jammed and crowded and spoiled and wasted,'' Moneo said. ''We had
to liberate it from its duties.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as exteriors go, the design stayed simple. Moneo's
Spanish-style reply to van der Rohe gives a stiff upper lip to the
street. Attention is pulled to the interior, and outside light is
limited.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a bit retrograde in that the galleries are
essentially 19th-century galleries,'' said Rice University
architect professor Fares el-Dahdah. ''But (Moneo) goes for the
counter strategy, and on those terms I like it very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the gallery opened, Moneo took in the sketches,
paintings and statues decorating the rooms he designed. Upstairs,
in the midst of the Impressionists, a single window frames the
skyline, throwing pale daylight across the floor. Underfoot, oak
that was stained an ashy hue laces into triangles and diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   A ring of intimate rooms, walls painted in ethereal blues and
greens, tug visitors down a path of European arts. The clean brows
of Botticelli give way to the brilliant brush jabs of pointillism.
</P>
<P>
   One thing was missing at the time, though, Moneo said. People.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hanging paintings are asking for people to be there,''
Moneo said. ''The way they are, they are asking for visitors.''

<HEADLINE> Landmark Play Still Potent  </HEADLINE>
By BENNIE M. CURRIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Like many families in the 1950s, the Youngers had
their sights set on the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Lee Younger longed for his own business. His mother,
Lena, wanted a new home and his sister, Beneatha, planned to go to
medical school.
</P>
<P>
   While these goals seem simple enough, this was a time when such
dreams were hard to come by for black families like the Youngers.
Theirs is a fictional story, but it was depicted in stunningly
realistic detail in Lorraine Hansberry's ''A Raisin in the Sun,''
the first play written by a black woman to be produced on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Goodman Theater opens its version of ''Raisin'' Friday
(April 21) to commemorate the play's 40th anniversary -- which
actually was last year -- and re-introduce the Youngers to
Hansberry's home town, the city in which her history-making saga is
set.
</P>
<P>
   Using personal experiences, including those leading up to a
pivotal Supreme Court decision involving her family, Hansberry
explored social and family themes in a way never before seen on the
Great White Way -- from a black perspective. Her examination of race
relations and a working-class family's strife are as relevant today
as they were when ''Raisin'' made its debut in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lorraine had insight into both human need and human
frustration,'' says Lloyd Richards, who directed the original
''Raisin'' production. ''The problems of the people in her play are
not just problems of black Americans. They are problems of people.
That is continually valid.''
</P>
<P>
   For Chuck Smith, an artist-in-residence at Columbia College in
Chicago, the Goodman's production is a chance to come full circle
as the director of the play that sparked his interest in the
theater. His first exposure to Hansberry's drama was the 1961 film
adaptation, which featured Sidney Poitier, Ruby Dee, Claudia McNeil
and Diana Sands, all cast members from the original Broadway
production.
</P>
<P>
   Both versions of ''Raisin'' generated widespread acclaim for
Hansberry, who became the youngest American and the first black
winner of the New York Drama Critic's Circle Award in 1959. The
prize catapulted the then 28-year-old writer into the midst of the
civil rights struggle and made her a catalyst for the black theater
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the play that put us over the hump,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   After ''Raisin'' emerged, ''people started looking at black
theater seriously, saying 'Oh, you can make money at this stuff,'''
Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   Woodie King Jr., founder and producing director of the New
Federal Theater in New York City, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lorraine ushered in a new era in America,'' King says. ''Her
play was one of the first to ever deal with blacks in a positive
way and show that we have family values and characters of multiple
dimensions, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The central conflict in the play revolves around Lena Younger's
late husband's insurance money and her desire to use it to move the
family out of their cramped tenement apartment and into a house in
a segregated white neighborhood on Chicago's South Side. She also
wants to pay her daughter's medical school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   But Walter Lee sees the money as a chance to open a liquor store
and a way to be more like the wealthy white men for whom he works
as a chauffeur. He wants to make life better for his son and
pregnant wife. In one poignant scene in the play, he tries to
convince his disbelieving mother that his plan will work:
</P>
<P>
   ''I open and close car doors all day long. I drive a man around
in his limousine and I say, 'Yes, sir; no, sir; very good sir.' ...
Sometimes it's like I can see the future stretched out in front of
me -- just plain as day. ... Hanging over there at the edge of my
days. Just waiting for me -- a big looming blank space -- full of
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Lee ultimately gets swindled out of the insurance money
and jeopardizes the Youngers' dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the family finds other means to buy their home. And
in a defining moment, Walter Lee asserts his manhood and rebuffs a
group of whites who try to buy off the Youngers to keep them out of
their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Hansberry's dead-on depiction of the Youngers' struggle to
persevere amid family conflict and the backdrop of bigotry is
perhaps the most enduring quality of ''Raisin.'' And the
generational conflict between Walter Lee and Mama Younger,
especially over his materialism, is another element that gives the
play contemporary appeal, says Margaret B. Wilkerson, who's working
on a Hansberry biography.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the first major play to deal with cultural ideas
without sacrificing the authenticity of that family,'' says
Wilkerson, a black studies professor at the University of
California at Berkeley. ''That's the genius of it. The play made it
OK and safe in a way to talk about those things that even my white
students were able to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   In writing about the Youngers' brush with bigots, Hansberry drew
upon her own family's real-life experiences: In 1938, the
Hansberrys moved into an all-white neighborhood near the University
of Chicago and endured flying bricks, court orders and other
hostile attempts to oust them.
</P>
<P>
   But Hansberry's father, Carl, fought back. He took his case all
the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. And in the 1940, the prominent
real-estate broker won a narrow ruling that paved the way for a
repeal of restricted covenants -- laws designed to keep blacks from
buying property in white neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Young Lorraine also accompanied her father while he made the
rounds collecting rent from families who lived in apartments much
like the Youngers' own. ''It seems that even as a child, she was
very observant and had sympathy and empathy for the people she
encountered,'' Wilkerson says.
</P>
<P>
   Hansberry later attended the University of Wisconsin at Madison
before moving to New York, where she married Robert Nemiroff, a
white Jewish songwriter and intellectual. Before pursuing her
career as a playwright, Hansberry edited Freedom, a radical
newspaper published by Paul Robeson. She died of cancer in 1965 at
age 34.
</P>
<P>
   Although she came from a relatively privileged background,
Hansberry attended segregated public schools with children who were
less fortunate and drew upon those experiences for ''Raisin.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansberry's gift for storytelling, coupled with the fact that
racism and discrimination still endure, are why her play continues
to be widely regarded as a timeless classic.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Mines Its Past for Movies  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A big, cheesy reptile. Another impossible
mission. That nutty professor. Mutant X-men. The return of John
Shaft. A new invisible man. Fred and Wilma and Barney and Betty.
Rocky and Bullwinkle and Boris and Natasha.
</P>
<P>
   Eyes on the prize means eyes on the past for Hollywood this
summer, with a movie slate heavy on sequels, big-screen adaptations
of small-screen icons, and films based on comics or best-selling
books.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last summer, when anticipation was hottest for the new
''Star Wars'' movie and Stanley Kubrick's ''Eyes Wide Shut,'' the
industry enters its busy season with no single film dominating.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty much status quo this year in terms of how the
wealth is spread,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor
Relations, which tracks the box office. ''It reflects a traditional
summer of sequels, films based on TV shows, action-adventure,
comedy and animated family films.''
</P>
<P>
   The lineup of derivatives includes Tom Cruise's ''Mission:
Impossible 2''; Eddie Murphy in ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'';
''The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,'' a second live-action
version of Bedrock's loudest neighbors; ''The Adventures of Rocky
and Bullwinkle,'' combining live actors with the animated moose and
squirrel; ''Hollow Man,'' a new twist on H.G. Wells' ''Invisible
Man'' premise; ''X-men,'' a live-action take on the comic-book
phenomenon; and Samuel L. Jackson in an updated ''Shaft.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Roundtree reprises his role as John Shaft, the tough,
independent private detective from the 1970s movies series. But the
action centers on Jackson as his nephew, also named John Shaft.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of passing the baton on,'' Roundtree said. ''Sam's
got an innate rawness that obviously works for the character. He
can be cold-blooded but has this innate charm, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's hitman comrade from ''Pulp Fiction,'' John Travolta,
stars in ''Battlefield Earth,'' a sci-fi epic based on L. Ron
Hubbard's novel about humans who revolt against alien conquerors in
the year 3000.
</P>
<P>
   And there's ''Godzilla 2000,'' thankfully not a sequel to the
overblown spectacle from 1998 that turned Japan's favorite monster
into an irradiated iguana on steroids. This one's more a throwback
to the beloved, guy-in-a-lizard-suit movies from the 1950s and
'60s.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood typically gains nearly 40 percent of its revenue
between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day. Buoyed by a stream of
hits last summer, including the surprise blockbusters ''The Sixth
Sense'' and ''The Blair Witch Project,'' the industry took in $3
billion for the season, a record in dollars unadjusted for
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of early hype, ''X-men'' and ''Mission: Impossible 2''
are perhaps a notch above the pack. Cruise's first update of the
spy classic in 1996 overcame a puzzling plot and unusual twist
(turning the TV series' main man, Jim Phelps, into a villain, then
killing him off) to gross $465 million worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   With action master John Woo directing, Ving Rhames returning and
Anthony Hopkins appearing as Cruise's boss, ''Mission: Impossible
2'' has ''can't miss at the box office'' written all over it.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount opens the movie for the long Memorial Day weekend, and
other studios generally are keeping out of Cruise's wake. Disney,
though, plans some counter-programming, moving Jackie Chan's latest
action movie, ''Shanghai Noon,'' from later-summer release to the
same weekend.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox's ''X-men'' features ''Star Trek's'' Patrick
Stewart as the telepathic leader of mutants who use their powers
for humanity's benefit. Other mutants, including Ian McKellen's
Magneto, are not so benign.
</P>
<P>
   McKellen, an Oscar nominee for ''Gods and Monsters,'' said
Magneto obviously differs in style from other roles such as his
lead in ''Richard III,'' but '''X-men' owes a great deal to
Shakespearean storytelling.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Magneto is often called one of the great comic strip villains,
though he doesn't think of himself as a villain,'' McKellen said.
''He's reminiscent of the complicated feelings you find in someone
like MacBeth as he pursues his ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Shakespeare, Miramax is releasing two film
adaptations of the Bard's work. ''Hamlet'' brings the melancholy
prince, played by Ethan Hawke, into a modern corporate setting.
Bill Murray, Kyle MacLachlan and Diane Venora co-star.
</P>
<P>
   ''Love's Labour's Lost'' is the latest Shakespeare adaptation by
another big-screen Prince of Denmark, Kenneth Branagh. The director
and co-star updated the romantic comedy to the early days of World
War II and turned it into a musical, with tunes by Irving Berlin,
Cole Porter and George Gershwin.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with recent years, studios are stretching the summer
by opening big pictures as early as a month before Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Twister'' helped launch that trend in 1996, premiering in
early May and grossing $242 million domestically. Other early
successes included ''Deep Impact'' in 1998 and last year's ''The
Mummy'' and ''Entrapment.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Universal debuts its World War II submarine movie
''U-571,'' starring Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton and Harvey
Keitel, on Friday (April 21), and ''The Flintstones,'' featuring
Mark Addy, Stephen Baldwin and Kristen Johnson, on April 28.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks weighs in May 5 with Ridley Scott's ''Gladiator,''
starring Russell Crowe as a deposed Roman general. The studio
offers Woody Allen's latest, ''Small Time Crooks,'' on May 19, as
well as ''Road Trip,'' a comedy about college buddies trying to
retrieve a sex tape one of them mistakenly sent to his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Other early entries include Sony's ''I Dreamed of Africa,''
starring Kim Basinger as a woman who swaps a comfortable life in
Italy for the hardships of Kenya; and Disney's ''Dinosaur,''
combining live-action backgrounds and computer-animated prehistoric
reptiles.
</P>
<P>
   June 30 is shaping up as the summer's pivotal weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Marching into theaters that weekend for the Fourth of July is
Mel Gibson's ''The Patriot,'' a Revolutionary War epic whose
trailer wowed theater owners at their annual convention in Las
Vegas in March. Gibson plays a widowed father of seven, a
French-Indian war hero reluctantly drawn into the American
Revolution. Sony recently previewed 45 minutes of the film for
reporters, showing off what promises to be an action-filled drama
that resembles ''Braveheart'' plus 500 years (or ''Lethal Weapon''
circa 1776).
</P>
<P>
   That same weekend, Warner Bros. launches ''The Perfect Storm,''
featuring George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg in the adaptation of
Sebastian Junger's best-seller about fishermen battling a monstrous
storm.
</P>
<P>
   Also coming June 30 is Universal's ''The Adventures of Rocky and
Bullwinkle,'' starring computer-generated versions of the TV
squirrel and moose alongside Robert De Niro, Jason Alexander and
Rene Russo as their nemeses, Fearless Leader, Boris and Natasha.
The three evildoers are pulled out of their animated universe and
into the real world. The movie allowed director Des McAnuff to
bring a 21st century sensibility to the cartoon series, which began
as a Cold War spoof.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fun is in a post-Cold War Rocky and Bullwinkle romping
around in the year 2000,'' McAnuff said. ''Fearless Leader becomes
a kind of media mogul in our version as he tries to take over the
U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other summer highlights:
</P>
<P>
   CHICKEN RUN: The animated adventure features the voices of Mel
Gibson, Miranda Richardson and Jane Horrocks as hens who hatch an
escape from a poultry farm.
</P>
<P>
   TITAN A.E.: Another animated feature, with Matt Damon, Drew
Barrymore and Bill Pullman among the voice cast. A teen searches
for a legendary spaceship to save humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ME, MYSELF AND IRENE: Jim Carrey reunites with the Farrelly
brothers (''Dumb &AMP; Dumber'') as a cop with a dual personality, both
of which fall for the same woman.
</P>
<P>
   GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS: Also reuniting are Nicolas Cage and
producer Jerry Bruckheimer (''The Rock'') in the story of a master
car thief unwillingly forced out of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS: Murphy returns as the portly
Sherman Klump, who uses the latest in DNA research to rid himself
of his unwanted alter-ego, Buddy Love.
</P>
<P>
   HOLLOW MAN: In another science experiment gone wrong, Kevin
Bacon updates the invisible man scenario, with remarkable special
effects to show the actor vanishing from skin to bones.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT LIES BENEATH: Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer star in a
thriller about a college professor trying to unravel the mystery of
a murdered student whose ghost appears to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   THE KID: Bruce Willis, the dead guy who befriended the kid in
''The Sixth Sense,'' meets his own 8-year-old self in this comic
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   POKEMON: THE MOVIE 2000: Sequel to last year's animated hit
based on the cartoon and Nintendo game characters known as ''pocket
monsters.''
</P>
<P>
   LOSER: Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari of last summer's hit
''American Pie'' re-team for a campus comedy about a dweeb who
finds romance.
</P>
<P>
   NUMBERS: Travolta stars as a cash-impaired TV weatherman who
conspires with the station's lotto-ball lady (Lisa Kudrow) to fix
the state lottery drawing.
</P>
<P>

   GIRLFIGHT: Michelle Rodriguez stars in a ''Rocky''-esque drama
about a teen who bucks tradition and enters the boxing ring. The
gritty, gutsy movie split the top prize at January's Sundance Film
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   THE REPLACEMENTS: As a warmup to the football season, Keanu
Reeves and Gene Hackman lead gridiron subs who step on the field
when the regular players go on strike.
</P>
<P>
   IMPOSTOR: Based on a story by sci-fi master Philip K. Dick, the
movie stars Gary Sinise and Madeleine Stowe in a tale of a
scientist suspected of being an alien intruder.
</P>
<P>

Florida retirement home.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the obvious films and stars, there's bound to be a
sleeper hit or two.
</P>
<P>
   ''As in all summers, there is a film out there that we're not
looking at much in the schedule,'' said Dergarabedian. ''Movies
we're aware of in name only, but we have no idea what kind of
phenomenon they could become.''

<HEADLINE> Photos Show Madness of Genocide  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW WELSH-HUGGINS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The woman in the black-and-white
photograph holds a sleeping baby in her right arm. She stares at
the camera, resigned, defeated. It is May 14, 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The picture will be useful to a high-ranking member of Pol Pot's
Khmer Rouge government. It is proof that these two enemies of the
state have been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ''Facing Death: Portraits From Cambodia's Killing Fields,'' a
100-photograph exhibit of Khmer Rouge victims, runs through May 28
at the Columbus Museum of Art. From Columbus, the show goes to the
Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University, June 18-Aug. 14;
the Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography in Ottawa, Sept.
10-Nov.6; the Weisman Museum in Minneapolis, Dec. 3-Jan. 29, 2001;
and the William Benton Museum of Art in Storrs, Conn., dates to be
announced.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit coincides with the 25th anniversary of Pol Pot's
genocidal reign over Cambodia, which began April 17, 1975. From
1975 to 1979, at least 1.7 million Cambodians -- one in five -- died
by starvation, disease, overwork or execution.
</P>
<P>
   As Pol Pot's brutal regime intensified, it also turned inward,
devouring its own. More than 30,000 members of the Khmer Rouge --
individuals judged traitors to the cause -- were jailed at Tuol
Sleng, a school-turned-prison in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arrival at the prison, known as S-21, prisoners were
numbered and photographed. After interrogation and torture, inmates
were executed. Only seven are known to have survived.
</P>
<P>
   The prison was finally liberated as the invading Vietnamese army
entered Phnom Penh in January 1979 and overthrew the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1993, U.S. photojournalists Chris Riley and Doug Niven
discovered 6,000 surviving negatives from the prison's photo
archive in a rusty drawer in a dusty upstairs room in S-21, now a
genocide museum.
</P>
<P>
   The black-and-white portraits are emotionally overwhelming. The
combination of their austere composition and the viewer's knowledge
of the prisoners' fate -- a fate not always known by the inmates --
draws you in and repulses you in the same moment.
</P>
<P>
   Most faces reflect the hopelessness of the victims' situation.
Sad. Worried. Shocked. Stoic. Defiant. Resigned. Angry. Startled.
</P>
<P>
   One young girl stares calmly at the camera, as if posing for a
school picture.
</P>
<P>
   A boy with a cloth tied around his neck and shoulders as if for
a haircut smiles broadly.
</P>
<P>
   Keo Sarun, an adolescent boy -- one of the few victims identified
-- faces the camera almost nonchalantly. His card -- No. 17 -- is
pinned to his skin just below his left collar bone.
</P>
<P>
   One man -- No. 389 -- is handcuffed to a taller prisoner on his
right. It's not until the second or third glance that you realize
the two doomed men are holding hands.
</P>
<P>
   Victims had numbers pinned to them for the photographs, but the
numbering started over every 24 hours, rendering the numbers
meaningless for identification purposes. Only later were victims
photographed with cards designating the date.
</P>
<P>
   One of those is a woman named Kong Saman, her picture taken May
17, 1978.
</P>
<P>
   From the bottom of the photograph, a child's hand floats
upwards, trying to clutch the woman's right sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   Children ended up in the prison because of a Khmer Rouge policy
of sentencing entire families to death to avoid family members
seeking revenge later.
</P>
<P>
   Niven, 37, now a Bangkok-based free-lance photographer, said he
and Riley decided the 6,000 negatives couldn't be treated as
representative, since at least 30,000 people died in S-21. Instead,
they turned to standard photographic criteria such as composition,
the ''critical moment'' and lighting, among other factors, in
selecting the 100 prints.
</P>
<P>
   They also gave special consideration to photos of women and
children, even though they were only a small percentage of the
prison population.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's so great about these pictures for me is it puts a
personal face on genocide and the tragedy of what happened in
Cambodia,'' Niven said. ''It has much more effect on a person than
just reading a story about what happened in Mitrovica today. When
you look at their faces, they're so clear, their expressions are so
close to our own -- it transforms you, puts you in their seat in a
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Some criticized the exhibit from the beginning, saying the
pictures weren't art. Niven said he understood that criticism, and
never intended to put the photos in a museum.
</P>
<P>
   ''But when we saw the negatives years ago and held them up to
the light before we had a chance to print them, we saw the art in
the negative,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The museum mounted the 100 photographs in a double row running
around an upstairs gallery's three walls. The goal was as neutral a
display as possible, said Catherine Evans, the museum's curator of
photography.
</P>
<P>
   ''To present the work in a context that allows for the
individual people to be recognized, since the majority are
unidentified -- no care was taken at the time to identify or
recognize them as individuals,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even after 25 years, the United Nations and Cambodia are still
divided over how to convene a joint tribunal to try Khmer Rouge
leaders for the mass killings.
</P>
<P>
   These photographs serve as a reminder of what happened, just as
a trial a quarter-century later would still have value to the
Cambodian people, said John Quigley, a professor of international
law at Ohio State University. Quigley testified as an expert
witness on genocide in Pol Pot's 1979 trial. His book on that
trial, ''Genocide in Cambodia,'' is being published this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''All these events are still traumatic enough that it makes
sense to try to bring some sort of end to it, even if it doesn't
resolve it,'' Quigley said. ''Trials don't make things better for
the people of Cambodia, but it is difficult for people to have to
exist in a situation where others have committed these really
horrible atrocities, are still in their midst and are not subjected
to any kind of penalty for it.''

<HEADLINE> Sofia Coppola Adds to Family Success  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sofia Coppola concedes her famous film-making
name helped land her directorial debut in theaters. At least a
little.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of Francis Ford Coppola enters the family business
with ''The Virgin Suicides,'' a darkly comic tale about five doomed
sisters and the teen-age boys who worship them.
</P>
<P>
   Making the film was a four-year odyssey nudged along just a bit
by her Hollywood pedigree, said Coppola, who appeared as an infant
and child in her father's first two ''Godfather'' movies and
co-starred as Al Pacino's daughter in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ''It opens doors, but you don't just get everything handed to
you,'' said the 28-year-old director.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this movie would have taken maybe twice as many years
to get made if my last name was Smith,'' she said. ''It's hard for
anyone. Everyone has to do whatever they can to get a movie made. I
get phone calls returned probably faster because of my last name.
But you have to prove yourself, and maybe even work harder to prove
yourself because of your name.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have been inevitable that Coppola would try directing.
One of her earliest memories was being on the set of ''Apocalypse
Now'' when she was 4.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone in my family is in the film business. I was talking
to my cousin and we were trying to think if there was anyone who
wasn't,'' Coppola said. ''It's just sort of what I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Her film-making family grew larger last year with her marriage
to Spike Jonze, who earned an Oscar nomination for his directing
debut, ''Being John Malkovich.''
</P>
<P>
   Featured at this year's Sundance Film Festival, ''The Virgin
Suicides'' is based on Jeffrey Eugenides' novel about the five
Lisbon sisters, their severely overprotective mother and hapless
father, and the lingering hold the girls have on the hearts of the
men who loved them in their teens.
</P>
<P>
   Decades after the girls inexplicably kill themselves, their
erstwhile beaus are left to ponder the reasons, waking up each day
to a world devoid of the perfection the Lisbon sisters represented
in their youth.
</P>
<P>
   The melancholy longing for lost innocence moved Coppola when she
read the novel several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not often you read something that captures that age in a
really true way,'' she said. ''With all the humor and tragedy,
everything you're sort of experiencing in your first crush, and how
it's so much more intense at that age.''
</P>
<P>
   The big question in the book and the movie was what prompted the
suicides. Coppola offers no easy answers, and did not want the
mother to be so villainous or the household so repressive that it
would drive the girls to kill themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because the point of the book was that there isn't one
reason,'' Coppola said. ''There's a million reasons, and there's no
good reason for something like that to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''The boys as adults have gone over it 20 years later, over and
over, trying to piece it together, and they still can't figure it
out. They've loved these girls and taken them with them. The girls
... are symbolic of the end of the boys' childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppola began writing the script as an exercise, figuring
nothing would come of it. She did not have the rights to the book
and knew another group of filmmakers planned to produce the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just felt protective of it -- you know how you feel something
belongs to you?'' Coppola said. ''I had envisioned every shot as I
wrote the script, and at the end I wanted to go shoot it. I felt
even more attached to it.''
</P>
<P>
   She got her chance when the other film project fell through.
Kathleen Turner, with whom Coppola had appeared in her father's
film ''Peggy Sue Got Married,'' signed on to play the dowdy,
inhibiting mother even before the financing had been lined up.
</P>
<P>
   James Woods co-stars as the father, a nerdy math teacher who
plays with model airplanes, and Coppola cast Kirsten Dunst as Lux,
the vampish sister whose date to the prom -- siblings in tow -- gives
the girls the only taste of normal life they will ever know.
</P>
<P>
   Coppola's father became one of the producers.
</P>
<P>
   Although he visited the set in Toronto and offered valuable
suggestions, ''he knew I knew what I wanted to make, so he was only
encouraging me to make it in my own way,'' Coppola said. ''A lot of
people ask, 'Was he there the whole time?' But I think it's clearly
my movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in the 1970s, ''The Virgin Suicides'' captures the era
through artful depictions of manicured suburbs, and especially
through music by such performers as ELO, Styx, Heart and Gilbert
O'Sullivan. Coppola crafts an evocative musical exchange by
telephone between the cloistered girls and their suitors, played
out entirely through such 45-rpm hits as Todd Rundgren's ''Hello
It's Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppola now plans to take a break, then look for another writing
and directing project. She hopes moviegoers will accept her work
independent of her long-famous father and newly famous husband.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't compete with Spike. I think he's brilliant,'' Coppola
said. ''And I hope that people will go see my movie just as
someone's first film. I hope once they see it, they can forget
about my family and all that.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 12; Nasdaq Up 44  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned modestly higher today as investors
took some profits from a powerful two-day run but couldn't resist
bargain-hunting in the recovering technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 12.10 at 10,779.52, having reversed an early loss.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also turned higher after falling at the
opening. The Nasdaq composite index was up 44.95 at 3,838.52, and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 4.38 at 1,445.99.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two sessions, the Nasdaq has risen 472 points and
the Dow average has gained 461, wiping out big chunks of the
crushing losses sustained last week. Financial markets will be
closed Friday for the observance of Good Friday, and with a long
string of volatile sessions behind them, some investors were taking
a pause ahead of the long weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, earnings reports drove the market. Companies are
nearing the peak of the reporting season, and while most companies
have reported very strong profit growth, investors have punished
those that have shown any hint of weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm fed the Nasdaq's gains, rising 12 5/16 to 124{. The
maker of mobile phone technology reported earnings of 25 cents a
share, beating analysts' expectations of 24 cents a share.
Qualcomm, one of the top-performing Nasdaq stocks in 1999, had
tumbled about 36 percent in the year to date as investors took
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Today, IBM fell 7 5/16 to 107 13/16. The company said late
Tuesday that while earnings beat analysts' expectations, sales
slumped 5 percent in the first quarter, dragged down by a broad
decline in products ranging from desktop computers to mainframes to
hard disk drives.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, a bellwether technology stock, fell 5] to 123| after
reporting first-quarter profits rose 37 percent. Intel executives
also predicted unusually high sales for the traditionally sluggish
second quarter, followed by accelerating revenue and profit during
the last half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Intel stock had risen sharply in advance of the report,
prompting investors to take profits today. Also, some analysts were
looking for higher revenue growth in the coming quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the renewed focus on earnings is the strongest
legacy of last week's rout. Many attributed the cataclysmic selling
to investors who drove stocks up too high on pure momentum, then
panicked on the fear that earnings wouldn't justify their high
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fundamentals do count, and will probably continue to drive at
least the near-term buying momentum within the marketplace,'' said
Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP;
Co. in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The market was little affected by a report that the U.S. trade
deficit shot up to a record $29.2 billion in February as Americans'
demand for foreign oil hit an all-time monthly high while sales of
exports dipped.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department said today the deficit widened by 6.5
percent in February. The deficit was bigger than the $28.9 billion
imbalance many analysts were forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a slender margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 309.60 million
shares, slightly behind Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, three stocks rose for every two that fell.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.14 to 492.23.

By The Associated Press	   Entertainment highlights during the week of April
23-29:
<TEXT>
<P>
   70 years ago: Lew Ayres starred in the film ''All Quiet on the
Western Front,'' directed by Lewis Milestone.

</P>
<P>
   15 years ago: In the cliffhanger battle of the nighttime soaps,
ABC's ''Dynasty'' edged CBS' ''Dallas'' by three-tenths of a point
to become the top-rated series of the 30-week prime-time season.
The ''Dynasty'' victory, its first in four seasons on the air, was
more for prestige, power and glory than advertising dollars since
the 1984-85 ratings of the two series were essentially the same.
</P>
<P>
   10 years ago: George Strait was named entertainer of the year at
the 25th annual Academy of Country Music Awards in Los Angeles.
Newcomer Clint Black won the male vocalist award.
</P>
<P>
   And British rocker David Bowie began the U.S. leg of his ''Sound
&AMP; Vision Tour'' in Miami. Bowie said the tour would be the last
time that he performed his old hits. ''I won't be singing
'Suffragette City' when I'm 50,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago: Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman starred in the
romantic comedy ''While You Were Sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   One year ago: Bowing to pressure from theater owners, 20th
Century Fox authorized the sale of advance tickets to ''Star Wars:
Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' Fox and LucasFilm Ltd. originally
banned advance ticket sales to stave off scalpers.
</P>
<P>
   John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton co-starred in ''Pushing
Tin,'' a comedy about a rivalry between two frantic air-traffic
controllers, and David Spade starred in ''Lost &AMP; Found,'' the story

</P>
<P>
   And Calista Flockhart, star of ''Ally McBeal,'' backed out of an
interview on NBC's ''Today'' show when its producers refused a
request not to talk about her weight. The ultrathin actress had
been denying rumors that she had an eating disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Spoken 10 years ago:
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't become a movie star because I made people cry, or
because I had some incredible romantic persona. I came on the scene
with an effervescence and a lightness and an ability to elevate
spirits, which, by the way, I do not sell short.'' -- Goldie Hawn.
</P>
<P>
   Spoken one year ago:
</P>
<P>
   ''I've made 101 films, and I throw up at the beginning of every
one.'' -- Donald Sutherland.

<P>
   In the spotlight:
</P>
<P>
   Melina Kanakaredes says the reason behind the success of her NBC
series ''Providence'' may ''have a lot to do with the accessibility
of a family story.'' Kanakaredes, who was born on April 23, 1967,
plays a Los Angeles plastic surgeon who returns home to Providence,
R.I. She told Parade magazine, ''People may not relate to or
understand a doctor story or a police story, but they understand a
family story.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Pacino says movies are OK, but he would rather act on the
stage. ''Movies are wonderful. I love seeing them. But they're not
as much fun to do for me,'' he told the Los Angeles Times. ''It's a
very fragmented existence. You may only shoot a minute a day.''
Pacino, who was born on April 25, 1940, made his Los Angeles
theater debut last summer. He appeared in Eugene O'Neill's
''Hughie'' at the Mark Taper Forum. Pacino played a gambler
chatting with a night clerk (Paul Benedict) at a seedy hotel. The
two won critical praise when they did the show in 1996 in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, tens of thousands of people logged on to watch the
gastric bypass surgery of Carnie Wilson, formerly of the Wilson
Phillips singing trio. During the procedure, the Web site
www.adoctorinyourhouse.com had 2.7 million hits, believed to be
about 50,000 to 200,000 viewers. Wilson, the daughter of Beach Boy
Brian Wilson, said prior to the surgery she was ''morbidly obese''
and the procedure provided a permanent solution to weight loss. She
was born on April 29, 1968.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Al Jarreau  </HEADLINE>
By NEKESA MUMBI MOODY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It doesn't take much prompting to get Al Jarreau
to belt out a tune.
</P>
<P>
   At recent dinner with several journalists and record executives,
Jarreau was asked to sing something -- anything -- so those present
could get an earful of his rich voice.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly stood up and wowed the crowd with ''Puddit,'' one of
the songs on his new album ''Tomorrow Today'' (GRP/Verve Records).
Then, after receiving a rousing ovation, he smiled and asked,
''Anything else?''
</P>
<P>
   The five-time Grammy Award winner and self-proclaimed
''loudmouth'' isn't shy about performing.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what I do better than anything, standing up in front of
an audience of 10 or 10,000, and reach inside and deliver a song,''
said Jarreau, whose hits include ''Mornin','' ''After All'' and the
theme song to the '80s comedy-drama ''Moonlighting,'' which starred
Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   Jarreau has delivered his first new songs in six years with
''Tomorrow Today.'' He co-wrote five of the songs on the album, a
typical Jarreau mixture of jazz, pop and adult rhythm and blues.
</P>
<P>
   He worked with Vanessa L. Williams on the inspirational song
''God's Gift to the World.''
</P>
<P>
   The singer/actress thoroughly charmed Jarreau.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vanessa is wonderful, I mean, as simple and sweet as she is
beautiful, '' he said. ''It was a dream come true. ... It's a
wonderful coming together of two people.''
</P>
<P>
   1. Why did it take you so long to record a new album?
</P>
<P>
   Jarreau: The main thing was that I left Warner-Reprise, where
I'd been since the very first album in 1975, 'We Got By.' I needed
to shop around and find some people. ... who understand that there
are things other than mainstream pop to be said musically and that
are valuable, and if we can begin there, and that if you also think
that what I'm doing is valuable stuff, then we have a beginning.
And that took a search. People whose music resembles mine are not
being signed a lot these days.
</P>
<P>
   2. A few years back, you complained about the lack of new young
jazz artists coming up. Do you think that has changed?
</P>
<P>
   Jarreau: I was talking about the fact that for a couple of
generations, young kids don't want to play instruments. No one that
they know doing music is playing instruments or singing a lot. Most
people are talking or rapping, as well as they're not being jazz
singers who are encouraged by what's on around them musically to
jump in and try some jazz. ... (But) there are some great new
voices on the scene who are doing really well, and those are some
real bright spots.
</P>
<P>
   3. You are constantly on tour. How has that affected your family
life?
</P>
<P>
   Jarreau: It's tough. I'm away a lot, and I realize all the time
that there are lost moments with my son, who is now 16, things I've
missed, lost moments with my wife, and things we've missed
together. But something's lost and something's gained in whatever
you do. This is my life, this is what I do, and it's not new to
either of them. My wife (Susan) was there before I did my first
album, and she's still with me now. It's a long time. (But) I spent
some days in the doghouse naturally!
</P>
<P>
   4. How do you think your approach to music has changed over the
years?
</P>
<P>
   Jarreau: I think I'm getting better at writing, I think I'm
getting better at performing, and I think my message is taking on a
more serious tone than it has before. I have always tried to say
things in music as often as I can about the goodness that we are,
and to present a positive and hopeful kind of view of the world and
mankind in this world, because that's how I feel about it.
</P>
<P>
   5: You just turned 60. Do you see yourself slowing down in the
next few years?
</P>
<P>
   Jarreau: That may come, but I don't see it in any real, near,
close-by, imminent time. ... I have a lot more to do in a very
physical way onstage in front of an audience. I've watched great
examples of people who've maintained health and still perform with
a great deal of vitality and artistry. I'd like to be doing it like
Tony Bennett. I'd like to do it like Frank Sinatra did.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Eric Heatherly  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Country singer Eric Heatherly thrusts
out his hands. They are rough with calluses from 10 years of
landscaping and painting houses while pursuing his dream of
stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew that the Lord would find some way to make this happen
for me,'' the 29-year-old singer-songwriter said. ''I just kept
trudging through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Things are happening in a big way for Heatherly, who looks like
Elvis Presley, writes songs like Tom Petty and John Mellencamp, and
plays Telecaster guitar like a surf rocker.
</P>
<P>
   His reworking of the Statler Brothers' ''Flowers on the Wall''
is getting radio airplay and rising in the charts, and his first
album ''Swimming in Champagne'' was just released by Mercury
Records Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just because you're different doesn't mean that you can't fit
and that you can't bring something to the table that people like,''
Heatherly said.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of playing Tuesday nights at the legendary
Tootsie's Orchid Lounge, Heatherly is regularly packing the house.
College students and truck drivers sing along to his songs, while
music industry spies and journalists lurk about to check him out.
</P>
<P>
   The police, however, aren't impressed. Heatherly said they cite
him for double-parking on nights when there is an event at the new
Gaylord Entertainment Center, across the street from Tootsie's,
where Willie Nelson and Roger Miller once drank and tried out new
material.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's irritating, man,'' he said, looking and sounding much
like Elvis with his light Southern drawl, black sideburns and
wraparound yellow-tinted sunglasses. ''So what? My equipment is
magically supposed to appear into the club?''
</P>
<P>
   Heatherly turned down a high-profile job playing guitar for
country music superstar Shania Twain on her last tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the toughest decision of my life,'' he said. ''I did
the 1997 CMA Awards with Shania and then was offered the guitar
spot for the 18-month tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Luke Lewis, head of Mercury Records, recommended Heatherly to
Twain. After Heatherly turned down the job, Lewis signed him to a
recording contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Luke really respected the fact that I was committing
so hard to my own thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Heatherly, the son of a truck driver and postal worker, was the
hot guitar player in Chattanooga as a teen-ager. He spent one year
in college to please his mother, then quit and moved to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in the heat of the Garth Brooks era and didn't fit
the mold of copycat acts being pushed at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knocked on every door in Nashville,'' he said. ''They'd say,
'Put a hat on. Put your big belt buckle and your boots and your
starched shirt on, and then we'll talk.'
</P>
<P>
   ''That drove me nuts, man.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent Tootsie's show, Heatherly proved he wasn't about to
fit into any mold.
</P>
<P>
   He opened the show with a Ventures-style instrumental that
showcased his guitar prowess. He did original numbers reminiscent
of Midwestern rockers like Mellencamp. The show culminated with
''Flowers on the Wall,'' which he has transformed from a
fiddle-and-banjo singalong to an electric guitar-centered tour de
force.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just one of those songs that never left me from when I
was a kid,'' Heatherly said. ''My dad had the 1965 vinyl record
version, back when the Statlers were dressed up like the Beatles,
with their pointed patent leather shoes and their striped ties. As
I got older, I started integrating it into my style with more
guitar riff stuff.''

<HEADLINE> David Nelson Band Tours  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF SIMONS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- David Nelson keeps on truckin'.
</P>
<P>
   The singer-songwriter-guitarist got his break during the
psychedelic Haight-Ashbury era of the '60s in San Francisco,
playing on three Grateful Dead albums, ''Aoxomoxoa,''
''Workingman's Dead'' and ''American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been more than a long, strange trip,'' said Nelson, 56,
echoing a line from ''Truckin','' one of the Dead's early anthems.
</P>
<P>
   ''David was there when that stuff was being born,'' said Barry
Sless, lead guitarist and pedal steel player with the David Nelson
Band, which has been together for six years. DNB's music is a
lyrical blend of rock 'n' roll, country and tempered improvisation.
</P>
<P>
   ''But most of us are second generation, who grew up listening to
that music and liking that style, as well as other styles of music.
That's where the sound comes from, and there's a definite influence
there -- first generation and second generation,'' Sless said.
</P>
<P>
   He shrugs off inevitable comparisons to the Dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do what we do, and whatever people say about us, it's
beyond our control. We just play the music that comes natural to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Nelson, Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter put together the
Wildwood Boys, the prelude to the Grateful Dead. In the early '70s,
Nelson, Garcia and John Dawson formed New Riders of the Purple
Sage, a spinoff country band that regularly opened for Dead shows.
Nelson's voice was featured on the band's hit single ''Panama
Red.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, he toured with the Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were fantastic years,'' said Nelson, who played lead
guitar on ''Box of Rain,'' another Dead standard.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a lot of good times on and offstage,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ''There was nobody in the world more fun to
hang out with than Garcia. He had a real spirit of adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Cooper is editor in chief of Volume Media, a company that
interviews artists and reviews CDs. He says the David Nelson Band
is a worthy carrier of the Grateful Dead legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''While other bands simply mimic the Dead, this band is, in
essence, a part of the Dead,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the David Nelson Band did a short tour of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were really well-received, and the folks had the same
spirit toward the music as the fans over here,'' Sless said.
</P>
<P>
   That spirit included a pair of Japanese Grateful Dead cover
bands that opened for the DNB, which has recorded four albums:
''Limited Edition,'' ''Keeper of the Key,'' ''Visions Under the
Moon'' and ''High Adventure in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   But like that of the Dead, the David Nelson Band's repertoire
doesn't resonate with every audience.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the band punched out the last chords of ''Kick in
the Head'' to a dancing-in-their-seats packed house at Antioch
College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, one of the last bastions of the
tie-dye and patchouli era.
</P>
<P>
   But at a recent performance at Albuquerque's Sunshine Theater --
a show that featured a cluster of new, improvisational material --
the sparse crowd of aging hippies could barely muster enough
enthusiasm to call the band back for an encore.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the band's appeal is creating rock 'n' roll that is
saturated with detailed counterpoint. Another is the blend of
talent and commitment that delivers strong and precise
performances.
</P>
<P>
   When the DNB rollicks through the Rolling Stones' ''Dead
Flowers,'' the New Riders' ''Lonesome L.A. Cowboy'' and Bob Dylan's
''Absolutely Sweet Marie,'' they punch up those ballads with drive
and clarity.
</P>
<P>
   Sless said many young fans are gravitating toward the DNB and
other jam bands that ''stretch out'' the music with lots of
spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
   But Sless said songwriting is another important component.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a taking-off point for the improvisation, we have strong,
original material -- lyrics that have real content to them. It's a
place to start from, and then we take off from there,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Matthew McConaughey Describes Heroes  </HEADLINE>
By SAMANTHA CRITCHELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Matthew McConaughey does not toss around the
word ''hero'' lightly.
</P>
<P>
   It was his desire to play ''a leader of men'' that drew him to
the role of Lt. Andrew Tyler in the new film ''U-571,'' which
follows a group of U.S. Navy submarine sailors on a dangerous high
seas mission against the Germans in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   ''The movie is a great hero's story. It's set in World War II --
'the good war' -- the war where there was a universal enemy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Does McConaughey have any personal heroes?
</P>
<P>
   ''Growing up, 'The Incredible Hulk' was a hero for a very
specific reason. I loved his three-strike rule. Mess with him once,
he'd say, 'No, thank you.' Mess with him twice and he'd say,
'Really, I'd just rather go about my business, please leave me
alone.' Mess with him a third time and he doesn't just get even, he
wins.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like that.''
</P>
<P>
   He also admires singer John Mellencamp for his words and music
about American pride and honor. It was through Mellencamp's songs
that he learned about patriotism, the Texas native said.
</P>
<P>
   His third hero is himself -- in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Saying that puts a meter on myself. It helps me keep a
long-term goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old actor knows where he would like to be when he's
40: He wants to have definite philanthropic goals, be more involved
in producing films through his company j.k. livin' (short for
''just keep living'') and possibly move into the director's chair.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, McConaughey said he never would have predicted his
success in films 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm the same guy, but the life that I'm living, I couldn't
even have imagined it,'' said a relaxed McConaughey, his feet
propped up on a table at a Manhattan hotel and his Southern drawl
still intact.
</P>
<P>
   McConaughey was a student at the University of Texas when a
chance meeting with a movie producer at a hotel bar led to his
breakthrough role in ''Dazed and Confused.'' McConaughey played a
dope-smoking slacker in the 1993 film, directed by Richard
Linklater.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lady luck shines on you at certain times, and when she does,
you have to play your cards, lay it down, get in the game. But you
have to know when she's shining,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His other film roles include ''A Time to Kill'' with Sandra
Bullock, ''Contact'' with Jodie Foster and ''EDtv'' with Jenna
Elfman.
</P>
<P>
   McConaughey said working on ''U-571'' was unlike any movie he
had ever worked on.
</P>
<P>
   The film required the actors to be in confined replicas of a
submarine, which kept them cold and wet for several hours at a
time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   No women were cast in principal roles, and after five months of
working with Bill Paxton, Harvey Keitel and Jon Bon Jovi,
McConaughey joked that he now understands why sailors behaved the
way they did when they went on shore leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''Think of what it was like for those guys. Months at sea, you
get to land and -- ah -- the scent of a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   While on location in Rome and Malta, McConaughey stayed as close
to the set as possible instead of commuting to nicer hotels. The
trip back and forth would have cost him at least an hour a day of
sleep, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really respect my sleep. I need my eight hours. ... When I'm
working, I go on a pretty good regimen. I don't play on school
nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up for McConaughey is the romantic comedy ''The Wedding
Planner'' with Jennifer Lopez. He said the choice was a deliberate
one after ''U-571.''
</P>
<P>
   When he isn't working, McConaughey enjoys playing golf,
traveling, gardening and listening to music. He splits his time
between Los Angeles and Austin, Texas.

<HEADLINE> Gore OKs Water Heater Standards  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is proposing tougher efficiency
standards for residential water heaters, Vice President Al Gore
announced today, the latest in a number of environmental
initiatives from Gore's office as Earth Day approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, the Democratic presidential candidate
announced a proposal to protect drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   The new standards for water heaters, being developed by the
Energy Department, will reduce costs for consumers and keep
millions of tons of greenhouse gases from reaching the atmosphere,
Gore said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The final water heater standard, if finished later this year,
would go into effect in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ''These new standards will help save consumers money on energy
bills and reduce greenhouse gases and other pollution,'' Gore said
in a draft announcement obtained Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although first word Tuesday of the planned announcement took
some people at the Energy Department by surprise, officials at both
the department and the White House said today Gore's office and the
department had been working closely on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and department ''have been working on this
initiative for some times,'' said Paul Bledsoe, a spokesman for the
White House Climate Change Task Force. DOE spokeswoman Natalie
Weimer said the department was ''fully involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore says the more-efficient water heaters will reduce
greenhouse gas emissions by 36 million metric tons over 20 years,
equal to taking 28 million cars off the road, and help curtail the
prospects of global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Americans spend $20 billion a year to heat water, which accounts
for 14 percent of all household energy requirements, Gore noted in
a news release. Over the typical 12-year life of a water heater,
the average consumer would save about $100, the Energy Department
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Gore announced the Environmental Protection Agency
was proposing new requirements on 157,000 water systems that get
water from public wells so as to reduce the risks from bacteria and
parasites.

<HEADLINE> Fido has a chip in his shoulder  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN EWING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- In an effort to make identifying lost pets
easier, animal shelters across New York have begun injecting tiny
microchips under the skin of animals under their care.
</P>
<P>
   The microchips will eventually enable the shelters to reunite
significantly greater numbers of strays with owners.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was once a select crowd that asked for their animals to be
chipped, but over the past few years, more and more people are
requesting the procedure,'' said Dr. Laurie Coger, with the Mohawk
Hudson River Humane Society.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies manufacture the chip, which has grown steadily
in popularity. California-based Avid Inc. registered 608 pets in
1996, but that grew to 4,414 in 1999, according to company
spokesman Mike Tuttle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've sold about 7 million microchips to shelter operators and
veterinarians,'' Tuttle said. ''Shelters in big cities like
Phoenix, St. Louis and New York City have all been using the chip
for several years.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the technology works:
</P>
<P>
   Each chip stores a nine-digit number. The chips are 14
millimeters long -- about the size of a grain of rice -- and weigh
about 0.25 grams.
</P>
<P>
   Workers use a hypodermic needle to inject a chip just under the
skin of a dog or cat -- usually in the animal's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   When a lost or abandoned animal is brought to the shelter,
workers use hand-held scanners to emit low-frequency radio waves
that can read the number of the chip inside an animal.
</P>
<P>
   Shelters use a computer database to match the number with the
pet's owners.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's relatively cheap, quick and it's a good way to identify
your animal should they become lost and later found,'' said Dr.
Kenneth Rotondo, a veterinarian with the Animal Health Center in
Clifton Park.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at the Mohawk Hudson River Humane Society in suburban
Albany do the procedure upon request. Soon, however, they expect
the procedure to become standard for all strays brought to the
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals of Central
New York has already begun the procedure on all of its animals
awaiting adoption. But according to chairman Bob Habberfield, it
may take three or four years before there are enough chip-carrying
animals in Onondaga County for the technology to become widespread.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, many animal owners have had success with a low-tech
identification system -- either dog tags that identify the animals,
or a tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   Records are kept at the shelter that identify the people who
adopt the tattooed animals.
</P>
<P>
   The process usually helps a shelter return the animal to its
rightful owner if they become lost.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tattoo was not a bad idea, but it was difficult to see if
hair had grown over the tattoo, or if you had an aggressive animal
and had to check their underside,'' Dr. Coger said. ''I would have
to say that scanning is infinitely preferable.''

<HEADLINE> Snowstorm Closes S.D. Highway  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Heavy, wet snow piled up on the western Plains today,
closing a
lengthy section of South Dakota's main east-west highway and
closing schools in the Nebraska Panhandle.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scattered power outages were reported in the two states as tree
limbs broke under the weight of the snow and wind gusted to 50 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The South Dakota Highway Patrol closed a 150-mile stretch of
Interstate 90 between Kadoka and the Wyoming state line. Highways
in Wyoming remained open.
</P>
<P>
   South Dakota Gov. Bill Janklow said people needed to stay off
the roads for their own safety and the safety of others.
</P>
<P>
   ''If something happens to them we're not going out until the
storm ends because it's too dangerous for rescue workers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got jackknifed trucks and people stranded. It's quite a
mess,'' said Highway Patrol Capt. Greg Ingemunson.
</P>
<P>
   The Rapid City airport was closed and parts of the city were
without power as snowdrifts piled up.
</P>
<P>
   Today's snow followed drenching rain.
</P>
<P>
   ''It rained like crazy last night. Now it's snowing like
crazy,'' said Scott Brewer, assistant manager at the Windmill Truck
Stop on I-90 just northwest of Rapid City.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer said his normally 10-minute drive to work took 45 minutes
this morning.
</P>
<P>
   A blizzard warning for lower elevations across the plains of
western South Dakota called for 8 to 16 inches of snow and north
wind blowing at 25 to 40 mph. At higher elevations of the
mountainous Black Hills, up to 2 feet of snow was possible, the
National Weather Service said.
</P>
<P>
   By 8 a.m., 18 inches of snow had already accumulated near Lead
and Nemo in the higher Black Hills, with 8 to 14 inches on the
plains.
</P>
<P>
   At least 6 inches of snow had fallen at Harrison, Neb., and
visibility was reduced to only two blocks in parts of the area.
</P>
<P>
   Travel was not recommended and schools called off classes in
western Nebraska as wind gusted to 45 mph.

<HEADLINE> Key Oklahoma Bombing Figures  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A look at key figures in the Oklahoma City bombing:
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIMOTHY McVEIGH: A former Army soldier from Pendleton, N.Y.,
angry at the government for the seige at Waco, Texas, McVeigh was
convicted of the April 19, 1995, bombing that killed 168 people. He
is on death row at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind., and is
appealing his conviction, arguing ineffective counsel in his trial.
</P>
<P>
   TERRY NICHOLS: Nichols sits in an Oklahoma County Jail cell just
blocks from the bomb site, waiting for a state trial on 160 counts
of first-degree murder. Nichols has been sentenced to life in
prison on federal convictions of conspiracy and eight counts of
involuntary manslaughter for the deaths of eight federal law
enforcement officers. He is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL FORTIER: Fortier, from Kingman, Ariz., is serving a
12-year federal sentence after pleading guilty in August 1995 to
four charges. He admitted he had prior knowledge of the bombing
scheme but did not alert authorities. He also admitted to lying to
investigators, hiding evidence and trafficking in firearms the
government said were stolen to finance the bombing. He is appealing
his sentence as too long.
</P>
<P>
   AREN ALMON-KOK: The mother of year-old Baylee Almon, whose
picture in the arms of firefighter Chris Fields became a lasting
image of the attack, has become a spokeswoman for a private
foundation urging the installation of shatterproof glass. She
married in 1997 and has a daughter, Bella Almon Kok. She and her
husband, Stan, are expecting their second child.
</P>
<P>
   CHARLES PORTER IV: An amateur photographer, Porter won the
Pulitzer Prize for his picture of Baylee Almon. He worked in a
downtown bank at the time. Porter, who occasionally shoots weddings
and other events, began taking college courses with an eye on a
physical therapy degree. In March, he was accepted to a three-year
physical therapy program at Hampton University in Virginia and
plans to begin classes June 20.
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS FIELDS: The firefighter in whose arms Baylee Almon was
placed by police Officer John Avera, Fields remains with the city
fire department. He still loves his job and loves to go to work
every day. Fields and his wife, Cheryl, have a 14-month-old son,
Parker, and a 7-year-old son, Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   EDYE SMITH STOWE: Four days after the bombing, Edye Smith sat at
the nationally televised memorial service and clutched a teddy bear
while mourning the loss of her sons, 2-year-old Colton and
3-year-old Chase. After reconciling briefly with her husband and
undergoing a procedure to reverse a tubal ligation, they divorced
in September 1996. She later met and married television engineer
Paul Stowe. They have a son, Glenn. Mrs. Stowe plans to become a
full-time cosmetologist in April.
</P>
<P>
   JON HANSEN: As the spokesman for the city fire department,
Hansen's was the face the world saw each day as he gave updates
about rescue and recovery efforts in the weeks after the bombing.
He retired in July 1999 to take a job at Oklahoma City
Freightliner, where he is general manager of its emergency vehicles
division in Oklahoma and Texas. The company supplies firefighting
equipment, mostly large fire trucks.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- A man who spent 19 years in one of the
nation's toughest prisons until DNA tests exonerated him -- and
implicated his brother -- says he believes in his brother's claims
of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not angry, I'm not bitter, but thank God for DNA,'' Clyde
Charles said Tuesday. ''It beat the rap for me. Modern technology
put my feet back on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles was sent to the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola
for a life sentence after a jury convicted him in June 1982 of
raping a 26-year-old nurse in March 1981.
</P>
<P>
   He was freed in December. Marlo Charles, Clyde's brother, was
arrested for the rape earlier this month in Hampton, Va., after the
DNA tests Charles had requested implicated his brother in the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference, Charles, 47, said he has no direct
knowledge of his brother's guilt or innocence but believes
officials are again pursuing the wrong man.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did the same thing to me for 19 years,'' he said. ''Marlo
told me he didn't do this, and I stand with my brother. He hasn't
had his day in court. I love my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he wouldn't have served the prison time for his
brother. ''I wouldn't spend 19 years in jail for anyone, not in a
hard place like Angola,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Charles filed a federal lawsuit March 29 against
Terrebonne Parish prosecutors who blocked the DNA testing, alleging
civil rights violations and wrongful imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   He was age 28 when he was sentenced to life in prison for raping
a 26-year-old nurse near a house where the Charles brothers had
been drinking in Houma, about 40 miles southwest of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   A flat tire had stranded the woman, and she said a man came up
behind her, punched her in the face and raped her. The nurse
identified Clyde Charles as her attacker. Authorities say the two
brothers look a lot alike.
</P>
<P>
   DNA testing wasn't available at Clyde Charles' trial and he was
convicted. He later spent nine years trying to persuade authorities
to compare his DNA with the preserved semen evidence.
</P>
<P>
   After he was released, authorities focused on Marlo Charles, 44.
The younger brother's DNA was on file in Virginia because of a 1992
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Marlo Charles is now imprisoned in Houma under a $1 million bond
and faces a possible life sentence if convicted of aggravated rape.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 71; Nasdaq Off 26  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned modestly lower today as investors
took some profits from a powerful two-day run and sold stocks that
failed to live up to high expectations for corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 71.98 at 10,695.44, having reversed an early loss.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were moving between positive and
negative territory. The Nasdaq composite index was down 26.00 at
3,767.57, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 6.49 at
1,435.12.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two sessions, the Nasdaq has risen 472 points and
the Dow average has gained 461, wiping out big chunks of the
crushing losses sustained last week. Financial markets will be
closed Friday for the observance of Good Friday, and with a long
string of volatile sessions behind them, some investors were taking
a pause ahead of the long weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, earnings reports drove the market. Companies are
nearing the peak of the reporting season, and while most companies
have reported very strong profit growth, investors have punished
those that have shown any hint of weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Today, IBM fell 8| to 106{. The company said late Tuesday that
while earnings beat analysts' expectations, sales slumped 5 percent
in the first quarter, dragged down by a broad decline in products
ranging from desktop computers to mainframes to hard disk drives.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, a bellwether technology stock, fell 6~ to 122[ after
reporting first-quarter profits rose 37 percent. Intel executives
also predicted unusually high sales for the traditionally sluggish
second quarter, followed by accelerating revenue and profit during
the last half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Intel stock had risen sharply in advance of the report,
prompting investors to take profits today. Also, some analysts were
looking for higher revenue growth in the coming quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm rose 7{ to 119 11/16 on the Nasdaq. The maker of mobile
phone technology reported earnings of 25 cents a share, beating
analysts' expectations of 24 cents a share. Qualcomm, one of the
top-performing Nasdaq stocks in 1999, had tumbled about 36 percent
in the year to date as investors took profits.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks, which are seen as more stable growth stocks than
the volatile technology group, were mostly higher after
Warner-Lambert reported that operating profits surged 35 percent in
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert rose 7 11/16 to 114 15/16 and Merck rose 2 11/16
to 68 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the renewed focus on earnings is the strongest
legacy of last week's rout. Many attributed the cataclysmic selling
to investors who drove stocks up too high on pure momentum, then
panicked on the fear that earnings wouldn't justify their high
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fundamentals do count, and will probably continue to drive at
least the near-term buying momentum within the marketplace,'' said
Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP;
Co. in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The market was little affected by a report that the U.S. trade
deficit shot up to a record $29.2 billion in February as Americans'
demand for foreign oil hit an all-time monthly high while sales of
exports dipped.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department said today the deficit widened by 6.5
percent in February. The deficit was bigger than the $28.9 billion
imbalance many analysts were forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 658.60 million
shares, behind Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, three stocks rose for every two that fell.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.20 to 488.29.

<HEADLINE> Report: Mother killed autistic son to end rapes, abuse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Exasperated and frightened, a woman says
she decided killing her 13-year-old autistic son was the only way
to stop him from raping and abusing her and her two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I set the fire I knew I had to end the abuse,'' Michelle
Davis of Fleming told police shortly after her arrest last
September for arson and murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted him to sleep and never wake up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis told police that her son, Daniel Leubner, had raped her
and beaten her just a few hours before she set the fire that killed
him. The words in her six-page signed statement were written by a
state police investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of Davis' confession appeared Wednesday in The
Post-Standard of Syracuse, which obtained the statement through a
Freedom of Information request.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 37, pleaded guilty March 14 to first-degree manslaughter
and second-degree arson, both felony charges punishable by up to 25
years in state prison when she is sentenced April 27. She had faced
more serious charges of first-degree murder and second-degree
murder. If convicted of murder, Davis could have been imprisoned
for life.
</P>
<P>
   She was allowed to use an ''affirmative defense,'' which holds
that she suffered from ''extreme emotional disturbance'' the night
of the fire. Her plea came several days after a four-day closed
hearing on whether to suppress her statement as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   According to the statement, Davis was home alone with her son
earlier on the night of the fire. Davis said her 9-year-old
daughter had gone to a friend's house and her 15-year-old daughter
was at a concert. Davis was estranged from her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Leubner had an outburst earlier that night while Davis's younger
daughter was home. He had punched and kicked Davis and thrown
objects.
</P>
<P>
   Around 8:30 p.m., Leubner, naked, approached her on the back
porch. She screamed when he hit and scratched her.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I ended up giving in. I didn't think I stood a chance,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the rape lasted about five minutes. Afterward, Davis
told him to get dressed, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He showed no remorse for this act,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes after he beat me he would say he was sorry. He
seemed to be very dangerous to me at this point,'' the confession
read.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said she agonized over the situation, trying to decide
what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought of my girls and the danger Danny posed to them. I
didn't think he would beat them, but I thought it wasn't beyond him
to sexually abuse them,'' the confession stated.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said Leubner had ''tried things'' with one of
Davis' daughters and had raped Davis before.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought a long time about what I could and couldn't do. I
thought I needed to stop it and end it. I couldn't stand it
anymore. I couldn't take another beating or another rape by him,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and her younger daughter slept outside on the porch that
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought the fire would make enough carbon monoxide to put
him asleep, but not burn my house down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she used nail polish remover, wrapping paper and a
candle to start the fire in a closet under the stairs. She planned
to get up after a short time but instead fell asleep, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement describes Davis waking up to her daughter's
coughing and smoke in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's when I realized, my God, what have I done?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She sent her daughter to get help and tried to rescue her son.
She said she realized she couldn't go upstairs because of the fire.
She climbed on the roof of the back porch to Daniel's bedroom
window, broke the screen and opened the window but the heat and
smoke drove her back.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said she realized she should have called police to report
the rape but didn't want her son taken away and institutionalized.

<HEADLINE> New S.F. Cable Car Introduced  </HEADLINE>
By JESSIE SEYFER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- They just don't make cable cars like they
used to -- except, of course, in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Working from dog-eared blueprints and plans kept only in their
heads, four carpenters spent 3,000 hours making a brand-new cable
car that's set to hit the rails Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The new, green and white No. 9 car was crafted by hand, from its
bronze-alloy bell to its Alaskan cedar roof. It will carry its
first passengers exactly 100 years after the death of the father of
cable cars, Andrew Hallidie.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred also is the car's life expectancy because the San
Francisco cable cars are so solid, made almost entirely of oak, and
are so painstakingly maintained.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the number one reason they last longer than street
cars is that they're hand made,'' says 45-year-old Bob Harris, a
carpenter who has crafted cable cars for 22 years. ''There's
special care in everything. Plus, they have no motor parts to wear
out.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's first cable cars started wearing out in the
1980s, and the Municipal Railway workshop has been crafting new
ones just about every other year.
</P>
<P>
   According to the San Francisco Cable Car museum, Hallidie
hatched upon the innovative idea of making street cars that grab
constantly moving underground cables for power after seeing a
horse-drawn streetcar accident in 1869 in which five horses were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   In the following years, cable car systems bloomed in cities all
over the world, only to be eclipsed in the 1940s by electrical
street cars, subways and buses. While San Francisco's routes shrank
to just two -- crisscrossing the hilly city on the California and
Powell lines -- the cable car and its clanging bell has become a
city landmark.
</P>
<P>
   Locals tend to shy away from the cable cars since the admission
price is double that of buses, but tourists line up by the hundreds
for the thrill of hanging perilously off a lurching, old-fashioned
machine.
</P>
<P>
   According to legend, the original blueprints were destroyed in
the fires that followed the 1906 earthquake, and since then
craftsmen have been drawing up patterns on the fly and passing the
craft down through the generations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have bits and pieces of plans, but a lot of it is just in
the carpenters' heads,'' says Harris. ''It's like putting a puzzle
back together. That's what I really like about working here, it's
such a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Each 7-ton car costs about $275,000. Constant maintenance is
needed to replace the wooden brake shoes and grips that grab the
underground cable, which moves at a constant speed of 9 mph. Both
the shoes and grips are crafted at the Municipal Railway workshop
and must be replaced every three days.

<HEADLINE> NYC: Standing Water Is Nuisance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In an effort to combat virus-carrying
mosquitoes, city leaders have declared standing water to be a
public nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Health approved a resolution Tuesday giving city
inspectors the power to enter private property without an owner's
consent and remove any containers with standing water.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners could be billed for the cleanup and fined up to
$2,000.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution is part of an effort to rid New York of breeding
grounds for mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus. Last year, the
virus killed seven people and sickened scores more in the
metropolitan region.
</P>
<P>
   Before the resolution, city officials had to declare a puddle on
private property a nuisance and allow the person responsible for it
a chance to clear it. The policy was largely ineffective against
the mosquitoes, which can grow to maturity in a week.

<HEADLINE> 4 Sentenced in Viagra Smuggling Case  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Four businessmen were sentenced Wednesday to a
maximum six months in prison for trying to smuggle 70,000 doses of
Viagra in a sting run by an undercover officer posing as a Russian
mobster.
</P>
<P>
   ''This disrupts the legitimate pharmaceutical industry in a
significant way,'' U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore said.
''Consumers may not know if they're getting what they believe
they're purchasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, Assistant U.S. Attorney Karen Rochlin
welcomed the prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sentence imposed reflects a recognition that this is a
serious offense with potential to harm innocent consumers,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   A Miami Beach detective assigned to an organized crime task
force targeting Russian mobsters became the nightclub owner known
only as Vladimir in the sting.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra became wildly popular internationally after it was
introduced in 1998. A wholesaler, broker, shipper, lawyer and
middleman got together with Vladimir late that year to put together
the $1.6 million deal. All were convicted of conspiracy to
distribute Viagra without a wholesaler's license, though one of
them has such a license.
</P>
<P>
   Rochlin argued during trial that a second license was needed on
the receiving end and everyone in the conspiracy knew Vladimir
intended to sell the Viagra doses illicitly to his bar patrons.
</P>
<P>
   The Viagra sale went beyond a business deal to unlicensed
distribution with Vladimir calling himself crooked and telling all
what he planned to do with the pills, prosecutors said. Wholesaler
Victor Penafiel suggested concealing the Viagra with vitamin labels
when shipping it out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Goodman, who helped organize the group, was the only
defendant to speak on his own behalf before sentencing, apologizing
and saying the case ''was due to my lack of better business
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Lachman Raichandani, the shipper, Matthew Scott, the broker,
Goodman and Penafiel had no reaction to their sentences. They must
report to prison by June 19.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Jon Freeman, agreed under his guilty plea to
cooperate with the prosecution but was not called as a witness. He
was sentenced earlier to probation.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned modestly lower today as investors
took some profits from a powerful two-day run and sold stocks that
failed to live up to high expectations for corporate earnings.
</P>

   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was down 73.76 at 10,693.66, having given
up a solid midday gain.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were moving between positive and

top-performing Nasdaq stocks in 1999, had tumbled about 36 percent
in the year to date as investors took profits.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks, which are seen as more stable growth stocks than
the volatile technology group, were mostly higher after
Warner-Lambert reported that operating profits surged 35 percent in
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert rose 5} to 113 and Merck rose 2{ to 68}.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers Squibb broke the trend, tumbling 18\ to 47 after
the company announced that it will withdraw a new drug application
for hypertension drug Vanlev from the Food and Drug Administration.
The drug was expected to be a blockbuster for Bristol-Myers.

<HEADLINE> ''Fifth Beatle'' Artwork on Display  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) -- Rarely seen artwork and letters of
''fifth Beatle'' Stuart Sutcliffe go on display in England this
week, offering new insight into the legendary band's early
influences.
</P>
<P>
   The bass player's work, mostly unseen for 40 years, has been
loaned to the Beatles Story Museum in Liverpool for a year by his
sister, Pauline.
</P>
<P>
   Sutcliffe, a Liverpool Art School friend of John Lennon, was 21
when he died in April 1962 from a brain hemorrhage, just six months
before the band's first hit ''Love Me Do.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair had met three years earlier and Sutcliffe, a talented
artist, was persuaded to join Lennon's band, Johnny And The
Moondogs. Sutcliffe quit the group in 1961 to continue his art
studies.
</P>
<P>
   Museum curator Shelagh Johnston said Sutcliffe's work and
letters should be of great interest to Beatles' fans.
</P>
<P>
   The late 1950s ''was so important in the formation of the band
and their relationships and was a potent period in developing their
style,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Kissinger Laments Candidates' Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Henry Kissinger says he's disappointed
that presidential candidates aren't talking more about foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things are changing in every part of the world. ... These
events are bound to affect us,'' the former secretary of state
said. ''Distances have shrunk, communication is easier. This
affects our national security.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Americans ''have always felt that we can withdraw
(from world affairs) or involve ourselves at will,'' the Nobel
Peace Prize winner said Tuesday in a speech at the Pasadena Civic
Center.

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma City Bombing Marked  </HEADLINE>
By TIM TALLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Church bells chimed on streets that once
rang with a bomb's blast. Children saw their reflections in a calm
pool where there was once an ugly crater. And families found
serenity Wednesday in a place that has pained them for five years.
</P>
<P>
   On the anniversary of the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred
P. Murrah Federal Building, 168 sculpted chairs stood in silent
tribute to the 168 victims of the most deadly terrorist attack on
American soil.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me it's like my funeral for him, my time to say goodbye,''
said 20-year-old Sarah Broxterman of Las Vegas, who lingered over
the stone-and-bronze chair inscribed with the name of her late
father, bombing victim Paul Broxterman.
</P>
<P>
   The chairs soon overflowed with flowers as thousands came for
the first of two ceremonies to dedicate the Oklahoma City National
Memorial at the site of the federal building.
</P>
<P>
   Bells tolled at 9:02 a.m., the exact moment when the
fuel-and-fertilizer truck bomb exploded and stripped the face from
the building, turning its nine floors into a tomb of concrete and
steel.
</P>
<P>
   After the names of the victims were read, family members,
survivors and rescuers stepped through one of two golden gates
marking the entrance to the memorial. There were 149 big chairs for
the adult victims and 19 little ones for the children who died.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt their presence there. I feel their presence every day
in the office,'' said Renee Kiel, who clutched roses as she walked
among the 35 chairs representing Housing and Urban Development
co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Children with thick sticks of chalk scrawled messages on tiles
beneath artwork in the children's area of the memorial. Some dipped
their fingers into the dark reflecting pool that stretches along
what once was the bomb crater.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Allen, who was severely injured but was one of the few
children in the building's daycare center to survive, stood waving
an American flag. His hand still bears scars and a tube helps him
breath.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was lovely,'' said his grandmother, Delores
Watson.
</P>
<P>
   An honor guard representing the rescuers who rushed into the
building first and stayed for weeks to recover the dead hoisted a
U.S. flag over the site. Lifted by a stiff breeze, the flag snapped
to its full length.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno were to appear
at another ceremony Wednesday evening. During the morning event, a
pastor urged families, survivors and rescuers to ''hold on to the
memories'' but move on with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''This whole memorial will serve as a reminder that hate may
blow up a building but we as a people will never forget,'' said the
Rev. Robert Allen, a United Methodist minister who coordinated
civilian chaplains during the rescue effort. ''We as a people will
never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Just blocks away, Terry Nichols sat isolated in an Oklahoma
County Jail cell awaiting an August preliminary hearing on 160
state counts of first-degree murder in the attack. Nichols and
Timothy McVeigh were convicted in federal court. McVeigh, who was
sentenced to death, is in a federal prison in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols had no way of watching or hearing the memorial services,
said Sheriff John Whetsel. ''It will be just another day in the
life of a typical inmate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many family members left the memorial content that it met the
stated mission to remember the dead, and survivors. But Jannie
Coverdale, who lost her two grandsons in the daycare center, had a
different reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those empty chairs, they are too sad,'' she said. ''I don't
have to go downtown to be reminded my grandsons are dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Broxterman echoed the thoughts of other family members
that the memorial offered comfort and serenity. She placed flowers
on the fence that long served as an impromptu memorial at the site
and left saying she felt somewhat settled by being there.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully I can put this behind and find peace,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Launches Texas Ballot Bid  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KOENIG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Reform Party presidential candidate Pat Buchanan
says it plainly: carrying Texas ''is going to be no easy
assignment.'' In fact, just getting on the ballot for November is a
tough task in the home state of George W. Bush and Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan needs 56,000 valid signatures by May 8.
</P>
<P>
   And he's getting no help from Perot, the billionaire founder of
the Reform Party, silent so far.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan came to the state this week to rally his troops in an
effort to win a spot on the Texas ballot. He was speaking again
Wednesday night in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush won re-election as governor with nearly 70 percent of
the vote two years ago. And Most Texas political observers think
even Vice President Al Gore, the likely Democratic nominee, will
privately concede the state to Bush without a big fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't see any scenario where Buchanan can be competitive.
Bush is solid in this state,'' said Bill Miller, an Austin lobbyist
and former campaign consultant to both Republicans and Democrats.
He said Buchanan, a former Republican who polls in the single
digits, is probably in Texas hoping for an in-your-face boost by
qualifying in Bush's backyard.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Perot could help. But the Dallas billionaire
has kept a low profile in recent weeks. On the rare occasions when
he has appeared in public, he has declined to answer questions
about the party or his own political plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Perot pushed for Buchanan it would help him get the
signatures,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a University of Texas political
scientist and no relation to the presidential candidate. But he
noted that in 1994 Perot endorsed Democratic incumbent Ann Richards
for governor over Bush, and she lost.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, some Reform Party officials have started a
draft-Perot petition drive. However, Russell Verney, a Perot
employee and former party chairman, said, ''It would take a miracle
for Ross Perot to run this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's bid also comes against a backdrop of ferocious
infighting within the party that he hopes to lead. Former party
officials say hundreds of activists have quit in the aftermath of a
nasty fight over control of the party. Some of those who remain
complain that Buchanan has hijacked the party.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Buchanan is pressing ahead in Texas with volunteers
augmenting 10 of his paid workers who are circulating petitions.
They say they've already gathered 30,000 signatures -- state
political veterans say Buchanan will need 100,000 to withstand
challenges by state election officials.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan told a rally of about 100 volunteers Tuesday night in
Irving that he's running to give voters a choice between Bush and
Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're Xerox copies of one another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan aimed most of his fire at the Texas governor,
criticizing Bush's recent meeting with gay activists and accusing
him of wavering in his anti-abortion stance.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Geren, a former Democratic congressman from Fort Worth,
said Buchanan isn't a threat to Bush in Texas ''but he's carved out
an interesting niche for himself. He'll appeal to some conservative
Republicans and also some protectionist Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Geren predicted, however, that Buchanan's anti-immigration
positions will not play well in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bush simply dismissed Buchanan, saying Texas
voters will overwhelmingly support the governor.

<HEADLINE> FBI holds anti-terrorist exercise in Philadelphia  </HEADLINE>
By RON TODT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Crouching behind their shields and a sleek
black vehicle, the black-helmeted FBI tactical team crept toward
the community center where a terrorist was holding a nameless
public official.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing wires from their command post, they tossed a phone
within reach of the open doorway before retreating as carefully as
they came. After a few minutes, the terrorist himself emerged, head
covered by a coat, with a gun next to his female captive.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a drill, but nobody smiled and nobody yelled
''cut.'' The fictional hostage drama being played out over three
days at the old Philadelphia naval base is aimed at making sure any
real event this summer ends as happily.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred FBI agents and support personnel from
Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey are taking part in ''Stolen
Liberty,'' a major exercise to prepare for terrorism or other
activities during the Republican National Convention this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We try to test all of our equpment, we put our negotiators to
work, we put our tactical teams to work ... so that we can iron out
any problems with equipment or communications before a crisis,''
said Linda Vizi, FBI spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The annual exercise is usually held in a remote central
Pennsylvania location such as Fort Indiantown Gap, but was moved to
Philadelphia because of the upcoming convention and other events.
</P>
<P>
   For the exercise, the negotiation and tactical posts were set up
in the weed-strewn parking lot of an old airplane hangar. The
''community'' around the center is only vacant naval housing with
fallen siding and empty carports.
</P>
<P>
   The command center in a Holiday Inn banquet room a short drive
away is more realistic, with computers, an aerial photo, and charts
showing a timeline of events and the people involved. Well, almost
realistic. ''We wouldn't have the crystal chandaliers,'' Vizi said.
</P>
<P>
   But on each green tablecloth was a computer linked up to allow
quick sharing of information among all center personnel, who
include a legal team to quickly process search warrants and press
personnel to brief news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been planning for the Republican National Convention for
a year and a half,'' said Robert S. Conforti, agent-in-charge of
the Philadelphia office. ''As we get closer the meetings intensify.
We've had people go to Washington, D.C., and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're planning for the worst-case scenario hoping that we get
the best one.''
</P>
<P>
   For the convention, strategy will be devised by a 16-member
executive committee made up of local and state police and federal
agencies such as the FBI, U.S. Secret Service, and the bureau of
Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, Conforti said.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia police, who will handle street protests, also sent
personnel to Washington. While they praised the handling of
demonstrations there during the meetings of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank, protest leaders have criticized the
use of pepper spray and police batons to disperse crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe the GOP Convention, already expected to
attract 45,000 people from July 31 to Aug. 3, may attract the same
kind of noisy protests seen during the recent world economic
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have people on the Internet saying they're coming, and
they're going to try to disrupt the Republican National Convention,
so if I had to guess, I would say we're going see some of what you
saw in Washington, D.C., and Seattle,'' Conforti said.

<HEADLINE> Paper Strike Ends in Finland  </HEADLINE>
By MATTI HUUHTANEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Union leaders accepted a new labor
agreement Wednesday, ending a weeklong strike by 30,000 workers
that shut down most of Finland's pulp and paper industry.
</P>
<P>
   Employers on Tuesday had already approved the mediation proposal
by government-appointed National Conciliator Juhani Salonius for a
three-year agreement that increases wages and gives workers one
extra day paid holiday a year.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement applies to 270,000 employees and gives a 4
percent wage hike to paper workers who annually earn an average
salary of 200,000 markkaa ($32,000), union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers who had been on strike since April 11, began to return
to their jobs in the afternoon and pulp and paper mills were
expected to reach full production within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   The pulp and paper industry has estimated that the strike cost
it some $160 million in lost export earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Stora Enso, the world's largest producer of paper and paper
board, said the strike had cost it $38 million in lost profit.
UPM-Kymmene, one of Europe's biggest forest products companies,
said its losses amounted to some $57 million.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies expected to reach full production capacity within
24 hours of paper and pulp mills starting up again.
</P>
<P>
   The central council of the Finnish Paper Workers Union accepted
the labor agreement after union chairman Jarmo Lahteenmaki on
Tuesday had recommended its approval.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers did not feel the strike as there were sufficient
stockpiles of newsprint and other paper. However, if it had
continued there were fears it would have affected the chemicals
industry due to a reduction in demand for chemicals used in paper
and pulp production. The transport sector also stood to suffer if
cargos of raw materials and paper stopped.

<HEADLINE> Vt. Senate OKs Gay Unions Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ROSS SNEYD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Bobbi Whitacre and Sandi Cote are already
making plans for a small ceremony sanctifying their 33-year
relationship. The women are just disappointed they won't be
considered ''married.''
</P>
<P>
   A bill that passed the Vermont Senate on Wednesday gets as close
to gay marriage as any place in America, but it still reserves
''marriage'' for opposite-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a bittersweet victory, I think, for a lot of us,'' Cote
said. ''To have to stop short of the goal, it's disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   On a 19-11 vote, the Senate passed a bill creating ''civil
unions,'' a legal structure parallel to marriage for gay and
lesbian couples.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark proposal would grant to same-sex couples some 300
state benefits of marriage, including medical decision-making, tax
breaks and inheritance. No other state has conferred more than just
a handful of the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great that it passed,'' said Beth Robinson, one of the
lawyers who successfully argued before the Vermont Supreme Court
that gay and lesbian couples were being unconstitutionally denied
the benefits of marriage. The court left the decision to the
Legislature how to provide those rights.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Condon, 44, an opponent of the bill, listened grim-faced to
the roll call of senators -- and said they were making a huge
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ''I truly, truly believe that the Supreme Court, the
legislators, and others, don't understand what they're doing,'' he
said. ''They don't understand the consequences of their vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 76-69 in March to provide civil unions. The
Senate largely agreed with the House's approach to the issue, but
changed some of the language in the bill and also moved up the
effective date by two months to July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Now the House will have to vote on whether to accept the
Senate's changes. House Speaker Michael Obuchowski said he did not
believe anyone would back off from his or her original vote. Gov.
Howard Dean has promised to sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has not been an easy journey,'' said Senate Judiciary
Committee Chairman Richard Sears, a Democrat. ''But for a few
months of my life, I've learned a lot about what it's like to be
discriminated against. I also began to understand the goodness of
my fellow Vermonters.''
</P>
<P>
   Because lawmakers decided to reserve the status of marriage only
to heterosexual couples, gays and lesbians would not be able to
qualify for federal benefits available to opposite-sex couples,
such as sharing Social Security benefits, immigration status and
some tax provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Whitacre, 52, and Cote, 53, of Manchester had almost decided
they would not enter into a civil union out of frustration that the
state wouldn't allow them to marry, but they decided to go ahead
with a ceremony anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have difficulty with separate but equal,'' Cote said. ''I
fought for civil rights down in Alabama in the '60s. And that's
what this state is letting happen, second-class citizens in the
year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though they know there's one more vote to come in the
House, people like Whitacre and Cote are beginning to plan their
futures. On Sept. 15 -- the anniversary of Whitacre's late
grandparents' 58-year marriage -- they'll hold their ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ''After 33 years, she's finally going to make me an honest
woman,'' Whitacre said.

<HEADLINE> Utah Man Charged With Rape, Bigamy  </HEADLINE>
By C.G. WALLACE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A polygamist who has defended his
lifestyle on national television, arguing that it is his God-given
right, has been charged with child rape, bigamy and failing to pay
child support.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Arthur Green, 51, who lives in Utah's West Desert with
five wives and an estimated 25 children, was charged Monday after
an investigation that Juab County Attorney David Leavitt said
lasted a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I only became aware of Mr. Green myself after he appeared on
national television,'' the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   Green's wives -- who include two sets of sisters -- have joined
him on television, including an appearance on NBC's ''Dateline.''
They portrayed themselves as one big happy family, with the women
saying they choose a life of polygamy over any other.
</P>
<P>
   But Leavitt says Green married some of his past or current wives
when they were just 14 and he was in his 30s or 40s.
</P>
<P>
   The child rape charge stems from an alleged relationship he had
with a 13-year-old girl, with whom he had a child, the prosecutor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Green's attorney, John Bucher, said Green has been expecting to
face charges for quite a while. But Bucher was alarmed by the child
rape charge and wondered why other polygamists were not targeted,
suggesting Green was singled out because of his family's public
profile.
</P>
<P>
   The child rape charge carries a maximum sentence of life in
prison. Bigamy and nonsupport could each bring maximum terms of
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Bucher said he advised his client not to speak with the media
for fear he might say too much.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very much too open. He's too eager to talk, and he's
gotten in trouble for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Green considers himself a fundamentalist Mormon practicing a
commandment given by God to church founder Joseph Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints officially
abandoned the practice of polygamy in 1890 as a condition of Utah
being recognized as a state.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Morrison, an attorney for Green's five ''spiritual'' wives
and one former wife, said none of the women will testify against
Green.
</P>
<P>
   ''They would rather go to prison than see their husband go to
prison,'' he said. ''I think it's a matter of destroying their
family through auspices of the state, and they won't cooperate in
the least.''
</P>
<P>
   Some former plural wives say the case is a major step toward
abolishing polygamy, which is thought to be practiced by some
30,000 people in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Berlin Wall of polygamy is tumbling down and the Tom Green
case is just the beginning,'' said Vicky Prunty, director of the
anti-polygamy group Tapestry of Polygamy.
</P>
<P>
   Green filed a defamation lawsuit against the group last year
after members criticized him on television. That lawsuit is making
its way though the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Green's television appearances have included a face-off on the
''Jerry Springer Show'' with Tapestry member Rowenna Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has always been so open about it. I think he was wanting to
be caught,'' Erickson said.

<HEADLINE> Long-Dead Boy ID'd As Louis XVII  </HEADLINE>
By CLAR NI CHONGHAILE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Scientists have cracked one of France's most
enduring mysteries, saying an ailing boy who died in a Paris prison
more than 200 years ago was the son of King Louis XVI and
Marie-Antoinette and heir to the French throne.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Louis XVI's 10-year-old son had long intrigued
France. Some historians declared the dead boy to be Louis XVII;
others said the royal heir escaped and another child died in his
place to save official face during the unstable days of the French
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But now science has come to the aid of history.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from two European universities compared DNA from the
long-preserved heart of the dead boy to DNA from hair cut from
Marie-Antoinette when she was a child in Austria. They also
compared the heart DNA to DNA from Marie Antoinette's sisters and
two living members of the Bourbon family.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Delorme, the French historian who organized the tests,
said they laid the riddle to rest at last.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was Louis XVII. It was the last little king of France who
died in the Temple prison,'' Delorme said. ''It's definitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The official version of the story has long gone like this: After
his parents were beheaded in 1793, Louis XVII was imprisoned in the
Temple, a fortified monastery in Paris, where he died of
tuberculosis at age 10 on June 8, 1795.
</P>
<P>
   But until now, that version was contradicted by rumor, legend
and simple royalist hope, strengthened by some fabulous tales from
that turbulent time. Some said the body in the Temple could not
have been Louis XVII as it seemed to belong to an older child.
Others claimed Louis XVII had been drugged with opium and a dead
boy substituted for the living one in the coffin.
</P>
<P>
   One guard at the time said he had seen many bathtubs being
carried out of the prison. When the porters carrying one stumbled,
he heard a child's cry from within, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Delorme said the scientific tests are indisputable.
</P>
<P>
   They were carried out by Jean-Jacques Cassiman, a professor of
genetics at Belgium's Louvain University, and Bernd Brinkmann of
Germany's Muenster University. Both scientists came to the same
conclusion, Delorme said.
</P>
<P>
   Cassiman and Brinkmann performed their tests on the preserved
heart, which took a circuitous route over almost 200 years before
ending up in a crystal vase in the royal crypt outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ''(It) was extremely well-preserved,'' Cassiman told France's
Europe-1 radio on Wednesday. ''One could see all the vessels and
all the compartments of the heart. But because it was mummified, we
had to saw off a small piece to be able to do this analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics will no doubt latch onto the heart's eventful history
to throw cold water on the recent research.
</P>
<P>
   The heart was stolen by the doctor who performed the autopsy on
the dead child in 1795. He pickled it in alcohol for eight to 10
years. One of his students subsequently stole it, but on his
deathbed, the student asked his wife to return it to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   After the restoration of the French monarchy in 1814, the heart
was offered to various members of the royal family, but they were
reluctant to accept a relic of such dubious provenance. It finally
found its way to the Spanish branch of the Bourbon family. They
returned it to Paris in 1975 and it was placed in the royal crypt.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will always be some people who think Louis XVII escaped.
But now we have indisputable scientific proof that confirms the
historic proof,'' said Delorme, author of ''The Affair of Louis
XVII.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bourbon family is already demanding a royal burial.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Louis de Bourbon, the head of the house of Bourbon, on
Wednesday said he hoped French authorities would consent to a
burial for Louis XVII's heart next to the tombs of his father and
mother in the royal crypt.
</P>
<P>
   For Delorme, the discovery is both a vindication of history and
a kind of belated justice.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me, it's a very important day, a very moving day for a
historian. It's an affair that has lasted two centuries. There have
been around 800 books written on the subject and we never managed
to find the response,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we are bestowing justice on this child. Until now, his
death was stolen, it was not admitted that he died in such a
horrible way.''

<HEADLINE> Court Examining Miranda Warning  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court seemed split Wednesday as it
considered whether police still must warn criminal suspects of
their ''right to remain silent'' when questioned or else risk
getting confessions excluded as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Two key justices, Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy,
wrestled with whether such warnings, required since the court's
landmark 1966 ruling in Miranda vs. Arizona, are constitutionally
mandated.
</P>
<P>
   Their votes appeared to be critical to the court's eventual
decision, expected in late June.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia
seemed willing to jettison the Miranda warnings. Justice Clarence
Thomas, who remained silent during the hour-long argument session,
often sides with them in criminal justice cases.
</P>
<P>
   But Justices Stephen G. Breyer, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and John Paul Stevens vigorously defended the 34-year-old
ruling and the warnings that Breyer said ''2 billion people
throughout the world probably know.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court last year threw the warnings' future
into doubt, ruling that Congress effectively overturned the Miranda
decision by enacting a long-ignored 1968 law known as Section 3501.
</P>
<P>
   Solicitor General Seth Waxman, the Clinton administration's
top-ranking courtroom lawyer, told the justices that Section 3501
must be struck down because ''the case has not been made to
overrule Miranda.''
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Cassell, a University of Utah law professor, argued
that police procedures need not necessarily change if the court
were to rule that Miranda's guidelines have been superseded.
''Congress has now stepped in ... (with) a more nuanced approach,''
he said. ''You don't have to satisfy every jot and jiggle in
Miranda.''
</P>
<P>
   But he came under repeated questioning from Ginsburg, who said
she viewed the Miranda ruling as an attempt to protect ''a discrete
right -- a procedural right if you will, but a constitutional
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Far more liberal in 1966 than it is today, the nation's highest
court sought to remedy ''inherently coercive'' police
interrogations by creating a bright-line rule. Courts previously
had used a ''totality-of-the-circumstances'' test to determine
whether a confession or incriminating statement had been given to
police voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Waxman said the Supreme Court's efforts to apply that standard
had been a ''profoundly unhappy experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1968 law was invoked by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals last year in the case of a Maryland man accused of robbing
banks in Maryland and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dickerson of Takoma Park, Md., made several
incriminating statements to FBI agents after being arrested and
charged with seven bank robberies. He says the agents did not give
him a proper Miranda warning.
</P>
<P>
   Neither he nor the federal prosecutors who had opposed his
appeal to the 4th Circuit court focused on the 1968 law. But
Cassell, representing the conservative Washington Legal Foundation
as a friend of the court, successfully resuscitated Section 3501
and persuaded the appeals court to rule against Dickerson, who then
appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   As Dickerson looked on, his lawyer, James Hundley of Fairfax,
Va., argued Wednesday that Congress unlawfully ''attempted to roll
the clock back'' and do away with the ''more clear-cut'' test
adopted in Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist quickly challenged Hundley, however, about how
clear-cut the Miranda ruling has proved, referring to the court's
some 50 Miranda-related decisions over the past three decades. ''To
say it is easily applied is just a myth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia drew a distinction between a police officer who ''used a
rubber hose'' to extract a confession and one who fails to remind a
suspect of his rights before questioning him. The first officer
clearly could be sued for violating someone's rights, Scalia said,
but ''I would be very surprised'' if the second officer could be.
</P>
<P>
   The case has drawn an enormous amount of attention, and people
seeking a place among the some 200 courtroom seats available to the
public began lining up outside the court building 7 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the friends-of-the-court arguing for the Miranda
decision's continued vitality were the American Civil Liberties
Union, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and House
Democratic Leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Among those urging the justices to uphold the appeals court's
ruling were 17 states: Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Delaware,
Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah and
Virginia.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Russians Regrouping in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Russia is building up troops in Chechnya's
south and launching operations to root out thousands of fighters in
the mountains, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The defense minister insisted the troops coming into the
mountains were being redeployed from elsewhere in Chechnya and that
no reinforcements were being sent in.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has maintained repeatedly that the Chechen rebels are on
the verge of defeat and that no more major military operations
would be needed. But liquidating the rebels in the mountains is a
difficult task because the Chechens are skilled guerrillas who use
the rugged terrain to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fierce fighting of the winter months has abated,
small groups of rebels still launch attacks and ambushes.
</P>
<P>
   The federal forces on Wednesday started a ''mopping-up''
operation in one of the roughest areas of the mountains, the Vedeno
Gorge, said Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin's top spokesman on
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The operation began with Russian artillery pounding suspected
rebel targets in four villages, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The military command also reported clashes near Tsentoroi in the
eastern mountains and Alkhazurovo in central Chechnya, and said
rebels ambushed a Russian post at Dyshne-Vedeno in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, a senior Interior Ministry official said special
forces units will be flown into the Nozhai-Yurt and Vedeno
districts, where up to 1,000 rebels are holed up, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Other commando units would be sent to Chechnya's eastern border
with the Russian republic of Dagestan, and to the Chechen capital
Grozny, where the Russian military says some 400 rebel fighters
still operate, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev insisted federal forces were just
regrouping for the war's changing demands.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no reinforcement. A planned regrouping is under
way,'' Sergeyev said in Moscow, Russian news agencies reported.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops seized about two-thirds of Chechnya in steady
advances across the northern flatlands after moving into the
republic in September. But the offensive has stalled in the
southern mountains, the last major area under rebel control.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev denied Russian news reports that as many as 3,000
paratroopers, motorized infantry troops and special police agents
poured into the Shatoi region in the southern mountains on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The region saw intense fighting this winter and scattered
clashes have continued in recent weeks. The reports on new troop
movements said the forces were being sent in to search for rebels
among civilian populations already under Russian control.
</P>
<P>
   While both sides appear to be using the recent relative lull in
fighting to regroup, Moscow also has indicated it is exploring
political solutions.
</P>
<P>
   A top commander, Gen. Viktor Kazanstev, told ITAR-Tass on
Wednesday that ''eliminating surviving small gangs does not depend
exclusively on the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Yastrzhembsky said Tuesday that Moscow is continuing to talk
with Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov through intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
   Russia sent ground troops into Chechnya after weeks of
airstrikes, following an invasion of neighboring Dagestan by
Chechnya-based rebels. The rebels are also blamed for the apartment
bombings in Russia in September that killed about 300 people.

<HEADLINE> N. Korea Accepts South's Proposal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korean and South Korean leaders
will meet this weekend to prepare for the first summit between
their leaders, officials from the south said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the north has accepted a South Korean
proposal for the preparation meeting. The meeting will set up a a
summit of their leaders in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang on
June 12-14 -- a dramatic breakthrough in a half-century of division.
The summit agreement was announced last week.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, South Korea proposed a working meeting with North
Korea in the border village of Panmunjom for Saturday, co-chaired
by vice Cabinet ministers and attended by five assistants from each
side. On Wednesday, North Korea sent a telephone message accepting
the proposal, Seoul's Unification Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korean acceptance of the border village as a meeting site
was surprising. It so far has shunned official contacts with South
Korea on the border, where it signed an armistice with U.S.-led
U.N. forces at the close of the Korean War in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreas were divided in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea hopes to use the summit to discuss economic
cooperation and other measures to ease tension, including the
reunion of millions of separated Korean family members. South
Korean officials believe North Korea was driven to agree to the
summit because of its severe food and energy shortages.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea warned Wednesday that the latest U.S. sanctions
imposed on it would hurt efforts to improve relations between the
Cold War enemies.
</P>
<P>
   As part of deals to normalize relations with North Korea, in
September the United States lifted some sanctions in force since
the 1950-53 Korean War. But last week, the United States imposed
new sanctions on North Korea and Iran for ''knowingly engaging in
the export of military technology.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials did not say where the North Korean technology was
exported to, but the hard-line communist government is believed to
have had dealings in such materials with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea denounced the move as a ''grave challenge'' to the
normalization process.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Workers Clash With Police  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE MELIA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Police fired rubber bullets and
tear gas Wednesday at protesters opposed to a labor reform bill,
wounding at least 30 people and prompting thousands to pour into
the streets in a show of support for demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   In the initial confrontation, involving about 500 people,
protesters blocked traffic and waved signs denouncing the proposed
legislation. Some smashed windows, burned tires, and prevented
firefighters from approaching.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested 49 people, Interior Minister Federico Storani
said. At least four policemen were injured as protesters threw
rocks and bottles, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Local news reports said 30 people were wounded and that 14 of
them -- including four hit by rubber bullets -- were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   The violence prompted demonstrations by thousands more labor
activists and their supporters. The later protests were mostly
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations came ahead of a Senate vote on the labor
bill, which was approved by the lower house of Congress in
February. President Fernando De la Rua says labor reform is a key
to revitalizing Argentina's economy. No date for the Senate vote
has been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The government says the legislation will spur job growth and
increase competition in the labor market. Opponents say it will
make it easier for companies to fire employees, lead to greater
unemployment and cause other problems for workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to lower our salaries,'' said one demonstrator,
Mario Casteno.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised news conference, Storani criticized what he
called the ''savage'' methods used by security forces to repel
demonstrators, and said a dozen police officers had been removed
from duty.
</P>
<P>
   ''They deserve the maximum punishment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Storani was quoted by news agency Noticias
Argentinas as saying protesters made a ''deliberate attempt'' to
block Congress and prevent lawmakers from working.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accused the interior minister of using the police as a
scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Excess force was used by the police, but it was the interior
minister who gave the order,'' charged Humberto Roggero, an
opposition Peronist lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The labor bill would decentralize collective bargaining, extend
the probation period of new hires, and lower employer-paid payroll
contributions for new workers, among other changes.
</P>
<P>
   Such changes are backed by the International Monetary Fund,
which considers labor market flexibility crucial for Argentina. De
la Rua's administration recently obtained a $7.4 billion standby
loan from the IMF.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Privacy Case Arguments Set  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Arguments are scheduled May 18 in the appeal
of a federal judge's finding that President Clinton violated
privacy law by releasing Kathleen Willey's letters.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, White House officials won't have to answer
questions in a civil lawsuit about their use of the letters to
undermine Willey's story of an unwanted sexual advance by the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on
Tuesday put on hold District Judge Royce Lamberth's order that
White House lawyers answer the disputed questions.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart called the stay ''a positive
development.'' ''We're confident in our position and we're
confident we will prevail in court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, conservative lawyer Larry Klayman said the
routine stay didn't reflect on the merits of the case. Klayman also
wrote the appeals court Wednesday requesting that one of three
judges assigned to the case, David S. Tatel, recuse himself because
he is a Clinton appointee. The judge did not immediately return a
call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth's March 29 ruling rejected the White House argument
that top lawyers' discussions about releasing the letters were
protected by attorney-client privilege. He also wrote that
releasing the Willey letters was a violation of the Privacy Act
because they had been placed in federal government files and so
must remain confidential.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department filed an emergency appeal, saying
Lamberth's ruling that the Privacy Act applied to the office of the
president was ''a clear error of law.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit by Reagan and Bush administration appointees stems
from the Clinton White House's gathering of their FBI background
files. Klayman's group, Judicial Watch, represents the former
officials and is exploring whether the White House routinely
gathered and released damaging information about opponents.

<HEADLINE> US GI's Remains Found in Germany  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE BOEHMER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The believed remains of a U.S. soldier
missing in World War II have been found in rural West Germany -- the
fourth time the remains of a GI have turned up in the area in three
years, the Army said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The remains were discovered in an area of fields and dense
forests near the Belgian border that saw heavy fighting between
American troops and Hitler's army in late 1944, Army officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Military identification tags found at the site were confirmed as
belonging to a soldier listed as missing since Dec. 13, 1944, from
the 311th Infantry Regiment, 78th Infantry Division of the U.S.
Army's 5th Corps, Army spokesman Sgt. Greg Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the unit was fighting in the Huertgen Forest, where
the Germans had set up a defensive line. Both sides suffered heavy
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth time since 1997 that remains of a U.S. soldier
were found in the area, said David Roath, head of the Army mortuary
at Landstuhl, Germany. The area is about 15 miles south of the city
of Aachen.
</P>
<P>
   German authorities were to turn over the remains in a ceremony
at Huertgen on Thursday. They will be sent to an Army
identification laboratory in Hawaii for final identification so
next of kin can be notified, Roath said. He said the name of the
soldier would be withheld until the process has been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Some 40,200 Americans are still listed as missing during World
War II in Europe and the Mediterranean.

NY City Opera Presents 1745 Comedy   
An AP Entertainment Review, 
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- If an opera company intends today to perform
Rameau's really silly 1745 dance comedy-opera ''Platee,'' it's
essential to have a clever, inventive choreographer like Mark
Morris with a strong sense of fun and camp.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, as director and choreographer, and the Mark Morris Dance
Group -- and some of Rameau's best music -- made ''Platee'' a
splendid entertainment by the New York City Opera on Tuesday night.
The production marks the opera's first staging in this city.
</P>
<P>
   The second half seemed long, but laughter kept erupting as the
dancers pranced and cavorted. During the orchestral interludes
between scenes, the dancers capered about as two swamp frogs, three
clumsy graces, four men in bikinis and four women with strippers'
fans. Not everything came from Morris' imagination; two men in
diapers and two wise old men danced to a section in the score
called ''The Dance of the Babies and the Scholars.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenor Jean-Paul Fouchecourt was exceptional as Platee. In 1745,
it was unusual for a female opera part to be written for a man. But
Platee is an ugly, vain marsh nymph who is used for a joke by the
gods. Rameau probably had a man sing her to lessen audience
sympathy for his title character. Fouchecourt was covered in a
green skin with big hands, long fingers, flippers for feet and a
fat orange front.
</P>
<P>
   The prologue is set in a modern bar where an idea is proposed
for the god Jupiter to cure his wife Juno's jealousy. He'll court
Platee, and then Juno will discover how ugly Platee is and realize
it was a mock courtship and Jupiter and Juno will reconcile. It
works.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Burton sang Folly. Dressed as a 1920s blond movie vamp, she
sang Rameau's parodies of Italian coloratura arias. Her voice
soared sweetly in what are coloratura arias, whether they're meant
as parody or not.
</P>
<P>
   Other notable voices were tenor Matthew Chellis, as Mercury,
messenger of the gods, who usually arrived and departed in a basket
from above, and bass-baritone Bernard Deletre as both Momus, god of
ridicule, and Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Beckwith conducted, and the singing chorus was in the New
York State Theater pit with the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ''Platee'' was performed for the first time in 1745 during
wedding festivities in Versailles, France, for King Louis XV's son
Prince Louis. Four years later it was performed by the Paris Opera.
But after 1773 it went out of style.
</P>
<P>
   A revival of the opera began in 1901 in Munich and 1917 in Monte
Carlo. Now, with a boom in Baroque opera revivals, this production
has been seen in London and has been traveling. The New York City
Opera is presenting six performances, the last one on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Networks Face Columbine Family Pleas  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Television networks are wrestling with how to
mark Thursday's first anniversary of the Columbine school massacre
while responding to pleas from some families of victims to show
restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, CBS and NBC are all expected to devote much of their
morning news shows to Columbine High School, where two teen gunmen
killed 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves on April
20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Students and school officials in Littleton, Colo., have asked
that cameras and all outsiders be kept away from Columbine, where a
private memorial service will be held. Public remembrances are
planned for the adjacent Clement Park and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents of shooting victims have also asked the news media
to refrain from showing pictures of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're sitting in your living room and watching
television, and I know this from personal experience, and you see
flashes of Columbine, and for me, people running past my lifeless
son lying on the sidewalk, it can be very traumatizing,'' said Sue
Petrone, whose son, Daniel Rohrbaugh, died that day.
</P>
<P>
   CNN and ABC's ''Good Morning America'' will have reporters in
Littleton, but both decided not to send anchors.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot of sensitivity and a lot of care and concern
for these families from this show,'' said Shelley Ross, executive
producer of ''Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials in Littleton persuaded a homeowner near
Columbine not to allow ''Good Morning America'' to set up a camera
on his property. Ross said she didn't know about the request.
</P>
<P>
   Some family members affected by the tragedy have simply decided
to leave town rather than mark the anniversary, ABC's Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Today'' show debated whether to go and decided to send
anchor Katie Couric, said Jeff Zucker, executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We decided that we could be both respectful of the day and the
people and still be there,'' Zucker said.
</P>
<P>
   CBS won't speak to anyone who doesn't want to be on camera, but
it can't ignore the story, said Marcy McGinnis, the network's vice
president of news coverage. Jane Clayson of ''The Early Show'' will
be in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   Networks were also internally debating how much file footage of
the massacre to show. Fox News Channel, for example, will show
terrified children fleeing the school but won't air footage that
contains dead bodies lying on the ground, said Alicia Acuna, a
correspondent based in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   CNN is ''not trying to wallow in what happened a year ago'' and
decided against a prime-time special on the anniversary, said Sid
Bedingfield, executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   But it is airing an interview with shooting survivor Patrick
Ireland which will include the wrenching footage of his bloody
escape through a school window.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy's Uncle Gains Fame  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The stern, chain-smoking great-uncle at the center
of the Elian Gonzalez controversy seldom speaks in public. He
mostly stays in his back yard, away from the chanting protesters
and media camped outside his house.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, a slow, satisfied smile spread across the face of
Lazaro Gonzalez as he approached cheering supporters standing
behind metal barricades on his street.
</P>
<P>
   After ignoring a deadline to make his 6-year-old relative
available to federal authorities, Gonzalez walked a few paces
toward the crowd and held up his arms, for all the world like
Sylvester Stallone in ''Rocky.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Lazaro! Lazaro! The people are with you!'' He smiled as the
screams washed over him, hands outstretched to touch him.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a 49-year-old immigrant who speaks little English
and was unemployed when the custody battle began last fall. Since
then, Gonzalez has a new job, a spokesman, lawyers and informal
security at the modest, one-story home with a $600 monthly rent.
</P>
<P>
   He won a victory Wednesday when a federal appeals court extended
an order keeping Elian in the country and pointedly saying that
Lazaro's interests, ''to say the least, are not obviously hostile''
to the interests of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   While Elian is the cause celebre, it is his barrel-chested
great-uncle who has emerged as the opponent of Attorney General
Janet Reno. Though Cuban-American leaders are constantly at his
side with support, legal advice and, some suspect, financial aid,
it is Gonzalez who has single-handedly stared down the government.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he is now treated with almost religious respect by the
hundreds of protesters who gather daily.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a boy with severe facial birth defects turned up at
the barricade in his mother's arms. Gonzalez left his house with a
swagger as he walked straight toward her.
</P>
<P>
   As women and children in the crowd wept, Gonzalez lifted the
child up and gave him a big hug. Gonzalez, silent, returned the
child and turned back to his house. The crowd cheered, chanting
''Viva Lazaro, Viva Lazaro!''
</P>
<P>
   Before Elian arrived in Miami, Gonzalez was well-known in the
neighborhood, but he lived an anonymous life among the county's
800,000 residents with Cuban roots.
</P>
<P>
   He was born June 20, 1950, in the coastal town of Cardenas,
about two hours from Havana. Fidel Castro took power nine years
later, and the government threw his older brother Delfin in prison
in 1962 after accusing him of being a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez married his wife, Angela, in 1971, and the couple had
two children, 21-year-old Marisleysis -- surrogate mother to Elian --
and William, 27 and married.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez arrived in the United States in 1983 or 1984, and made
a living repairing boats and cars.
</P>
<P>
   He did not appear to have been politically involved in the Cuban
exile community before November, when Elian was rescued from the
sea after his mother drowned in a bid to leave Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not as far as I know,'' said Lombardo Perez Sr., a board
member of the Cuban American National Foundation. Perez said he
gave Lazaro a job at his car dealership after hearing about the
custody battle and estimated Lazaro could earn $45,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Though Lazaro hasn't worked since the family holed up at home,
Perez said he still gives him some money.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro seems bewildered by the government's demands. Like many
protesters, he refers to a conspiracy-filled world manipulated by
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ''Definitely, a deal has been done, but we don't know who got
paid for it,'' Lazaro said after Reno demanded he hand over the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a person who speaks his mind,'' Perez said. ''He doesn't
have a lot of higher education.''
</P>
<P>
   Family spokesman Armando Gutierrez said Lazaro decides the
family's legal and media strategies, in consultation with Delfin, a
62-year-old fisherman, and Marisleysis.
</P>
<P>
   ''They meet together and make the final decision on
everything,'' said Gutierrez, who -- like the lawyers -- says he is
not being paid for his work.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the attention, Lazaro always appears calm. He smokes
Marlboros almost constantly and drinks an occasional beer.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is under a lot of pressure,'' Perez said. ''His only focus
in life now is this custody battle.''

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Squatters Vow Violence End  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- After a week of heightened violence on
white-owned farms across Zimbabwe, a leader of squatters occupying
the farms pledged Wednesday to end hostilities -- but not to leave
the land.
</P>
<P>
   Squatters would remain in place while their leaders peaceably
work toward a negotiated end to the 2-month-old occupations, said
Chenjerai Hunzvi, the militant leader of a group of veterans of
Zimbabwe's independence war who initially led the farm invasions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have agreed hostilities should cease and we should work
toward a solution,'' Hunzvi said.
</P>
<P>
   The occupations began in February, days after the defeat of a
proposed constitution that would have allowed the government to
seize white-owned farms without paying compensation. However, it
was unclear whether the war veterans still controlled the
squatters, who have become increasingly violent in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   President Robert Mugabe mediated talks Wednesday between Hunzvi
and leaders of the Commercial Farmers Union, which represents most
of the country's 4,000 white farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent talks would deal with that issue of squatters
withdrawing from the farms, Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
   Farm leaders were optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe in the interest of national unity we will get to a
result,'' said Tim Henwood, head of the farmers' union. ''We will
meet again. We are both determined to reach a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The occupations have become increasingly violent in the past
week, with two white farmers and two black members of the
opposition Movement for Democratic Change killed. At least six
white farmers were badly beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing a further escalation in violence, farm union officials
advised white farmers to evacuate their families from the western
province of Matabeleland, where farmer Martin Olds was killed
Tuesday, and the neighboring province of Midlands, David Hasluck,
director of the union, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty more families remained evacuated from the nearby Macheke
area.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Mugabe said those farmers should be able to
return in peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the war vets can pledge not to interfere with them, I don't
see any reason why they should not go back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe said he considered it unnecessary to deploy extra police
to the area because the squatters had promised to refrain from
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has called the occupations a legitimate protest against
the ownership of one-third of the country's productive farmland by
the white farmers. He also said that Britain, the former colonial
ruler, reneged on an agreement to help pay for land reform in
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, which pledged millions of dollars for land reform at
independence, delivered nearly 90 percent of that money before
freezing the fund in 1990 when it said Zimbabwe violated the
agreement by forcing unwilling farmers to sell to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Hunzvi was found in contempt for disobeying a
High Court order to tell his followers to leave the farms.
</P>
<P>
   Judge David Bartlett ordered Hunzvi to ''actively strive to
assist in the peaceful vacation by veterans of occupied farms.''
Hunzvi, whose group claims to have led the occupations to complete
the ''unfinished business'' of the independence war, was to return
to court May 5 for sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   In London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the killings
of the farmers were barbaric but signaled that Britain feared tough
action against Mugabe could backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a difficult balance to strike,'' Blair said. ''It is
best we are guided by those with most to lose, not those who are
commenting from a safe distance.''
</P>
<P>
   In meetings with British officials last week, opposition leader
Morgan Tsvangirai said that punishing Mugabe by, for example,
seeking to get Zimbabwe suspended from the Commonwealth could help
Zimbabwe's leader portray himself as a martyr.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the
United States deplores ''the violence and the climate of
lawlessness'' that led to the four deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the Zimbabwe leadership needs to accept
responsibility to uphold the law and implement the court orders.
That's a view that we have communicated to them. We expect that
they will do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, two white women were raped on a farm south of
Harare, police said Wednesday. Police had no information whether
the rapes were politically motivated, but the husband of one of the
women raped said the attackers demanded to know his family's
political affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview on Tuesday, Zimbabwe's 20th
anniversary of independence from white rule, Mugabe called white
farmers enemies of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Tsvangirai said Mugabe was trying to stoke racial
tension to help his party ahead of upcoming parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no rational conclusion to such a statement,'' he said
Wednesday. ''He is just trying to play the race card and so
continue the racial divide.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsvangirai also called on African leaders to condemn
government-orchestrated violence against his supporters.

<HEADLINE> Boy Back at School After Shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- A 6-year-old boy accused in the February
shooting death of a Buell Elementary School classmate is back on
campus at a private school.
</P>
<P>
   State officials placed the boy in the unspecified school and
covered the expenses, said Sam Riddle, a spokesman for Tamarla
Owens, the boy's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney J. Dallas Winegarden, who represents the parents of
victim Kayla Rolland, said the move angered the family.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're shocked, appalled and outraged that they would put him
back in any school, and we're concerned about the safety of other
children who would be around this 6-year-old boy,'' Winegarden
said.
</P>
<P>
   Owens' two other children, a third-grade boy and a girl in
kindergarten, also have transferred to private schools at state
expense, Riddle said. All three Owens children have lived with the
woman's sister since the Feb. 29 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're all glad to be back in school,'' Owens said. ''One
wants to be a doctor so he can take care of me, and (the
6-year-old) wants to be a lawyer to get his father out of jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Thompson of the Family Independence Agency, which placed
the children in the private schools, said she could not comment on
the specifics of the case.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T settles complaint over switching unknowing customers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. on Wednesday said it will
pay for a consumer education campaign in Connecticut to settle a
3-year-old dispute over the practice of switching long-distance
service without the customer's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The original investigation centered on complaints from three
phone customers, although state regulators reported hearing from
dozens of consumers who said they were slammed.
</P>
<P>
   The phone company has agreed to produce 1,000 brochures against
''phone slamming'' to be distributed by the state Department of
Utility Control and the Office of Consumer Counsel. AT&AMP;T also will
pay up to $10,000 to produce a public service radio announcement --
in English and Spanish -- to educate consumers on slamming.
</P>
<P>
   ''AT&AMP;T has no tolerance for slamming and none was found in
connection with the three cases brought before the DPUC in 1997,''
said AT&AMP;T spokesman Gary Morgenstern. ''However, recognizing that
educating the public on how to protect themselves against slamming
is in everyone's best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   It is essentially the same agreement the company offered in
1998, but was opposed by state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal.
He argued the agreement does nothing to deter future unlawful
conduct by AT&AMP;T and recommended any settlement signed by the DPUC
include a commitment from AT&AMP;T not to engage in specific unlawful
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   But the DPUC said Wednesday that AT&AMP;T has demonstrated a
''willingness and ability'' to curb slamming complaints and has
improved its response to those complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, AT&AMP;T representatives will begin meeting
with state regulators at least once a month for three months to
discuss the how the company handles complaints. After the first
three months, a new meeting schedule will be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   The DPUC began investigating the New York-based AT&AMP;T in 1997
after fielding complaints from more than 150 consumers who said
they were victims of phone slamming.
</P>
<P>
   Utility officials said slamming complaints involving AT&AMP;T
increased by more than 300 percent in 1997 over the year before.
The number of slamming complaints against AT&AMP;T also was much higher
than other phone service providers in the state, according to the
DPUC.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Phone
messages were left at his office.

<HEADLINE> DNA Tests Underway in Wash. Killing  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN K. WILEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- In a medical lab in western Washington,
DNA tests were under way that police say could connect a National
Guardsman to the slaying of a prostitute -- and possibly as many as
17 others.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives have linked the murders of at least 10 prostitutes in
Spokane and Tacoma in 1997 and 1998 to a single killer and say
eight others are possible victims.
</P>
<P>
   They would not release the name of the victim in the case that
led to Robert L. Yates Jr.'s arrest Tuesday, but the victim is
believed to be one of the 18.
</P>
<P>
   Yates, 47, was to make an initial court appearance Wednesday on
the single count of first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives spent Wednesday searching for clues behind a fence of
blue tarpaulins surrounding Yates' two-story home.
</P>
<P>
   Yates, a National Guard helicopter pilot, worked at a Kaiser
Aluminum Corp. smelter and has lived in the house with his wife and
five children since March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A sample of Yates' blood was obtained with a search warrant,
Spokane County sheriff's Cpl. Dave Reagan said. The results will be
compared with DNA taken from sites where the bodies were found.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're focusing on the one homicide at this point because
that's what the evidence suggests,'' Reagan said. ''If we find
evidence that supports his involvement in other case, then that's a
bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   The DNA test results were expected by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Police seized seven vehicles, including a white 1976 Corvette
and two vans formerly owned by Yates. Evidence found in the
Corvette, which was seized last week, ''heightened our interest''
in Yates, Reagan said, but he refused to say what was found.
</P>
<P>
   No attorney had been appointed for Yates on Wednesday, and his
family had been moved to an undisclosed motel and could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives began 24-hour surveillance of Yates after he returned
to Spokane on Sunday from a two-week Army National Guard summer
camp at Fort Lewis. Officials would not say when or why he became a
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Records show Yates left the Army in 1996 after an 18-year
career. He joined the National Guard as a pilot with the 66th
Aviation Brigade, which trains once a month at the base near
Tacoma, spokesman Lt. Col. Rick Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   While in the Army, Yates was stationed at Fort Drum, N.Y., and
Fort Rucker, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   People who lived near the house Yates rented in 1996 and 1997
before moving to his present home said he frequently tinkered with
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ''He washed his cars incessantly,'' said former neighbor Judy
Kauffman. ''He was always out in the front driveway, changing the
oil'' of the Corvette. She described him as cordial, but said other
members of his family kept to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a neighborhood where if you reach out, people will pull
you in, and they didn't really reach out,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Edwards Defense Calls Case 'Gossip'  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIE GOTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Prosecutors built their racketeering
case against former Gov. Edwin Edwards on half-truths and lies, his
attorney said in closing arguments Tuesday in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not in this country convict someone on gossip,'' defense
attorney Dan Small said in his closing argument.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said Edwards tried to extort millions of
dollars from applicants for Louisiana riverboat casino licenses
during and after his fourth and final term, which ended in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards faces 27 counts that could net him life in prison if
convicted. Edwards is 72.
</P>
<P>
   Small wrapped up his argument in two hours but it will be next
week before the jury begins deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Five of Edwards' co-defendants spent the rest of the day making
their case and a lawyer for Edwards' son and co-defendant Stephen
Edwards will have two hours on Thursday. Prosecutors then will have
two hours of rebuttal arguments and court will recess for the
three-day Easter weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Small said several witnesses in the case told only half the
story or even changed their stories when they did not fit with what
the prosecution wanted.
</P>
<P>
   One such witness, Small said, was former San Francisco 49ers
owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo testified that Edwards threatened to cause problems
for his casino license application in 1997 if he did not pay
Edwards $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   However, Small noted, on the government's own undercover
recordings, Edwards is heard expressing nothing but support for
DeBartolo's project.

   DeBartolo testified under an agreement with federal prosecutors,
pleading guilty to failure to report the alleged extortion. He drew
no prison time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eddie DeBartolo made a sweet business deal. That's what
happened,'' Small said, pointing to the prosecution table. ''He
took them for a ride.''
</P>

   In 40 years of public life Edwards built a reputation as a
quick-witted wheeler-dealer, an unabashed gambler and ladies man
and a populist champion of the underprivileged.
</P>
<P>
   But he also was often tied to scandal and has, by his own count,
been the subject of close to two dozen state and federal
investigations.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Okla. Memorial Is 'Sacred'  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- President Clinton, marking the fifth
anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, promised today that
''America will never forget'' the pain and suffering inflicted by
the deadliest terrorist attack in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are places in our national landscape so scarred by
freedom's sacrifice that they shape forever the soul of America,''
the president said. ''This place is such sacred ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his remarks in a speech prepared for delivery at
the dedication of the Oklahoma City National Memorial on the site
of the explosion that ripped open the nine-story Alfred P. Murrah
Federal Building on April 19, 1995 -- exactly five years ago. An
advance text was released by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   On a grassy slope where the building once stood, 168 bronze and
stone chairs represent the 168 Oklahomans who died. Nineteen of the
victims were children, and their chairs are smaller than the
others. At night, all the chairs are to be lighted, casting a
gentle glow over the site.
</P>
<P>
   The president was to officially open the memorial by untying
symbolic colored ribbons: white for innocence, purple for courage,
yellow for hope and blue for statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that today also was the 225 anniversary of the
beginning of the American Revolution. ''The brave Americans we lost
here 220 years later, though they were not fighting a war, were
also patriots in service to their fellow citizens or children whose
promise keeps our old democracy forever young,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Five years ago, the cowards who killed them made a choice,''
Clinton said. ''They chose to attack this building and the people
in it, because they wanted to strike a blow in America's heartland
-- at the core of our nation's being. This was an attack on all
America and every American.
</P>
<P>
   ''Five years later, we are here because you made a choice,'' the
president said. ''You chose hope and love over despair and hatred.
It was a wise but hard choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know there are still days when anger wells up inside you,
when tears fill your eyes, when you feel your heart will break,''
Clinton said. ''On those days, I hope you can find solace here in
the memory of your loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped the memorial would ''forever serve as a
powerful reminder to all Americans of our common humanity, and our
profound duty to protect life, liberty and the rule of law
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorial is anchored on opposite sides by separate
four-story gates, emblazoned ''9:01'' and ''9:03'' for the moments
immediately before and after the 9:02 a.m. bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were convicted in federal
court in the attack. McVeigh has been sentenced to death; Nichols
has been sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will never have all the answers for what happened here,''
the president said. ''But as we continue our journey toward
understanding, these truths ring clear: what was meant to divide us
has brought us together. What was meant to break us has made us
stronger.''

<HEADLINE> Study Examines Whiplash Recovery  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   No gain, no pain? People hurt in traffic accidents actually
recover better when they can't collect money for their pain and
suffering, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian researchers say policy makers should consider
no-fault insurance as a prescription for treating whiplash.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which analyzed whiplash claims when the province of
Saskatchewan switched to a no-fault system, supplies a strong
medical argument for such a system, the researchers said in their
report, published in Thursday's issue of The New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 13 U.S. states have adopted no-fault auto insurance
laws, which generally let policy holders recover benefits
regardless of fault and restrict the right to sue. Massachusetts
was the first to adopt such a system in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Deyo, who does cost-benefit analyses at the
University of Washington, wrote in a journal editorial that there
may be several reasons that people report fewer symptoms under no
fault. He said some people fraudulently exaggerate whiplash when
they can win pain and suffering awards.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, under no-fault, some may feel -- consciously or not --
that it's not worth fussing about pain with no financial return,
and they suffer in silence.
</P>
<P>
   But Deyo said many also seem to feel better. ''It seems
axiomatic that if you have to prove you are ill, you can't get
well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Alberta researchers studied 7,462 whiplash
claims for six months before and one year after Saskatchewan
dropped its pain and suffering awards. Under no fault, people could
instead collect more money for medical costs and lost work.
</P>
<P>
   The frequency of claims under no fault slipped 28 percent within
six months and the average time to settle claims plunged 54
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers asked people with claims to fill out follow-up
health questionnaires, and learned that as people settled claims
they reported less neck pain, better functioning, and fewer other
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ''When benefits are tied to the amount of pain you have, then
you tend to focus more on your pain -- and you feel more pain,''
said J. David Cassidy, an epidemiologist who was lead author of the
study. He said no-fault takes away that financial incentive to
delay recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the U.S. insurance industry said the study builds
on other research with similar findings.
</P>
<P>
   Loretta Worters, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information
Institute, said a 4.5 percent drop in U.S. auto premiums last year
is credited partly to no-fault insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Since tension can aggravate neck pain, some people may actually
feel better with a quicker and easier claims process that is
''eliminating some of the stress of not knowing if the claim is
settled,'' she suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stresses of litigation can be pretty significant,'' added
David Snyder, a lawyer for the American Insurance Association.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kinzler, president of the Coalition of Auto-Insurance
Reform, in Alexandria, Va., said fault systems also inflate both
outright fraud or conscious exaggeration of medical claims.
</P>
<P>
   ''For small claims, everybody has the incentive to overutilize
the system: doctors, lawyers, claimants,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Father Awaits Son's Fate  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like his 6-year-old son Elian, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez has a boyish, mischievous side. But when he's angry and
hurt, he displays indignation like the kind that emerged when he
watched his son wag a finger at a television camera and exclaim:
''I do not want to go to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, an overnight hero in his communist homeland who has
won the sympathies of Americans wanting to see him reunited with
his son, was visibly disturbed. He got up, fought back tears and
went off by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''I watched the video of Elian with him,'' said the Rev. Joan
Brown Campbell, who has spent time with the Gonzalez family, both
in America and Cuba. ''It was a terrible moment. His eyes teared up
and he just said: 'That's not my boy. That's not my son.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, 31, a cashier at a Cuban beach resort, came to America
two weeks ago to retrieve Elian. The lad was found clinging to an
inner tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25 after a boat sank and
killed his mother and 10 others.
</P>
<P>
   For four decades and through the terms of nine U.S. presidents,
Americans' view of Cuba focused on Fidel Castro, the revolutionary
who took over the island nation in 1959. Now, they're seeing a
young father who is loyal to Castro yet has created an outpouring
of compassion from Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In America, he goes to church and gets a standing ovation.
Reporters are staked out in front of the Bethesda, Md., home of
Cuban diplomat Fernando Remirez, where Gonzalez is staying with his
wife, Nersy, and their baby boy.
</P>
<P>
   In his hometown of Cardenas, about two hours east of Havana,
Gonzalez lives in a working-class neighborhood in a small stucco
house that Campbell calls ''sparkly clean.''
</P>
<P>
   In America, he waits. He eats dinners of salad, rice, beans and
pork cooked Cuban-style and watches television to catch news clips
of Elian and updates about the custody struggle.
</P>
<P>
   He shows visitors a home video of Elian's fifth birthday party
in Cuba that features a clown and children watching the boy blow
out candles on his cake.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a loving father,'' says Albert Fox, president of the
Alliance for Responsible Cuba Policy, a group opposed to the U.S.
trade embargo against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   When Gonzalez emerges, he wears spiffy, donated duds to meet
with lawyers, members of Congress and Cuban diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled that Elian
should be returned to his father. The boy's relatives in Miami want
him to stay in America. They have challenged the INS decision in
federal court and have accused Gonzalez of being an unfit father.
</P>
<P>
   In this story of boy, father and dictator, fact and fiction
clash.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Orlando Rodriguez, a Miami man who knew Gonzalez
and his late ex-wife Elisabeth back in Cuba, signed an affidavit
that said Gonzalez is abusive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know of my own personal knowledge that Juan ... emotionally
and physically mistreated Elisabeth, hitting her to the point that
she went to the hospital for treatment for injuries,'' Rodriguez
said. ''Juan Miguel is of a violent nature, impulsive nature and
out of control -- all of which traits I saw him inflict on his own
son, Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez emphatically denied these charges. In an interview with
CBS's ''60 Minutes,'' he said it's his Miami relatives who are
abusing the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is child abuse and mistreatment, what they're doing do
this boy,'' he said, referring to the videotape of Elian. ''It is
something that has been induced because these aren't the boy's true
feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, Gregory Craig, says Gonzalez and Elian's mother
were friends since their teens and continued their relationship
after their divorce. A State Department official said Elian was
conceived after the breakup, following several miscarriages.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who was general secretary of the National Council of
Churches when the Cuban Council of Churches asked for its help in
December, said she doesn't understand the allegations of abuse. She
said Gonzalez was very angry when he learned his telephone
conversation with Elian was recorded.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has a temper, but I don't want to feed into an image of
someone out of control,'' she said. ''It's very appropriate to be
angry and to say angry words when you find out that what you
thought was a private conversation with your son was taped.''
</P>
<P>
   He's very attentive to his 6-month-old son, she said. ''The baby
is extremely comfortable with him, he doesn't keep wanting to go to
his mother even though she's nursing him. When he carries the baby
around the house, he's always smooching him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Frank Calzon, director of the Center for a Free Cuba,
contends that Americans who argue about the father's parental
rights don't understand that parents in Cuba don't have the right
to make decisions for their children.
</P>
<P>
   If Elian is sent back to Cuba with his father, he will become
part of a young communists organization. ''In a very famous speech
about 10 years ago, on national TV, Castro said to the Cubans:
'Fidel is the daddy of all Cubans.'''

   Dow Ends Down 92; Nasdaq Off 87
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell today as investors took some profits
from a powerful two-day run and sold shares that failed to live up
to high expectations for corporate earnings. Mild volume and modest
losses for major market indicators made for one of the calmest
sessions of the year, in sharp contrast to the violent market
swings of recent weeks. the Dow Jones industrial average fell 92.46
to close at 10,674.96, having given up a solid midday gain. The
Nasdaq composite index fell 87.06 to close at 3,706.51. Broader
stock barometers also closed lower. The market's decline reminded
investors that last week's devastating selloff has left the market
vulnerable. Some mixed reports on corporate earnings and a sense
that the rally on Monday and yesterday may have been overdone
sparked selling today, analysts said.

   Feb. Trade Deficit Hit Record $29B
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A surging foreign oil bill along with
Americans' appetite for foreign computers and telecommunications
equipment helped push the U.S. trade deficit to a monthly record of
$29.2 billion in February. The bigger-than-expected deficit was up
6.5 percent from a January shortfall of $27.4 billion, the Commerce
Department said. Imports jumped 1.5 percent in February to a record
$113.4 billion. U.S. exports fell 0.2 percent to $84.2 billion.
Sales of food fell, as did sales of cars and capital goods,
including airplanes and industrial machines. But economists said
the trade report isn't as bad as it appears. ''When you adjust for
oil prices, the deficit narrowed,'' said Northern Trust Co.'s chief
economist, Paul Kasriel.

   Toymaker Mattel Narrows Losses
</P>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Troubled toymaker Mattel Inc. narrowed
its losses in the first quarter, benefiting from a jump in Barbie
sales and strength in its Fisher-Price business. But Wall Street
still wasn't satisfied with the financial results reported today,
and analysts said that more work was needed to revive the world's
biggest manufacturer of toys. Mattel reported a loss of $6.2
million, or 1 cent a share, from continuing operations for the
quarter, compared with $12.6 million, or 3 cents per share, in the
same period a year ago. Analysts had forecast a 3-cent loss per
share. Nattel stock was down 1/16 at 11 11/16 today.

   SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co.'s profits fell 11 percent in the first
quarter of 2000, the company said today, blaming a 40-day strike by
engineers and technical workers for fewer aircraft deliveries and
lower revenues. Boeing made $418 million, 48 cents per share, on
revenues of $9.91 billion. In the same period last year, Boeing
made $469 million, or 50 cents per share, on sales of $14.39

toothpaste, Irish Spring soap, Mennen deodorant and Ajax cleanser
earned $239.9 million, or 38 cents a share, in the three months
ended March 31, up from $208.9 million, or 32 cents a share, a year
earlier. That was a penny a share better than analysts expected.
Colgate stock was up 7/16 at 55 11/16.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Chase Manhattan Corp. said today that profits

bank posted higher investment banking fees and gains in its
venture-capital portfolio. Chase earned $1.36 billion, or $1.59 a
share, topping Wall Street's estimate by 4 cents, according to a
survey by First Call/Thomson Financial. Chase Manhattan stock was

   Fuel Costs Hit Airlines Earnings
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Higher fuel costs dragged down earnings at major
air carriers in the first quarter, but UAL Corp. reported a 2
percent increase in operating profits on a 10 percent jump in
passenger revenue. Excluding one-time charges and certain
compensation expenses, the world's largest airline earned $191
million, or $1.61 per share, up from $187 million, or $1.54 per
share, in the year-earlier period. Trans World Airlines had a wider
first-quarter net loss: $76.1 million or $1.16 a share. But
passenger revenue, which accounts for the vast majority of the
company's revenue, rose to $723.6 million from $681.1 million.
America West reported a 44 percent drop in first-quarter earnings
due to higher fuel prices and operating problems early in the year.
Earnings were $14.6 million, or 40 cents.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Woman Describes Rapes  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- The Muslim woman's ordeal began on
her 19th birthday when Serb soldiers overran her village and an
invader gave her to a soldier, who raped her, paraded her around
town as a sex conquest and eventually sold her for $250 and a truck
of laundry soap.
</P>
<P>
   ''They destroyed everything in me,'' the victim, identified as
A.S., testified Wednesday from behind a screen to a U.N. tribunal
on how her descent into terror began April 7, 1992, when the Serbs
took the Bosnian town of Foca.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Serb paramilitary Radomir Kovac, one of the
defendants, imprisoned her at an apartment in town and forced her
to serve as a sex slave for his roommate, a soldier, Jagos Kostic.
</P>
<P>
   Kostic, she said, forced her to have sexual intercourse in the
children's room of the apartment and paraded her around town as his
sexual conquest.
</P>
<P>
   ''He took me out and put a knife against my neck and beat me
with his fists and legs. With his knife he threatened to slit my
throat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked asked how often she was raped by Kostic, she said:
''Whenever he wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   At another apartment, she said she was raped ''perhaps 50, 60
times. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Serbs were finished with her, she said, they sold A.S.
and another girl as chattel to a pair of Montenegrins for ''500
German marks ($250) and a truck full of washing powder.'
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who wept during the testimony, said the two were
raped and forced to work as barmaids in cafes for a while, and then
put on a passenger bus headed for a Muslim area of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal lasted a year, she said, and in the years since, the
witness has suffered back and kidney problems, serious infections,
and underwent surgery for polyps.
</P>
<P>
   The American prosecuting attorney, Peggy Kuo, asked her to
describe the emotional pain she still feels.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's difficult,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are you able to try?'' Kuo gently asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have pills, sedatives, and I also take pills for rheumatism
and for everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Do those pills affect ability to recall the events that
happened to you?'' Kuo asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''No,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The witness was the fifth rape victim to testify in the Foca
rape trial, the first international prosecution of the sexual
enslavement of women in wartime.
</P>
<P>
   It has produced horrifying tales of women and girls, some as
young as 12, assaulted in rape camps and soldiers apartments in the
early part of the 1992-95 Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   The woman said she had never talked about the ordeal with
anyone, not even her mother, until last month, when she responded
to a request she had received from tribunal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend the systematic rapes were not only for the
soldiers' own gratification, but also represented one of the most
vicious components of the Serb strategy of ''ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   The proceeding began March 20 at the U.N. tribunal, set up in
1993 to bring those responsible for atrocities in the Balkans to
justice.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cops Storm Rebel Hide-out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATMAN, Turkey (AP) -- Police on Wednesday stormed a suspected
Kurdish rebel hide-out in this southeastern city, killing one
alleged militant who refused to surrender, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Police also detained four people -- two of them women -- who were
in the house at the time of the raid, the first reported on a rebel
hide-out since guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK,
announced an end to their armed struggle last year.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has ignored the PKK's cease-fire and has vowed to
continue its fight until all surrender or are killed.
</P>
<P>
   Police charged into a house after the suspected rebel ignored
calls to turn himself in and fired shots at officers, said Police
Chief Muzaffer Erkan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tried to catch him, but he responded to our calls to
surrender with a gun,'' Erkan said.
</P>
<P>
   Erkan said police had been watching the suspected militant's
moves for some time. His identity was not released, but the
semiofficial Anatolia news agency said the man was in his thirties.
</P>
<P>
   Most PKK rebels have withdrawn from southeastern Turkey under
orders from their imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who now wants
to struggle for Kurdish rights using political means. Turkey
dismisses the group as a terrorist organization and says it will
never negotiate with its members.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey does not recognize Kurds as a minority and bans teaching
and broadcasts in the Kurdish language.
</P>
<P>
   Some 37,000 people, mostly Kurds, have been killed in clashes in
the southeast since the rebels took up arms in 1984.

   Dow Ends Down 92; Nasdaq Off 87
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell today as investors took some profits
from a powerful two-day run and sold shares that failed to live up
to high expectations for corporate earnings. Mild volume and modest
losses for major market indicators made for one of the calmest
sessions of the year, in sharp contrast to the violent market
swings of recent weeks. the Dow Jones industrial average fell 92.46
to close at 10,674.96, having given up a solid midday gain. The
Nasdaq composite index fell 87.06 to close at 3,706.51. Broader
stock barometers also closed lower. The market's decline reminded
investors that last week's devastating selloff has left the market
vulnerable. Some mixed reports on corporate earnings and a sense
that the rally on Monday and yesterday may have been overdone
sparked selling today, analysts said.

   Feb. Trade Deficit Hit Record $29B
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A surging foreign oil bill along with
Americans' appetite for foreign computers and telecommunications
equipment helped push the U.S. trade deficit to a monthly record of
$29.2 billion in February. The bigger-than-expected deficit was up
6.5 percent from a January shortfall of $27.4 billion, the Commerce
Department said. Imports jumped 1.5 percent in February to a record
$113.4 billion. U.S. exports fell 0.2 percent to $84.2 billion.
Sales of food fell, as did sales of cars and capital goods,
including airplanes and industrial machines. But economists said
the trade report isn't as bad as it appears. ''When you adjust for
oil prices, the deficit narrowed,'' said Northern Trust Co.'s chief
economist, Paul Kasriel.

   Toymaker Mattel Narrows Losses
</P>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Troubled toymaker Mattel Inc. narrowed
its losses in the first quarter, benefiting from a jump in Barbie
sales and strength in its Fisher-Price business. But Wall Street
still wasn't satisfied with the financial results reported today,
and analysts said that more work was needed to revive the world's
biggest manufacturer of toys. Mattel reported a loss of $6.2
million, or 1 cent a share, from continuing operations for the
quarter, compared with $12.6 million, or 3 cents per share, in the
same period a year ago. Analysts had forecast a 3-cent loss per
share. Nattel stock was down 1/16 at 11 11/16 today.

   Boeing Profits Fall 11 Percent

<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co.'s profits fell 11 percent in the first
quarter of 2000, the company said today, blaming a 40-day strike by
engineers and technical workers for fewer aircraft deliveries and
lower revenues. Boeing made $418 million, 48 cents per share, on
revenues of $9.91 billion. In the same period last year, Boeing
made $469 million, or 50 cents per share, on sales of $14.39
billion -- a 31 percent drop in revenue. Despite the lower profits,
Boeing surpassed Wall Street's expectations. Analysts surveyed by
First Call/Thomson Financial had expected earnings of 35 cents per

divisions around the world showed improvement. The maker of Colgate
toothpaste, Irish Spring soap, Mennen deodorant and Ajax cleanser
earned $239.9 million, or 38 cents a share, in the three months
ended March 31, up from $208.9 million, or 32 cents a share, a year
earlier. That was a penny a share better than analysts expected.
Colgate stock was up 7/16 at 55 11/16.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Chase Manhattan Corp. said today that profits

venture-capital portfolio. Chase earned $1.36 billion, or $1.59 a

   Fuel Costs Hit Airlines Earnings

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Higher fuel costs dragged down earnings at major

percent increase in operating profits on a 10 percent jump in
passenger revenue. Excluding one-time charges and certain
compensation expenses, the world's largest airline earned $191
million, or $1.61 per share, up from $187 million, or $1.54 per
share, in the year-earlier period. Trans World Airlines had a wider
first-quarter net loss: $76.1 million or $1.16 a share. But
passenger revenue, which accounts for the vast majority of the
company's revenue, rose to $723.6 million from $681.1 million.
America West reported a 44 percent drop in first-quarter earnings
due to higher fuel prices and operating problems early in the year.
Earnings were $14.6 million, or 40 cents.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The founder of an online stock trading firm at

million in debt as a result of his own risky investment strategy --
buying stock on margin. Barry Hertz, the founder of Track Data
Corp., a Brooklyn, N.Y., firm that caters to investors who disdain
professional advice in favor of instant access to the markets, owes
the money to four brokerage firms from whom Hertz borrowed money to
speculate in the stock markets. The company said in a statement
earlier this week that Hertz was forced to put up half of the 45
million shares he owns of Track Data as collateral against his

<HEADLINE> 26 Killed in Kenya Cop, Bandit Clash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- An attack by a gang of suspected cattle
rustlers and an ensuing gun battle with police claimed 26 lives
Wednesday in north central Kenya, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspected rustlers, believed to be members of Kenya's Pokot
tribe, had attacked a homestead belonging to the Turkana tribe,
killing nine people, police spokesman Peter Kimanthi said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Police pursued the gang and caught up with them at Soito Kikuyu
village in Samburu district, about 132 miles north of Nairobi and a
heavy gun battle and police shot 17 members of the gang to death,
arresting four others, the statement said. Police suffered no
causalities, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Police recovered 852 head of cattle, 240 camels and 470 goats,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle-rustling is endemic among the herding communities that
straddle the region that crosses the borders of Kenya, Uganda,
Sudan and Ethiopia. Easy access to modern weapons has made the
traditional raids increasingly deadly.

<HEADLINE> Feb. Trade Deficit Hit Record $29B  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A surging foreign oil bill along with
Americans' appetite for foreign computers and telecommunications
equipment helped push the U.S. trade deficit to a monthly record of
$29.2 billion in February.
</P>
<P>
   That bigger-than-expected deficit was up 6.5 percent from a
January shortfall of $27.4 billion, the previous record, the
Commerce Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Imports jumped 1.5 percent in February to a record $113.4
billion as sales of crude petroleum, industrial supplies including
chemicals and capital goods such as computers and
telecommunications equipment rose to records.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first two months of this year, the U.S. trade
deficit was running at an annual rate of $340 billion, compared
with $268 billion for all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''About half of the increase in the deficit thus far this year
can be traced to higher petroleum prices,'' said Commerce Secretary
William Daley.
</P>
<P>
   The price of crude oil hit $25.01 per barrel in February, the
highest since $25.75 in December 1990 on the eve of the Persian
Gulf War. Imports of foreign oil, meanwhile, hit an all-time
monthly high of $6.5 billion in February.
</P>
<P>
   Production limits by oil-producing nations pushed crude-oil
prices to a nine-year high in early March of $34 a barrel, but
prices have fallen since then. A decision by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to boost production should provide
additional relief.
</P>
<P>
   America's deficit with OPEC countries widened to a record $3.2
billion in February, a 21.4 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the trade report isn't as bad as it appears.
''When you adjust for oil prices, the deficit narrowed,'' said
Northern Trust Co.'s chief economist, Paul Kasriel. National
Association of Manufacturers' economist Gordon Richards said:
''outside of oil, imports showed a small decrease.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq
closed down as investors took some profits from a powerful two-day
run and sold shares that failed to live up to high expectations for
corporate earnings. The market was little affected by the trade
report.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight month, U.S. exports dipped in February.
They fell 0.2 percent to $84.2 billion. Sales of food such as fish,
corn and fruits fell, as did sales of cars and capital goods,
including airplanes and industrial machines.
</P>
<P>
   The widening trade deficit is the one bit of tarnish on an
otherwise sterling, record-breaking economy, which is in its ninth
year of uninterrupted growth.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the bloated deficit is actually a testimony to
the robust state of the U.S. economy compared with other countries,
particularly foreign economies that are continuing to recover from
a global financial crisis that struck in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperous consumers are helping the United States gobble up
imported goods as demand from overseas' economies for U.S. exports,
while picking up, continues to lag.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S economy is surging at a pace so much faster than the
rest of the world that exports just cannot hope to keep up with
imports,'' said economist Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. economy could face dangers at some point, economists
warn, if the huge increases in the trade deficit continue and
foreigners suddenly decide they no longer want to hold
dollar-denominated assets. A sudden rush for the exits could send
American stock prices and the value of the dollar plunging.
</P>
<P>
   On the political front, the deficit could present the Clinton
administration with political problems as it tries to sell a
landmark trade agreement to Congress that would clear the way for
China to become a member of the 135-nation World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   America's deficit with China narrowed by 6.8 percent in February
to $5.6 billion. But that deficit is running $2.2 billion higher in
the first two months of this year than the same period last year.
The administration argues that the market-opening trade deal with
China would mean billions of dollars in increased sales for
American exporters.
</P>
<P>
   The politically sensitive deficit with Japan shot up 20.7
percent to $6.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   There was at least one bright spot in the report for U.S.
exporters. Sales of U.S. consumer goods, such as household
appliances, rose by $253 million to a record monthly high of $7.3
billion in February.

<HEADLINE> Federal judge calls for nationwide settlement to tobacco cases  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A global settlement to all tobacco cases
nationwide would be sensible since they are all related and
complex, a judge has concluded as he ordered lawyers in several
cases to prepare for settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time for bringing a close to tobacco litigation is nigh,''
U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein wrote in a three-page order
urging lawyers in five major tobacco cases in various stages to
begin talks.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein, a Brooklyn federal jurist since 1967, said the cases
were complex and the court has a ''duty to take affirmative
action'' to encourage lawyers to seek creative ways to resolve the
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement would include a pending class action suit
currently before Weinstein that encompasses all U.S. smokers with
lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein suggested that the class action might be expanded to
include everyone with smoking-related diseases ''so that the
tobacco litigation may be fully resolved in a comprehensive
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   The jurist also invited the U.S. government to participate in
the talks to resolve any claims that might have arisen from federal
programs. In September, the Justice Department sued the tobacco
industry to recover billions of government dollars spent on
smoking-related health care, accusing cigarette-makers of a
''coordinated campaign of fraud and deceit.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge said plaintiffs and defendants in the cases must each
choose an individual or individuals to represent them in
preliminary discussions meant to create a framework for settlement
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Then, they should try to jointly select a mediator or special
master to assist the discussions, he said. If necessary, he will
appoint one, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously the order was something we didn't expect,'' said
William Ohlemeyer, associate general counsel at New York-based
Philip Morris, the nation's leading cigarette manufacturer with
brands such as Marlboro and Virginia Slims.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's impossible to know what our response will be until we
have a chance to look at the law,'' Ohlemeyer said. ''We certainly
believe we have strong defenses to these cases.''
</P>
<P>
   A liberal judge known for fostering innovative mass-tort
litigation, the 78-year-old Weinstein has played a major role at
resolving other complex and high-profile civil cases, including
Agent Orange and asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   The need for global solutions to complex cases was illustrated
in 1991 when the U.S. Judicial Conference, a 27-judge board,
discovered that two of every three dollars spent in connection with
asbestos cases went to trial costs, not the victims.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Weinstein ordered the consolidation of 44 lawsuits
against major computer-equipment makers by people complaining of
painful work-related wrist and arm injuries.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Weinstein led a group of 10 judges who created a
plan to combine cases and reduce a backlog of nearly 100,000
asbestos lawsuits that were clogging state and federal courts at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein also devised a national settlement in 1984 for Vietnam
War-related injuries from the defoliant Agent Orange.

<HEADLINE> AM-CT--Phone Slamming, 1st Ld-Writethru,379  </HEADLINE>
AT&AMP;T settles complaint over switching unknowing customers
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. on Wednesday said it will
pay for a consumer education campaign in Connecticut to settle a
3-year-old dispute over the practice of switching long-distance
service without the customer's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The phone company has agreed to produce 1,000 brochures against
''phone slamming'' to be distributed by the state Department of
Utility Control and the Office of Consumer Counsel. AT&AMP;T also will
pay up to $10,000 to produce a public service radio announcement --
in English and Spanish -- to educate consumers on slamming.
</P>
<P>
   It is essentially the same agreement the company and the DPUC
tentatively reached in 1998, but was opposed by state Attorney
General Richard Blumenthal. He argued the agreement does nothing to
deter future unlawful conduct by AT&AMP;T and recommended any
settlement signed by the DPUC include a commitment from AT&AMP;T not to
engage in specific unlawful conduct.
</P>
<P>
   But the DPUC said Wednesday that AT&AMP;T has demonstrated a
''willingness and ability'' to curb slamming complaints and has
improved its response to those complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, AT&AMP;T representatives will begin meeting
with state regulators at least once a month for three months to
discuss the how the company handles complaints. After the first
three months, a new meeting schedule will be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   The DPUC began investigating the New York-based AT&AMP;T in 1997
after fielding complaints from more than 150 consumers who said
they were victims of phone slamming.
</P>
<P>
   Utility officials said slamming complaints involving AT&AMP;T
increased by more than 300 percent in 1997 over the year before.
The number of slamming complaints against AT&AMP;T also was much higher
than other phone service providers in the state, according to the
DPUC.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal called the action a slap on the wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ''This serious anti-consumer misconduct merited a significant
fine and other penalties to deter and punish slamming,'' he said.
''We will continue to battle abuses of consumer rights that harm
them financially by misusing technology in slamming and similar
practices.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 92; Nasdaq Off 87  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell Wednesday as investors took some
profits from a powerful two-day run and sold shares that failed to
live up to high expectations for corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Mild volume and modest losses for major market indicators made
for one of the calmest sessions of the year, in sharp contrast to
the violent market swings of recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 92.46 to close at
10,674.96, having given up a solid midday gain.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 87.16 to close at 3,706.41.
Broader stock barometers also closed lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 fell 14.14 to 1,427.47.
</P>
<P>
   The decline reminded investors that last week's devastating
selloff has left the market vulnerable. Some mixed reports on
corporate earnings and a sense that the rally on Monday and Tuesday
may have been overdone sparked selling on Wednesday, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than anything else, we had a negative reaction to the two
strong days that came before,'' said Ricky Harrington, technical
analyst at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C. ''The market has
had a strong technical rally but it might not yet be sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first two sessions of this week, the Nasdaq rose 472
points, with record point gains each day, and the Dow average
gained 461, wiping out big chunks of the crushing losses sustained
last week. Financial markets will be closed Friday for the
observance of Good Friday, and with a long string of volatile
sessions behind them, some investors took a pause ahead of the long
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, earnings reports drove the market. Companies are
nearing the peak of the reporting season, and while most companies
have reported very strong profit growth, investors have punished
those that have shown any hint of weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, IBM fell 7 to 104{. The company said late Tuesday
that while earnings beat analysts' expectations, sales slumped 5
percent in the first quarter, dragged down by a broad decline in
products ranging from desktop computers to mainframes to hard disk

   Intel, a bellwether technology stock, fell 9 15/16 to 119 1/16,
accounting for the largest share of the Dow's decline. Intel said
first-quarter profits rose 37 percent, and executives also
predicted unusually high sales for the traditionally sluggish
second quarter.

   However, some analysts were looking for higher revenue growth in
the coming quarters. Also, Intel stock had risen sharply in advance

   Qualcomm rose 2 9/16 to 114} on the Nasdaq. The maker of mobile
phone technology reported earnings of 25 cents a share, beating
analysts' expectations of 24 cents a share. Before Wednesday's

-- had tumbled about 36 percent in the year to date as investors
took profits.
</P>

   Drug stocks, which are seen as more stable growth stocks than

Warner-Lambert reported that operating profits surged 35 percent in

   Late in the session, however, Bristol-Myers Squibb broke the
trend, tumbling 14{ to 50| after the company announced that it will
withdraw a new drug application for hypertension drug Vanlev from
the Food and Drug Administration. The drug was expected to be a
blockbuster for Bristol-Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the renewed focus on earnings is the strongest
legacy of last week's rout. Many attributed the cataclysmic selling
to investors who drove stocks up too high on pure momentum, then
panicked on the fear that earnings wouldn't justify their high
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fundamentals do count, and will probably continue to drive at
least the near-term buying momentum within the marketplace,'' said
Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP;

</P>
<P>
   The market was little affected by a report that the U.S. trade
deficit shot up to a record $29.2 billion in February as Americans'
demand for foreign oil hit an all-time monthly high while sales of
exports dipped.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department said the deficit widened by 6.5 percent
in February. The deficit was bigger than the $28.9 billion
imbalance many analysts were forecasting.

margin on the New York Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq, advancers led

<HEADLINE> Haiti Opposition Candidate Kidnapped  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Gunmen kidnapped a local opposition
candidate in the latest violence to hit Haiti's election campaign,
a party official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Four men in a pickup truck abducted Claudy Myrthil in front of
his home in a Port-au-Prince suburb Tuesday, said Mischa Gaillard,
spokesman for the five-party opposition coalition, known as Space
for Concord.
</P>
<P>
   ''The atmosphere is one of terror,'' Gaillard said. ''We need
security for candidates and voters to have a free and fair
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Myrthil was running for a seat on a city government advisory
board. His sister told the private Radio Kiskeya that he had
previously been threatened.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 people have been killed -- including several
opposition officials -- in election-related violence in recent
weeks. Haiti is scheduled to hold two rounds of legislative and
municipal voting on May 21 and June 25.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a crime wave that has accompanied the political
violence, Alicia Matos, wife of Spanish Ambassador Rafael Matos,
was slightly injured Monday by a mob throwing stones at passing
vehicles. Foreign diplomats met with President Rene Preval Tuesday
to ask that police crack down.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians blame supporters of former President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide for the political violence. Aristide, who
denies his claims, plans to run in presidential elections slated
for December.
</P>
<P>
   Militants claiming to support Aristide razed the Space for
Concord's headquarters and stoned the offices of the opposition
Struggling People's Organization on April 8. Opposition leaders say
two local party managers have been killed, party offices in other
towns attacked, and campaign workers beaten. Haiti's most prominent
radio journalist, Jean Dominique, was slain on April 3.
</P>
<P>
   Preval, an Aristide ally, has accused the opposition of
''fueling the climate of disorder'' with their anti-violence
protests.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Protesters Hold Vigil  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 50 World Bank and International Monetary
Fund protesters are holding a quiet vigil outside a District of
Columbia jail, vowing to stay until their fellow protesters are
released.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated 150 protesters jailed are required to identify
themselves and post $50 fines before they can leave but are
refusing to do, protester Fraf Wheaton of Texas said Wednesday.
They believe they should not be in jail and ''won't be forced to
submit to the system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a grassy spot outside the jail, two green tarps cover duffel
bags, clothes and blankets. Food is available, thanks in part to a
friendly woman down the road who has delivered soy milk, chicken,
juice and bagels, Wheaton said.
</P>
<P>
   Those camped out cooked over a gas stove Tuesday night -- making
stew with lentils, potatoes and cabbage.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. police estimated as many as 10,000 protesters were in town
Sunday and Monday to protest and try to stop the World Bank and IMF
meetings, which proceeded as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Arrests throughout the week topped 1,300.

<HEADLINE> Euro Sinks To New Low Against Dollar  </HEADLINE>
By SKIP WOLLENBERG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro fell to a new low against the dollar
Wednesday before recovering a bit, its decline fueled by doubts
that Europe will be taking steps anytime soon to stimulate growth
and investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The single currency adopted by 11 European currencies at the
start of 1999 sank as low as 93.57 cents in midday trading in New
York. Its previous low had been 93.90 cents reached Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   In late New York trading, the euro had recovered somewhat to
94.04 cents, still down from 94.80 cents late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading, the dollar was quoted at 104.78 Japanese yen,
up from 104.75 yen late Tuesday; 1.6688 Swiss francs, up from
1.6623, and 1.4742 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4828. The British
pound rose to $1.5813 from $1.5790.
</P>
<P>
   The euro came under pressure this week after it was unable to
stage a recovery during last week's late rout in U.S. stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Some traders has been expecting the euro would benefit a sharp
decline in U.S. stocks on the theory that traders would pull funds
from America to invest elsewhere. But Wall Street's woes didn't
spark demand for the European currency. U.S. stock prices bounced
higher on Monday and Tuesday before giving some ground Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Anderson, who follows foreign exchange developments at
Fleet in Boston, said the euro's weakness reflects the ''low
confidence'' that European authorities will enact ''the type of
economic programs and reforms that are going to lead to growth
rates there similar to those in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   He said investors ''are looking for clarity and vision in
long-term policies'' such as on taxes to convince them to commit
money to Europe but are not seeing it.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Nickerson, currency strategist in New York for Bank of
America, said the dollar is benefitting from a perception that last
week's stock selloff was simply a correction rather than an end to
the bull market of most of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Domestic demand still strong. There is not much reason to
sell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said European authorities, meanwhile, have appeared ''not
particularly concerned about the euro's weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0796 German
marks, up from 2.0629; 6.9749 French francs, up from 6.9186; and
2,058.86 Italian lire, up from 2,042.26.

<HEADLINE> Drugmakers Report Earnings Growth  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- American Home Products Corp. and Warner-Lambert
Co., two of the nation's largest drugmakers, posted strong
first-quarter operating earnings growth on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies had planned to merge until Pfizer Inc. became
involved in a messy three-way takeover battle that ultimately led
to the pending combination between Pfizer and Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   For Warner-Lambert, fast growth has become commonplace in the
past several quarters due mostly to explosive sales of its
cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor.
</P>
<P>
   American Home's higher net income stands in contrast to its
sluggish 1999 performance.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products
</P>
<P>
   Rebounding from slugglish growth in the past year, American Home
Products first-quarter profits rose 18 percent, fueled by strong
sales of its estrogen-replacement pill Premarin.
</P>
<P>
   Including special items, American Home's net income was $276.4
million or 21 cents per share, compared to $654 million or 49 cents
per share a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The first-quarter results included a $1.8 billion fee the
company received from Warner-Lambert for breaking off its merger
with American Home. Warner-Lambert terminated the deal to merge
with Pfizer, a pact expected to be completed later this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding one-time items, American Home earned $634.9 million or
48 cents per share in the three months ended March 31, up from
$538.1 million or 40 cents per share in the year-ago period.
Results matched Wall Street forecasts, which had been lowered in
the past few days, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Sales from continuing operations increased 16 percent in the
first quarter to $3.34 billion from $2.86 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Madison, N.J.-based-company's drug sales rose 16 percent to
$2.7 billion. Sales of Premarin rose 8 percent to $542 million, its
antidepressant Effexor rose 54 percent to $252 million and Enbrel,
a rheumatoid arthritis drug doubled to $136 million.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, American Home only made a tiny profit after the
company had to fend off thousands of lawsuits related to its diet
drugs and recall some drugs due to safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   American Home's results were negatively affected by a loss of
$1.57 billion from the sale of its agricultural business, which it
sold for $3.8 billion to European chemical concern BASF AG.
</P>
<P>
   The company's consumer health sales rose 6 percent to $595.9
million in the quarter on the strength of its Centrum vitamins and
Advil pain reliever.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of American Home rose $2.75, or nearly 5 percent, to
$59.12{ at 5:15 p.m. EST on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert's first quarter operating profit surged 35
percent, but the drugmaker reported a $1.4 billion net loss, or
$1.61 a share, because of the large breakup fee it had to pay for
terminating its merger deal with American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the breakup fee and other unusual items,
Warner-Lambert made $516 million or 58 cents per share in the three
months ended March 31, compared to $382 million or 43 cents per
share in the year-ago period. Results topped Wall Street
expectations by 2 cents, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   The Morris Plains, N.J.-based company attributed its strong
operating earnings to fast rising sales of Lipitor and the
anticonvulsant drug Neurontin.
</P>
<P>
   Lipitor sales rose 46 percent to $1.1 billion. The drug now
controls half of the U.S. market share for cholesterol pills. Sales
of Neurontin rose 71 percent to $301 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company's consumer products, which include Benadryl allergy
products and Schick razors, posted a 2 percent increase in sales to
$748 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the firm's confectionary products, such as Trident gum
and Halls cough tablets, rose 9 percent to $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company's first quarter results were also hurt by a $91
million charge from the recall of its diabetes drug Rezulin, which
has been linked to several dozen deaths since it was introduced in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Warner-Lambert rose $7.73 7/16, or more than 7
percent, to $115 at 5:15 p.m. EST on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Crude, Heating Oil Futures Soar  </HEADLINE>
By BENNIE M. CURRIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heating oil and crude futures rose sharply Wednesday on the New
York Mercantile Exchange amid growing concern about shrinking fuel
supplies, which are at their lowest level in at least seven years.
</P>
<P>
   In other markets, cattle and grain futures climbed higher.
</P>
<P>
   Inventories for distillate fuel, which includes heating oil and
diesel fuel, fell again last week, according to newly released data
from the Department of Energy and the American Petroleum Institute.
That prompted a nearly 9 percent surge in heating oil prices, also
leading other energy commodities higher.
</P>
<P>
   Heating oil for May delivery rose 6.07 cents to 76.85 cents a
gallon, while May intermediate crude jumped $1.24 to $27.35 a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   May unleaded gasoline followed suit, rising 2.47 cents to 85.33
cents a gallon, while May natural gas fell 4.3 cents to $3.055 per
1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   In London, June Brent crude from the North Sea rose 72 cents to
$23.77 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department data released early Wednesday confirmed
what API figures had shown late the day before -- that distillate
and gasoline stocks both dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Bill O'Grady, energy futures analyst for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons
Inc. in St. Louis, said falling inventories, coming at a time of
year when stockpiles usually are building, are heightening fears
about the possibility of summer shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Inventories are shrinking partly because of truck drivers
tanking up to keep pace with the booming economy, according to
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ''You also have a significant need for diesel fuel for crop
equipment, combines, tractors and planting,'' O'Grady said, noting
that spring planting has been accelerated due to unusually dry
Midwestern conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Heating oil inventories are about 15 million barrels lower than
their five-year average, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, cattle prices pushed to three-week highs on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange as beef demand continued to soar in the
runup to America's beloved summer barbecue season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite prices that are at seven-year highs, supermarkets and
other retailers are stocking up on beef with confidence that
consumers will soon start snapping up beef for warm-weather
cookouts.
</P>
<P>
   June live cattle rose .25 cents to 69.52 cents a pound after
hitting a three-week high of 69.90 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Grain and soybean futures resumed their rise on investors'
lingering concerns about dry soil conditions in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Even though many growing regions took a soaking Wednesday,
market watchers said the dry weather pattern that has depleted soil
moisture in recent months would continue, leaving moisture levels
below normal.
</P>
<P>
   May corn rose 3\ cents to $2.27} a bushel; July oats rose 2{
cents to $1.22\ a bushel; July wheat rose 1 cent to $2.65\ a
bushel; July soybeans rose 3} cents to $5.50} a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Misdiagnose Women, Blacks  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Emergency rooms miss the signs of a heart attack in only about 2
percent of patients, but much more often in blacks and young or
middle-aged women, a study finds.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.7 million patients are admitted to U.S. hospitals each
year with heart attacks or the warning chest pains known as
unstable angina. The study finds that emergency rooms incorrectly
send home about 26,000 other patients each year with the same
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The good news is it's only 2 percent. The bad news is that's
26,000 patients,'' said Dr. Harry Selker, a reseacher at New
England Medical Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published Thursday in The New England Journal of
Medicine, tracked 10,689 patients at 10 hospitals in the East and
Midwest. It was the largest study ever to check accuracy of
diagnoses on emergency room heart patients.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, doctors missed unstable angina in just 2.3 percent
of patients and heart attacks in 2.1 percent. However, the mistake
rates for the combined problems ranged widely among the hospitals:
from 0 to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The study found wrong diagnoses for 4.3 percent of blacks and 7
percent of women younger than 55.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said the rate is important to know, because
hospitals are under such financial pressure to curtail unnecessary
admissions. Patients wrongly sent home with acute heart problems
are at much higher risk of death.
</P>
<P>
   Selker said hospitals and insurers should routinely monitor such
rates at specific hospitals, especially in the cost-cutting
environment.
</P>
<P>
   His research colleague, Dr. J. Hector Pope, at Baystate Medical
Center in Springfield, said emergency room doctors should take
careful medical histories, examine patients thoroughly, and make
smart use of the testing methods.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers gave several possible explanations for why more
women and blacks are missed. Other research suggests that the
signature symptom of a heart attack, the severe chest pain, is
absent more often in women than men. The study team also said its
own earlier research suggested that black patients are younger
overall and more often are women.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to be particularly careful when seeing women and
minorities, who may have nontraditional heart attack warning signs,
such as shortness of breath or nausea,'' said Dr. Rose Marie
Robertson, president-elect of the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   But the study researchers also said they cannot rule out sexism
and racism.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Romney, policy director at the National Black Women's
Health Project in Washington, D.C., largely blamed personal and
institutional discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's embedded in our society,'' she said. ''Your race and your
sex in this society does have an impact on how you enter the health
system and what kind of care you get.''

<HEADLINE> Toymaker Mattel Narrows Losses  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL WHITE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Troubled toymaker Mattel Inc. narrowed
its losses in the first quarter, benefiting from a jump in Barbie
sales and strength in its Fisher-Price business.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street still wasn't satisfied with the financial
results reported Wednesday, and analysts said that more work was
needed to revive the world's biggest manufacturer of toys.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel's stock fell 6\ cents to $11.68} in trading at 4:30 p.m.
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the income statement was particularly
optimistic,'' said Joe Kinnison, an analyst with American Express
Financial Advisers. ''I need to see some progress on the
fundamentals before I would get our investors to purchase it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattel reported a loss of $6.2 million, or 1 cent a share, from
continuing operations for the quarter ended March 31, compared with
a loss of $12.6 million, or 3 cents per share, in the same period a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel beat a 3-cents-per-share loss forecast by analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thompson Financial. The results, however,
did not reflect a $127 million loss in the company's interactive
toys division, which for reporting purposes was considered a
discontinued operation.
</P>
<P>
   The results also did not include $38.4 million in severance
payments to former chief executive Jill E. Barad and other senior
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterly sales rose 1 percent to $693.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Barbie sales in the United States rose 14 percent, but overseas
fell 5 percent despite a concerted campaign to boost the doll's
international appeal. Sales in the core Fisher-Price pre-school
division rose 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Barbie in the U.S. is turning around,'' Kinnison said. ''Their
inventory was in much better shape going into the first quarter
this year. Sales are robust. Barbie international, however, is
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems in Mattel's interactive division were rooted in its
acquisition last year of software maker The Learning Company for
$3.6 billion. The company was expected to immediately add to
Mattel's revenues, but instead lost millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Barad resigned in February after Mattel reported a loss for the
fourth consecutive quarter. A string of executive departures began
in November, when Learning Company founders Kevin O'Leary and
Michael Perik resigned in the wake of big losses in the division.
Mattel President Ned Mansour resigned last month.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel has not said how much money individual executives,
including Barad, were being paid after they left the company. In a
news release on Wednesday, Mattel said the $38.4 million in
severance included the forgiveness of unspecified loans.
</P>
<P>
   Since Barad left, board member William Rollnick has served as
Mattel's acting chairman and Ronald Loeb as acting CEO. The company
is looking for a new chief executive.

<HEADLINE> Ad Growth Boosts Meredith Earnings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Advertising growth in its magazines and
other publications helped Meredith Corp. post a 12 percent increase
in earnings for its third fiscal quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Net earnings were $24.8 million, or 47 cents per share, compared
to $22.1 million, or 41 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenues
rose 8 percent to $286.9 million from $265.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues from Meredith's magazines and other publications,
including Better Homes and Gardens and Successful Farming, were
$224.1 million, up 11 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of special note is Ladies' Home Journal magazine. It achieved
marked improvement in the third quarter, with advertising pages up
8 percent versus the prior year, and even stronger advertising
revenue growth,'' said William T. Kerr, Meredith chairman and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues from Meredith's broadcasting group, however, slipped to
$62.9 million from $63.1 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr blamed, among other things, investments in the Atlanta
station WGNX-TV, news expansion across the group and low prime-time
ratings for the Fox network. Six of Meredith's 12 stations are Fox
affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Meredith were priced at $27.25 at 5:15 p.m. EST on the
New York Stock Exchange, up 50 cents or about 2 percent.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Earns Up, Stock Down  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG surpassed Wall Street
expectations Wednesday with a 3 percent increase in first-quarter
earnings, but excitement was tempered by declining profit margins
in North America and an ever-shrinking stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the company's annual shareholder meeting, Chairman
Juergen Schrempp said DaimlerChrysler was feeling the squeeze of
competitors slashing prices in the United States to snag customers
for high-profit minivans and sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The problem -- rolling out rebates, discounts and other
incentives in order to compete -- has cut into DaimlerChrysler's
bottom line, triggering a 7 percent drop in the operating profit at
Chrysler division.
</P>
<P>
   Investors didn't like the news, and DaimlerChrysler stock closed
down 1.96 euros, or 2.9 percent, to 66.75 euros ($63.41) in
Frankfurt trading. On the New York Stock Exchange, shares fared
slightly better, falling 75 cents to $63.87{.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's declines come after disheartened shareholders have
already watched the price steadily erode over the past year, down
almost 30 percent from its 52-week high.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where's my shareholder value?'' demanded Evelyn Y. Davis, a
shareholder activist from Washington who traveled to Wednesday's
meeting to confront the DaimlerChrysler board. She said her shares
in Chrysler Corp. were worth $32,000 before the 1998 merger, but
are only worth $18,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   More than 8,000 shareholders attended Wednesday's annual
meeting, and Davis wasn't alone in lining up at the podium to air
their angst about DaimlerChrysler's precipitous slide.
</P>
<P>
   The auditorium erupted in applause when Schrempp said, ''There
is one point on which I am as dissatisfied you are. That is the
trend in share prices over the past 12 month.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schrempp remained upbeat about the first quarter, saying
last month's deal to acquire a 34 percent stake in Mitsubishi
Motors seals DaimlerChrysler's role as a global powerhouse ready to
take on No. 1 General Motors Corp. and No. 2 Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new millennium is off to a great start for
DaimlerChrysler,'' Schrempp said. ''No company has such a
well-balanced spread across all world markets and is so
well-positioned as we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite declining profit margins at the German-American company,
it said overall net income was up 3 percent in the first three
months of 2000 to 1.69 billion euros ($1.62 billion), or 1.69 euros
($1.62) a share. That compares to 1.64 billion euros ($1.6
billion), or 1.64 euros ($1.57) a share, in the same period a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The results edged out Wall Street estimates of $1.58 a share for
the quarter, as surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. Schrempp
said the company expects earnings per share to increase for the
full year.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues for the quarter also rose 17 percent, to 40.9 billion
euros ($39.2 billion) from 34.9 billion ($33.5 billion).
</P>
<P>
   The Chrysler division had revenues of 18.9 billion euros ($18.2
billion) for the first quarter, an increase of 24 percent over last
year. That was driven by a 10 percent increase in the number of
vehicles sold.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercedes-Benz and Smart car division had revenues of $9.9
billion euros ($9.5 billion), a 17 percent increase over last year.
Sales of Mercedes-Benz passengers cars were up 7 percent in the
quarter. Sales of the micro-mini Smart car, available only in
Europe, totaled 18,500 for the quarter, more than doubling the
figures from last year.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, shareholders approved a proposed dividend for
1999 of 2.35 euros ($2.25), unchanged from the previous year. That
was a sore point for some who complained that the dividend --
relatively small by U.S. standards -- added insult to sinking stock
price.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler shareholders also approved a share buyback and a
new stock option plan for DaimlerChrysler management.

<HEADLINE> General Dynamics Earnings, Sales Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) -- General Dynamics reported a 17 percent
rise in first-quarter earnings on increased sales in the military
contractor's aerospace, combat, shipbuilding and technology
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Falls Church-based company earned $184 million, or 91 cents
per share, in the three months that ended April 2. That compares
with $158 million, or 78 cents per share, in the same period of
1999, excluding one-time gains.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues for the quarter were $2.55 billion, compared with $2
billion in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman and chief executive Nicholas Chabraja attributed the
gains to a 17 percent increase in sales in the aerospace division,
combined with more efficient operations in the Gulfstream corporate
jet division.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in the information systems and technology division were up
160 percent, primarily due to the acquisition of several technology
companies. Sales in the marine division also rose.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter, the Navy began a $435 million contract with
General Dynamics for the construction of the first of four
amphibious transport ships to be built at Bath Iron Works in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   General Dynamics hopes to compete for more European arms
contracts following the announcement last week that it would buy
ENSB, a Spanish maker of combat vehicles and munitions that has a
contract to provide a battle tank for Spain's military.
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares were priced at $52 at 5:15 p.m. EST on the
New York Stock Exchange, up $1.75 or nearly 3.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> United Technologies' Earnings Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- United Technologies Corp.'s earnings rose
22 percent in the first quarter, boosted by strong revenue growth
at its Carrier building systems, Otis elevators and Flight Systems
units.
</P>
<P>
   United Technologies earned $377 million, or 74 cents per share,
compared with $308 million, or 63 cents per share, in the same
period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues increased 17 percent in the quarter to $6.39 billion,
compared with $5.44 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   At Carrier, UTC's heating, air-conditioning and refrigeration
unit, operating profit rose 35 percent to $123 million, helped by
strong performance in North America. Revenues at UTC increased 22
percent to $1.85 billion, partly due to recent acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter, Carrier acquired Electrolux's commercial
refrigeration business for $140 million. With annual sales of more
than $300 million, the acquisition doubles Carrier's European
commercial refrigeration operations.
</P>
<P>
   The elevator maker, Otis, had a 13 percent increase in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   At Pratt &AMP; Whitney, UTC's jet-engine unit, operating profit
inched up 1 percent to $282 million on 10 percent lower revenues as
declines in large military and commercial engine shipments were
offset by growth in Canada operations and continued cost cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Flight Systems segment, operating profit tripled to $138
million as revenues more than doubled from the inclusion of the
recently acquired Sundstrand's operations and higher value
helicopter shipments at Sikorsky.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of United Technologies rose $3.06\, or 5 percent, to
$61.12{ in trading at 4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Home Lending to Poorer Americans Up  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lending to poorer Americans to buy homes rose
sharply during the 1990s, according to a Treasury Department report
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, required by Congress, found that banks and other
financial institutions covered by a community lending law made a
total of $467 billion in mortgage loans to low- and moderate income
borrowers between 1993 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In just 1998, these institutions made $135 billion in mortgage
loans to these borrowers, an 80 percent increase over such lending
in 1993, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Banks, thrifts and other financial institutions that are
federally insured are covered by the 1977 law called the Community
Reinvestment Act. It requires banks to make loans in low-income and
minority areas in which they operate.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that in 84 percent of the metropolitan areas
reviewed, lenders covered by the CRA raised the share of their
mortgage lending to poorer borrowers and communities.
</P>
<P>
   ''This study is further evidence that a strong Community
Reinvestment Act is critical to ensuring that all neighborhoods are
part of our national economic prosperity,'' said Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers.
</P>
<P>
   A dispute over the community lending law last year threatened to
scuttle legislation overhauling the financial services industries.
In the end, the financial overhaul legislation was passed by
Congress and signed into law by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, a
longtime critic of the 1977 law, ''believes that the CRA is a
serious public policy issue and his staff will undertake a
thoughtful review of the Treasury Department report before making
any comment,'' said the committee's spokeswoman Christi Harlan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a big supporter of the CRA, said in a statement
accompanying the report, that the government ''must remain watchful
to ensure that, as we modernize our financial system, it works for
all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also said that for lenders not covered by the CRA,
so-called subprime lending -- which targets borrowers with sketchy
credit histories -- accounted for most of the growth in lending to
low- and moderate-income borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John LaFalce of New York, the top-ranking Democrat on the
House Banking Committee, commented on the report, saying the law
''has proven to be a lifeline to working families who need and
deserve a home to call their own.''

<HEADLINE> Profits rebound, more outsourcing planned at Lucent Technologies  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Lucent Technologies on Wednesday reported a
41 percent jump in second-quarter profits, a strong rebound from
its weak first quarter. The company credited lower operating
expenses and booming sales of optical fiber, optoelectronic
components, and service provider network services and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The world's top telephone equipment maker also announced it will
outsource all but its most high-tech equipment manufacturing to
boost cash flow and meet customers' needs more quickly. To do so,
Lucent will sell some of its 17 U.S. manufacturing plants to
contract manufacturing partners, leaving about 11,000 workers
either with a new employer or jobless.
</P>
<P>
   For its fiscal quarter ending March 31, the former AT&AMP;T unit
reported net income of $754 million, or 23 cents per share, up from
$535 million, or 17 cents per share, a year earlier. That beat the
22 cents per share that analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson
Financial had forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues rose 17 percent, to $10.3 billion from $8.8 billion a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lucent is regaining its momentum this quarter with strong
growth in wireless, Internet infrastructure -- including optical and
data networking systems and optical fiber -- professional services
and optoelectronics,'' said Richard McGinn, chairman and chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues for the microelectronics and communications
technologies business hit $1.74 billion, up 38 percent overall from
1999's second quarter and up 56 percent in the United States. Sales
for Lucent's service provider networks business, which provides
consulting and design services and builds equipment to send voice,
data and video over networks, reached $6.5 billion, up 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   McGinn predicted revenues from ongoing operations would keep
growing by more than 20 percent for the last six months of fiscal
2000, with revenue growth of about 17 percent for the full year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to take steps to sharpen our strategic focus and
allow us to capitalize even more quickly on the fastest growth
opportunities in communications networking,'' McGinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent plans by late September to spin off its new Enterprise
Networks Group, an $8 billion business that assembles telephone
systems and data networks for companies. Lucent expects that
7,000-employee business to be a leader in messaging and call
centers and voice communications systems.
</P>
<P>
   This quarter's strong showing comes after a disappointing first
fiscal quarter, when Lucent saw profits drop 23 percent on flat
sales. Lucent shares had plunged about 30 percent when the company
issued a warning on Jan. 6 that its October-December profit would
be down, mainly because it was caught off guard by customers' rapid
shift to products based on Lucent's latest fiber-optic technology.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to have other manufacturers produce most of its less
complicated equipment on contract is intended to prevent that
problem from recurring.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our markets and our technologies have changed dramatically in
the past few years, and our manufacturing strategy needs to as
well,'' McGinn said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Bill Price said Lucent has not yet decided
which plants will be sold to contract manufacturers, but increased
outsourcing, which follows an industrywide trend, will help Lucent
''be a little bit more competitive and nimble'' because the
contract manufacturers are better able to quickly increase supply
of new products.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, outsourcing will mean Lucent can reduce inventory
and future investment in manufacturing technology, freeing up more
capital to focus on research and development, and growth areas such
as systems integration.
</P>
<P>
   Price noted that Lucent is working with unions that represent
about 63 percent of its 30,000 U.S. manufacturing employees to
ensure as many as possible at plants that are sold end up with
comparable jobs, but some layoffs are possible.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent's stock closed at $63, up $3.75 on the New York Stock
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> PepsiCo Profits Rise 10.4 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- PepsiCo Inc.'s first-quarter earnings rose 10.4
percent as growth in profits at its snack food, juice and
international beverage businesses more than offset a decline in the
domestic soft drink division blamed on higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   The results were slightly above Wall Street forecasts but
PepsiCo shares fell 62{ cents to $35.31\ a share in trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The food and beverage concern from Purchase, N.Y., earned $422
million, or 29 cents a share, in the three months ended March 18
compared with $333 million, or 22 cents a share, reported a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial expected
earnings of 28 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue fell to $4.19 billion from $5.11 billion a year ago, but
the decline was due to PepsiCo's public offering of a 60 percent
stake in its bottling operations. Its revenue was up 8 percent if
last year's figures are adjusted to exclude the bottling revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Frito-Lay's operating profit rose 10 percent in North America
and 27 percent overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Double-digit growth in the Ruffles and Cheetos brands and new
product introductions helped boost North American revenue by 6
percent as favorable commodity costs and higher volume helped lift
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi-Cola North America, the second biggest soft drink company,
posted an 8 percent decline in its operating profit as higher
retail prices depressed volume for the quarter. The company said
shipments began to improve in March.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profit rose 30 percent in the Pepsi-Cola International
operations and 70 percent at the Tropicana juice business.

<HEADLINE> Oscar-Winning Actress Kedrova Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAULT STE. MARIE, Ontario (AP) -- Lila Kedrova Howard, who won an
Oscar and a Tony for her role as Madame Hortense in the film and
stage version of ''Zorba the Greek,'' has died of heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian-born actress' birth records were lost years ago, but
her husband, Richard Howard, said she was believed to be in her 80s
when she died on Feb. 16 in Sault Ste. Marie, across the border
from northern Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Known professionally as Lila Kedrova, she won the Academy Award
for best supporting actress in 1964 for her portrayal of the dying
French prostitute in the film version of ''Zorba the Greek'' that
featured Anthony Quinn, Alan Bates and Irene Papas.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, Kedrova and Quinn also starred on Broadway
in the musical based on the Nikos Kazantzakis novel, and she
received a Tony award.
</P>
<P>
   Known for her smoky, sensuous singing voice, Kedrova acted in
scores of other movies and stage shows in a career that began in
the 1930s and ended in the early 1990s, according to Howard.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Leningrad, Kedrova and her family fled the former Soviet
Union for Paris in the 1930s and she began performing at age 14,
she said in a 1984 interview.
</P>
<P>
   She met Howard in London in 1968 while she was appearing in a
production of Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard. They were married
in Sault Ste. Marie on New Year's Eve 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had no children, and Kedrova suffered from congestive
heart failure and Alzheimer's disease in her later years.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee Executes Child Killer  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SHARP, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Charlotte Stout went to the execution of
the man who raped and killed her 8-year-old daughter hoping for an
apology.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't get one.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Glen Coe was executed by injection early Wednesday
morning, becoming the first person put to death in Tennessee in 40
years. Coe told Stout he forgave her for helping the state kill
him.
</P>
<P>
   Though she didn't get the remorseful apology she's sought for
more than 20 years, Stout did find peace with his death.
</P>
<P>
   ''Please do not forget Cary's words -- 'Jesus loves you.' These
are her legacy to her killer, to Robert Coe's family and to us. My
child will finally rest in peace,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Coe, 44, kidnapped Cary Ann in 1979 from a church parking lot in
Greenfield, a West Tennessee community, as she rode bicycles with
her brother.
</P>
<P>
   Coe told authorities he raped her and when the little girl told
him, ''Jesus loves you,'' he decided to kill her because it wasn't
true.
</P>
<P>
   When he was rolled into the death chamber, Coe looked to the
witness room where his two sisters, brother and sister-in-law were
watching from 10 feet away through a plate glass window.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ''I love you all with all my heart and soul.''
</P>
<P>
   He then said, ''I forgive the state of Tennessee for murdering
me for something I did not do. I'm not guilty of this crime, and
that's the God's truth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Charlotte Stout, I forgive you, too, for helping the state
kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   His final words were: ''Forgive everyone. You all hear me? God
loves you. I'm gone. I'll see you in heaven. Bye, bye.''
</P>
<P>
   Coe is the 126th person executed by Tennessee since official
records began in 1916, the first since 1960 and the first ever by
lethal injection.

<HEADLINE> Hope, Pain on Columbine Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE GUTTERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The carpenter who last year erected
wooden crosses for the 15 victims of the Columbine High School
massacre returned to Colorado to restore the memorial as mourners
prepared to mark Thursday's anniversary of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Zanis wanted ''to honor the families of the victims,'' his
wife, Susan, said in an interview from their Aurora, Ill., home.
</P>
<P>
   His truck carried 13 crosses this time, in deference to one
victim's parents who had torn down the two crosses representing the
two student gunmen. Both boys committed suicide after the rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The April 20, 1999, massacre was the worst school shooting in
U.S. history, and it affected thousands of people worldwide who
watched on television as police circled the building and terrified
students fled the school, including one seen dropping from a
library window.
</P>
<P>
   At nearby Clement Park, where the crosses were erected after the
slayings, workers unloaded orange-and-white barricades Wednesday in
anticipation of thousands of mourners at a public memorial service
and a candlelight vigil planned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, victims' families organized memorial services to mark
the day, and officials prepared for a statewide moment of silence.
</P>
<P>
   The school itself remains off-limits to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Davadas Moses, a doctor from Loma Linda, Calif., in Denver on
business, tried to reach it Wednesday but was turned back by
security.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted to get a sense of it in my own mind,'' Moses
said as he walked through Clement Park.
</P>
<P>
   Many survivors, still coping with their grief, planned to stay
away from the services and the Littleton area Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine's attendance has dropped this week, with 263 of 1,885
students absent Tuesday, said school district spokeswoman Marilyn
Saltzman. Attendance was ''way down'' Wednesday but figures were
not available by midafternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the people I've talked to are trying to get as far
away from this place as possible -- the ones who were actually
there,'' said Karen Nielsen, who was working in the cafeteria when
the first shots rang out.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Blair, a Columbine senior who saw her friend Anne Marie
Hochhalter wounded, planned to spend the anniversary with her
family in a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody I know is going up to the mountains or trying to get
away for the day at least,'' Blair said. ''For some, it's an
emotional thing. Last year was so horrifying that they just can't
be anywhere near that place at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials expected a good number of students at the
private assembly. Classes are canceled for the day, and attendance
is not mandatory. Teddy bears sent in the wake of the shootings
were to be set out for students to take if they want.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Owens planned to lead a public service at the Capitol
in downtown Denver, including a statewide moment of silence at
11:21 a.m. MDT, the time the attack began.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Scott, whose daughter Rachel was killed, was to lead a
service at a nearby church that is expected to draw about 2,000
people, including victims' families. Other services were planned at
nearby churches and the gravesides of some victims.
</P>
<P>
   Nate Wooten, a freshman skateboarding during a break Wednesday,
said there was little talk about the anniversary among Columbine
students.
</P>
<P>
   ''They care, I know that,'' said his friend Brad Bootsma, a
sophomore. ''I guess they're just trying to go on with their lives.
I know I am.''

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Leader Backs AIDS Policy  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNA LOOF, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- In a letter to world leaders
published Wednesday, President Thabo Mbeki compared the criticism
of his AIDS policies to the censorship of political ideas under
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki also argued that since HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is
spread mostly through heterosexual contact in Africa, the
continent's problems are unique.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the West, HIV-AIDS is said to be largely homosexually
transmitted, it is reported that in Africa, including our country,
it is transmitted heterosexually,'' said the letter, dated April 3.
''Accordingly, as Africans, we have to deal with this uniquely
African catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said Wednesday that
Mbeki sent the letter to President Clinton and other world leaders
''to explain his position because the reports that have been in the
media have either been misleading or inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides detailing the country's efforts to battle the epidemic
that has infected one in 10 South Africans, Mbeki also defended
South Africa's contacts with scientists who argue that AIDS is not
caused by HIV, and that AZT, a medication commonly used to treat
AIDS, does more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not long ago, in our own country, people were killed,
tortured, imprisoned and prohibited from being quoted in private
and public because the established authority believed that their
views were dangerous and discredited,'' Mbeki wrote in the letter
made public Wednesday by the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are now being asked to do precisely the same thing that the
racist apartheid tyranny we opposed did, because it is said, there
exists a scientific view that is supported by the majority, against
which dissent is prohibited.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Mbeki believes that HIV causes AIDS, Mankahlana
said: ''You are asking me an irrelevant question that is not
important for me to answer.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in a parliamentary debate on AIDS Wednesday, South
Africa's Deputy President Jacob Zuma said Mbeki never said that
''he challenges the view that HIV causes AIDS, or the contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   ''All we are saying is that the issues must be debated and all
views are considered,'' he said in Cape Town. ''We should not, and
we will not, leave any stone unturned, even if this means including
the view of the so-called dissidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Zuma, who heads the government's anti-AIDS drive, said
broadening the debate had not stopped the government from
addressing the disease in accordance with mainstream scientific
practice.
</P>
<P>
   But others, such as Dr. Malegapuru Makgoba, president of South
Africa's Medical Research Council, said they were disappointed by
the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we are just creating (an image of) ourselves as an
embarrassment to the world,'' Makgoba said.
</P>
<P>
   Makgoba said government officials were undermining South
Africa's efforts to combat the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ''The scientific evidence about these issues is so clear that
one is really surprised that we spend so much time and energy
having a heated argument about something that is very
straightforward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was meant to mobilize international activism,
Mankahlana said.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy comes as South Africa is preparing for its role
as host to July's international AIDS 2000 conference, to be held in
Durban. South African and British media have reported that some
scientist might refuse to attend the conference.

<HEADLINE> Diet's Anti-Cancer Benefits Doubted  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two large studies cast doubt on the widely held belief that
eating low-fat, high-fiber food will lower the risk of colon
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Such a diet is recommended by health groups for many reasons,
but evidence of the anti-cancer benefit has been unclear.
</P>
<P>
   To help resolve doubts, researchers conducted two large
experiments, putting people on different diets and counting
potentially cancerous growths in their colons and rectums for up to
four years. The researchers were disappointed to find no apparent
effect from the low-fat, high-fiber diet or high-fiber supplements.
</P>
<P>
   The two new studies were published Thursday in The New England
Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Similar results were reported in a study published in the
journal in January 1999. That study tracked the colon and rectal
health of 88,757 women who participated in the Harvard-based Nurses
Health Study over 16 years. It found that the risk of cancer of the
same regardless of how much fiber the participants ate, and
researchers said they believed those findings apply to men as well.
</P>
<P>
   However, the issue is still not settled. Animal experiments and
some studies of large populations suggest that fruits, vegetables
and fiber do indeed help ward off such cancers. And even if they do
not, experts maintain that this kind of food clearly carries other
benefits, including preventing obesity, heart disease and possibly
some other kinds of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a case of choosing the disease you don't want to
get,'' said Melanie Polk, a dietitian at the American Institute of
Cancer Research in Washington. ''If we eat a diet that is high in
vegetables, fruits, grains and beans we ... will protect our
overall health.''
</P>
<P>
   About 130,000 cases of colon and rectal cancers were diagnosed
last year in the United States. About 56,600 people died from the
disease, which is second only to lung cancer in causing cancer
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   One of the new studies, conducted at the National Cancer
Institute and eight other health centers, watched 1,905 patients
for recurring adenomas, or polyps, which are precancerous growths
in the colon, or large intestine. One group of patients limited fat
to 20 percent of total calories and ate five to eight servings of
fruit or vegetables daily; a virtually identical group kept up its
usual eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   Polyps were removed from both groups at the start. Over four
years, they came back in 39 percent of patients in both groups. The
average number per patient and size were about the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very disappointing,'' said Dr. Arthur Schatzkin, a lead
researcher at the National Cancer Institute. ''A positive result
would have been a very strong statement.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second study, of 1,303 patients, University of Arizona
researchers also found no lower risk of colorectal cancer from a
diet heavy on a high-fiber, wheat-bran cereal.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have theorized that a low-fat, high-fiber diet
chemically neutralizes cancer agents, makes protective changes to
cells, or curtails bile acids that irritate intestinal lining and
promote polyps.
</P>
<P>
   The two new studies did not consider actual cancers partly
because doctors can readily remove polyps and do so under the
accepted standard of good medical care. If undetected, only 5 to 10
percent of polyps turn cancerous within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said low-fat, high-fiber diets could conceivably
act on colon cancer in the later stages of development. Such diets
may work only when eaten for more than just four years.
</P>
<P>
   However, in an accompanying editorial, Dr. Tim Byers, at the
University of Colorado School of Medicine, was not as hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ''There may be many reasons to eat a diet that is low in fat and
high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables ... but preventing colorectal
adenomas, at least for the first three or four years, is not one of
them,'' Byers said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Protests Causing Concern  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Protests by Indians, students and
landless farm workers have created security concerns for Brazil's
president, who has been appearing at festivities marking the 500th
anniversary of the arrival of Portuguese explorers.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Henrique Cardoso's schedule has been shortened and up
to 9,000 security agents have been assigned for his stay Saturday
in Porto Seguro, 500 miles northeast of Rio de Janeiro, where
explorer Pedro Alvares Cabral came ashore on April 22, 1500.
</P>
<P>
   The large and well-organized Landless Rural Workers Movement has
promised to occupy idle farm land across the country to call
attention to the need for agrarian reform. Farmers have threatened
to take unspecified action in response.
</P>
<P>
   Student groups were also stepping up protests against the
celebrations. Students marchers clashed with police Tuesday in
Fortaleza, 1,350 miles northeast of Rio. Five officers and one
demonstrator were injured.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 Indians were gathered in Porto Seguro to draw up a
letter outlining demands that will be presented to government
officials on Saturday. Leaders of some 200 tribes say they have
nothing to celebrate and that for Brazil's indigenous peoples the
500th anniversary is a ''day of mourning.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians say that as many as 5 million Indians inhabited
Brazil when the Europeans arrived. Today, their numbers have
dwindled to 330,000.

<HEADLINE> Passage rate high, turnout low in 2000 New Jersey school elections  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON (AP) -- Voters, at least those who showed up, approved a
record rate of school budgets, state education officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's passage rate was its highest ever, but voter turnout
continued to lag around New Jersey, according to statistics
released by the Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   This year's 88 percent pass rate surpassed the previous high of
86.5 percent in 1985, and represents the highest rate since records
were first kept in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   But only 12.5 percent of registered voters turned out to select
school board members and decide the fate of 553 school budgets that
carry an estimated total value of $14 billion, according to
education officials.
</P>
<P>
   Education Commissioner David Hespe attributed the high pass rate
to the state's strong economy and to an increase in state aid for
New Jersey's public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But he was disappointed at the low turnout, which may have been
dampened by Tuesday's rainy weather.
</P>
<P>
   He said voter turnout was at an ''unacceptably low level.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Too many citizens choose each year not to participate in the
annual school elections. When more people vote, we have a sharper
view of how they wish to spend local taxes on their schools.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the base budgets, voters approved 74.3 percent,
or 81 of 109, of so-called second ballot questions. The questions
ask voters to approve appropriations for specific items whose costs
exceed state growth limits.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Belluscio, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards
Association agreed with Hespe that the healthy economy led most
voters to pull ''yes'' levers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Undeniably the economy played a role. The whole climate makes
people open to public spending,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Voters also responded to tighter budgets, Belluscio said. About
83 percent of the budgets were proposed below state spending
limits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''School boards learned a lot during the lean years of the early
1990s when taxpayers were feeling the pinch,'' he said. ''Districts
are holding the line and voters realized that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hespe and Gov. Christie Whitman renewed their call for school
elections to be moved to November, at the same time as the general
election. Supporters say such a move would generate greater voter
interest and participation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Local tax rates and the quality of education are too important
to be left up to a tiny minority of voters,'' Whitman said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Won't Attend N.Y. Fund Raiser  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The head of New York's Conservative Party
said Wednesday that George W. Bush will not attend its May 17
fund-raiser where he was to have been the main speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Party Chairman Michael Long blamed the change on a scheduling
conflict. He had announced last month that Bush would attend the
annual dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Long also said the change was unrelated to a rift between him
and New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Bush's favored candidate in
the New York Senate race with Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He said Karl Rove, a top Bush adviser, had assured him that
Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, would attend
a Conservative Party event in June or July.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are considering a later date. We're taking a look at the
schedule,'' said Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Long is courting alternatives to Giuliani to run on the
Conservative Party line in large part because of the mayor's
support for abortion rights. No Republican has won statewide office
in New York without Conservative Party backing since 1974. Unlike
other states, New York allows major party candidates to also run on
third-party ballot lines and add all of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Conservative Party dinner presents several problems for
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helping raise money that the party could use to
back another candidate over Giuliani, the dinner comes as Bush is
seeking to move toward the political middle in preparation for the
general election against Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Long said none of that would keep Bush away.
</P>
<P>
   Not having the Conservative Party line could complicate things
for Bush in the state. Democrats enjoy a 5-to-3 edge in enrollment
and no GOP presidential candidate has carried the state since
Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984.

<HEADLINE> IRA Cites British 'Lack of Will'  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The IRA offered no hint in its
annual Easter statement on Wednesday that it would ever disarm, and
instead blamed Britain for upsetting Northern Ireland's 2-year-old
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army did not mention disarmament,
the issue that has brought political progress in this British-ruled
territory to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was being scrutinized by the British and Irish
governments for signs of new thinking by the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart,
Bertie Ahern, plan to meet Thursday in London to discuss a new
initiative for breaking the deadlock. Blair spent much of Tuesday
in Northern Ireland trying to win new commitments from local
parties, particularly the IRA-linked Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   The former chairman of the peace talks, retired U.S. Sen. George
Mitchell, said it was his ''hope and prayer'' that Blair and Ahern
could find some formula for promoting disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, making a speech Wednesday at St. Andrew's University
in Scotland, said the issue had ''plagued the talks from the
start.'' He didn't offer any specific recommendations for resolving
the current impasse.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA's 14-paragraph statement -- due to be read aloud this
weekend at rallies of IRA supporters across Ireland -- stuck to
traditional themes of defiance and blame.
</P>
<P>
   It declared that Britain had been wrong in February to suspend
the powers of Northern Ireland's joint Catholic-Protestant
administration after 11 weeks in office.
</P>
<P>
   ''The British government's unilateral decision to collapse the
political institutions in February highlights a lack of political
will to bring about meaningful change,'' the IRA said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain at the time insisted it had to resume direct rule of
Northern Ireland or the province's major Protestant party, the
Ulster Unionists, would have withdrawn from the administration,
triggering its irreparable collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell in November persuaded the Ulster Unionists to work
alongside Sinn Fein and two other parties within the long-delayed
coalition. The terms of the deal required the IRA begin disarming
in response, but the IRA refused.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's statement the IRA indicated that its 1997
cease-fire -- halting a 27-year campaign to destabilize Northern
Ireland as a Protestant-majority state -- was all the group would
have to offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Good Friday accord of 1998 proposed a Catholic-Protestant
administration in Northern Ireland that would take many
responsibilities away from the British government, which assumed
direct control of the province in 1972.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Costs Hit Airlines Earnings  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Higher fuel costs dragged down earnings at major air
carriers in
the first quarter, but UAL Corp. reported a slight increase in
operating profits on a jump in passenger traffic. Trans World
Airlines reported a wider operating loss and America West had lower
earnings. Meanwhile, American Airlines bounced back from a
troubling quarter a year ago that was hurt by a pilot job action.
UAL Corp.:
<TEXT>
<P>
   A surge of passengers last month enabled United Airlines' parent
company, UAL Corp., to post a 2 percent increase in operating
profits in the first quarter despite a jump in fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 percent jump in passenger revenue in March compared with
a year ago resulted in earnings that exceeded Wall Street
expectations. Shares in the Chicago-based carrier rose 2 percent,
$1.37{ a share, to $58.12{ in trading at 4:30 p.m. on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding one-time charges and certain compensation expenses,
the world's largest airline earned $191 million, or $1.61 per
share, up from $187 million, or $1.54 per share, in the
year-earlier period. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson
Financial had pegged earnings at $1.37 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues grew 9 percent to $4.55 billion from $4.16 billion
thanks to the late-quarter rise in passengers and higher fares, an
industrywide move aimed at compensating for fuel costs that rose 37
percent due to higher crude oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Counting the effects of a $209 million accounting charge and
other one-off items, UAL posted a net loss of $99 million or $1.18
a share. In the same period a year ago, the company reported net
earnings of $78 million, or 44 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Candace Browning, an analyst for Merrill Lynch, called UAL's
showing ''spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The revenue growth was stronger than anyone expected,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   United does face some daunting challenges in the near future,
however. Separate negotiations with both its pilots and machinists
are expected to result in sharply higher wages and mean United is
likely to have significantly greater labor costs than its
competitors this year.
</P>
<P>
   United also finished last in a recent annual ranking of airline
quality based on consumer complaints to the U.S. Department of
Transportation.
Trans World Airlines Inc.:
</P>
<P>
   Light traffic over the New Year's period and rising fuel costs
resulted in a wider first-quarter loss at TWA.
</P>
<P>
   TWA posted a net loss of $76.1 million or $1.16 a share versus
$21.6 million or 42 cents a share in the same period a year ago.
Revenues rose to $809 million from $765 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like our competitors, TWA also was heavily impacted by
increased fuel costs in the quarter,'' president William F. Compton
said. ''However, we recently have seen improvement in our revenue,
including improved yield, largely due to more efficient utilization
of our revitalized fleet and changes in our route structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Passenger revenue, which accounts for the vast majority of the
company's revenue, rose to $723.6 million, up from $681.1 million
in the first quarter last year. But TWA's fuel costs rose to $140.4
million, up from $72.6 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, with hubs in St. Louis and at New York's Kennedy
Airport, has not turned an annual profit since 1988. In 1999, TWA
lost $353.4 million, or $5.58 per share.
</P>
<P>
   TWA shares were unchanged at $1.87{ at 4:30 p.m. on the American
Stock Exchange.
America West Holdings Corp.:
</P>
<P>
   America West reported a 44 percent drop in first-quarter
earnings due to higher fuel prices and operating problems early in
the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Tempe, Ariz.-based America West Holdings Corp., parent
company of the airline and a travel package arm called The Leisure
Co., reported earnings of $14.6 million, or 40 cents a share, in
the three months ending March 31, compared with $25.9 million, or
63 cents a share, during the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the 71 percent increase in fuel costs, America West
Airlines also suffered two major problems that forced flight
cancelations and other delays.
</P>
<P>
   The airline was forced to cancel more than 280 flights on Feb.
17 and Feb. 18 and stranded hundreds of passengers after its
automated flight management system shut down for five hours. The
computer system provides flight plans, weather reports and other
information for flight crews.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers stuck at airports overnight also complained about the
treatment they received from airline employees. The airline
eventually took out full page ads to apologize to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   In the first week of March, unusually severe storms in Phoenix,
one of the airline's hubs, and bad weather in other key markets
forced the cancelation of another 270 flights and additional
delays.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues rose to $563 million compared with $520 million.
</P>
<P>
   America West shares rose 50 cents to $15 in trading at 4:30 p.m.
on the New York Stock Exchange.
US Airways Group:
</P>
<P>
   Higher fuel costs coupled with labor problems with flight
attendants led to a $218 million net loss at US Airways in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding a one-time charge related to accounting for revenues
from frequent flyer partners, the Arlington, Va.-based carrier lost
$115 million, or $1.72 per share. US Airways earned $46 million, or
56 cents per share, in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues edged up 1.7 percent to $2.1 billion from $2.07
billion.
</P>
<P>
   President and chief executive Rakesh Gangwal said the company
had put its problems ''largely behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of aviation fuel during the first quarter rose from
43.27 cents per gallon last year to 88.81 cents per gallon this
year, causing fuel costs for the quarter to shoot up to $274
million from $129 million.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, the nation's sixth-largest, concluded a lengthy
labor dispute with its 10,000 flight attendants last month,
averting a strike and potential shutdown. The number of passengers
dropped 1.5 percent for the quarter, largely because of uncertainty
over whether the airline would shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators agreed to a five-year contract on March 25. Flight
attendants vote May 1 on the agreement, which would guarantee
raises totaling 10 percent. The airline said the agreement would
bring labor costs in line with major competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Company shares rose $2.06\, or 8 percent, to $27.62{ in trading
at 4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
AMR Corp.:
</P>
<P>
   AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, said Wednesday that
stronger ticket sales and higher prices raised first-quarter
profits from continuing operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth-based airline indicated that its jet fuel costs
soared 58.5 percent to $553 million from a year ago, but officials
said they avoided even greater increases by buying fuel at lower
prices under advance-purchase deals.
</P>
<P>
   Profit figures looked especially good by comparison with losses
a year ago, when American lost an estimated $225 million in the
first quarter last year when a sickout by disgruntled pilots caused
the cancellation of about 6,600 flights.
</P>
<P>
   AMR said it earned $89 million, or 57 cents a share, from
continuing operations in the first quarter, beating the 40 cents
per share expected by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
   The company restated its year-ago earnings to exclude earnings
from Sabre Holdings Corp., a travel-reservation system that AMR
spun off to shareholders on March 15. The restated year-ago
earnings showed a loss of $2 million, or 1 cent per share, on
continuing operations.
</P>
<P>
   Including discontinued operations and one-time items, AMR earned
$132 million, or 89 cents per share, down from $158 million, or 99
cents per share in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   AMR, which also operates the American Eagle commuter carrier,
said revenues were $4.58 billion, up 14.2 percent from $4 billion a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''What you're really seeing in the numbers is just better
fundamentals from a strong economy, which has led to strong demand
for our product, and a relatively healthy pricing environment,''
said Tom Horton, AMR's chief financial officer and a senior vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   AMR shares were up 62{ cents to $34.50 on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> DiFrancesco seeks faster preservation on threatened land  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- With $5 million on hand, the state could
swoop in and save environmentally sensitive lands that might be
lost in the time it now takes to acquire open space, Senate
President Donald T. DiFrancesco said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   So DiFrancesco proposed a ''quick strike'' fund to cut around
routine procedures and purchase sensitive forests, meadows and
wildlife areas that are facing an immediate threat of being
developed.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco's plan would allow the Department of Environmental
Protection to buy the land without prior approval from the
Legislature. To get that approval now takes six to 18 months,
according to DiFrancesco.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups from across the state praised the measure
and joined DiFrancesco, R-Union, at a statehouse news conference to
detail his bill creating the Conservation Action Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only will this bill save open space and allow government
to work quicker to buy land, it will also save taxpayers money,''
said Jeff Tittle, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra
Club.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, approximately 6,000 acres of ''critical''
lands went up for sale in the Highlands in the northern part of the
state, and in central New Jersey, Tittle said. But many of the
parcels were sold off before they could be preserved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some land was bought by the state and other groups, but by then
property costs were ''two to three times'' the earlier lots, Tittle
said. This fund would allow land to be bought while prices are
still low, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to go out there and buy land to save open space for
future generations,'' Tittle said.
</P>
<P>
   The fund could also be used to enable the state to seize
discount opportunities because of tax auctions or mortgage
forfeiture sales.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way New Jersey will win the open space race is by
moving forward quickly using the Garden State Preservation Trust
Fund and by adopting new and creative tools like the Conservation
Action Fund,'' said Michele Byers, director of the New Jersey
Conservation Foundation, in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   All lands acquired through this fund must be approved first by
the Garden State Preservation Trust. The trust must also notify
municipalities to collect local input on the purchase, under the
terms of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Money for the fund comes from the same act that created the
preservation trust.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco said the state must ''maximize, not miss, the
opportunity to conserve and protect our dwindling open space
resources.''

<HEADLINE> Reno Back in Hot Seat With Elian  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was April 19, and Janet Reno was back in
the hot seat Wednesday as a federal appeals court dumped the tough
issue of who cares for 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez back into her lap.
</P>
<P>
   On her first April 19 as attorney general, in 1993, the Branch
Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, burned after an FBI tear gas
assault she ordered; some 80 people died there. Two years later on
the same date, two men angered by Waco bombed the Oklahoma City
federal building, killing 168 in the most deadly terrorist attack
in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Reno was flying to help dedicate a memorial to the Oklahoma City
dead on Wednesday when the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ordered her Justice Department to keep Elian in this country while
it considers an appeal by his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Those relatives are Cuban exiles who fled Fidel Castro. They
have cared for Elian since he was found in the Atlantic last
Thanksgiving after the ship on which his mother escaped from Cuba
sank, carrying her and 10 others to their deaths. Now, the
relatives are defying Reno's order to turn him over to his father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who came to this country to take his son back
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   On landing at Oklahoma City, Reno noted that the Justice
Department and Juan Miguel had earlier agreed to keep Elian here
until the appeals court ruled. But the court in Atlanta did not
address the separate, more immediately volatile issue of who has
custody on Elian in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court order does not preclude me from placing Elian in his
father's care while he stays in the United States,'' Reno said.
''It does not disagree with my determination; it does not say that
the boy cannot be reunited with his father.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Justice officials ''are still reviewing the court's
decision. ... We are going to consider all our options and take the
course of action that we deem appropriate under the
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several options open to Reno, but she gave some clues
to her thinking at her weekly news conference in Washington earlier
in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our major focus has got to be to see that the law is enforced
and that he is returned and reunited'' with his father,'' Reno
said. ''I am dead set and determined to do it the right way, the
safest way, the least violent way and the soonest way I possibly
can under the law.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was willing to use force to extract the boy from
his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez's house and the crowd of hundreds
of angry Cuban exiles surrounding it but only ''when there is no
other alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel's attorney, Gregory Craig, demanded Wednesday
afternoon that she act immediately to end Elian's stay in what
Craig and a pediatrician working for the government called an
abusive environment.
</P>
<P>
   She could do that now. Aides have described a sketchy plan to
use U.S. marshals and immigration agents in minimum force and
civilian clothes, with no drawn guns to go to the house to get
Elian. But the crowd of exiles motivated by hatred of Castro has
vowed to form a human chain to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   She also could appeal the injunction issued by the three 11th
Circuit judges to the full circuit panel or to the Supreme Court,
but she and Juan Miguel have already agreed to it.
</P>
<P>
   Reno could ask a federal court to reinforce her order to Lazaro
to give up the boy, but she already asked the 11th Circuit to do
that and those three judges declined to get into that question at
this time. Justice officials say her order has the force of law
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   She could also delay acting as she did when Lazaro refused to
obey her order to turn the boy over to immigration officers at 2
p.m. last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit encouraged Reno and the Miami relatives to
voluntarily submit their dispute to the court's mediation service.
She could do that or just wait in the hope that time, circumstances
or even a ruling in May by the appeals court change the atmosphere
in the streets around Lazaro's house or persuade Lazaro and his
family to voluntarily relinquish the boy or to negotiate a peaceful
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   She bristled Wednesday when a reporter asked if memory of the
Waco deaths had stayed her hand too long in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each case is different,'' Reno said. ''In Waco, you had people
who had killed federal officers and who had injured others. There's
a lot of difference.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said: ''If the criticism of me is that I'm trying to
avoid that little boy being hurt or being snatched in a way that
can scar him further, I plead guilty. But at the same time ... I'm
going to enforce the law.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls Memorial Site 'Sacred'  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- On a day of sad memories, President Clinton
knelt among 168 empty chairs Wednesday memorializing each victim of
the Oklahoma City bombing and declared the site ''sacred ground''
in the soul of America.
</P>
<P>
   ''America is still with you,'' the president said. ''With this
memorial, you can know that America will never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years after the deadliest terrorist attack in U.S. history,
Clinton helped dedicate the Oklahoma City National Memorial at the
site where a bomb ripped off the face of the Alfred P. Murrah
Federal Building and killed 19 children and 149 men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, speaking before the president,
said: ''To all the people of Oklahoma City, thank you for showing
America how to stand up to evil, to the evil that spawned that
blast from hell. You have helped us renew our spirit and our love
of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the nine-story building once stood, 168 bronze and stone
chairs stand on glass bases on a grassy slope. Each base is etched
with the name of a victim. The chairs of the 19 children are
smaller than the others.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial is anchored on opposite ends by four-story Gates of
Time, one emblazoned ''9:01'' and the other ''9:03'' for the
moments immediately before and after the 9:02 a.m. bombing. Clinton
gazed across a long, black granite reflecting pool to the 9:03
gateway and knelt to wet his fingers in the water.
</P>
<P>
   He walked among the chairs with relatives of the victims. The
chairs were piled high with flowers, balloons and American flags.
Clinton paused with Jeannine Gist at the chair memorializing her
daughter, Karen Gist Carr. He knelt at another chair and fixed a
toppled bucket of flowers. He also stopped with Doris Jones and
stroked the bronze back of a chair honoring her daughter, Carrie
Anne Lenz and her unborn child.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd assembled at the memorial ceremony cheered when
Clinton arrived but the mood of the event was somber. Police
officers turned down the volume of their radios. The invocation,
however, was interrupted by a siren from a nearby street that
blared like those that sounded for hours the day of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are places in our national landscape so scarred by
freedom's sacrifice that they shape forever the soul of America,''
the president said. ''Valley Forge. Gettysburg. Selma. This place
is such sacred ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Remembering the victims, Clinton said, ''Five years ago, the
cowards who killed them made a choice -- a choice to attack this
building and the people in it because they wanted to strike a blow
at America's heartland -- at the core of our nation's being. This
was an attack on all America and every American.''
</P>
<P>
   Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were convicted in federal
court in the attack. McVeigh has been sentenced to death; Nichols
is serving a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Five years later,'' Clinton said, ''we are here because you
made a choice -- a choice to choose hope and love over despair and
hatred. ... I know there are still days when the old anger wells up
inside you, still days when tears fill your eyes, when you think
your heart will surely break.
</P>
<P>
   ''On those days in the future, I hope you can come here and find
solace in the memory of your loved ones and the honor of your
fellow citizens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope you can find the strength to live a full and loving
life, free of hatred which only cripples. I believe your loved ones
would want you to have that life,'' the president said. ''And
though you have given too much, you still have so much to give.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that ''we may never have all the answers to what
happened here. But as we continue our journey toward understanding,
one truth is clear: What was meant to break (us) has made you
stronger.''

<HEADLINE> State cracks down on campaign accounts for omitting keyinformation  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- In campaign fund-raising, the big money is
the soft money. The big money also is the area ripest for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   And in the past 10 months, the state agency charged with
monitoring fund-raising and the integrity of public reports on soft
money has started to crack down on the political committees that
collect it, fining them $35,900 for failing to give complete
information about what their donors do for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money contributions are given to a political party rather
than to an individual candidate, and the normal limit of $1,800 a
year does not apply.
</P>
<P>
   A 1993 New Jersey law made an attempt to at least control soft
money, which at the federal level flows without limit or
accountability. The state law allowed the political parties to each
form three fund-raising committees, six total, and it capped
donations on a scale that currently is $30,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But this cap is more of a loophole than a rule. Someone wishing
to donate to the GOP, for instance, has three committees to choose
from and can give $30,000 to each. Then the person's spouse and
children can donate.
</P>
<P>
   It is legally possible for a single donor with the help of a
spouse and child to give $180,000 a year -- and then create a
political fund that gives even more to the same committees. That's
not even including business partners or employees.
</P>
<P>
   So far no one has needed all that many loopholes. ELEC's recent
penalties covered donations received in 1995 and 1996, a period
when the most generous donor, financier Finn Casperson and his
family, gave $148,000 to Republicans over two years.
</P>
<P>
   The committee fined most recently is the most affluent of them
all, the campaign account operated by the Republican State
Committee, ordered last week to pay $10,950. By agreeing to pay
early and not to appeal, they got a $2,175 discount.
</P>
<P>
   The largest fine to be handed down came in October when the
Democratic State Committee was fined $15,175. ELEC forgave $3,160
for settlement and early payment.
</P>
<P>
   All of the violations were for essentially the same thing --
providing partial information that in fact rendered the contributor
reports relatively meaningless. The parties' lawyers called them
all trivial oversights not worth the cost or bother to file an
appeal, but ELEC director Frederick Herrmann and other experts on
campaign finance did not agree.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is important for the public to understand where the money
is coming from and where it is going,'' Herrmann said. ''They are
bringing money in from private interests and the public has a right
to know that.''
</P>
<P>
   ELEC in the past issued hundreds of fines mainly against small,
local violators for such things as failing to file reports or
filing them late. The agency has been criticized for ignoring the
big soft-money committees even after news organizations, including
The Associated Press, reported on significant patterns of
violations.
</P>
<P>
   On the national scene, no one watches the ebb and flow of
political money more closely than the nonpartisan, nonprofit Center
for Responsive Politics. Its director, Larry Makinson, applauded
the New Jersey agency for taking a step regulators of the Federal
Elections Commission appear reluctant to take.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be shocking if the FEC ever did something as
aggressive as that,'' Makinson said. ''It brings attention to the
problem. If party committees are not fully identifying their
donors, the people can't track who the politicians are thankful to.
That is absolutely essential.''
</P>
<P>
   Omitting occupational details or employer addresses ''is not
trivial,'' Makinson said. ''If you don't have disclosure, full
disclosure, you don't have anything. ... This money is not given
free and clear. This money is given often with expectation of
something in return.''
</P>
<P>
   Herrmann denied that his agency has been sluggish. ''We have
always paid attention to them. There is a tremendous amount to
review in those committees. We are talking about millions and
millions of dollars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And while ELEC is traditionally quiet about its investigations
and does not publicize its enforcement actions, Herrmann
acknowledged this scrutiny of these largest of all campaign
committees shall continue. ''In many ways those committees, because
of the amounts of money that are being raised, will be ones the
commission is always looking at,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This year the state fund-raising issue is secondary as the focus
is on federal elections, although the state committees can do
so-called ''party building'' work and spend money on county and
local candidates in ways that also help congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But in 2001, with the governor and the full Senate and Assembly
up for re-election in new districts adjusted by the census, it is
hard to envision an issue more crucial than this.

<HEADLINE> Annan: UN May Fortify Lebanon Force  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
Wednesday the United Nations may need to strengthen its
peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon to monitor the Israeli
pullout in early July.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters he is sending his Middle East envoy, Terje
Roed Larsen, to Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt and Israel next week
to discuss the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council on Wednesday held private discussions on a
statement which would give Annan the official go-ahead to start
preparing for the pullout.
</P>
<P>
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and has occupied part of southern
Lebanon since 1985 as a buffer against guerrilla attacks on
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Security Council resolutions call for Israel's withdrawal from
Lebanon and the establishment of a U.N. peacekeeping force to
confirm the pullout. They also call for U.N. troops to restore
peace to the region and help the Lebanese government regain its
authority in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has pledged to withdraw
Israeli troops from Lebanon by July, preferably as part of an
agreement with Lebanon and Syria but unilaterally if necessary.
Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon. Talks between Israel and
Syria, however, have stalled since January over Syria's demand for
a total withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Israel believes the U.N. force, now numbering about 4,500
troops, will be enough to patrol the Israel-Lebanon border if
expanded to its full mandate of 7,000 soldiers, a senior Israeli
official said recently, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But the secretary-general said the United Nations has not
determined how many troops will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may need to strengthen the force,'' he said. ''We are doing
our contingency planning. We will factor in the information Larsen
brings back and then make proposals to the council.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel officially informed the United Nations of its planned
withdrawal by July 7 on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Appeals for Innocent Iraqis  </HEADLINE>
By HASSAN ABDULWAHAB, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASRA, Iraq (AP) -- A U.S. lawmaker assessing the impact of U.N.
sanctions on Iraq said Wednesday it is important not only to force
Baghdad to give up its weapons of mass destruction but also to do
more to ease the hardships on ordinary Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, did not call for a lifting of sanctions
imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, but said the
United Nations should make sure that sanctions do not hurt innocent
Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very, very important'' to compel Iraq to rid itself of
weapons of mass destruction so that ''it cannot use or export them
to other countries,'' he told Associated Press Television News.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted the international community can do a much better
job in helping Iraq deal with its economic and health problems.
</P>
<P>
   One way would be to speed up the flow of health supplies and
other urgent commodities to the country under a U.N. humanitarian
program, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq says the United States and Britain hold up delivery of
needed supplies, using their clout in the United Nations. The U.S.
government says it wants to ensure that Iraq is not buying items
that appear to be humanitarian in nature but that could be used for
making weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq claims about 1.2 million people, including 750,000 children
under age 5, have died during the last 10 years, and blames the
deaths on shortages caused by sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The United States says President Saddam Hussein could have
avoided the hardships by helping U.N. weapons inspectors eliminate
all illegal weapons -- a primary condition laid down by the U.N.
Security Council for lifting the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he agreed that Iraq should give up its weapons of mass
destruction, the global community should ''do a much better (job)
in helping the people here that are hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the 1970s and 1980s malnutrition was not in this country.
They did not have cholera. They did not have bad water. They had an
infrastructure that was decent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who is on a four-day tour of Iraq, spent two days in the
south, visiting several cities including Basra, which bore the
brunt of Iraq's 1980-88 war with Iran and the 1991 Persian Gulf War
over Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting a maternity and children's hospital in the southern
city of Babylon on Tuesday, he saw first hand the overcrowding in
the hospital where many beds were shared by two children. Doctors
told him about the rampant malnutrition among the children admitted
at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world can do much better with Iraq healthwise, toward the
economy ... with the children. It is very hard to see children that
are malnourished,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he will report his findings to Congress. He is
scheduled to leave Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Gephardt To Oppose China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID SCOTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said
Wednesday he will speak on the floor and one-on-one with House
members about his opposition to a bill granting permanent
normalized trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been talking to members about this issue,'' Gephardt,
D-Mo., said in formally announcing his plan to vote against the
measure. ''I've been telling them what I think about the issue and
will continue to do that actively.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's opposition to the bill puts him at odds with the
White House, Republican Congressional leaders hoping for a
bipartisan vote, and the presumptive presidential nominees of both
parties, Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In his 25-minute speech to supporters, Gephardt said the United
States should not trust the Chinese government to improve human
rights practices on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Voting annually to grant China trading rights that the U.S.
extends to almost every other country ''is the best single yearly
spotlight on the behavior of the Chinese government,'' Gephardt
said.
</P>
<P>
   A House vote on the issue is expected to be close when it's
taken next month.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Commerce Secretary William Daley said the
administration is ''hopeful'' that Gephardt's statements won't
discourage other House Democrats from supporting the trade deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''There should be no sort of litmus test for Democrats on this
issue,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   When word of Gephardt's decision became public earlier in the
week, a Democratic official said Gephardt wasn't expected to join a
full-fledged effort to defeat it.

<HEADLINE> East Timor Militia Trials Scheduled  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The first militia leaders accused of
serious crimes in East Timor are expected to be brought to trial
before international and East Timorese judges by June or July, a
senior U.N. official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The trials will be among the first for East Timor's nascent
judiciary, which was created by the U.N. administration running
East Timor as one of the cornerstones of its transition to
independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   East Timorese courts are handling prosecutions independently of
Indonesian investigations into abuses committed by the Indonesian
armed forces before and during the wave of violence in the
territory after its independence vote Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   However, Indonesia has agreed to transfer suspected militia
members to the East Timorese courts.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-Indonesian militias backed by the military went on a rampage
to protest the ballot results, killing more than 250 people,
demolishing thousands of homes and buildings and sending tens of
thousands of refugees fleeing into neighboring West Timor. The
destruction ended with the arrival of international troops in
September.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. administration so far has appointed 23 East Timorese
judges and prosecutors and a pool of defense attorneys to handle
court cases, said the deputy legal adviser to the U.N.
administration, Hansjoerg Strohmeyer.
</P>
<P>
   So far about 65 people have been detained. About 20 of them are
militia members who will come before a special panel of two
international judges and one East Timorese judge hearing cases
alleging genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, torture,
serious sexual offenses and murder, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the East Timorese legal officials all have law degrees,
none have any prosecutorial or judicial experience because
Indonesia only appointed Indonesian officials to those posts during
its 25-year occupation of the former Portuguese colony, Strohmeyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court with similar international participation would
hear challenges to the lower court's ruling, Strohmeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Verdicts won't necessarily be reached by June or July, but the
hearings can start by then, he said. In addition, the U.N.
peacekeeping force has gathered so much evidence that ''some of the
cases are, one would say, almost watertight. They don't need long
or lengthy investigations,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bristol-Myers Squibb puts highly touted blood pressure pill onhold  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bristol-Myers Squibb is delaying by at least a
year the launch of its experimental hypertension drug Vanlev, which
has been touted as a better way to control blood pressure and was
expected to be the industry's next blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the New York-based-based company plunged 22 percent on
the news. The company's research headquarters are in Princeton,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers made the surprising decision on Wednesday after
the Food and Drug Administration raised safety concerns that the
pill might cause severe swelling in the face, throat and lips.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't have been more shocked,'' said Barbara Ryan, a
managing director at Deutsche Bank in New York. ''The fact that
it's delayed is going to put a lot of questions in physicians'
minds. ... It puts the growth rate of the company in question.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ryan said, the stock plunge leaves shares ''grossly
undervalued right now, and I would be a buyer,'' expecting the
price to move up modestly and recover within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Vanlev has been studied in nearly 7,000 patients, with some
staying on the drug up to two years, Bristol-Myers said. A little
more than 1 percent of patients experienced the swelling problem,
including four patients who needed to have a tube inserted down
their throat because they had trouble breathing, the company said.
All four survived.
</P>
<P>
   While the swelling problem, known as angioedema, is a rare side
effect of some blood pressure drugs, the FDA seemed more concerned
with the severe cases in which intubations were needed, the company
said. The swelling problem was mainly seen in black people, it
added.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA had been reviewing the drug since December and had been
expected to approve it by June.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers now says it will conduct more studies on the drug,
and wait until early next year to reapply for federal approval.
</P>
<P>
   ''We remain bullish on this drug,'' said Richard Lane, the
president of the company's Worldwide Medicines Group. ''We hope to
show the four cases of severe angioedema were statistical
anomalies, and not a signal of increased risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The swelling problems occurred with patients shortly after they
started taking the pill, the company said. As a result, the company
will look into starting patients on a lower dosage to reduce the
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Butler, senior pharmaceutical and biotechnology analyst at
Lehman Brothers in New York, said that if that strategy works and
the data Bristol-Myers presents next year to the FDA show that
Vanlev doesn't have worse side effects than existing hypertension
drugs, Vanlev's sales potential might not be diminished.
</P>
<P>
   The company has gone to great lengths to promote Vanlev in the
past year, including touting the results of earlier studies.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had estimated Vanlev could make more than $2 billion in
sales by 2004, projecting it would be the company's top-selling
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers was counting on Vanlev sales to make up for
falling sales of its current top drug, Pravachol, a
cholesterol-lowering pill. It also was hoping that revenues from
Vanlev would help offset anticipated lower sales of its cancer drug
Taxol, which is facing patent challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Investors responded by pushing shares of Bristol-Myers down
$14.50, or 22 percent, to $50.62{ on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you have it, hold it,'' Butler said, adding that he would
only recommend buying the stock now for the long term. While he
considers Bristol-Myers well-managed, Butler noted that just five
weeks ago the company withdrew another FDA drug application, for a
treatment for advanced colorectal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The delay with Vanlev also gives a boost to rival Pfizer Inc.,
which makes Norvasc, the top-selling hypertension drug. Norvasc had
sales last year of more than $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Pfizer rose $1.81\ to $41.37{, also on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   Vanlev was designed to simultaneously inhibit two key enzymes
which regulate blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   At a medical meeting last fall, studies found Vanlev
outperformed two mainstays of blood pressure control, a top-selling
ACE inhibitor and a calcium-channel blocker.
</P>
<P>
   Vanlev appeared to do a better job of lowering both systolic and
diastolic pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Systolic is the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats,
while diastolic is the pressure between beats. Systolic is the
first and larger of the two numbers. Ideal blood pressure is less
than 140 over 90.
</P>
<P>
   Like standard ACE inhibitors, Vanlev blocks angiotensin
converting enzyme, which raises blood pressure. However, the
medicine also stops another enzyme called neutral endopeptidase. By
doing this, the medicine protects the body's supply of other
helpful substances that make blood vessels relax and prevent
dangerous overgrowth of heart muscle.
</P>
<P>
   High blood pressure affects more than 600 million people
worldwide. Three of four people with high blood pressure in the
United States are not at or below the recommended target goal,
which puts them at increased risk of heart attack, stroke, heart
failure, and kidney disease.

<HEADLINE> Suspect in Washington state slaying is former Fort Drum soldier  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WATERTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- The arrest of a National Guard helicopter
pilot in Washington state in the death of a prostitute has prompted
speculation that law enforcement officers might have cracked a
serial killer case.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel like we've arrested the person responsible for up to
18 prostitute homicides in our community,'' Sterk told reporters
about an hour after Robert L. Yates Jr., 47, was charged with
first-degree murder in the slaying of 16-year-old Jennifer Joseph,
whose body was found Aug. 26, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Police are investigating the Yates, a former soldier at Fort
Drum, might have been involved in other killings, including one in
Watertown a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yates, a married father of five children, was arrested Tuesday
morning as he drove to work and was booked into the Spokane County
Jail for investigation of first-degree murder in the death of one
woman.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the deaths of 18 women since 1990, most of them
prostitutes, remain unsolved, Spokane County sheriff's spokesman
Dave Reagan said. Authorities say 10 of those deaths, in 1997 and
1998, are the work of a single killer. The other eight might be
victims of the same killer, but evidence is not conclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Yates is a pilot with the Washington Army National Guard's 66th
Aviation Brigade, which trains once a month at Fort Lewis, near
Tacoma, spokesman Lt. Col. Rick Patterson said. Two of the serial
killer victims were found in the Tacoma area.
</P>
<P>
   Yates also had a career in the U.S. Army and was a commercial
pilot licensed to fly transport planes or helicopters, Army and
Federal Aviation Administration records show.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities hope to compare blood samples from Yates with DNA
evidence collected from some of the serial killer victims.
</P>
<P>
   Watertown Police Detective Sgt. Gary Comins said Wednesday that
Yates was not yet a suspect in the unsolved murder of Tina Hosmer
Smith. She was found dead on a Watertown street in the summer of
1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, we're waiting on word from Spokane,'' Comins
said. ''We won't know if he's a suspect until we can get a timeline
on him to help us. We're trying to determine the exact time period
he was at Fort Drum. We don't have exact dates.''
</P>
<P>
   According to federal files obtained by the Associated Press,
Yates had a Watertown address from January to August of 1990. Over
all, he had addresses in the Fort Drum area from March 1989 through
June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Yates was taken into custody as he drove to his job as a
replacement worker at a Kaiser Aluminum Corp. smelter. He was hired
in December 1998 as a strikebreaker after workers at the plant
walked off the job.
</P>
<P>
   Officers on Tuesday searched areas of the smelter and also
seized the vehicle he was driving, along with a vehicle that Yates
recently sold to another man.

<HEADLINE> Dissent shareholders want to take control of Dairy Mart  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WINDSOR, Conn. (AP) -- A group of dissident stockholders, citing
more than $30 million in losses over the past several years, said
Wednesday it will seek to replace the board of directors of
Ohio-based Dairy Mart Convenience Stores.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which calls itself the Committee of Concerned Dairy
Mart Shareholders, is led by former Dairy Mart president and CEO
Frank Colaccino.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release Wednesday, the group said it has filed
preliminary proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and will launch the ouster effort at Dairy Mart's May 25
stockholder meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The company has posted losing years over the past six and
seems to be well on its way to another disappointing performance,''
said Colaccino, who ran Dairy Mart from 1988 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   If the takeover is successful, he said the new board would
explore the company's possible sale.
</P>
<P>
   A Message seeking comment was left Wednesday night at the
company's Hudson, Ohio, headquarters, which was closed for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy Mart owns or operates approximately 600 retail stores in
seven Midwest and Southeastern states. The company was formerly
based in Enfield, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Dairy Mart were unchanged Wednesday at $3.37{ on the
American Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Experts Surprised by Elian Ruling  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID CRARY, AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Experts in child law were surprised, and in some cases dismayed,
by a federal court order in the Elian Gonzalez case that chided
U.S. immigration officials for not giving more weight to the
6-year-old boy's own wishes.
</P>
<P>
   In most child custody disputes, asylum cases and other legal
proceedings, an adult guardian would speak for a child of that age,
lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unheard of -- a 6-year-old being able to exercise judgment
on such an important decision in his life,'' said Sue Burrell, a
lawyer with the Youth Law Center in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoever he's sitting with at the moment, he's probably going
to try to please,'' she said. ''The whole idea of asking a
6-year-old what should be done is absolutely ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Burrell was reacting to Wednesday's order from a three-judge
federal appeals panel, which said Elian must remain in the United
States pending arguments in the custody dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The panel suggested the Immigration and Naturalization Service
had been remiss in not interviewing Elian about his ''separate and
independent interests'' in seeking asylum rather than returning
with his father to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   John O'Toole, director of the National Center for Youth Law in
Oakland, Calif., said he was surprised by the ruling. ''A decision
about whether to apply for political asylum is not normally left to
a 6-year-old,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Altman, a professor of family law at the University of
Southern California Law School, said most judges hearing
family-related cases are interested in the preferences of 10- or
12-year-olds, but view younger children differently.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many judges are reticent to talk to a 5- or 6-year-old about
their preferences,'' Altman said. ''They fear that just asking
could traumatize the child, and they worry that children that age
are not able to form sound judgments.''
</P>
<P>
   With Elian, he said, ''We are asking a child to choose loyalties
in a way that could be very traumatic. It's not obvious that a
child could have well-informed judgments about a matter of
asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lyon, another USC law professor specializing in child abuse
and neglect, agreed with the federal judges that the INS should
interview Elian, but said the boy's comments should be assessed
cautiously in the context of other information.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real question is whether he's getting a realistic picture
of life in the United States,'' Lyon said.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell said Elian, if allowed to choose to split with his
father, might regret the choice later on.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many kids who've been taken by the state from their
biological parent, but years later, that's who they want to be
with,'' she said. ''Your parent is your parent.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks fell moderately early Thursday,
weighed down by a decline on Wall Street after a two-day rise. The
dollar was higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 85.33 points,
or 0.45 percent, to 19,001.29 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Wednesday, the average closed up 117.10 points, or 0.62
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 104.62 yen, up 0.14 yen from late Wednesday in
Tokyo but below its late New York level of 104.78 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, Tokyo high technology issues declined early
Thursday following a drop in the tech-laden Nasdaq composite index
in New York Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In New York on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
92.46 points to close at 10,674.96. The Nasdaq composite index
closed at 3,706.41, down 87.16.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 14.72 points, or 0.91 percent, to 1,605.10
points. The TOPIX closed up 23.42 points, or 1.42 percent, the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar remained relatively steady in
early Tokyo trading following its strength against the euro in New
York. In overseas trading, the greenback rose to an all-time high
against the euro before losing some ground later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The euro was traded at 98.40 yen, down from 98.94 yen late
Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's weakness stemmed from doubts that Europe will take
measures anytime soon to stimulate growth and investment
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.7100 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.7050 percent. Its
price fell 0.04 point to 101.64.

<HEADLINE> China Seeks to Improve Turkey Ties  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey and China have agreed to fight
terrorism and religious extremists, Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said Wednesday during a visit punctuated by protests over China's
treatment of a minority group related to the Turkish.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both sides ... will oppose every kind of international
terrorism, separatism and extreme religious forces,'' Jiang said
after a meeting with President Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
   While ultra-nationalist Turks loudly criticized China's
treatment of its Muslim Uighur minority, Turkish leaders eager to
boost trade ties with China, expressed their concerns more demurely
behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Uighurs and Turks share a common cultural root and both practice
Islam. They speak similar languages.
</P>
<P>
   Demirel told Jiang the Uighur minority should be ''a bridge
between Turkey and China,'' the semiofficial Anatolia news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Demirel awarded Jiang the country's highest
decoration at a ceremony during which Turkish opera stars sang
famous arias.
</P>
<P>
   As a thank-you gesture, Jiang sang the traditional Neapolitan
song ''O Sole Mio'' to the delight and surprise of Demirel and
other guests who burst into an applause.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, a right-wing party and dozens of civic groups,
including an association of Uigher immigrants from China's
far-northwestern region of Xinjiang protested the government's
hospitality to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   ''We violently denounce in the name of humanity ... this
government which is putting us through this undeserved shame,''
said Okkes Semdiller, deputy head of the marginal far-right Great
Unity Party. The party laid a black wreath near the prime
minister's office in protest of plans to honor Jiang with the
medal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Muslim separatist groups, mostly Uighurs resentful of
Chinese domination, rioted and fought gun battles with Chinese
police in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
   Uighur immigrants have held several protests in Turkey to
denounce Chinese crackdowns on Muslims during the riots. Police
increased security for Jiang's visit, with hundreds of policemen
lining the roads to the presidential palace in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang oversaw the signing of energy and trade agreements for
increased cooperation on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Demirel said they would also seek ways to boost two-way trade
which stands at $930 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economic and trade ties between the two countries are far
below their economic potentials,'' Demirel said.

<HEADLINE> Newark makes arrest in 1991 murder case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The police department's Cold Case Squad has
solved a 1991 murder case that was reopened a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Major Sheffield, 33, of Newark on Monday and
charged him with the 1991 beating death of Willie Orr.
</P>
<P>
   The case dated back to Sept. 6, 1991 when Orr was walking in
front of a house on South 18th Street when he accidentally bumped
into some children who were playing in front of it.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the children fell to the ground, a man ran up to Orr
and chased him into a nearby alley, where he beat him with his
fists.
</P>
<P>
   Orr staggered into a nearby apartment, collapsed and never
regained consciousness. He died later at University Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an initial investigation by the department's homicide
unit, the case remained unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   On March 17, detectives Keith Sheppard and Rashid Sabur decided
to reopen the case, and developed information that led to
Sheffield's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Cold Case Squad has been instrumental in bringing closure
for the families of victims,'' said Police Director Joseph
Santiago. ''Detectives Sheppard and Sabur have established that the
Newark Police Department will pursue all leads to solve a crime.''

Oklahoma City Bombing Victims Remembered
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Families of the victims of America's worst terrorist
attack sought serenity today in the place that has pained them for five years.
On the anniversary of the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah
Federal Building, 168 sculpted chairs stood in silent tribute to the 149 adult
and 19 child victims who died in the attack. ''To me it's like my funeral for
him, my time to say goodbye,'' said 20-year-old Sarah Broxterman, who lingered
over the stone-and-bronze chair inscribed with the name of her late father,
bombing victim Paul Broxterman.

Cuban Boy Staying in U.S. For Now

   MIAMI (AP) -- Chastising the government for ignoring the wishes of a
6-year-old boy, a federal appeals panel today ordered that Elian Gonzalez must
remain in the United States until an asylum hearing next month. The court
action, extending an earlier stay granted by one of the judges, marked the
latest in a series of victories for Elian's Miami relatives, who have been
battling his Cuban father in an international tug-of-war over the child. The
order, however, does not prevent the government from reuniting father and son in
the United States.

Gay 'Marriage' Passes Vermont Senate

   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- A bill that passed the Vermont Senate today gets as

''marriage'' for opposite-sex couples. The Senate passed a bill creating ''civil
unions,'' a legal structure parallel to marriage for gay and lesbian couples.
The landmark proposal would grant to same-sex couples some 300 state benefits of

Crash Follows Call for 737 Redesign
</SUBHEAD>

   SAMAL, Philippines (AP) -- Wednesday's crash of an Air Philippines Boeing 737
comes days after a U.S. Federal Aviation Administration panel recommended
redesign of the rudder assembly of the jetliner. The 737 rudder system, which
controls left-right movement of the plane, came under close scrutiny after the
crash of USAir Flight 427 near Pittsburgh, Pa., in 1994, which killed all 132
people aboard. The Davao-city bound flight was carrying 131 passengers when it
crashed early Wednesday in what was the Philippines' worst air disaster. The
cause of the crash remains under investigation.

   PERTH, Australia (AP) -- Trees were uprooted and roofs blown off
houses in towns in northwestern Australia Thursday as Cyclone
Rosita swept through the region. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Outback town of Broome was buffeted by heavy rain and winds
gusts up to 118 mph as the storm passed early Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The cyclone began to weaken soon after moving inland from the
Indian Ocean.
</P>

   ''There was a lot of noise, a lot of rain ... we've experienced
a lot of trees being blown around,'' said Graeme Down, a spokesman

</P>
<P>
   Residents reported that a handful of roofs in the town had
either been blown off or damaged by falling trees, Down said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Meteorology said Rosita was moving east-southeast
at 12 mph and steadily weakening as it headed inland.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Poll: Lima Confident in Fujimori  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Residents of this capital city consider
President Alberto Fujimori more capable of creating jobs, improving
education and promoting business than runoff challenger Alejandro
Toledo, a poll showed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The vision of Fujimori as the man who can deliver undercuts
Toledo's promise to generate employment and combat poverty, the
foundation of a presidential bid that threatens to end Fujimori's
10-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   The two will face off in an upcoming runoff vote after Fujimori
fell just short of the majority necessary to claim an unprecedented
third term in the April 9 election, which was riddled with
irregularities and accusations of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Toledo's strong showing, the poll of Lima voters by the
private firm Apoyo showed the 61-year-old president outpacing -- in
most cases by a wide margin -- his 54-year-old challenger in nearly
a dozen categories measuring ability to govern.
</P>
<P>
   The poll surveyed 512 Lima residents between April 14 and 16 and
had a margin of error of 4.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The Apoyo poll showed 51 percent of those surveyed consider
Fujimori a hard worker, compared to 30 percent for Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   While most Peruvians consider lack of jobs the single most
important campaign issue, 45 percent of those polled said Fujimori
would be capable of generating employment, compared to 39 percent
for Toledo, a former World Bank official.
</P>
<P>
   And 49 percent said Fujimori would be capable of promoting
investment, while only 37 percent said Toledo could reinvigorate
Peru's stagnant business climate.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three percent said Fujimori would improve education,
compared to 34 percent for Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed Toledo's strongest overall support coming from
the more affluent sectors, with most people listing his
professional work and training as his greatest asset. Among the
middle class he has 60 percent support to Fujimori's 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those supporting Fujimori said he had earned their vote
by defeating leftist rebels, building schools, hospitals and roads
and providing economic assistance to the poorest segments of Peru's
society.

<HEADLINE> McCain Backs S.C. Flag Removal  </HEADLINE>
By JIM DAVENPORT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- U.S. Sen. John McCain said Wednesday the
Confederate flag should be lowered from South Carolina's
Statehouse, apologizing for not saying so during the Republican
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feared that if I answered honestly, I could not win the
South Carolina primary. So I chose to compromise my principles. I
broke my promise to always tell the truth,'' the Arizona Republican
said at a South Carolina Policy Council luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, were questioned
repeatedly on the issue during the campaign in February, and both
said they considered it an issue best decided by South Carolinians.
Bush won the primary with 53 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   A month earlier, the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People had begun a tourism boycott of the state, saying the
flag was a symbol of hate. Flag supporters say it represents the
state's heritage.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Wednesday, McCain said the flag ''should be
removed from your Capitol, and I am encouraged that fair-minded
people on both sides of the issue are working hard to define an
honorable compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the primary, McCain said his ancestors had
''fought honorably'' on the side of the Confederacy. On Wednesday,
he said they ''fought on the wrong side of American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction among some former McCain supporters was swift.
</P>
<P>
   ''He lied to me,'' said state Rep. Jake Knotts, R-Lexington, a
Confederate flag supporter. Knotts was among the South Carolina
Republicans, along with U.S. Reps. Lindsey Graham and Mark Sanford,
who broke from the party leadership and supported McCain.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain also won praise.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't have to come, he didn't have to say it,'' said Sam
Tenenbaum, a prominent Columbia Democrat who contributed to
McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, McCain drew parallels with Arizona's
struggle to adopt a holiday recognizing the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr. He said he supported the King holiday, but ''didn't like it
when people came in from other states to try and tell us in Arizona
how we would solve our problems and I don't intend to involve
myself in this controversy'' about the flag.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's Legislature is debating the flag's fate. A
Senate-passed plan to move it to a monument on Statehouse grounds
is likely to face tougher going in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Graham this week invited McCain and Bush to meet in South
Carolina and resolve their differences over the issue. The meeting
''would be a unifying event for our state party and would send a
good signal nationally,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain accepted the offer. Bush campaign spokesman Scott
McClellan said Bush had just received Graham's letter.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is ''to help heal the wounds of the South Carolina
primary and to show that we're a unified party,'' said Graham
spokesman Kevin Bishop. He said Graham suggested a date sometime
between a scheduled May 9 Bush-McCain meeting in Pittsburgh and the
Republican National Convention that begins July 31 in Philadelphia.

Oklahoma City National Memorial on Wednesday on the site of the
April 19, 1995, federal building bombing:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''I just want people to remember what happened here and the 168
people that were killed. If we forget this, we are losing
something.'' -- Richard Williams, former assistant building manager
for the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the Governor said in alluding to Gettysburg, there are
places in our national landscape so scarred by freedom's sacrifice
that they shape forever the soul of America -- Valley Forge,
Gettysburg, Selma. This place is such sacred ground.'' -- President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''This memorial, like this community, will always stand for
justice. Justice is that deep and abiding peace that comes when
wrong is righted and when hurt begins to heal.'' -- Attorney General
Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ''This wouldn't be something we would come to every day. Our
parents tried to teach us to get on with our lives. To me, my
parents aren't there.'' -- Gwen Battle, who lost her parents, Calvin
and Peola Battle, in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could have chosen to grieve very privately but instead you
chose to take a stand against terrorism, and to raise a lasting
tribute to those who perished, for the survivors who have suffered
the horror of the last five years and to all the courageous who
came from near and far to our aid.'' -- Robert M. Johnson, chairman
of the Oklahoma City Memorial Trust.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a face of evil that staggers the soul, you've demonstrated
the triumph of the human spirit.'' -- Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ''We bring with us our broken hearts and shattered dreams. We
know our hearts would have no rainbows if our eyes had no tears.
... Do not allow us to lose ourselves from the horror of this
terrorist attack on our government.'' -- Jack Poe, Oklahoma City
Police Chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a time of unspeakable horror and tragedy, where else is
there to turn but to turn to God?'' -- Gov. Frank Keating, following
a noon Mass at St. Joseph's Cathedral, which had its windows blown
out by the bomb. He was speaking about the response of people of
all faiths to the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ''By this memorial, we are saying that evil will not defeat
good. We are saying that good will defeat evil.'' -- Sen. Don
Nickles, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I got down here this morning, the moon was still up, the
clouds were in the sky and it reflected in the water. It was like
heaven was right here.'' -- Marsha Kight, mother of Frankie Merrell
who died in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is a tribute to all the victims of terrorism. It is
more than just the 168 people here. The memorial stands for the
people in embassies in Beirut and Africa ... Lockerbie, Scotland,
and even the children in Columbine.'' -- Tom Kight, stepfather of
Frankie Merrell, who died in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know there are still days when the old anger wells up inside
you; still days when tears fill your eyes, when you think your
heart will surely break. On those days in the future, I hope you
can come here and find solace in the memory of your loved ones, in
the honor of your fellow citizens. -- President Clinton.

northwestern state of Quiche.
</P>
<P>
   The group left Monday morning in a Cessna single-engine plane
for Huehuetenango, about 78 miles northwest of Guatemala City, on a
humanitarian mission. The pilot later dropped out of radio contact.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they expect to release the identities of all
the victims early next week.

<HEADLINE> At Least 9 Columbine Suits Filed  </HEADLINE>
By P. SOLOMON BANDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- A police sharpshooter was refused
permission to shoot Columbine High School gunman Dylan Klebold
through a library window during the rampage, a lawsuit alleged
Wednesday. A second lawsuit alleged one student was killed by
police gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits were among at least nine that have been filed
against the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department alleging deputies
mishandled the rescue and ignored advance warnings of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Sanders, the daughter of slain teacher Dave Sanders,
contended a sharpshooter on the roof of a nearby house claimed he
had a clear shot of Klebold in the library during the rampage.
</P>
<P>
   He informed commanders but was denied permission to fire,
according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   In a second lawsuit, filed by five families, lawyers for the
relatives of slain student Daniel Rohrbough alleged he was killed
by police, not the gunmen, based upon reports from a police officer
and teacher at the scene, the position of their son's body and
trajectory of the fatal bullet.
</P>
<P>
   They also alleged sheriff's deputies failed to rescue the
students in a timely manner and failed to properly train deputies,
dispatchers and 911 operators.
</P>
<P>
   ''They knew the killers were shooting defenseless students and
teachers, heard the screams ... and heard the gunshots, but made no
effort to aid,'' the families' lawsuit alleged.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits were filed one day before the anniversary of the
April 20, 1999, attack in which Klebold and Eric Harris killed 12
classmates and a teacher and wounded about two dozen before they
committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   State law sets a one-year statute of limitations on such
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the families claim the sheriff's department could
have prevented the shootings if it had investigated threats made by
Harris on an Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County Attorney Frank Hutfless, said: ''We are
confident that the claims are without any legal merit and we will
defend them vigorously.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, 47, was shot twice as he shepherded students out of the
cafeteria and ordered others to hide under tables as the shooting
began.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders ran upstairs and was pulled into a science room, where
he remained for four hours. He died as a SWAT team officer reached
him. Some officials have said Sanders' wounds were so severe he
would have died even if he had been rescued earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Officers knew Sanders' location 15 minutes after he was shot
when a large white message board stating ''1 bleeding to death''
was held up to the window, the suit stated.
</P>
<P>
   Officers also knew Harris and Klebold killed themselves about an
hour after the attack began, the suit contended.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly four hours afterward, sheriff's commanders prevented
''anyone from taking any action directed at rescuing or saving the
life of Dave Sanders,'' the lawsuit stated.
</P>
<P>
   Rohrbough was outside the school when the gunmen approached and
opened fire. Families of Matt Kechter, Lauren Townsend, Kyle
Velasquez and Kelly Fleming were included in Rohrbough's lawsuit.
It alleged the students, who were slain in the library, would have
survived had they not been promised that help was on the way and
ordered to stay put.
</P>
<P>
   Denver legal analyst Andrew Cohen said that although it is too
early to predict whether any allegations will be proven in court,
the suits are at least shedding more light on the tragic events.
</P>
<P>
   ''Already we've seen this week that these lawsuits have forced
into the public domain some information that wasn't yet public and
in and of itself that's a good thing,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits were have been filed by families of slain student
Isaiah Shoels and injured victims Richard Castaldo, Lance Kirklin,
Mark Taylor, Kacey Ruegsegger, Valeen Schnurr, Evan Todd and Jeanna
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we've gotten have been tears, flowers, crosses, monuments
and pious phrases, but nothing for the injured children and their
suffering,'' said Walter Gerash, a lawyer for the family of
partially paralyzed shooting victim Sean Graves, which also filed
suit.

<HEADLINE> Actors Strike Against Advertisers  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- TV and radio audiences may catch more
commercial repeats as actors strike against advertisers, though
negotiators for ad agencies said Wednesday that consumers will
notice little difference in the sales pitches they see and hear.
</P>
<P>
   Board members for the Screen Actors Guild and American
Federation of Television and Radio Artists finalized strike plans
Tuesday night over what the unions say are unfair wage proposals
from advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The unions, which have a combined membership of 135,000 actors,
authorized a strike beginning 12:01 a.m. May 1. Their commercial
contracts with the American Association of Advertising Agencies and
Association of National Advertisers expired March 31.
</P>
<P>
   John McGuinn, chief negotiator for advertisers, said the
associations plan to continue business as usual during the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers have an inventory of fresh commercials and probably
will keep some older spots on the air longer while the walkout
continues, McGuinn said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the problem they may have is perhaps in a couple
months where consumers who have probably seen the same ad a few
zillion times may get really turned off,'' said Wayne Friedman, who
covers the ad industry for the trade publication Advertising Age.
</P>
<P>
   Some agencies and producers use non-union actors for
commercials, and other advertisers likely will do the same while
the strike lasts. Some union actors also might continue to work
despite the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not worried about that,'' said William Daniels, actors
guild president. The contract offer from advertisers would cut into
actors' earnings and ''has so galvanized our unions that we have
never had such a unified membership.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors are pushing for a new pay system on cable-TV ads that
would compensate performers for each time their commercials air.
That system would be similar to the setup for network TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers want the opposite, expanding flat-rate wages for
cable commercials to network TV because of shrinking audiences for
broadcast networks. Ad agencies say a proposed increase in flat
rates for cable commercials would more than offset money actors
would lose by scrapping the pay system for network ads.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have been negotiating since February. No new talks
are scheduled before the strike date.
</P>
<P>
   Actors went on strike over commercial contracts for three weeks
in 1988 and for three months in 1978-79. The strike would not
affect production of feature films or TV shows.

<HEADLINE> Bucks 110, Wizards 105  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The playoffs are all about momentum, and not
many teams have more of it than the Milwaukee Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Williams had 19 points and Vinny Del Negro scored eight of
his 16 in the final four minutes as the Bucks finished the regular
season with a 110-105 victory over the Washington Wizards on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee played reserves most of the night, having clinched its
second straight playoff berth two nights earlier with a victory
over the Orlando Magic. Detroit's 112-91 win over Chicago on
Wednesday night kept the Bucks in the No. 8 seed in the East.
</P>
<P>
   With a hard-fought victory over the Wizards, Milwaukee enters
its first-round matchup with the top-seeded Indiana Pacers on a
three-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee (42-40) won 11 of 15 games to close the season,
posting a 8-3 record in April while streaking past Orlando for the
final playoff spot. The Bucks, who last year snapped a streak of
seven consecutive seasons out of the playoffs, finished with a
winning record for the first time since 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Allen, who sprained his left knee against Orlando, didn't
let the minor injury end his streak of 296 consecutive games
played. Allen, who hasn't missed a game in his four-year NBA
career, started the game and played six minutes, scoring five
points and even dunking off the injured leg.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards (29-53) ended another lost season with a solid
effort but another defeat. Washington's winning percentage
decreased for the third straight season, and the Wizards lost five
of six, including three straight, to close the year.
</P>
<P>
   Interim coach Darrell Walker, who doesn't know whether team
president Michael Jordan will retain his services next year,
finished with a 15-23 record.
</P>
<P>
   Washington gave several glimpses of the tough, offensively
talented team its expensive roster suggests but never became.
Richmond scored 27 points in another outstanding performance, Chris
Whitney had 22 and Bucks-killer Tracy Murray had 15 off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Murray hit a layup with 4:55 to play that gave the Wizards a
95-93 lead, their first of the game. The teams traded baskets until
Del Negro hit two free throws and a fallaway jumper that put
Milwaukee up 103-99 with three minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Del Negro hit another jumper, and Robert Traylor put the game
away with a three-point play with 32 seconds left. Williams led six
Bucks in double figures, and Tim Thomas added 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   The teams played a thrilling double-overtime game at the Bradley
Center in January, which was won on Williams' layup with two-tenths
of a second to play. Milwaukee also beat Washington on Saturday
night in a 120-116 overtime game.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Milwaukee split its four-game season series with the Pacers
and was one of just five teams to win at Conseco Fieldhouse this
year. ... The 6-foot-5 Darvin Ham emphatically blocked a fallaway
jumper attempt by the 6-foot-11 Howard in the third quarter. ...
Before the game, Milwaukee signed CBA Defensive Player of the Year
Maceo Baston to a two-year contract. Baston was in uniform for
Wednesday night's game and would be eligible for the playoffs.
Mirsad Turkcan was placed on the injured list to make room for
Baston. ... Murray averaged 18.3 points in the Wizards' four games
against the Bucks, nearly twice his average against everyone else.

<HEADLINE> Mets 3, Brewers 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rick Reed turned in another sharp start and the
New York Mets beat the Milwaukee Brewers for the seventh straight
time, 3-1 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets ended Jason Bere's nine-game winning streak, dating
back to Sept. 19, 1998, when he pitched Cincinnati over Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Reed (2-0), who had no-decisions in two of his first three
starts, has now given up just three earned runs in 29 2-3 innings
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Reed allowed seven hits and struck out six, leaving after James
Mouton opened the eighth with a single.
</P>
<P>
   The night got off to an ominous start for Reed. He was hit on
the thumb of his glove hand by Marquis Grissom's line drive to
start the game, but recovered to throw out the leadoff man.
</P>
<P>
   After brief medical attention, Reed grimaced while making a few
warmup tosses before retiring the side in order.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Benitez pitched the ninth for his sixth save in seven
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Bere (2-1), who spent part of last season on the disabled list
and part of it in the minors, gave up three runs in 5 2-3 innings.
His winning streak was tied for the longest in the majors with
Pedro Martinez of the Red Sox and Pat Mahomes of the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Jenkins homered on Reed's first pitch of the seventh,
pulling the Brewers within 3-1. It was Jenkins' fourth homer.
</P>
<P>
   New York took a 1-0 lead in the first inning on Mike Piazza's
RBI groundout, but left the bases loaded when Bere got Jay Payton
to ground into a forceout after two walks.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell's RBI single and Edgardo Alfonzo's sacrifice fly made
it 3-0 in the second.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The game started with three umpires when Ed Rapuano,
scheduled to work first base, was caught in traffic. He didn't
arrive until the Mets came to bat in the second inning. ... On
Tuesday night, Mike Hampton -- who had two singles and two walks --
became only the fourth Mets pitcher ever to reach base four times
in a game. Tom Seaver (1967) and Jerry Koosman (1974) both had
three hits and a walk. ... Bere had not lost in 20 consecutive
appearances. He was 3-0 with Cincinnati last season and 2-0 with
the Brewers.

<HEADLINE> Syria Softens Rhetoric Over Pullback  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Syria on Wednesday softened its tone over
a planned Israeli pullout from south Lebanon by July, saying it
hopes that the move would be a prelude to a withdrawal from other
occupied Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is still ample time and many gleams of light,'' wrote
Fayez Sayegh, head of Syria's official news agency in an article
published in the government's Al-Thawra newspaper. ''Let the
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon be a part of an Israeli
pullout from lands captured in 1967.''
</P>
<P>
   The commentary marks a shift in Syria's reaction to Israel's
planned withdrawal, of which the Jewish state formally notified the
United Nations earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The move was initially viewed with skepticism by Syria and its
protege and neighbor Lebanon, with newspapers in Damascus, which
reflect the thinking of the Syrian government, claiming that Israel
was insincere in its pledge to pull out.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's reaction also came a day after Lebanese Prime
Minster Salim Hoss departed from previous statements by not
criticizing the Israeli move, instead hailing it as a victory and a
''crushing defeat for Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Lebanon and Syria had said that the pullout
must be part of an overall Mideast peace settlement, a prospect
which now appears unlikely to materialize soon with the
Israel-Syria talks deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
   A withdrawal without an Israel-Syria peace accord is likely to
deprive Syria, which maintains about 30,000 troops in Lebanon, of a
bargaining chip -- in the form of pressure on Israel from Lebanese
guerrillas -- in any future talks.

<HEADLINE> New Milford police officer found guilty in cruiser fatal case  </HEADLINE>
sdfonsy
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- A New Milford police officer whose
cruiser struck another car and killed its teen-age driver was found
guilty Wednesday of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The six-member jury deliberated for about 10 hours over two days
before returning the verdict against Officer William Scribner, 39.
He is scheduled to be sentenced on June 14 and faces up to six
months in prison and a $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Scribner, who lives in Bethel, was convicted in the June 1998
death of Angela D'Aquila.
</P>
<P>
   D'Aquila was killed when Scribner's cruiser, its lights flashing
and siren screaming, raced through a New Milford intersection and
smashed into her car. Caroline LaVoie, 18, a passenger in
D'Aquila's car, suffered a collapsed lung, broken ribs, a fractured
clavicle and a sprained spine.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely been a long 2{ years,'' LaVoie said outside
Litchfield Superior Court. ''I think we're all happy that this is
done and over with and justice is served.''
</P>
<P>
   Scribner was disappointed by the verdict, said his attorney,
John Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here's a man with 14 years on the job, with an unblemished
record, legitimately responding to an emergency and a tragic
accident occurs and now he's convicted of a motor vehicle
offense,'' Kelly said. ''So he's very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jury Foreman Wayne Smith said the jury felt Scribner did not use
reasonable care going through the intersection.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was going way too fast,'' Smith said. ''It was with a very
heavy heart that we reached that verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   Scribner was the first Connecticut police officer to be charged
with negligent homicide in the line of duty. His conviction comes
five weeks after former New Milford police Officer Scott Smith was
convicted of manslaughter for fatally shooting an unarmed suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who is scheduled to be sentenced May 5, originally was
charged with murder -- the first Connecticut police officer ever to
be so charged for an act in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Scribner was responding to a disturbance call when his cruiser
struck D'Aquila's car. Prosecutors charged him after concluding in
a yearlong investigation that he hadn't slowed down before going
through the intersection.
</P>
<P>
   The defense had maintained Scribner followed police procedure.
Scribner's attorney argued that D'Aquila caused the accident by
making an improper left turn into the path of the cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Scribner, a 13-year police veteran at the time of the crash,
turned down the state's offer to place him on a special one-year
probation, after which his record would have been wiped clean. He
remains free on a promise to appear pending sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Acting New Milford Police Chief Colin McCormack issued a
statement after the verdict, expressing the department's sympathy
for the victims, but disappointment with the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we as citizens are disappointed by the jury's decision
to convict Officer Scribner, we as members of a law enforcement
agency must respect and abide by our system of justice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCormack added: ''As a community, we need to be reminded that
our law enforcement officers are constantly thrust into rapidly
evolving and dangerous situations, placing themselves at great
personal jeopardy. Despite this risk, the New Milford Police
Department will persevere, and continue with its mission to provide
a safe environment for all of our citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Arthur Peitler could not be reached for comment. Telephone
messages were left for him and the town attorney at Town Hall.

<HEADLINE> Braves 10, Phillies 1  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Javy Lopez homered and equaled his career high
with four RBIs to back seven strong innings by Tom Glavine, leading
the Atlanta Braves to a 10-1 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies
on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga also drove in two runs for the Braves, who
didn't need to use John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial reliever began warming up in the top of the
eighth with Atlanta ahead 4-1, but he sat down when his teammates
turned the game into a rout with six runs in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga erased the save possibility with his second RBI single
of the game, then Lopez sent his third homer of the season deep
into the left-field stands against reliever Steve Schrenk, who
failed to get an out before he was yanked.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves added two more runs before Trever Miller finally got
the first out of the inning, a diving catch by Doug Glanville at
the warming track in right-center.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, who broke a 1-1 tie with a two-run single in the sixth,
had four RBIs for the 10th time in his career. The last came on
June 20, 1999, at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine (3-0) surrendered just four hits but had to overcome
five walks, two of which were intentional. The Phillies stranded
eight runners against the two-time Cy Young winner, who threw 116
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine got off to a terrible start last season, going 1-3 with
a 5.19 ERA in the opening month and struggling through his worst
season in nine years. But April has traditionally been one of his
best months, with a career ERA below 3.00.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones gave the Braves a 4-1 lead in the seventh with a
solo homer to right-center against Phillies starter Randy Wolf
(1-1).
</P>
<P>
   Rocker made his return to baseball on Tuesday, pitching a
scoreless inning after receiving a standing ovation from the Turner
Field crowd on his sprint to the mound. He didn't factor in the
decision as the Braves won 4-3 in 12 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's game was tied at 1 in the sixth when Wolf hit
consecutive batters, Brian Jordan and Galarraga, to load the bases
with one out. Lopez followed with his two-run single to center.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan returned to the Braves after spending 15 days on the
disabled list with a muscle strain in his rib cage.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga, bumped from fourth to fifth to make room for Jordan
in the lineup, went 3-for-3, including an RBI single in the fourth
that erased Philadelphia's 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf went seven innings, which he also did in his first two
starts of the season. He allowed seven hits and four runs, walked
two and struck out two.
</P>
<P>
   Rico Brogna's bases-loaded groundout gave the Phillies a 1-0
lead in the first. Glavine escaped additional trouble by striking
out Mickey Morandini with the bases full.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Jordan and Philadelphia Ron Gant both made spectacular
catches. In the fourth, Jordan made a belly-flopping grab near the
foul line in right on a sinking liner by Doug Glanville. An inning
later, when Quilvio Veras sent a drive to the warning track in
left, Gant initially turned the wrong way but recovered to make a
twisting, back-handed catch before slamming into the wall. ... Home
plate umpire Randy Marsh was injured in the second when Wolf's
pitch bounced in the dirt and caught the umpire in his left jaw,
just beyond the mask. Marsh remained the game, but he continued to
poke at his jaw for a couple of batters. ... The crowd of 29,992
was nearly 5,000 less than the previous night for Rocker's return.

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Steve Nash had 22 points and 10 assists as
the Dallas Mavericks beat the shorthanded Minnesota Timberwolves
113-107 Wednesday night for their 11th win in their final 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Finley added 18 points and Erick Strickland and Cedric
Ceballos each scored 17 for the Mavericks, who closed the season
with a flourish. After falling 14 games below .500 on Jan. 10, the
Mavericks (40-42) went 30-18.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolves, who finished 50-32 for the best record in franchise
history, already had turned their attention to their first-round
playoff series with Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not taking anything away from Dallas, because right now
they're playing as well as anybody,'' Wolves coach Flip Saunders
said before the game. ''But the last two days, our staff has spent
all our time watching Portland. I'm going to start calling them
Portland.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, the Mavericks looked like a playoff team, thanks to
Minnesota's depleted lineup.
</P>
<P>
   With the sixth seed in the Western Conference secured, Kevin
Garnett (hamstring) and Terrell Brandon (back) watched the game in
street clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon was placed on the injured list, and the Wolves activated
forward Andrae Patterson. Brandon will be back for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett, who missed a game for the first time all season, became
the ninth player in NBA history to average 20 points, 10 rebounds
and five assists. The last one to do it was Charles Barkley for
Phoenix in 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Peeler scored a season-high 22 points and Bobby Jackson
tied his season-high with 21 for Minnesota. Wally Szczerbiak added
19.
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak's 3-pointer with 35 seconds left in the third quarter
gave the Wolves their biggest lead, 87-80. But the Mavericks went
on a 14-2 run, capped by Strickland's three-point play, for a 94-89
lead. Dallas never trailed again.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Saunders said that if Dallas' Don Nelson has coached his
last game, ''he's put this team in the right direction.'' ... The
Mavericks made their first 16 free throws. ... Patterson spent
almost all season on the injured list after tearing cartilage on
Oct. 28 and undergoing an operation the next day. ... Other players
who have averaged 20 points, 10 boards and five assists are: Larry
Bird, Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor, Oscar Robertson, Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, Billy Cunningham and Sidney Wicks. ... Brandon missed
11 games this season with a variety of ailments.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 3, Devil Rays 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken, playing his first game at Camden
Yards since getting his 3,000th hit, provided another highlight
Wednesday night, connecting for a home run in the bottom of the
ninth inning that lifted the Baltimore Orioles over Tampa Bay 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken led off by driving a 1-0 pitch from reliever Jim Mecir
(2-1) into the left-field stands for his third homer of the year,
giving the Orioles their third straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken got his 3,000th hit during the weekend at Minnesota. The
Orioles were rained out Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the game, Ripken was honored with a video recap of his
career. He twice received standing ovations -- before the Orioles
batted in the first inning and before his first at-bat in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration, however, did not go off without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   Four banners bearing the number ''3-0-0-0'' were unfurled on the
B&AMP;O Warehouse beyond right field, but only the first and last flags
unrolled. Eventually, a team staffer reached out of an open window
to knock the stubborn banners loose with a baton.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Canseco and Vinny Castilla homered for the Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles reliever Mike Trombley (1-1), who worked out of a jam
after loading the bases with one out in the top of the ninth, got
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles starter Mike Mussina remained winless despite his fourth
strong outing of the season. He allowed six hits, walked three and
struck out seven in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina surrendered solo home runs to Canseco and Castilla for a
2-0 Tampa Bay lead in the fourth. Canseco hit a 2-2 pitch into the
left-field bleachers to lead off the inning and Castilla hit his
first American League homer, a 417-foot shot to center with two
outs.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles rallied with one out in the seventh. Will Clark
walked and went to third on Charles Johnson's double down the
left-field line. Mike Bordick then tripled to the wall in
right-center, tying the score and chasing starter Steve Trachsel.
</P>
<P>
Notes: With a first-inning single, Canseco has hit in 12 of the
Devil Rays' 14 games. ... Bordick singled to lead off the third,
extending his hitting streak to a career-high 14 games over two
seasons. He has a hit in all 13 of the Orioles' games this season.

Ludwig Jailed After Guilty Verdicts in Alberta Oilpatch Vandalism
Trial
</P>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Wiebo Ludwig is a cunning man who used
an innocent child in a vengeful crusade against the energy
industry, a judge said Wednesday as he convicted and jailed him on
five charges related to vandalism in the northern Alberta oilpatch.
</P>
<P>
   To a smattering of applause at the end of his presentation,
Justice Sterling Sanderman found Ludwig guilty on five of 14
charges. The most serious was possession of explosives, which
carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   That charge relates to a 1998 explosion at a Suncor well near
Hinton. Ludwig was later found in the area with explosives residue
on his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Sanderman said he believed Ludwig's motive was revenge for the
stillbirth of his grandson, which he blamed on pollution by the
energy industry near his farm.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Boonstra, Ludwig's friend and co-accused, was convicted
of one mischief charge and acquitted of 12 other charges.
</P>
<P>
   The two men will be sentenced next Wednesday. Boonstra was
released pending sentencing, but Ludwig was remanded in custody.

Alberta Legislature Cancels Question Period as Health Debate Heats
Up
</P>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- The Alberta legislature was battened
down and question period canceled following a late-night protest
that saw police tires slashed, the legislature vandalized and a
security guard roughed up.
</P>
<P>
   ''When there's violence and property damage and a minor injury
occurring . . . that to me is not reasonable protest,'' an angry
Premier Ralph Klein said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuesday night rally was another in an escalating series of
public protests against Bill 11, which would expand and regulate
private-sector health care in Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   Klein, who wasn't in the house at the time but watched news
reports of the violence on TV at his Calgary condo, added such
actions won't deter his government from passing the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Ken Kowalski took the rare step of shutting down debate
in question period Wednesday after tempers flared while Opposition
Liberal Leader Nancy MacBeth hammered on Klein to pull the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Klein accused the Liberals of stirring up the violence.

Feds, Ontario Heat Up Health care Ad Battle
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The advertising battle between Ontario and the
federal government over health care is turning into a
multimillion-dollar war of attrition and some people are getting
sick of it.
</P>
<P>
   Ontario's Conservative government will launch a new TV ad Sunday
attacking Ottawa over health care funding. That's in addition to
three ads already aired.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign budget will be boosted to $5 million from $3
million, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ottawa has moved beyond print advertising to
prime-time television in the Ontario market. Its campaign is
smaller and has cost about $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Health care activists are not giving either side any points.

Cameras To Watch For Crime Along Canada's Longest Street
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- The long arm of the law will soon be
strengthening its grip along the longest street in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's police chief wants to install surveillance cameras on
Yonge Street at the corner of Dundas, a busy intersection in the
heart of Canada's largest city that police say will soon be a
modest version of New York's Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras are intended to catch criminals in the act, with
their lenses transmitting closed-circuit television images of
robberies, drug deals, shootings, assaults and other street crimes
to police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras are already in place in many U.S. cities and they're a
fixture in some parts of Britain, including London, Leeds and
Glasgow.
</P>
<P>
   In Ontario, Sudbury police have been using the cameras for four
years, while the police services board in London, Ontario, approved
a plan last April to install cameras downtown.	   Winnipeg police will be
erecting the monitors on downtown
streets by year end.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 4, Padres 3  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Darryl Kile followed a horrid outing with his
strongest of the season, working eight innings in the St. Louis
Cardinals' 4-3 victory over the San Diego Padres on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Kile (3-1) lasted 1 2-3 innings in his last start at Colorado,
where he struggled for two seasons after signing a free-agent deal,
allowing 11 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Padres, he faced the minimum on only 69 pitches
through six innings before allowing three runs the last two
innings. He struck out seven and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Veres worked the ninth for his fourth save in four chances.
There was heavy rain and lightning for the final few outs.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn returned to the Padres' lineup after missing seven
games with a knee injury, going 0-for-4 with a run-scoring
groundout in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Davis had a disputed, two-run infield hit in the third off
Sterling Hitchcock (0-4), breaking up a scoreless game.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Tatis and Shawon Dunston, subbing for .120-hitting Ray
Lankford, hit consecutive home runs in a three-pitch span in the
sixth, the sixth time the Cardinals have done that this season.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis has homered in 11 straight games, totaling 27 homers
during the streak, and leads the major leagues with 36. This
despite minimal output from Mark McGwire, who missed his seventh
straight game with a lower back injury.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is expected back in the lineup Thursday after taking
batting practice, running and fielding earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Vina scored from second on Davis' bases-loaded infield
hit in the third. Replays showed first baseman Ryan Klesko beat a
sliding Davis to the bag after fielding the ball, but umpire Larry
Young signaled safe.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock struck out nine in six innings, allowing four runs on
seven hits. He's given up six home runs in 24 1-3 innings this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Owens extended his hitting streak to 13 games when he
singled with two outs in the Padres eighth and Wiki Gonzalez
followed with his first home run to cut the gap to 4-3.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Padres did not leave a runner on base. ... Lankford has
struck out 20 times in 50 at-bats. ... Cardinals RHP Matt Morris
threw 22 pitches in two hitless innings in his first official
outing in extended spring training. Morris had elbow surgery last
April and is expected to join the team in June. ... The Cardinals
are 5-4 without McGwire in the lineup and 5-1 with him. ...
Gonzalez threw out Edgar Renteria and Craig Paquette attempting to
steal in the seventh. ... Padres backup C Ben Davis is 1-for-16
since being recalled from Triple-A Las Vegas April 7 due to an
injury to Carlos Hernandez. ... Owens is 20-for-55 (.364) after not
starting on opening day.

<HEADLINE> Detainee Deaths Attributed to Hitler  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The executions of 50 Allied airmen who fled a
German prison camp -- immortalized in the film ''The Great Escape''
-- were personally ordered by Adolf Hitler, according to British
intelligence records released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The statement on Hitler's direct role was made by Gen. Maj.
Adolf Westhoff, the German officer responsible for prisoners'
welfare, to British interrogators after World War II, according to
the files.
</P>
<P>
   The records were released Thursday by the Public Record Office,
which had obtained them from the British intelligence agency MI5.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 Allied aircrew tunneled their way out of Stalag Luft
III, a prison camp at Sagan in southeastern Germany, on March 24,
1944. Three managed to reach Britain, but the rest were recaptured.
Fifty were chosen randomly for execution as a warning to other
would-be fugitives. The others were relocated to new prison camps.
</P>
<P>
   The records show that during his interrogation, Westhoff
recounted how an ''excited and nervous'' Field Marshal Wilhelm
Keitel summoned him to a meeting shortly after the mass breakout.
</P>
<P>
   Westhoff quoted Keitel as saying that he had been personally
admonished by Luftwaffe chief Hermann Goering in the presence of SS
head Heinrich Himmler. Westoff said Keitel warned he must ''set an
example'' to other prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   '''We shall have to take very severe measures. I can only tell
you that the men who have escaped will be shot; probably the
majority of them are dead already,''' Westoff quoted Keitel as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Told it was ''out of the question'' to execute recaptured men,
Westhoff said Keitel answered simply: ''I don't care a damn.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Keitel added, '''We discussed it in the Fuhrer's
presence and it cannot be altered.'''
</P>
<P>
   Westhoff said Hitler and Himmler had decided the matter between
them, adding, ''The Fuhrer himself always took a hand in these
affairs when officers escaped.'' Previous accounts of the escape
were not clear on who ordered the executions.
</P>
<P>
   He told his MI5 interrogators that all those killed had been
shot by police or the Gestapo before his troops even saw them.
</P>
<P>
   Other records revealed that a Nazi general implored a ''broken''
Hitler to remain in Berlin and commit suicide rather than flee to
safety, only a week before the Fuhrer's death.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony from Gen. Gottlieb Berger, a top-ranking SS
officer, offers a vivid picture of a paranoid leader who blamed
everyone else for his imminent defeat.
</P>
<P>
   In a transcript of his interrogation by MI5 officers, Berger
painted a scathing picture of Hitler's state of mind during their
last meeting on April 22, 1945, eight days before Hitler killed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he believed Hitler had died, Berger answered: ''I
presume he blew himself up, but he was just as likely to have had a
stroke, as he raved like a madman on the 22nd, when he spoke to me.
He was completely finished, a broken man.''

<HEADLINE> Athletics 10, Indians 5  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Miguel Tejada hit his first career grand slam
and Oakland hit four home runs to back Kevin Appier, powering the
Athletics to a 10-5 victory over the lifeless Cleveland Indians on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tejada's slam came in the fifth inning off Sean DePaula as
Oakland opened a 10-2 lead and coasted to its second win in a row
against an Indians team that swept them at home last week.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi, Ben Grieve and Matt Stairs also homered for the
A's, who chased Jaret Wright (2-1) in the fourth inning. Wright
pitched a five-hit shutout in his previous start in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cleveland fell to 1-4 at home this season, and if not
for back-to-back homers in the ninth inning to beat Texas on
Sunday, the Indians would be winless at Jacobs Field in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's entire lineup is in an offensive funk. After
averaging 7.7 runs in going 7-2 on the road to open the season, the
Indians are batting just .215 and have scored only 18 runs in five
home dates.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Alomar homered twice for Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Appier (3-1) didn't have to be very good to win his third
straight start. He allowed three runs and seven hits in five
innings. He walked six but twice worked his way out of jams.
</P>
<P>
   Giambi, who has 20 RBIs this season, opened the third inning
with his seventh homer, a shot to straightaway center to give the
A's a 3-1 lead. One out later, Grieve connected for his second
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Wright gave up a leadoff single to Ryan Christenson in the
fourth and was done after Tejada hit an RBI double to make it 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Wright allowed five runs and seven hits in three-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Stairs homered to lead off the fifth against DePaula, who was
recalled Tuesday when Bartolo Colon went on the disabled list. A
single and two walks loaded the bases for Tejada, whose slam came
in his 1,106th at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   The A's snapped a 10-inning scoreless string against Wright in
the second when Eric Chavez tripled off the center-field wall to
score Grieve and Jorge Velandia hit an RBI groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland got a run back in the bottom of the inning on Einar
Diaz's single that scored Travis Fryman, who doubled off Appier's
leg.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, Fryman hit a shot up the middle that struck
Appier above his right ankle and caromed all the way into short
right field, allowing Fryman to reach second.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Indians catcher Sandy Alomar is expected to go on the
disabled list Thursday because of a pulled right hamstring. Alomar,
who spent most of last season on the DL after knee surgery,
underwent tests to determine if spasms in his hamstring were
related to his back. The Indians will bring up either catcher Jesse
Levis or Bobby Hughes to take Alomar's roster spot. ... The A's
also hit four homers on opening day April against Detroit. ... In
conjunction with a promotion for the expansion Columbus Blue
Jackets' joining the NHL next season, the Stanley Cup was at Jacobs
Field on Wednesday night. Manuel wasn't impressed. He's got his eye
on another trophy. ''I want to see a World Series Cup,'' Manuel
said. ''I don't want to see a Stanley Cup.'' Roberto Alomar has
eight multihomer games in his career.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Alleges Anti-Communist Plot  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba claimed Wednesday that anti-communist groups
planned to use force to prevent federal officials from taking Elian
Gonzalez from the Miami house where he is staying.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Remirez, head of the Cuban Interests Section in
Washington, said that men armed with shotguns are stationed
permanently at a house close to that of Lazaro Gonzalez, the
great-uncle who has custody of the boy, according to a text of his
remarks read on Cuban television.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their objective is to block U.S. authorities from taking Elian
from the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said they have not seen any armed men around the house.
''Otherwise, decisive action would have been taken,'' said Miami
police spokesman Delrish Moss.
</P>
<P>
   He said police had been in contact with neighbors and found no
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters outside the house also said they haven't seen anyone
armed.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban journalist Lazaro Barredo said the text of Remirez's
statement had been sent to the U.S. State Department, as a show of
concern for the life of the 6-year-old boy at the center of a
custody battle that has become a battleground between friends and
foes of Cuban President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department duty officer said he had heard nothing about
the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Cubans expressed disappointment with a court
ruling in Atlanta that said Elian should stay in the United States
while an argument about a possible asylum request is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is Clinton. Clinton is guilty,'' insisted
59-year-old parking lot attendant Francisco Hernandez, referring to
the U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
   Elian ''should return because he is Cuban,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba's first official reaction to the court ruling, Remirez
and Parliament President Ricardo Alarcon said the judgment
''ignored the opinions of judges, psychologists and pediatricians''
about the boy's welfare.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement read over television, they said that the
U.S. government should have settled the case administratively by
turning Elian over to his father four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. government knows... of the dangers the boy runs and
is responsible for his security,'' their statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban state television has broadcast almost daily reaction and
commentary on the case since Elian was found off the coast of
Florida in late November following a shipwreck that killed his
mother. His father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has gone to the United
States to reclaim the boy, saying he wants to bring him back to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   While news of the ruling had not reached the streets of Havana
earlier in the day, Cubans told of it by a foreign reporter
expressed support for the child's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has to end,'' said Nancy Andino Diaz, 38, a cook. ''He
has to return because his father speaks for him. How is it that
this has lasted four months?''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a crime that he is there,'' said Norka Mena, 66. She said
the case should be settled because it has caused ''so much
bitterness'' for Elian's family.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an abuse what they are doing with that boy,'' said her
sister Dinora Mena, 63. ''I'd kill for my granddaughter,'' she
said.

<P>
   With the Eastern Conference's best record in hand, Indiana coach
Larry Bird played his starters in the first and third quarters
only, giving the bench players extended minutes. The Pacers never
trailed.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Best scored 14 and Reggie Miller 13 as eight Pacers
reached double figures.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzen Wright led Atlanta with 23 points and Jim Jackson
scored 16.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Rik Smits hit their first shots as the Pacers scored
the first four points en route to a 22-11 lead eight minutes into
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Smits scored eight point in the quarter, but saw little action
thereafter. Indiana led 51-46 at intermission, and most of the
starters returned for the third quarter and improved the lead to
81-68.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's 13 points gave him 1,470 for the season and extended
his reign as the Pacers' leading regular-season scorer to 12
straight years. He averaged 18.212, just ahead of Jalen Rose's
18.203.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Hawks' center Dikembe Mutombo, who played just one minute
into the second quarter, grabbed five rebounds to finish as the
NBA's champion in that department with an average of 14.1 per game.
He finished second in blocks (3.3) and in field-goal percentage
(.563). Mutombo scored five points and blocked two shots in 13
minutes. ... Smits blocked two shots, giving him 100 for the
season. It's the first time since 1991-92 that he's reached the
century mark. ... Atlanta's 54 losses are the most in franchise
history since the team moved from St. Louis in 1968. The Hawks lost
24 of their last 30 games. ...Indiana, which has the homecourt
advantage through the Eastern Conference finals, won its last five
games at Conseco Fieldhouse for a 36-5 home record, best in the
conference.

<HEADLINE> Spurs 103, Lakers 98  </HEADLINE>
By KELLEY SHANNON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- David Robinson scored six points in overtime
and the Spurs overcame a 17-point fourth-quarter deficit to beat
the Los Angeles Lakers 103-98 in overtime Wednesday night to gain
homecourt advantage in the first round of the playoffs
</P>
<P>
   Four Spurs reserves scored in double figures, including Antonio
Daniels with 11 points in the fourth quarter and overtime to boost
the Spurs' comeback.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio, shorthanded without injured star Tim Duncan, had to
win to clinch homecourt advantage in the best-of-five first-round
series against Phoenix. The teams were tied heading into
Wednesday's games, and the Spurs owned the tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan again was sidelined because of torn cartilage in his left
knee. It was the fourth game he's missed with the injury, and it's
questionable whether he'll be ready for the start of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson led the Spurs with 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant led the Lakers with 23 points, and Shaquille O'Neal
had 22.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs got off to a quick start in overtime on field goals by
Daniels and Robinson and outscored Los Angeles 14-9 in the extra
period.
</P>
<P>
   With 1:39 left in overtime, Robinson picked up a foul guarding
O'Neal and fell to the floor as O'Neal elbowed him in the rib area.
O'Neal was called for a technical foul, and Spurs coach Gregg
Popovich was so mad he had to be held back by his assistants.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers led 48-40 at halftime. Though the Spurs lurked close
behind until midway through the third quarter, a 16-3 Los Angeles
run opened a double-digit lead for the Lakers -- 72-57 with 2:11
left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   With a 74-61 advantage entering the fourth quarter, the Lakers
inched further ahead and led by 17 points two minutes into the
period. Then a 10-0 by Spurs reserves got San Antonio back in it.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio pulled to 84-81 on a dunk and follow-up free throw
by Malik Rose with 4:48 remaining. A 3-pointer by Daniels tied the
game at 84-84, two free throws by Terry Porter moved the Spurs
ahead and a hook shot by Samaki Walker gave San Antonio a
four-point lead with 1:58 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers went more than seven minutes in the fourth without a
field goal before tying the game at 89-89 with 29 seconds left on a
3-pointer by Rick Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs ran out the shot clock on their next possession, and
Bryant missed a long jumper to send the game to overtime.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: O'Neal was 4-for-8 from the foul line. ... Lakers coach
Phil Jackson once again had a choice comment about the Spurs
winning the NBA title during last year's lockout-shortened season.
''It wasn't a regular season. This is a regular season. Where is
San Antonio finishing, fifth or fourth? That's the key. Last year
they had a shortened season.'' Jackson made a similar remark
earlier this year ... Andrew Gaze, a member of San Antonio's
championship team last year, was in the Alamodome crowd. Duncan
greeted him at halftime with a big hug. Gaze played basketball in
his native Australia this year.

<HEADLINE> Champagne Flowing in Little Havana  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- With cheers, champagne and prayers, Little Havana
erupted in celebration on Wednesday after federal judges issued a
ruling that extends Elian Gonzalez's stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Saavedra, head of the Cuban exile group Vigilia Mambisa,
hefted a bottle of champagne as car horns blared and cheers of
''God Bless America'' and ''Libertad, Libertad'' rang out through
the community.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know the United States is a land of law, a land of
justice,'' Saavedra said. ''I've been telling people 'don't worry'
all along because you are in a land of law.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling from a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta extends its order keeping Elian in the
country pending arguments in the custody dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez reacted by saying the family
respects U.S. laws, and his attorney said they spent the day in
quiet prayer. Elian later played outside the home where he has
lived since his rescue last November.
</P>
<P>
   By early evening, the crowd had swelled to about 600 people,
many of them chanting and singing outside the home. The family had
disappeared inside.
</P>
<P>
   Rolando Houdayer, a 48-year-old maintenance man, was on Calle
Ocho -- the street that is the heart of Little Havana -- when he
heard about the ruling: ''I'm shaking so much I can't talk. I'm so
glad, I'm so glad.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbaro Rodriguez, a 57-year-old butcher, called his wife on his
cellular phone to tell her the news.
</P>
<P>
   ''We defeated Castro one more time,'' he said. ''I have much
joy.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas, who's of Cuban descent, said he
was satisfied that the court ''recognized Elian's need of due
process of law.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a victory for all Americans,'' he said at a separate
function at the Miami airport.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Saul Sanchez, the leader of the anti-Castro Democracy
Movement, stood in front of the cheering and chanting crowd in
Little Havana and waited until they quieted down.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that God is with us,'' he said. ''This is the second
miracle of Elian. This is not the end of the battle. We are taking
the right way. This little kid also has a voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone shared the crowd's enthusiasm for the ruling. A
plane flew over the home with a banner that read: ''Send Elian home
-- the taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the media frenzy after the ruling, a cameraman for the Miami
NBC affiliate, WTVJ, said he was attacked by a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Rigau said he was filming a live interview with Sanchez
when the reporter barged into the shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I nudged her and she turned and hit me in the back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He later found that he had been struck with a pen, drawing a
small amount of blood. He sought out police.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter, Maria Alvarez of the New York Post, left the scene
in a police car. She was charged with aggravated battery, a felony,
and simple battery, police spokesman Delrish Moss said. The Post
released a statement saying the newspaper believes the charges are
unfounded and that it is retaining a local lawyer to deal with the
situation.

<HEADLINE> Christian Commune Leader Convicted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON (AP) -- The leader of a Christian commune was convicted
Wednesday of charges linked to a series of sabotage attacks on oil
and gas installations in northwestern Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   Wiebo Ludwig, a former evangelical preacher who moved his
extended family from Ontario to Alberta 13 years ago, was the chief
suspect of a police investigation into more than 160 incidents of
sabotage and vandalism since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig has railed against the fast-growing energy industry in
Alberta, blaming oil and gas projects that now encircle his farm
for killing livestock and causing three miscarriages among the
women in his commune.
</P>
<P>
   He was convicted on five of 14 counts, including the possession
of explosives charge from a 1998 explosion at an oil well. The
charge carries a maximum 14-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
   A second defendant, Richard Boonstra, 53, was convicted on one
mischief charge and acquitted of 12 other charges. Both men were
acquitted of the most serious charges against them -- endangering
life, which carried a possible life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks, which ranged from minor vandalism to powerful
bombings of oil-well sites, caused no injuries but angered area
residents and prompted energy companies to implement anti-terrorism
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Though he never claimed responsibility for any attacks, Ludwig
has said he was aware of ''underground activity'' and depicted
sabotage as a legitimate self-defense against pollution that
authorities fail to curtail.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 5, Mariners 2  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Fair or foul? Alex Rodriguez thought it was fair.
Lou Piniella couldn't tell. The umpires, after a discussion, were
sure it hooked to the foul side of the pole. And their ruling is
all that mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's long drive to left, a potential game-tying homer in
the seventh inning, was foul, and he went on to ground out as the
Chicago White Sox beat the Seattle Mariners 5-2 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Third base umpire Fieldin Culbreth made the foul call. Rodriguez
protested and Piniella came out of the dugout to make sure Culbreth
checked with his fellow umps. He did and the ruling stood.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a tough call for the umpire. He asked the other three
and when they had their little pow wow, the decision basically
stayed the same,'' said Piniella, who did not argue after that.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ball hooked a lot and I couldn't tell from the dugout,
either. It would have been fair on a normal day by a good margin,
but that wind really got it and hooked it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a game delayed twice by rain and with a 10 mph wind blowing
across Comiskey Park, Chicago took a 4-2 lead in the fifth when
Carlos Lee hit a two-run single after Seattle starter Gil Meche
(0-1) walked the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   After Stan Javier doubled in the seventh, Rodriguez -- who had
three homers Sunday against Toronto -- drove a long shot to left.
</P>
<P>
   ''The strong wind was unpredictable. I didn't think it would
even be close, I just can't believe the way that ball hooked,''
Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Third base coach Larry Bowa also argued that the ball was fair.
</P>
<P>
   After his initial ruling and after Piniella came out,, Culbreth
met with plate umpire Bill Welke, second base ump Mike Winters and
first base ump Bruce Froemming. The call stood. Television replays
were inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked him if he had it foul and he's got it foul and it's a
foul ball,'' Froemming said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lou said' 'Ask somebody' to Cubby (Culbreth) right away.
Cubby's got a foul ball and then it's a foul ball. It was a very
short discussion. Cubby had the play all the way. It wasn't hard to
see and he was right on the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Did White Sox manager Jerry Manuel think the call was going to
be reversed?
</P>
<P>
   ''No,'' he said with a smile. ''I was, I guess, ready to go
(argue).''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez eventually grounded out after an at-bat against
reliever Keith Foulke that featured nine foul balls, including
another long drive to left. Edgar Martinez walked but John Oledrud
hit into a first-to-short-to-pitcher double play to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox made it 5-2 on a bloop double by Magglio Ordonez
and RBI single by Paul Konerko in the bottom of seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has hit in 12 of the White Sox's 14 games this season and is
tied for the team RBI lead with 16. Four of Chicago's runs
Wednesday were produced by two-out hits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are just more patient and swinging at good pitches,'' Lee
explained. ''The weather today was funny and cold. We did a good
job of getting the two-out RBIs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean Lowe (1-0) got the victory with 2 1-3 innings after
replacing starter Scott Eyre. Bob Howry pitched the ninth for his
first save.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Buhner hit a two-run homer, his fourth of the season, to
give the Mariners a 2-0 lead in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox tied it in the third, loading the bases on a
single by Josh Paul, double by Ray Durham and an error on third
baseman David Bell, who didn't catch Jose Valentin's high pop.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Thomas hit into a double play with Paul scoring. After
Ordonez walked, Konerko hit an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner was ejected by Welke after being called out on a 3-2
pitch with two outs and the bases loaded in the fifth. Buhner
protested the inside corner pitch from Lowe and drew a line with
his bat in the dirt before he was tossed.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The start of the game was delayed 58 minutes by rain. But
after leadoff Mark McLemore was thrown out on a bunt, umpires waved
the teams off three minutes into the game when it started raining
harder. The second delay lasted just 11 minutes. ... The announced
crowd was 8,425, but there were only about 1,000 people in the
stands. ... Eyre, who made the start because Mike Sirotka has
tenderness in his forearm, lasted just 3 2-3 innings, giving up
five hits and two runs. Meche went 4 2-3 and allowed just three
hits but couldn't overcome his wildness. ... John Olerud has
reached base safely in all 14 of Seattle's games.

<HEADLINE> Affidavit Details Lee Contacts  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE (AP) -- An affidavit filed to secure a search warrant
in the case of fired Los Alamos researcher Wen Ho Lee details
alleged contacts between Lee and scientists in China.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's attorneys have argued that the search warrant, served last
April, was illegally broad, and they have asked a federal judge to
suppress all evidence that resulted from it.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, is charged with 59 counts alleging he breached Los
Alamos National Laboratory security by downloading material from
secured computers to unsecured computers and computer tapes.
</P>
<P>
   He is being held without bail and could spend the rest of his
life in prison if convicted. He is not accused of espionage.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge John Conway granted a
prosecution motion to unseal most of the affidavit federal
investigators filed in seeking the search warrant.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit details contacts Lee had with Chinese scientists
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It says Lee passed a polygraph test in 1984 that included his
statement that he did not give classified information to any
foreign government.
</P>
<P>
   However, it says Lee failed to report at least one contact with
Chinese scientists after returning from a 1988 visit to China.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit says Lee recalled the 1988 contact with Zheng Shao
Tong and Hu Side only last spring, while talking about the visit
with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lee stated that he thought Hu Side was an explosives expert,''
the document says, and that Zheng was an administrator with the
Institute of Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics in
China.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said he told the scientists he would not answer questions
involving sensitive information, the court papers say.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit says Lee also had contacts with Chinese scientists
at an international conference in South Carolina and during a visit
to China in the mid-1980s -- both of which were approved by the lab.
</P>
<P>
   After the visit to China, ''he began to receive cards and
letters from these scientists,'' the affidavit says. It says one of
the scientists, Li De Yuan, was a mathematics specialist like Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The court document also outlined a process by which the FBI says
it suspects China identifies and recruits potential spies.
</P>
<P>
   It says: ''PRC (People's Republic of China) intelligence
operations virtually always target overseas ethnic Chinese with
access to intelligence information sought by the PRC.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Travel to China is an integral element of the Chinese
intelligence collection tradecraft, particularly when it involves
overseas ethnic Chinese,'' the affidavit says.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was born in Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Kills 1 at Retirement Center  </HEADLINE>
By JOLYN OKIMOTO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- A man armed with a rifle and handguns
walked into a meeting at a retirement community recreation center
and opened fire Wednesday, killing one woman and injuring four
other people. The unidentified gunman was arrested at the scene,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred about 2 p.m. while the victims were
attending a meeting of the Ventana Lakes community association.
Sgt. Shawn Gormley said there was no known motive.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities described the suspect only as 55-year-old man who
pulled up to the building in a rental moving truck.
</P>
<P>
   Fran Dorsch, a 67-year-old resident of Ventana Lakes, said she
was at the pool behind the club with her grandchildren when people
came out of the building screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought they were fighting with each other, but then they
said a man had a gun,'' she said. ''I heard the shots, 'Pop, pop,
pop.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One woman died after being transported to John C. Lincoln
Hospital-North Mountain, said hospital spokeswoman Susan Fuchs.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republic reported on its Web site that the
75-year-old woman was shot in the head and shoulders. Her identity
had not been released.
</P>
<P>
   Victims Charles Yankowski, 69, and Gilbert McCurdy, 63, were
both listed in fair condition at Lincoln Hospital, said spokeswoman
Polly McGary.
</P>
<P>
   Two other victims were being treated at St. Joseph's Hospital
and Medical Center, said hospital spokeswoman Catherine Menor.
</P>
<P>
   One victim, a 75-year-old woman with bullet wounds to the head
and shoulder, was listed in extremely critical condition. A
69-year-old man was listed in stable condition with a bullet wound
to the chest.
</P>
<P>
   A sixth person was also taken to the hospital, though police
said that person had not been shot.
</P>
<P>
   The community has about 1,400 homes amid man-made lakes, tennis
courts and grassy common areas.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting came a day after a man opened fire at a senior
citizens apartment complex in Michigan, killing two women and
critically wounding another. In that case, authorities said, the
accused gunman opened fire during a meeting tenants called in the
wake of accusations the man had used vulgar language.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Butch Huskey hit an RBI single with two outs
in the bottom of the ninth inning Wednesday night and the Minnesota
Twins beat Kansas City 7-6, the Royals' fifth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Matt Lawton hit a double that bounced over the
head of second baseman Carlos Febles. Ron Coomer grounded out and
Corey Koskie was intentionally walked.
</P>
<P>
   Huskey, who had been 0-for-4 in the game, singled to center off
Jose Santiago (2-1) and Lawton scored easily from second base.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Carrasco (2-1) was the winning pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Mark Quinn turned in the third two-homer game of his
brief major league career and sparked a three-run burst in the
seventh to give Kansas City a 6-3 lead. Minnesota answered with
three runs in the bottom of the seventh to tie it.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn's homers were his first two of the season. The left
fielder had a pair of two-homer games after being called up from
Triple-A Omaha for a 17-game stint last September.
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine Dye homered and drove in two runs for the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Royals starter Mac Suzuki got into trouble early, allowing a
walk, a double and another walk to start the game. The Twins scored
twice, but Suzuki escaped further trouble by striking out Huskey.
</P>
<P>
   Dye led off the second with his fifth home run of the season.
Kansas City took a 3-2 lead in the fourth on Quinn's two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Jensen hit his first AL home run in the Twins fourth. He
also tripled and singled.
Notes: RHP Jay Witasick was scratched from his probable start on
Wednesday night because of soreness in his right biceps. He is
expected back in the rotation for the Royals' game Saturday in
Seattle ... Before the game, the Twins honored the University of
Minnesota women's hockey team, which beat Brown University to win
the national championship last month ... Despite struggling to hit
home runs this season, the Twins lead the majors with eight
triples.

<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Trot Nixon hit a grand slam and four other Boston
players homered as the Red Sox routed the Detroit Tigers 10-0 on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman, Troy O'Leary, Mike Stanley and Nomar Garciaparra
also homered for the Red Sox, who fell one short of matching the
six homers hit in the first seven games at Comerica Park.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rose (1-2) and three relievers combined on a six-hitter in
Boston's second straight shutout against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, who was 4-for-5, hit a disputed home run to start
Boston's six-run sixth. After two singles and a walk against Matt
Anderson, Nixon greeted Jim Poole with the first grand slam in
Comerica Park history.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Garciaparra hit his first homer of the season to
give Boston a 9-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, who homered in the Red Sox's 7-0 victory Tuesday, joined
Tampa Bay's Gerald Williams as the only players with two home runs
in the Tigers' new home.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon added a run-scoring single in the seventh. He was 4-for-5
and had five RBIs to match his career high set in a three-homer
game against Detroit last July 24.

<P>
   Rose, hit hard in his two previous starts, allowed three hits in
six innings. His ERA dropped from 16.50 to 8.25.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit starter Hideo Nomo (1-1), who entered the game with a
string of 15 scoreless innings, gave up four runs on five hits --
including three homers -- in five-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley led off the sixth with a drive that bounded somewhere
off the top of the right-center field wall and back into play as
Stanley rounded first with an apparent single.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox manager Jimy Williams came out to argue the ball hit the
railing above a yellow line and should have been a home run.
Williams argued again as the Tigers changed pitchers and, after
umpire crew chief Tim McClelland conferred with second base umpire
Phil Cuzzi, Stanley was awarded a home run.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Tigers, who were shut out a major league-high 12 times
last year, have been blanked four times this season -- all during
the current homestand. ... Nixon stole second base in the third
inning for Boston's first steal of the season. The Red Sox hadn't
gone far into a season without a steal since going the first 15
games without one in 1987. ... The start of the game was delayed 23
minutes by rain.

<HEADLINE> 7 Guatemala Crash Victims Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Authorities late Wednesday pulled a
seventh body from the wreckage of a small plane that went down in
northwest Guatemala earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Six other bodies were recovered earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   All were representatives of the Wings of Hope Christian
Association, a humanitarian group based in Mayaland in the
northwestern state of Quiche. Officials said at least one foreigner
was aboard, but they said they would not give the person's
nationality until Thursday when the victims' identities are to be
released.
</P>
<P>
   The group left Monday morning in a Cessna single-engine plane
for Huehuetenango, about 78 miles northwest of Guatemala City, on a
humanitarian mission. The pilot later dropped out of radio contact.

<HEADLINE> Bush-appointed Police Chief Resigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas (AP) -- A top law enforcement official appointed
by Gov. George W. Bush resigned Wednesday following months of
criticism over racial remarks he made in a 1998 court deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Police Chief Charles Williams, who took over last year
as presiding officer of the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement
Officers Standards and Education, said in the deposition that the
term ''porch monkey'' was not a racial slur and that blacks didn't
mind being called ''niggers'' 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he was unaware of the statements when Williams
took over the panel, and called on him to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, the Texas Rainbow Coalition asked Bush to
demand Williams' resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ''These recent statements by a man who Bush chose for a
leadership position in Texas raise serious questions about the
kinds of appointments he would make as president,'' said Coalition
Chairwoman Hazel Faulke-Obey.
</P>
<P>
   Williams did not indicate Wednesday whether he would resign as
police chief. He did not return calls seeking comment, and his
staff said he is undergoing cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''After serious consideration, I have decided it is in the best
interest of my personal health and the Texas Commission on Law
Enforcement Officers Standards and Education to step down,''
Williams said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I apologize to those who were offended by my previous comments
and deeply regret not making my points clearer to everyone
concerned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Mike Jones said: ''We have accepted his
resignation. We respect the work that he's done in law enforcement,
and we agree with his decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The deposition was for a race discrimination lawsuit filed
against Williams and his department.
</P>
<P>
   In Marshall, some members of the black community have said they
plan to ask the city commission to fire Williams as police chief.
Several hundred people met at a church Monday night and said they
would send petitions to the City Commission.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks edged higher Thursday morning on
bargain hunting following an earlier weak start. The dollar was
higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which was down
some 85 points early in the session, reversed into positive
territory, gaining 81.72 points, or 0.43 percent, to 19,168.34
points at the end of the morning session.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the average closed up 117.10 points, or 0.62
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 104.67 yen in late morning, up 0.19 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 104.78
yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index started lower on selling
of high technology issues following a drop in the tech-laden Nasdaq
composite index in New York Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said, however, that investors later in thin trading
bought shares in selected electrical industry companies, reversing
an earlier overall drop in prices.
</P>
<P>
   In New York on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
92.46 points to close at 10,674.96. The Nasdaq composite index
closed at 3,706.41, down 87.16.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 1.85 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,621.67
points. The TOPIX closed up 23.42 points, or 1.42 percent, the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar remained relatively steady in
morning Tokyo trading following its strength against the euro in
New York. Trading remained in a narrow range amid a lack of
market-moving news.
</P>
<P>
   In overseas trading, the greenback rose to an all-time high
against the euro before losing some ground Wednesday. The euro's
weakness stemmed from doubts that Europe will take measures anytime
soon to stimulate growth and investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the euro was traded at 98.55 yen, down from 98.94
yen late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.7350 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.7050 percent. Its
price fell 0.26 point to 101.42.

<HEADLINE> Students at Yale no longer have access to Napster  </HEADLINE>
prfons
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- The heavy metal band Metallica on
Wednesday dropped legal action against Yale University after the
school agreed to block access from their computer network to an
Internet site that allows people to trade copyrighted music.
</P>
<P>
   Yale blocked access to the Napster site last week after
Metallica filed a lawsuit against the school, two other
universities and California-based Napster, which makes the popular
Internet music sharing software.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement Wednesday, the band said it would drop
Yale as a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   ''We appreciate the prompt and responsible reaction by Yale
University in dealing with the gross violations of copyright laws
and the protection of intellectual property,'' the band said in a
written statement. ''We thank them for their quick response to the
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Yale spokesman Tom Conroy said that some months ago Yale blocked
access to the Napster Web site during business hours in an effort
to relieve congestion on the school's network. In February, the
school ''alerted'' students to federal copyright laws as they
applied to Napster, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then, at the time of the lawsuit, we notified students that we
were blocking access to Napster continuously, until we could
clarify the legal issues surrounding Napster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Napster software program allows Internet users to search for
and download music directly from each others' computer hard drives.
The music is stored in a digital format known as MP3.
</P>
<P>
   In their lawsuit, Metallica alleged Yale, the University of
Southern California and Indiana University allowed free trade of
copyrighted songs to flourish by failing to block access to the
Napster sharing program, thereby violating the federal Racketeering
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
</P>
<P>
   The band filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles
on April 13.

<HEADLINE> DNA Tests Underway in Wash. Killings  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN K. WILEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Authorities say a National Guardsman
charged with murder in the death of a 16-year-old prostitute is a
suspect in as many as 17 other slayings in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   DNA testing was under way Wednesday comparing blood samples
taken from Robert L. Yates Jr. of Spokane and evidence from the
various crime scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives have linked the murders of at least 10 prostitutes in
Spokane and Tacoma in 1997 and 1998 to a single killer and say
eight other slain women are possible victims.
</P>
<P>
   Spokane County Sheriff Mark Sterk said Wednesday that Yates -- a
father of five arrested early Tuesday as he drove to work -- was a
suspect in all of them, though he was only charged in one.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel like we've arrested the person responsible for up to
18 homicides in our community,'' Sterk told reporters about an hour
after Yates, 47, was charged with first-degree murder in the death
of Jennifer Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph's badly decomposed body was found Aug. 26, 1997, in a
field northwest of Spokane. She was among the eight women
considered possible victims of the same killer.
</P>
<P>
   Yates was ordered held on $1.5 million cash bond during an
appearance in a Spokane County Jail courtroom Wednesday. Yates said
little during his court appearance, other than to request a public
defender.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, I don't have anything to say at this time, thank you,''
Yates said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph, of Spanaway near Tacoma, was last seen getting into a
white Corvette driven by a white male in his 30s or 40s, court
documents indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results of a DNA analysis of blood smears found in a
1977 Corvette Yates formerly owned matched Joseph's blood, Sterk
said. The affidavit of probable cause said blood, hair, items of
clothing and other evidence that could have come from Joseph were
found inside the Corvette.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives spent Wednesday searching for clues behind a fence of
blue tarpaulins surrounding Yates' two-story home in a comfortable
middle-class neighorhood.
</P>
<P>
   Yates, a National Guard helicopter pilot, works at a Kaiser
Aluminum Corp. smelter and has lived in the house with his wife and
five children since March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A sample of Yates' blood was obtained with a search warrant,
Spokane County sheriff's Cpl. Dave Reagan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're focusing on the one homicide at this point because
that's what the evidence suggests,'' Reagan said. ''If we find
evidence that supports his involvement in other case, then that's a
bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   More DNA test results were expected Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Police seized seven vehicles, including the Corvette and two
vans formerly owned by Yates. Evidence found in the Corvette, which
was seized last week, ''heightened our interest'' in Yates, Reagan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives began 24-hour surveillance of Yates after he returned
to Spokane on Sunday from a two-week Army National Guard summer
camp at Fort Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Records show Yates left the Army in 1996 after an 18-year
career. He joined the National Guard as a pilot with the 66th
Aviation Brigade, which trains once a month at the base near
Tacoma, spokesman Lt. Col. Rick Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   While in the Army, Yates was stationed at Fort Drum, N.Y., and
Fort Rucker, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   People who lived near the house Yates rented in 1996 and 1997
before moving to his present home said he frequently tinkered with
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ''He washed his cars incessantly,'' said former neighbor Judy
Kauffman. ''He was always out in the front driveway, changing the
oil'' of the Corvette. She described him as cordial, but said other
members of his family kept to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a neighborhood where if you reach out, people will pull
you in, and they didn't really reach out,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Rockets Fans Bid Farewell to Barkley  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Charles Barkley ended his 16-year career the way
he wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to go out standing up, the Houston Rockets forward
thrilled the hometown crowd with 7:26 to go in the second quarter
Wednesday night when he reported into the regular season finale
against the Vancouver Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, out since Dec. 8 with a ruptured knee tendon, received
a standing ovation amid shouts of ''Barkley, Barkley, Barkley.''
Fans waved cardboard cutout Barkley masks and groaned when Barkley
missed his first shot with 6:10 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich obviously was trying to get
Barkley in the scoring column. Barkley missed his next two shots
before he finally got a rebound and scored with 1:24 left in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That got him another standing ovation, and Tomjanovich took him
out with 1:19 left.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley left smiling, finishing with six minutes of playing
time, two points, one rebound, one assist and a blocked shot.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the sidelines for the second half, a fluffy
recliner awaited him.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets almost had another thrill with a fourth quarter
comeback, but the Grizzlies held on for a 96-92 victory that
snapped a seven-game losing streak. Former Rocket Michael Dickerson
led Vancouver with 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Barkley's night. After the game, the accolades
flowed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has what I call the heart of a champion,'' Tomjanovich
said. ''He always played to win. He put the team above himself and
he always followed the golden rule: 'The open man gets the ball.'
If he was double teamed 10 times he passed it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon also praised Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been my honor to have played against Charles and to have
played with him on the same team,'' Olajuwon said. ''In the
beginning, we thought it was going to be hard to play on the same
team with Charles, but it took only five minutes to know
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockets vice president Carroll Dawson told Barkley that he
''owned the backboards in the NBA'' and then presented Barkley with
the backboard fom which he got his final NBA rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ''You really own this one,'' Dawson said.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley accepted the praise graciously.
</P>
<P>
   ''For 16 years, I've lived every kid's fantasy,'' Barkley said.
''It's unfortunate I didn't come to Houston until I was on the
downside. I wish I could have played my entire career here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets trailed 84-71 with 7:59 left in the game but tied it
at 90-90 with 1:27 to play. The Grizzlies hit six straight free
throws to hold on. Walt Williams led Houston with 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   After a dazzling 16-year career with Philadelphia, Phoenix and
Houston that earned him a spot among the 50 greatest players in NBA
history, Barkley brought it to a close against the Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's career was thought to have ended Dec. 8 when he
ruptured a knee tendon against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But he wanted to walk away -- rather than be carried away -- in
his last game, which is why Barkley one more time despite his knee
being only about 70 percent healed.
</P>
<P>
   For all his flamboyance throughout his career, Barkley finished
with a humble tone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basketball doesn't owe me anything, I owe everything in my
life to basketball, everything,'' Barkley said. ''I'm 37 years old.
I'm rich beyond my wildest dreams. I have great material things.
I've been all over the world and it's all because of basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley considered playing Tuesday night at Phoenix, where he
performed for four seasons and came closest to winning an NBA
championship in 1993. But Tomjanovich didn't want to take a chance
with Barkley's knee still less than 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a sad day for me, I've been playing basketball since I
was nine years old and now I'm not going to be playing anymore,''
Barkley said. ''That's the only thing that makes me sad. I won't
miss the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   ''The difficult thing is that nothing I'll do in my life from
now on will come close to what I've accomplished in basketball in
the last 16 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was the fifth player chosen overall in the 1984 NBA
draft by Philadelphia after a standout career at Auburn. Barkley's
draft class included Michael Jordan, John Stockton and current
teammate Hakeem Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   After playing six seasons with the 76ers, Barkley was traded to
the Phoenix Suns and led the them to the NBA Finals, where they
lost to the Bulls in 1993. Barkley was in his fourth season with
the Rockets when he suffered the injury in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important for me from a mental standpoint to get out
there,'' Barkley said of returning for one last game. ''It's a
mindset thing. It's been a grueling ordeal to get to this point. I
just want to walk off under my own power.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley averaged 22.2 points, 11.7 rebounds and 3.9 assists in
1,072 career games and won MVP honors in 1992-93.
