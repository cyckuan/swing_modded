<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Maize Harvest Back to Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa, southern
Africa's largest maize producer, is set to harvest between 7 and
8 million tons of maize this year following a good start to the
rainy season, the state-run maize board said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the board, some 3.18 million
hectares of maize had been planted throughout the country, a
figure which may rise fractionally as farmers could still plant
up to the middle of January.
</P>
<P>
With a yield in a good rainfall season of between 2.2 and 2.4
tons per hectare, South Africa was on course for a harvest of
around 7.5 million tons in this 1996-97 marketing season starting
May, said the board.
</P>
<P>
That should leave in excess of one million tons for export,
given domestic consumption, including retentions per season, of
around 6.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
In the current season, which was hit by poor rains, just 4.23
million tons were harvested, made up of 2.29 million tons of yellow
and just 1.94 million tons white maize, the country's staple food.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the result was a white maize shortage of around one
million tons.
</P>
<P>
The board figures also indicated that some 370,000 tons of white
maize had already been imported.
</P>
<P>
However, the board expected to export up to 500,000 tons of
yellow maize this season. It had calculated a yellow maize
surplus of around one million tons, but said retentions by
farmers had been high in view of the white maize shortage.
</P>
<P>
In the 1994-95 season, South African farmers produced a near
record 12.03 million tons of maize.

<HEADLINE> ANC, Inkatha Bickering On S. Africa's  Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, January 10 (Xinhua)-- South Africa's ruling
party, the African National Congress (ANC), today regretted on the
refusal by its rival, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), to resume
talks on the country's first post-apartheid Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"it is unfortunate that Buthelezi responded to the ANC's
gesture of reconciliation by launching a wholly unfounded attack
on our President (Nelson Mandela)," said an ANC statement
released here today.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Mandela made a strong statement calling for
Inkatha's unconditional return to the Constitutional Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The call was refused by the "unsatisfied" Inkatha leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi who said Mandela should have directly made
the appeal to him instead of delivering the order.
</P>
<P>
And Inkatha Secretary General Ziba Jiyane said today Mandela's
weekend call had "dealt a further blow" to relations between the
the country's two major parties.
</P>
<P>
Inkatha had withdrawn from the Constitutional Assembly early
last year, accusing ANC of failing to honor the 1994 agreement
on international mediation over Zulu autonomy in Kwazulu/Natal
Province.
</P>
<P>
The accusation was rejected by the ANC which said it was the
Inkatha which withdrew from talks with the ANC on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Inkatha repeatedly said it would not honor any constitution
formulated without its participation.
</P>
<P>
The first working draft of the final constitution had already
been released in November last year.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges UN to Approve New French Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today urged the
U.N. Security Council to approve a French proposal which demands a
U.N. commission be sent to the country to study the suffering of
the Iraqi people under the international embargo.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency,
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf said that the success or
failure of the French proposal depends on the Security Council's
way of dealing with the Iraqi issue and all the negative
consequences in the event of the embargo's continuation.
</P>
<P>
The success also depends on the Security Council's readiness to
deal objectively with mere facts instead of political motives, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has attributed the misery of its people to the trade
embargo the U.N.imposed in 1990 for its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also urged in his statement the Security
Council to release its frozen assets abroad to allow it to
purchase food, medicine and other necessities badly needed for
daily life.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had used some of its frozen assets during 1991 and 1992
but a minority of the Security Council members has imposed new hard
measures and deprived Iraq of using its money frozen abroad, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that Iraq had implemented almost all the
U.N. resolutions related to its invasion of Kuwait, accusing the
United States and Britain of being behind the continued suffering
of the Iraqi people.

<P>
MAPUTO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Primary and secondary
education is in a difficult condition in Cabo Delgado province,
northern Mozambique, as teachers are badly needed there, Radio
Mozambique reported today.
</P>
<P>
The radio reported that the number of students in the
province's primary and secondary schools is expected to reach
110,000 in the coming school year while there are only 2,530
teachers who cannot afford the heavy task to teach all the
students.
</P>
<P>
An official from the provincial education department said
that 15 new primary schools are expected to be constructed or
repaired this year, which will make the shortage of teachers
still more outstanding.
</P>
<P>
To ease up the pressure of the shortage of teachers, the
school authorities are planning to mobilize the teachers
to share more work while the provincial education department
prepares to invite some temporary teachers for the schools.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Snow-buried eastern U.S.
struggled back to life today, with offices re-opening, airports
resuming operation and children returning to school after the
worst blizzard in 70 years left at least 96 people dead.
</P>
<P>
Government and business offices re-opened, grocery stores were
expecting new supply trucks to arrive and postal service sent out
nearly every deliverer to the street.
</P>
<P>
But federal workers in the Washington area were told to stay
home for a third day after up to three inches of new snow fell in
the area Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Major airports along the East Coast resumed operation, with
flights both landing and taking off. Many commuter train lines
went back to full service and buses were running on the street.
</P>
<P>
Schools in much of the eastern part of the United State
reopened today. New York City's 900,000 pupils were told to go
back to school, but schools in Philadelphia canceled classes for a
third day.
</P>
<P>
The blizzard left Philadelphia with over 30 inches of snow,
dumped 27 inches of white powder in New York City and Washington,
D.C. and buried Shenandoah National Park in Virginia with as much
as 47 inches of flakes.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press said at least 96 deaths were blamed on the
three-day snowstorm. Many of the deaths were traffic accident
related. Two people were killed by carbon monoxide poisoning
after they stayed too long in their cars with the engines running
and the tailpipes stuck in the snow.
</P>
<P>
As the blizzard roared to the Atlantic, a new but weaker storm
was arriving. Massachusetts, New York and Maryland already had
light snow overnight. Weather service said more snow could arrive
this weekend.

<HEADLINE> WHO Calls For Sanctity for Patients, Health  Personnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Director-General of the
World Health Organization (WHO), Hiroshi Nakajima, issued today a
strong-worded statement condemning armed attacks and
hostage-taking targeted at patients and health personnel during
armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Although no country was specially targeted, the statement was
apparently a reaction to the assault taken by Chechen fighters
Tuesday on the southern Russian town of Kizlyar in which about one
thousand of hostages had been taken in a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
"A deliberate hostage operation against a hospital is a
flagrant violation of international law and human rights,
including the rights of the sick to get medical help and
protection. Attacking an unprotected hospital full of suffering
patients is immoral. No goals can justify such inhumane methods to
achieve them," Nakajima said.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of health authorities worldwide, he said, WHO calls
on all warring parties throughout the world to respect human
rights of all patients and health personnel and to respect the
sanctity of health facilities. He also called on governments to
help prevent armed attacks or hostage-taking against patients and
health personnel.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Embassy Refutes "Return to Dying Rooms" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese embassy in Britain
today issued a statement, expressing deep regret over the
screening by Britain's Channel Four TV station of the film "Return
to Dying Rooms" last night.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that by picking up few isolated cases in
certain areas and making fabrications to produce a sensational
story, the film, in an attempt to defame China, distorted the
actual situation in China and denied the great achievements the
Chinese government and people have made in improving children's
welfare.
</P>
<P>
"By collaborating with Human Right Watch/Asia, which has
persistently taken a hostile attitude towards China and the
Chinese people, the film producers launched a vicious attack on
China, asserting that children were deliberately left to die," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that the so-called dying rooms do not and are not
allowed to exist in China," it declared.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that the showing of the film will not only
hurt the feelings of the Chinese people, especially the social
workers who have worked so hard for children's welfare, but will
also impair the understanding between the Chinese people and the
British people, and adversely affect the improvement of
Sino-British relations.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese embassy believes that fact speaks louder and the
British people will refuse to be misled," it said.

<HEADLINE> Senior UN Official Urges Fund for Mission in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Human Rights High
Commissioner Ayala Lasso today appealed for urgent financial
support for Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda which he said
would otherwise be closed down.
</P>
<P>
Lasso made the appeal at an emergency fund-raising meeting in
Geneva Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that half of a three million U.S. dollar advance
borrowed by the human rights operation in Rwanda in October 1994
to finance its establishment will have to be repaid shortly and
the U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs, from where the money
was borrowed, also asked the other half to be reimbursed by the
end of March 1996.
</P>
<P>
"This creates a situation which could lead to the abrupt
termination of the mission by the end of January, unless
additional funds can be generated," Lasso said.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment, the human rights mission in Rwanda has
been financed from voluntary contributions. A request from Lasso
for regular budget funding in the amount of nine million dollars
was not accepted by the last U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of the mission in Rwanda, Lasso said
it had made a significant contribution to human rights protection
in the country through the investigation of the 1994 genocide,
monitoring the human rights situation, including the process of
repatriation of rufugees, as well as its efforts to rehabilitate
the Rwandese juctice system.
</P>
<P>
"A human rights field operation of this magnitude and
complexity cannot be conducted in the long-run without a secure
financial base," Lasso complained.

<HEADLINE> UK Defense Ministry Urged to Back Land Rover Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The British Ministry of Defense
(MoD) is under increasing pressure from MPs of all parties to back
a British company Land Rover's bid for a lucrative order of
British Army ambulances, it is reported today.
</P>
<P>
These lawmakers fear that the MoD will award the contract,
worth 70 million pounds (about 105 million U.S. dollars), to the
Austrian company Steyr Daimler Puch.
</P>
<P>
They argue that as the bids are equally attractive, the British
government should choose Land Rover in an effort to secure jobs.
</P>
<P>
Although Prime Minister John Major confirmed on Tuesday no
decision has been made, the MoD is believed to favor the Austrian
bid and an announcement is expected later this month.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Land Rover displayed the new model 130 XD
ambulance in New Palace Yard at the House of Commons to lobby for
the bid.
</P>
<P>
Iain Mills, Chairman of the All-Party Motor Industry Group, is
quoted as saying a coalition of 22 Tory and Labor MPs would meet
the Land Rover representative later today to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very powerful lobby," Mills said, the government would
harm Land Rover's exports if it awarded the contract to the
Austrians.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will also go to Croatia, Hungary and Italy during his planned
visit to Bosnia this weekend, the White House spokesman said
today.
</P>
<P>
But spokesman Mike McCurry declined to give details of the U.S.
president's visit or the order of his stop-over in each of these
countries.
</P>
<P>
The program of Clinton's visit has been kept secret because of
fears that someone might attempt to attack the American President.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the trip is to see the U.S. troops who have
been doing a very fine job helping the parties ensure compliance
with the peace agreement," the spokesman told reporters at a press
briefing here. "The president is confident he will be protected."
</P>
<P>
McCurry said that Clinton will be accompanied by his top
national security advisers and a small group of Congressmen.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's trip to Bosnia follows a visit by U.S. Defense
Secretary William Perry to the former Yugoslav republic last week.
</P>
<P>
The visits are aimed at boosting morale of the U.S. ground
troops in Bosnia. The American force is part of the 60,000-strong
NATO-led multinational operation to enforce the U.S.-brokered
Bosnian peace agreement.

<P>
LUSAKA, January 10 (Xinhua)-- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba today announced the 30-day voters registration exercise,
which is scheduled to end today, has been extended by a month.
</P>
<P>
President Chiluba made the announcement after he had
registered as a voter at the Zambia Red Cross Centre in the
northern city of Ndola.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the voter's card used in the last general
elections in 1991 is no longer valid and eligible voters must
therefore register again.
</P>
<P>
The voters registration exercise must be taken seriously by
everyone because the democratization process depends on the
participation of the people, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He made a passionate appeal to the people to register and
exercise their rights to vote.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the registration exercise has been marred
by apathy so far. Only 20 percent of the eligible voters
registered in the past month. enditem

links I have made with the paramalitary organizations allow me to
know their thinking".

<HEADLINE> 800 Palestinians Set Free from Israeli Jails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 800 Palestinian
prisoners, first group of the 1,200 due to be released, left
Israeli jails today.
</P>
<P>
They were met by relatives after being dropped off at various
locations at the entrance of the Gaza Strip and West Bank. Four
hundred more are to be freed in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
The release fulfilled Israel's commitment to free this batch
of prisoners before the Palestinian Council elections due to take
place on January 20.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to previous releases, the detainees set free today
did not have to sign a pledge of support for the peace process.
Amongst the 1,200 are members of the Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas), Islamic Jihad, leftist opposition groups, and those
convicted of murdering fellow Palestinians who cooperated with the
Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel still insists in its refusal to let go
prisoners convicted of participating in violent attacks against
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
According to Palestinian estimates, there are still 2,800
Palestinians left in Israeli jails after the current release.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Shaath, who negotiated details of the release,
expressed hope that all Palestinians would be freed as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Shaath, Palestinian Minister of Planning and International
cooperation, said, "we understand each others' sensitivities, but
I think, we both have to move forward a concrete feeling of peace
that these people will be released."

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) has donated 45,000 US dollars to assist the
rehabilitation of health centres in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
An OAU source said here today that an agreement to this effect
was signed here last week by Daniel Antonio, OAU Assistant
Secretary General responsible for political affairs, on behalf of
the OAU secretary general, and Dawit Zewde, Founder and
President of the Africa Humanitarian Action (AHA).
</P>
<P>
The donation will be used for the rehabilitation of three
war-destroyed health centres in Rwanda by the AHA, a humanitarian
organization headquartered here.

The AHA was created in Addis Ababa in May 1994 with the
objective of providing emergency relief to populations during
natural disasters and civil conflicts. It has been pursuing its
activities in Rwanda since August 1994. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese swimmers clinched 13
out of 17 gold medals on offer in the first day's competition at
the second leg of the World Cup short-course swimming series here
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese swimmers also brought home 10 silvers and 12
bronzes to atop the tally with a total of 35 medals.
</P>
<P>
Han Xue, who set a new world record in the women's 50 meters
breaststroke last week in Hong Kong, made her winning debut in the
100 meters breaststroke, which she also won in Hong Kong,
</P>
<P>
Han, 15, said she was also confident to win the 50 meters
breaststroke and 100 meters freestyle scheduled on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm in a better form here than in Hong Kong." Han said. "Of
course I wish to challenge the world record tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
But Han told Xinhua that her current target is to gain a spot
in China's Olympic squad in the national qualifying matches in
April.
</P>
<P>
China's other world champions and world record holders Le
Jingyi and Liu Limin also won a title apieces in their speciality
events of women's 50 meters freestyle and 100 meters butterfly.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yiwu, China's first world champion in men's swimming,
scored his third victory in the 200 meters breaststroke, following
the his victories in Hong Kong last week and in Brazil last
December.
</P>
<P>
Backstroke specialist Jia Yuanyuan, who won three gold medals
in the Hong Kong leg, captured the title in the women's 50 meters
backstroke.
</P>
<P>
But the day's first gold medal went to Germany when Troeger
Christian won the men's 100 meters freestyle before the

butterflys in the world.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 swimmers from 16 countries and regions are

<HEADLINE> Ulster Anti-Drugs Group Denies Links with IRA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- An anti-drugs group in Northern
Ireland calling itself Direct Action Against Drugs (DAAD) which
admitted responsibility for killing an alleged drug dealer in
County Armagh last week declared that it has no links with the
Irish Republican Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
According to a report in the Irish Times, two members of DAAD
said their group was totally separate organization from the IRA
and their group was "not concerned with politics".
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Ian Lyon was shot dead on New Year's Day by the
DAAD which repeatedly claimed that the victim had been involved in
drug trade.
</P>
<P>
The DAAD also warned that they had planned to kill two of the
victim's associates.
</P>
<P>
But police in Northern Ireland believed that the DAAD does not
exist as a separate paramilitary organization and that the
killings this organization had committed during the past one month
are authorized by the IRA Army Council.
</P>
<P>
The Alliance Party which keeps a neutral position in the Ulster
conflict dismissed the above-said DAAD's claim as "rubbish" and
said the DAAD was simply a flag of convenience for the IRA.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionist Party has urged the British government to
cease contact with Sinn Fein because of these killings.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Announces New Agitation Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's major opposition
parties today announced a new agitation program to press their
demand for the resignation of Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia to
pave the way for the establishment of a neutral caretaker
government to supervise the elections.
</P>
<P>
The new program was announced at a big rally here this
afternoon organized by the Awami (People's) League, the Jatiya
(National) Party and the Jamaat-e-Islami.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the opposition parties will stage a
dawn-to-dusk nationwide strike on January 17 and a siege to
electoral offices throughout the country on January 18.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties just ended their 36-hour nationwide
strike on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although the Election Commission earlier postponed the date of
the elections to February 15 from February 7, the opposition still
demands that all functions related to the electoral process be
stopped until a neutral caretaker government is formed.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister is the only obstacle to constituting a
caretaker government. After her resignation, all the political
parties will decide on the elections and its schedule," the
opposition stressed.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Irish FMs Meet on Cyprus Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Irish Foreign Minister Dick
Spring urged here today all parties involved in the Cyprus
problem to seize "the window of opportunity" and compromise to
allow progress for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference following a two-hour meeting
with Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides, Spring said, "there is
a strong understanding in our country of the problems on this
island. We have a very strong affinity in Ireland with Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
The Irish Minister said he briefed Michaelides on the
situation in the Northern Ireland peace process and discussed
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He also shared Ireland's experience since its accession to the
European Union (EU) and the benefits EU membership has brought to
his country.
</P>
<P>
Asked which aspect of the Northern Ireland peace process would
be most useful to the Cyprus process, Spring said that "in the
first instant, you must have a willingness to want to find a
solution," noting that creating an atmosphere of "tolerance,
understanding and a willingness to overcome the legacy of history"
is a very much important part of the process of finding a solution
in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there is now a window of opportunity in
relation with accession negotiations with Cyprus six months after
the end of the Intergovernmental Conference.
</P>
<P>
Spring described the Cyprus problem as "a major problem in the
region and one that has long-term and future implications" for
which the U.S. and the EU must work together to find a solution.
</P>
<P>
The Irish foreign minister also indicated that Ireland would
back a proposal for the appointment of an EU coordinator in the
Cyprus peace process.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks, the Cypriot Foreign Minister said the message
from today's talks was that seemingly intractable problems can be
solved if there is a desire to do so.
</P>
<P>
"I stressed the EU role can play in the Cyprus problem and we
expect the EU to come and help in finding a solution to a problem
in a country which will be a future EU member," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, President Glafcos Clerides met with Spring in
the presidential Palace before his departure for Paris to attend
late Francois Mitterrand's funeral ceremony.
</P>
<P>
On his arrival at Larnaca Airport Tuesday night, Spring said
that his government would be "actively involved with Cyprus"
during Ireland's presidency of the EU in the second half of this
year. He said he was on a "fact finding" visit to Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> EC Aid to Combat Diphtheria in Former Soviet Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
has made available two grants totalling ECU 1.98 million (2.57
million U.S. dollars) to combat diphtheria in the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
The grant will be channelled via the European Community
Humanitarian Office (ECHO) and will enable the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the International Federation of the
Red Cross (IFRC) to continue work on a coordinated vaccination
campaign, according to the EC.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF will get a grant of one million ECU (1.3 million
dollars). This will cover Tadjikistan, the country with the
highest level of the fatal cases (630,000 ECU), and the three
southern Caucasus states, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia (370,000
ECU).
</P>
<P>
IFRC will get a grant of 980,000 ECU (1,274,000 dollars) for
work in Belarus(730,000 ECU), and the Russian Federation (250,000
ECU).
</P>
<P>
Diphtheria has made a comback in the former Soviet Union in
recent years. In 1994, there were about 50,000 cases, eight out of
ten of them in the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
The EC said these new grants provided continuing support for
the anti-diphtheria campaign the World Health Organization
launched in late 1994 with UNICEF and IFRC.
</P>
<P>
ECHO's contribution prior to this fresh funding amounts to 3.6
million ECU (4.68 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Sweden Cuts Interest Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 10 (Xinhua)-- Sweden's Central Bank lowered
the repurchase agreement (repo) interest rate on Tuesday by 0.25
of a percentage point to 8.66 percent.
</P>
<P>
The move, the first in 18 months, was made to try to relieve
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
Reactions to the Central Bank's long-awaited shift in monetary
policy were swift and generally positive. The krona strengthened
substantially against the German mark, closing at 4.5737 kronor on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank said inflationary pressures in the economy
had eased.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect that the Central Bank will further lower the
repo rate by at least 1.5 percent, to around 7 percent, in 1996.

<HEADLINE> EU Donates Food Aid to Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Twenty thousand tons of
maize from the European Union (EU) have arrived in Lesotho for
drought-striken people, the South African Press Association
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho's national disaster management authority Deputy
Director Leteketa Molapo said in Maseru that the shipment had
been collected from five entry points on the Lesotho-South Africa
border.
</P>
<P>
The EU pledged the maize aid last year in response to an
appeal by the government on behalf of more than 400,000 people
worst hit by the drought.
</P>
<P>
Molapo said although Lesotho had had widespread rains
recently, thousands of people were still without food as a result
of the devastation to their crops in the last ploughing season.
</P>
<P>
A good harvest following the recent rains could be expected in
May or June, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho is a small land-locked country surrounded by South
Africa. enditem

<HEADLINE> NATO Expansion Costly and Risky: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- NATO expansion would cost
billions of dollars and risk destabilizing Europe, according to a
report in the bi-weekly "Atlantic News" issued today.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "Study on NATO Enlargement: Destabilizing
Europe", estimates that expanding NATO will cost Western countries
at least seven billion U.S. dollars over a 10-year period.
</P>
<P>
The figure could rise by a factor of 10 if advanced weapons are
transferred and new air bases, weapons depots and transportation
equipment are purchased to enable the United States and West
European nations to reinforce Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Eastern European countries which join NATO will
face large bills of at least 2.5 billion dollars. Poland's share
could be some 150 million dollars a year even without building new
military capabilities.
</P>
<P>
NATO's expansion will give it greater military superiority in
Europe, yet NATO has no plans for further arms reductions or to
adjust the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFT) Treaty, the
report noted.
</P>
<P>
The authors of the report, Martin Butcher, Tasos Kokkinides and
Daniel Pleach, recommend that "NATO should not be expanded unless
it is at least to include Russia".
</P>
<P>
They also believe that any other form of expansion "would again
divide Europe".
</P>
<P>
They say that absorbing the Visegrad countries (Poland,
Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia) into the alliance "would
re-open the old religious schism between Protestant and Catholic
cultures in NATO, on the one hand, and Orthodox on the other".
</P>
<P>
They consider that NATO is "dangerously evasive" as regards
the expansion process and has not evaluated the costs, the risks or
the consequences of increasing conventional superiority in Europe,
and that it has not taken account of Russian concerns.
</P>
<P>
The report also stressed that nuclear policy is dealt with "too
vaguely" in NATO's study on expansion, which "ignores the
commitments made on non-proliferation and does not clearly state
if American nuclear weapons will be stationed in the new member
states or not".

<HEADLINE> New Oil and Gas Field in the Tarim Basin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The petroleum department of
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has recently
discovered another large oil and gas field in the northern part of
the Tarim Basin.
</P>
<P>
Tests from four exploratory wells showed that the oil and gas
field is rich in reserves. One of the wells produced 218 tons of
crude and 177,000 cu m of gas daily.
</P>
<P>
The oil-and gas-bearing structure of which the field is a part,
extends for 50 km, according to a local source.
</P>
<P>
The Tarim Petroleum Production Headquarters have verified nine
oil and gas fields, 24 industrial oil-bearing structures, and a
group of high-yield oil and gas wells thus far.
</P>
<P>
According to an expert here, much bigger oil and gas fields are
expected to be found in the area over the next two years.

<HEADLINE> Smoking, Overdrinking May Hasten Alzheimer's Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Smoking and overdrinking may
hasten Alzheimer's disease in some patients, according to the
latest research published in a medical journal today.
</P>
<P>
But taking more than three drinks a day may delay onset in
people who have a family history of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The conclusions came in a study of 829 Alzheimer's patients in
the United States, Canada and Germany by a team led by Dr Lindsay
Farrer of the Neurology Department at Boston University's School
of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
The researchers say that the mechanisms leading to the
disease differ among individuals according to whether they have a
genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
But smokers get the disease sooner, whether or not they have
the predisposing genes, the doctors say.
</P>
<P>
The disease also strikes earlier in patients with a history of
depression, but its onset seems to be delayed by arthritis and
high blood pressure. In the case of arthritis, several studies
have shown that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as
aspirin and ibuprofen delay Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
Heavy smokers who drink get the disease earlier, even if they do
not have the Alzheimer's genes. But non-smokers with the genes can
apparently delay onset by more than three years if they have at
least three drinks a day.
</P>
<P>
Dr Farrer said the preliminary results need to be substantiated
by comparison with people who do not have the disease.
</P>
<P>
Dr Sarah-Jane Richards of the Alzheimer's Research Trust, whose
journal Alzheimer's Research published the study today,
said: "This is the first time that environmental factors and
lifestyle have been explored in relation to Alzheimer's."
</P>
<P>
Eventhough genetic factors are quite important, in the
majority of cases Alzheimer's is not inherited. "If it can be
demonstrated that lifestyle does affect how early you get
Alzheimer's disease then this is something that the individual
might be able to control," she said.
</P>
<P>
The age at which patients got the disease varied widely in the
group, with the youngest patients showing symptoms at 35, and the
oldest at 90. The average age at onset was just over 70.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Pt Satelit Palapa Indonesia
(SATELINDO), a private telecommunications operator, is making
final preparations for launching Palapa-C1, the first of
Indonesia's new generation of telecommunication satellites.
</P>
<P>
The launch is scheduled for January 31 from Cape Canaveral in
Florida, the United States, according to a release by SATELINDO
received here today.
</P>
<P>
The shipment of the satellite to the launch site was conducted
on December 12 last year.
</P>
<P>
Palapa-C1, manufactured by Hughes of the US, is to replace
Palapa-B2P at 113 degrees of the east longitude at the end of its
operational life next month.
</P>
<P>
The new satellite, with a life span of about 14 years, has 34
transponders, 28 of which will be operated by SATELINDO, while six
others will be managed by Pt Pasifik Satelit Nusantara.
</P>
<P>
Palapa-C1's transponders will all be leased to domestic and
foreign subscribers, mainly broadcasting firms.
</P>
<P>
SATELINDO, established in January 1993, also operates
international and digital cellular telecommunications services.

<HEADLINE> Lady Thatcher to Inflame Debate within UK Tories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Former British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher will fuel the feud tomorrow within the ruling
Conservative party by warning that it cannot win the next general
election, due to be held on May 1, 1997, by lurching to the left,
revealed press reports here today.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the former prime minister will make a
speech to a conference on Thursday night organized by the Center
for Policy Studies, the Tory right-wing "think-tank" launched in
1970s.
</P>
<P>
She will be delivering her first speech on domestic affairs
since 1992 general election and will call on John Major's
government to stick to the political principles she laid down
during 1980s.
</P>
<P>
She will tell the depressed Tory party that in order to win the
next general election, it must hold fast to the policies of low
taxation, low spending, getting the state off the backs of the
people, free markets and expanding consumer choice and
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Her speech will come against a background of mounting despair
among many Conservatives about their chances of preventing the
Opposition Labor from winning a handsome election victory.
</P>
<P>
Her speech will be a boost for Michael Portillo, the
Eurosceptic defense secretary who has claimed that he is the
victim of a campaign by left-wing parliament members to discredit
him.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the former prime minister is expected to add to the
left-right split within the Tory party when she warns the Tory
leadership that it cannot keep power by lurching to the left.
</P>
<P>
But she will not criticize her successor Prime Minister John
Major again. Her speech would be the most supportive of Major that
she had ever delivered.
</P>
<P>
She will make the speech to an invited audience of 300,
including well-known Eurosceptics such as Defense Secretary
Portillo, Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley and former Welsh
Secretary John Redwood who challenged Major last June in the Tory
leadership contest.

<P>
Johannesburg, January 10 (Xinhua)-- Swaziland street vendors
clashed with police yesterday in Manzini during a demonstration
against a law regulating their trading, the South African Press
Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
About 500 demonstrators staged a noisy march in protest
against a refusal by the city councils of Manzini and Mbabane to
lift a recently imposed by-law restricting street vendors trading
in specified areas.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said police armed with batons, teargas and rifles
arrived in the city centre to try to disperse the protesters, but
were attacked with stones. Police reinforcements were immediately
called in.
</P>
<P>
Shops and banks in the area were quickly closed and motorists
and members of the public scurried for cover as police fired
teargas and rubber bullets to disperse the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Police waded into the stone-throwing crowd with batons,
beating several to the ground before arresting them.
</P>
<P>
About dozens of demonstrators and several police officers were
injured during the clash.
</P>
<P>
Last week, about 300 street vendors also staged a protest in
central Mbabane, demanding the lift of the by-law barring them
from trading at the city's central taxi rank or street pavements.

<HEADLINE> Music Master Enthralls Chinese Audiences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Lorin Maazel, one of the
world's top ten conductors, and the Bavarian Radio Symphony
Orchestra moved Chinese audiences with a program that included
Strauss waltzes here this evening.
</P>
<P>
Scarcely had the last note faded when the nearly 7,000 people
packing the Great Hall of the People burst into applause for
several minutes, indicating the success of the performance.
</P>
<P>
The music of the "Blue Danube" at the Vienna New Year's Concert
10 days ago is still resounding in the ears of Chinese music
lovers and the director's new year's greeting in their language
still arousing warm feelings among the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"I've heard that the Chinese audiences have been listening to
this program with much pleasure," said Maazel, who has conducted
the New Year's concert three times, "and I thought it would be a
sign of respect for the people who have been so loyal to this
program for me to say happy new year in their language."
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old conductor came to China in 1987, when his
performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 with China's Central
Philharmonic Society left a deep impression on Chinese music
lovers.
</P>
<P>
Now, nearly a decade later, performing for a loyal audience,
Maazel could hardly hold back his excitement. "I would like to
come again much earlier," he said in an interview with Xinhua,
"since I had a very very positive feeling when I was here last
time about the way people responded to music."
</P>
<P>
This evening's performance began with Richard Strauss's "Till
Eulenspiegels Iustige Streiche", and with a precise but relaxed
style, Maazel soon enchanted his audience. At the end of each
piece, he was greeted with extended applause, a sign of
appreciation for his virtuosity.
</P>
<P>
Born in Paris, Maazel displayed outstanding musical talent in
childhood. He conducted his first concert at the age of nine and
gave his first violin recital at 15.
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, Maazel became known in music circles in Europe
and North America for his unique conducting style, with a series
of concerts with more than 30 of the world's famous orchestras to
his credit.
</P>
<P>
Throughout this evening's concert, the conductor and the
orchestra were harmoniously integrated and their collaboration
brought the expressive power of music into full play. At the
audience's insistence, Maazel gave three encores, one of which was
a Chinese piece.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese
National People's Congress, watched this evening's performance and
congratulated Maazel and the orchestra on their success.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A total of 455 companies in
Hong Kong went bankrupt in 1995, compared with 306 in 1994, the
head of the Official Receiver's Office said here today.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the office's work in 1995, Official Receiver Robin
Hearder said there were 481 new compulsory company liquidations
last year, accounting for less than 1.5 percent of the 33,000 new
companies incorporated during the year and for only around 0.1
percent of the total of 472,000 companies in the territory.
</P>
<P>
The corresponding figure for 1994 was 426.
</P>
<P>
He said the majority of the increase in bankrupt cases was
attributable to non-business individuals, only the minority
concerned sole traders and partnerships.
</P>
<P>
He added that although the total number of new court
insolvencies rose in 1995, it was still low compared with other
overseas jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
The businesses mainly affected by compulsory company
liquidations and bankruptcies include garment and knitting
manufacturing, restaurants and canteens, importers and exporters,
electrical and electronic manufacturing, construction and
engineering, and transportation and godowns, he said.

Premier Li Peng and former U.S. President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
Located 100 kilometers south of Hainan Island in the Yinggehai
Basin, the Ya 13-1 field is the largest one in China, and is
capable of producing 3.4 billion cubic meters of natural gas per
year.
</P>
<P>
Developed by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation
(CNOOC), the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO), and the Kuwait
Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company (KUFPEC), the gas field was
completed last October with a successful test run.
</P>
<P>
In an impromptu speech at the ceremony, Li extended
congratulations on the successful cooperation of the three
companies.
</P>
<P>
The gas field is the first large Sino-foreign offshore gas
venture and shows how appropriate China's reform and opening-up
has been, and how sincere the country is in conducting technical
cooperation with foreign countries, Li said.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country, China's demand for oil and gas will
continue to rise. "We are willing to cooperate with foreign
countries in the field on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit", Li said, adding that China's cooperation with the United
States and Kuwait have good prospects.
</P>
<P>
China's decision to divert the majority of production of the
gas field to Hong Kong also demonstrates China's desire to keep
the island prosperous and stable, the premier pointed out.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-US relations, Li said expressed the hope that China,
the largest developing country, and the United States, the largest
developed one, have more common ground than they have differences.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to develop normal relations with the United
States, and hopes that the two countries will increase
cooperation, reduce troubles, and not engage in
confrontation. This is in the interests of both sides, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
If Chinese and American businesses can have good cooperation on
such a large project as the Ya gas field, why cannot the two
peoples maintain long-term cooperation and friendship, Li asked.
</P>
<P>
As long as the two governments adopt long-term views, seek
common ground while shelfing differences, and expand cooperation,
Sino-US relations should develop in a healthy and stable manner,
the premier said.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to make joint efforts with the US side to
overcome obstructions and let Sino-US ties achieve more progress
in this new year," Li said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Bush said that he is fully confident in the
improvement and development of US-China relations.
</P>
<P>
The Ya project has shown the potential of US-China
collaboration, Bush said. Economic cooperation between the two
countries will provide a solid base and guarantee for bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Ya gas field project started three and a half years ago. Of
its 3.4 billion cubic meters of annual production, 2.9 billion
will be sent to Hong Kong, with the remainder to go to Hainan. A
stable supply of natural gas should be available for at least 20
years, sources here said.

<HEADLINE> Breast Cancer Screening Could Save 2,000 Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Expanding a government
breast-cancer screening program to include elderly women could
save 2,000 lives a year, according to a report by Age Concern
released on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that the risk of breast cancer increases with age
and almost two thirds of breast cancer deaths occur among women
aged over 65.
</P>
<P>
However, there is widespread ignorance among women about the
risks of developing breast cancer and their entitlement to breast
screening, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A survey of more than 1,000 women over 65 found that more than
60 percent considered themselves "not very much at risk" and more
than a quarter thought that they faced no risk. More than half
said that they had never had a mammogram.
</P>
<P>
Only women aged 50 to 64 are invited for breast examinations
under the five-year-old government-funded program. Although women
over 65 are entitled to request a screening, many believe this
right applies to younger women only.
</P>
<P>
The report urged elderly women not to ignore the risk of breast
cancer and encouraged them to go for breast examinations.
</P>
<P>
Breast cancer caused 5 percent of all deaths in women and
almost 14,000 women died of it in England and Wales in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Iran Adopts Anti-US Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran today revealed its
anti-U.S. budget totalling 25 billion rials as a tit-for-tat
measure to fight back the U.S. covert-action bill against this
Islamic country.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Qashaqvi, member of the Plan and Budget Committee of
the Iranian Parliament, said that sum of fund equivalent to 14
million U.S. dollars will be at disposal of the National Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
However, the Persian language evening daily Resallat gave no
detail about the special budget adopted by the Iranian authorities
to foil any subversive operation by the U.S. Administration.
</P>
<P>
On the last day of 1995, Parliamentary Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri called for the allocation of a budget for the special
counter measures.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the parliament, Nateq-Nouri said the recent
20-million-dollar budget by Washington against Iran was
"irrational, prejudiced and insane."
</P>
<P>
A member of the Parliament said on the condition of anonymity
that the special commission dealing with next year's budget has
allocated a certain sum of money to "enlighten the world public
opinion and take up the issue of allocation of a 20 million dollar
fund by the U.S. Congress for anti-Iran operations with
international legal forums and thwart this move of the United
States."
</P>
<P>
The deputy said that the issue will be debated in the 270-seat
Majlis, but gave no further details.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said at a recent press
conference "Iran has the right to oppose U.S. 20-million-dollar
bill because it is against international rules, the U.N. Charter
and even the Algiers Declaration which was signed by the
Americans."
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 extremists staged anti-US demonstrations in the
capital of Tehran last week and the leader of the extremist group
threatened to attack U.S. interests anywhere in the world if the
U.S. engages in any action against the Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the relations between the United
States and Iran seem to be much more intense as both sides are
preparing the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Iran's Supreme Court sentenced five Iranians to
death on charges of spying for the U.S. and Iraq. The sentences
were the severest punishment for those accused of espionage in
the country in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Specialists said that the announcement of Iran's special anti-
U.S. budget and the court ruling can be interpreted as a signal
that the Iranian regime is taking tough measures to suppress any
dangerous elements inside the country in a bid to thwart any
spying activities backed by Washington.
</P>
<P>
Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, a hardliner clergy and the member of
the powerful Guardians Council, even called for a purge of
Westernized professors and administrators who criticize religious
ideals in their lectures at the university.
</P>
<P>
Foreign diplomats here said that the Iranian government is
getting worried about the U.S. support to these anti-government
groups in Turkey as the White House has approved the 20 million
dollar covert-operation to destabilize the Iranian regime.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1 million Iranian nationals residing in Turkey
now. Some of them are carrying out anti-government activities.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the approval of the 20 million dollars covert-
action by the U.S. administration, the Iranian government
dispatched its envoy to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Alaeddin Boroujerdi, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Asia-
Pacific Affairs, paid a two-day visit to Ankara with a special
message from President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to his Turkish
counterpart Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
On December 23, the Turkish President told Boroujerdi that
other countries should know that Tehran and Ankara enjoy very good
relations within the framework of mutual interests and Turkey
would not permit any agent to weaken such ties.

<HEADLINE> Riverbank Levels to Be Raised in Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will soon raise the
level of six riverbanks that function as embankments in several
flood-prone areas in Jakarta, an official of the flood control
program said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to Siswoko, head of the Ciliwung rivers development
project, higher dikes will be built to stop water from spilling
over the banks into residential areas.
</P>
<P>
All of the riverbanks in Jakarta, which are currently three
meters in height, will be raised by 50 centimeters, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some sections of the rivers will be widened to 60
meters from the current width of only 20 meters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Public Works Ministry said that at least 250
million rupiah (112,500 US dollars) would be taken from the city's
disaster aid reserves to fund the project.
</P>
<P>
Floods have been drowning Indonesia's capital since last week,
with the worst taking place last weekend. Jakarta has at least 80
districts that are prone to flooding.
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, thousands of families were evacuated, more
than 3,000 fell ill and at least nine people were killed or
missing.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta Governor Surjadi Soedirdja said that the recent floods
were due to "human error," accusing riverbank squatters of
narrowing the waterway.
</P>
<P>
However, some residents distributed pamphlets that put the
blame on the authorities for allowing rich people to build golf
courses and housing complexes in the nearby mountain resort, which
eliminated the vital trees to absorb rain water.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Employees of Pakistan's Wah

three billion rupees (87.6 million US dollars).

share, which was bid by a private company.
</P>
<P>
Under the regulation, the employees' group was asked to
exercise its matching right and it accepted the last bidding
price.
</P>
<P>
However, the group now have to pay the same price for their 10
percent shares that did not go for bidding.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Privatization Commission Syed Naveed Qamar
looked quite satisfied with the earning of three billion rupees
(87.6 million US dollars) for the cement factory.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that it was a good bidding and the government
earned a good price.
</P>
<P>
"It is beyond our expectations," he commented.
</P>
<P>
The total estimated asset of the factory was 7.01 billion
rupees (204.7 million US dollars), including 4.16 billion rupees
(121.6 million US dollars) of liabilities that will be shifted to
the successful bidder.
</P>
<P>
The equity was three billion rupees (87.6 million US dollars),
which is equal to the amount to be paid by the bidder to the
Privatization Commission.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Investigates Reported Kidnapping Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Armed Forces
(ABRI) have received reports that 14 people, including seven
foreigners, were kidnapped in the remote Baliem valley in the
eastern-most province of Irian Jaya, an ANTARA report said today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted ABRI spokesman Brig. Gen. Suwarno Adiwijoyo
as saying that "we are still carrying out further investigation
now."
</P>
<P>
"If it's true that the 14 were kidnapped from the Indonesian
territory, obviously ABRI will handle the case," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, ABRI is investigating whether the
foreigners were employees of foreign companies operating in Irian
Jaya or anthropologists conducting research at the Baliem valley.
</P>
<P>
ABRI will try to find out whether the kidnapping was conducted
by a movement called OPM from neighboring Papua New Guinea, which
earlier kidnapped two Indonesian students and demanded a ransom
for their release.
</P>
<P>
Local tribes have also been suspected of conducting the
kidnapping as they were said to believe that their sacred land had
been trespassed.
</P>
<P>
On the safety of foreigners in Irian Jaya, Adiwijoyo said that
"ABRI guarantees the safety of all foreigners."
</P>
<P>
A diplomat at the German embassy here who refused to be
identified said he was informed on Tuesday that one German, two
Dutch and four British nationals were among those kidnapped.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, Iran Want More Cooperation over Afghanistan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Iran will work
together to put an end to the unabated civil war in neighboring
Afghanistan and bring peace to that country, Iranian Foreign
Minister Akbar Velayati said today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the Islamabad airport at the end of a
two-day visit to Pakistan, Velayati said it is important that both
Iran and Pakistan cooperate in efforts to end the bloodshed in the
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
"It was felt that all the countries, Pakistan, Iran and
Afghanistan should cooperate to bring peace in Afghanistan and put
an end to the internal intrigues undermining the peace process,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to find a viable and acceptable solution to the Afghan
problem," he added.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Islamabad, Velayati held talks with
Pakistani President Farooq Leghari, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
and his Pakistani counterpart Sardar Aseff Ahmed Ali.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said his talks with Pakistani leaders had been very
fruitful and a number of bilateral issues and matters relating to
regional cooperation were discussed.
</P>
<P>
"We exchanged views on a whole range of issues of interest to
the two countries, including Afghanistan, bilateral matters such
as investment, gas pipelines, joint ventures and the regional
situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that after Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's recent visit
to Iran, a number of agreements were signed and progress is being
made to in further enhancing cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Both Iran and Pakistan are cooperating in a number of fields
especially the oil and gas."
</P>
<P>
Iran, he said, has cheap gas and could provide it to Pakistan
through a gas pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, he said, the two brotherly countries are cooperating
in the field of roads and transport which will lead to strong
trade ties and enhanced economic relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Pakistani leaders, Velayati said, both
agreed to further reduce the trade tariffs between Iran and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have already reduced the tariffs to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The talks today between Velayati and Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto focused on further enhancing cooperation and promoting
understanding between the two countries in all areas of common
interest, an official spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
On the Afghan issue, both sides agreed to back the efforts to
bring an end to the factional fighting in Afghanistan and to work
for a peaceful solution which would be acceptable to all Afghan
parties.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to extend full cooperation to any solution
agreed upon by the Afghan leaders and people, reflecting the
ethnic and demographic realities in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to continue regular high-level contacts in
order to promote the process of peace and reconciliation in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Velayati informed the Pakistani government about the contacts
they have made with various Afghan leaders recently.

<HEADLINE> Syria Pins Hopes on Christopher's Mideast Shuttle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Syria gives great attention to
the U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's current Middle
East tour, pinning high hopes on the outcome of that tour.
</P>
<P>
Christopher arrived in Israel earlier today within a new Middle
East tour intended to push forward the Syrian-Israeli peace
negotiations and assess the outcome of the Syrian-Israeli talks
which took place in a U.S. Maryland plantation in a "better and
more optimistic atmosphere," as Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
put it.
</P>
<P>
During his current Middle East tour, according to diplomatic
sources in the Syrian capital, Christopher will try to fix a date
for the resumption of Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations within a
new mechanism and to expand the participation of both parties in
the coming round of talks so as to include military and economic
experts.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that Christopher would seek to bridge the
gaps between the attitudes of Syria and Israel with the aim of
pushing forward the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's recent visit to Israel
had paved the way for Christopher's tour, they added.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Israel, Perry offered to Israel
U.S. security guarantees including the stationing of U.S. troops
on the Golan Heights to keep peace as soon as Israeli troops
withdraw from the strategic heights, in a bid to meet the
requirements of Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here do not think it unlikely for
Christopher to offer new proposals and ideas to push forward the
Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In its editorial today, the Syrian newspaper "Al-Baath",
mouthpiece of the ruling party, called on the U.S. to continue to
act as a full partner in the Middle East peace process on the
basis of the land-for-peace principle and the relevant
U.N. Security Council resolutions.

<P>
According to local officials, three persons are still missing

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Vitasoy International
Holdings Ltd., one of Hong Kong's major soft drink producers, has
ordered the recall of all its 30 million paper-packed drink
products after receiving complaints yesterday about foul-tasting
Vitasoy soy milk.
</P>
<P>
The company has also decided to close immediately its Tuen Mun
plant in the New Territories, which runs 13 production lines
producing 27 different types of soft drinks, according to reports
in today's local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The wave of complaints about the sour taste of Vitasoy drinks
started last week, which led to the closure of the company's plant
 in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province of China, while the products
involved in the latest complaints have been produced locally.
</P>
<P>
Vitasoy estimated that at least 30 million packs of soy milk
products need to be withdrawn, half of which are now widely
distributed throughout Hong Kong and Macao, while the remainder
have been exported.
</P>
<P>
A Health Department spokesman said that they are closely
monitoring the recall and investigation process of the involved
products.
</P>
<P>
Vitasoy said that there is no evidence of health hazards to
consumers resulting from the "sour taste."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Farmer Group Backs Fertilizer Import Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Farmers
Association has expressed support for the government's plan to
import fertilizer which is badly needed by farmers, said a release
by the association received here today.
</P>
<P>
The association said that "the fertilizer shortage is
threatening the farmers, so the government has to settle the
problem quickly through importation."
</P>
<P>
The local press said today that the government has decided to
import at least 75,000 tons of triple-super-phosphate type of
fertilizer in the first three months of 1996 after a recent
meeting of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the Ministry of
Agriculture and the Ministry of Cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
However, several parliamentarians and agriculture experts have
dismissed the fertilizer shortage as baseless, arguing that recent
data showed no less than two million tons of fertilizer in surplus
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia produces at least six million tons of fertilizers
every year and only four million tons are absorbed by the market.
</P>
<P>
They said that the import plan indicates the lack of
coordination between fertilizer production and distribution
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts suspected that the competitive prices of
fertilizer on the international market have prompted producers to
ignore the domestic demands and concentrate on export activities.

constant efforts in exploring new ways to deepen reforms in state
enterprises and establish a modern corporate system.
</P>
<P>
Qiao made the remarks during an inspection tour in Shanghai and
Jiangsu Province in east China during January 2-7, where he noted
that Shanghai has made progress in reforming state-owned

enterprises have very good prospects, as long as they continue the
reforms.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that Shanghai will base its moves on local
realities and learn from favorable experiences of others, so as to
set an example for the country in establishing a modern corporate
system that suits China's situation.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said he believes that Shanghai will play a better role as
a "dragon-head" in bringing economic prosperity to the Yangtze
River Delta areas and the river valley and will be turned step by
step into one of the world's economic, financial and trading
centers.

<P>
FREETOWN, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 500 tons of essential
food items were airlifted to Bo City, southern Sierra Leone, on
Tuesday by the World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Foday Turay, a WFP program officer, in
an interview today.
</P>
<P>
He said the food will be distributed to displaced people there
to arrest a growing sign of hunger.
</P>
<P>
Turay said there is "need for such undertaking due to frequent
rebel ambushes making highways unsafe."
</P>
<P>
He said a cargo plane will transport about four metric tons of
cornflour and vegetable oil daily for one week "to replenish
existing stocks intended for the most vulnerable groups of the
war".
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that some 5,000 tons of food will also be flown
to Bonthe in the south and Kenema in the east "very shortly".
</P>
<P>
WFP will also fly in an aircraft, which will be based in
Freetown to airlift food supplies to the affected areas on a
regular basis.
</P>
<P>
This is the first airlift undertaken by WFP since the civil
war began in the country five years ago.
</P>
<P>
With the main roads leading to the interior now blocked
because of an escalation of the civil war, many towns and cities
are now connected to the capital only by air. enditem

<HEADLINE> Christopher Emphasizes Need for Accelerating Peace Process In 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher stressed here today that as the 1996 elections
in Israel and the U.S. will "inevitably affect the negotiations"
here, acceleration of the peace process is required.
</P>
<P>
Christopher made the point when he was addressing a press
conference with Prime Minister Shimon Peres following their early
afternoon meeting in the Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
Christopher arrived here this morning for the first leg of a
shuttle diplomacy mission between Israel and Syria. The visit is
being conducted in the wake of a productive start in the two
rounds of talks in a U.S. Maryland plantation over the past two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Christopher is due to fly to Damascus Thursday to meet with
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad. He is expected to return to
Israel Friday.
</P>
<P>
There were successful dialogues in the Maryland plantation
though many difficult problems remain, he said. "Although there
are very serious gaps I arrive here in a hopeful frame of mind."
</P>
<P>
Christopher said, "in my meetings here and in Damascus, we
shall talk about next steps."
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the overriding purpose of the U.S. is to
assist the parties to achieve lasting peace, emphasizing that the
U.S. objective is nothing less than an end of Israel's conflicts
not just with Syria, but with all Arab neighbors, and for
development of a framework of cooperation in the entire region.
</P>
<P>
He said that as parties are calling on the U.S. to help achieve
comprehensive peace the U.S. is ready to hold that responsibility
and is determined to carry out that responsibility and "to
intensify our efforts to do anything we can."
</P>
<P>
When asked if the U.S. will put forward proposals of its own
to bridge the gap between Israel and Syria, Christopher replied
that the time has not come for the U.S. to do so.
</P>
<P>
A healthier way, he added, is for the parties to move forward
in the process and "we shall accelerate it in a way that is most
helpful to the parties."

deficit dropped to about 2.7 percent of the country's gross
national product (GNP) at the end of 1995 from the 4.3 percent

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Says Trip to France Depends on Hostage Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today that his planned trip to France for the funeral of late
President Francois Mitterrand depends on the hostage crisis in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Depending on the development of the situation, I shall make
the decision whether to fly to France," the President told
reporters today in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
His spokesman Sergei Medvedev said earlier in the day that
Yeltsin would fly to Paris Wednesday night for Mitterrand's funeral
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin confirmed that a convoy of 11 buses and two trucks
carrying an estimated 250 Chechen terrorists and more than 160
hostages had halted at the Chechen border.
</P>
<P>
"They did not let them (hostages) go, although there was an
agreement that they take the hostages to the Chechen border, free
all of them and then go wherever they like. They have again
violated the agreement," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
However, he predicted that the hostages would eventually be
freed. "They have no other choice. Chechnya is an open field," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russian commandos escorting the convoy would
protect the hostages. "Our forces are ready to take measures,
without affecting the hostages," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president did not say whether force would be used against
the terrorists after the hostages were freed. "If the bandits
free the hostages, there would be one scenario. Otherwise, there
would be another operation," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
After setting off from the Dagestani city of Kizlyar, the
convoy has been reportedly held up near the Chechen border by a
blown-up bridge.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are demanding immediate repair of the bridge and
free passage to Chechnya. They have threatened to kill the
hostages if their conditions are not met. Negotiations are
underway.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Promises More Cabinet Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today there would be new cabinet changes, but refused to
say who may be involved.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made the remarks after announcing the appointment of
Vyacheslav Trubnikov as head of the Foreign Intelligence Service
to succeed Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Primakov was appointed Foreign Minister on Tuesday to replace
Andrei Kozyrev, who left the post last Friday. Kozyrev was
elected to the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian
Parliament in December. Under the Constitution, he cannot hold
both posts concurrently.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Vladimir Kinelev was appointed Deputy Prime
Minister.
</P>
<P>
The post of chairman of the Committee of State Property remains
vacant for the time being. Former committee chairman Vladimir
Belyayev resigned from his post after he was elected to the new
Duma.
</P>
<P>
Asked if more changes were to be expected, Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin said that he would not like to forestall
developments, but added that some conclusions might be drawn from
the president's criticism of his top ministers on Tuesday for the
Kizlyar hostage crisis.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- felling of trees was on a
massive scale for the celebration of Christmas (January 7 in the
country) last week, Ethiopian official newspaper "the Ethiopian
Herald" said in an editorial today.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said the country has already paid a heavy
price for environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
"Millions have perished due to famine and drought in the past,
and millions of others have been threatended as a result of food
shortages," the editorial pointed out.
</P>
<P>
There was a total of 27.2 million hectares of forest land in
the beginning of the 1980s, but deforestation claimed 880,000
hectares or 3.2 percent of the total during the decade,
according to the editorial.
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, lack of regulated exploitation of natural
resources has resulted in massive deforestation, the editorial
said, warning that "soil quality has been degenerating in the
face of scanty conservation programmes that produce little or no
impact on the ecology".

<P>
Speaking on the future of Hong Kong, Li said, "We have full
confidence in the stable transition of Hong Kong and smooth
transfer of power and in maintaining prosperity and stability
afterwards."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's future will not depend on a few people's
irresponsible remarks, but on common efforts made by Hong Kong's
residents, he said, pointing out that its economic ties with the
mainland have become closer and wider. The rapid growth of the
mainland's economy in its reform and opening to the outside world
gives a powerful impetus to supporting Hong Kong's economy and
such support is irreplaceable.
</P>
<P>
Noting that some people in Hong Kong still feel a little
anxious about its future and will wait and see about its
development. This does not matter, he said, explaining: "We
believe that as long as Hong Kong keeps its good investment and
trade environment, those who have left Hong Kong will return."
</P>
<P>
Li said the composition of the Preparatory Committee of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has been thoroughly
discussed and has taken various factors into consideration.
</P>
<P>
The majority of its members come from Hong Kong, many of them
industrialists, he said, noting that it is quite reasonable, and
"It shows our hope that Hong Kong will maintain the position of a
financial, economic, trade and shipping center."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will implement the "one country, two
systems" policy strictly, along with a high-degree of autonomy and
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong", he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will neither send any official to hold a post in the
government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, nor
take away a single penny from Hong Kong," Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind said the smooth transfer of power in Hong Kong is in
the interest of the two sides. "The British side is willing to
strengthen its consultations and close cooperation with the
Chinese side in 18 months so as to realize our common goal," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin: New Minister Does Not Mean Foreign Policy Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today that the appointment of a new Foreign Minister does not
mean the Kremlin intends to make fundamental changes in its foreign
policy, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
The basic principles of Russia's foreign policy "is shaped not
personally by ministers, but proceed from the interests of the
state," the president said when presenting new Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov at the Collegium of the Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"The future of the country, the interests of the state, the
dynamics and effectiveness of our reform depend a great deal on
the external conditions, on the relations between Russia and the
rest of the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, head of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS),
was named Foreign Minister on Tuesday to replace Andrei Kozyrev,
who resigned last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Primakov "is a specialist and a serious political figure," said
Sergei Chugayev, a political analyst for the daily newspaper
Izvestia. "Russia will have a firmer foreign policy, with more
attention being paid to the country's interests," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The new Foreign Minister is a staunch opponent of NATO
expansion. He is also expected to shift the focus of Russia's
foreign policy away from the West, towards which he has much
cooler feelings than his predecessor," a diplomat here said.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here also noted, "it is obvious that
Primakov's appointment is designed to strengthen Yeltsin's image
as a defender of Russia."
</P>
<P>
Primakov, 66, graduated from the Moscow Institute of Oriental
Studies in 1953, and began his career as a journalist, serving as
Pravda's Middle East correspondent in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
He was named deputy chairman of the KGB in September 1991 by
former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, and became head of the
FIS when the KGB was dismantled in the fall of 1991.
</P>
<P>
Primakov joined the Communist Party in 1959, was a member of
the policy-making Central Committee and, briefly, a non-voting
member of the ruling Politburo under Gorbachev.

placement agency has been set up in east China's Jiangsu Province
as part of the province's effort to organize an orderly flow of
migrant workers from rural areas.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of the new agency, Jiangsu, one of the
most developed areas in China, has formed a network for the
exchange of laborers between its northern and southern parts, an
official with the provincial Labor Department said.
</P>
<P>
During a fair held by the agency in this provincial capital,
job placement agencies from all over Jiangsu signed contracts with
18,000 rural laborers.
</P>
<P>
Economic development in Jiangsu is uneven, the official said,
noting that the southern part, with well-developed rural
industries, requires an inflow of workers from elsewhere, while
underdeveloped northern Jiangsu has a surplus of rural labor.
</P>
<P>
However, the official said that the flow of workers from
northern Jiangsu to southern Jiangsu has been chaotic in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary statistics, the province has about 1.2
million migrant workers, only 40 percent of whom are registered
with legitimate job placement agencies.
</P>
<P>
The local governments of northern and southern Jiangsu are now
co-operating with one another in guiding the flow of migrant
workers. To date, two million rural migrant workers from northern
Jiangsu have been organized to work in southern Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jiangsu is placing emphasis on establishing labor
markets. Job placement agencies have been set up in all cities and
counties, and in 80 percent of all townships.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Calls for Educational Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
called for carrying out an educational reform in Lebanon,
according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The call came in a speech made by Hrawi at a ceremony held
Tuesday evening in Beirut on the 24th anniversary of the founding
of the Educational Center for Research and Development.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was also attended by Speaker of Lebanon's House
of Representatives (Parliament) Nabih Berri, Prime Minister Rafik
al-Hariri and a number of cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
"The reality of education and instruction in Lebanon now needs
more than renewal," President Hrawi said.
</P>
<P>
"Any educational reform in our country is linked to its ability
to build up Lebanon and to embody its role in the region and all
over the world. The rebuilding of this sector (education) needs
more than one year and more than one institution," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi pointed out that educational reform in Lebanon is a
nation-wide task, and that what is required is a unified method
for all Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese President called for achieving three urgent
objectives through educational reform, namely:
</P>
<P>
-- To eliminate illiteracy throughout the country;
</P>
<P>
-- To do away with unemployment by linking education to the
labor market and the production sectors; and
</P>
<P>
-- To remove alienation between the citizen and the homeland.
</P>
<P>
"What is required is a type of education to cultivate the
living values of the Lebanese and their effective
citizenship... a type of education to train enterprising and
successful people for the sectors of knowledge, production,
development and inventiveness," President Hrawi concluded.
</P>
<P>
The 1975-1990 civil war in Lebanon, which had negative effects
on education there, brought the illiteracy rate to 20 percent in
1990.
</P>
<P>
In Lebanon there are 300 primary and secondary (middle) schools
and 24 universities and other institutions of higher learning.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Rebels Abandon Bases In Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Ugandan West Nile
Bank Front (WNBF) has abandoned its bases in Zaire and crossed
into Sudan, according to a report reaching here today from Arua,
northwestern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in Arua are quoted as saying that about 200
rebels get no cooperation from Zairean soldiers or food for the
continued stay at their bases, and have thus run back into Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The rebels fled to Zaire because of an earlier defeat they had
suffered in Sudan, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
They have camps in Oraba-Miju-Aziku hill, Ajipaku and mountain
areas of Kajugo, Poki and Ndudulabe in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
WNBF first surfaced in May last year in northern Uganda in an
attempt to topple Uganda's current government and reinstall
former president Idi Amin, who was toppled in 1979.
</P>
<P>
WNBF has 1,000 men whose activities are conducted mainly in eastern
Uganda.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of telephones in
Uganda rose from 32,303 in 1994 to 42,565 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Owora Richard, Principal Public Relations Officer of the
Uganda Post and Telecommunication (UPTC), said here today that
there are 91 telephone exchanges countrywide with a capacity of
58,922 lines.
</P>
<P>
Richard said these are not enough to meet the ever-increasing
demand, adding that the waiting list is currently 5,203, with
2,831 being in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that under the UPTC's expansion program,
scheduled to be completed this year, a 108 exchange is to be
installed in Kampala with a capacity of 10,000 lines.
</P>
<P>
The massive countrywide telecommunications expansion will
touch even some very remote areas.
</P>
<P>
According to Richard, a project aimed at improving telephone
services in 10 towns in Uganda by installing modern digital
exchanges is expected to be completed in the first quarter of
1996 and a total of 7,000 lines will be available in these areas.

<HEADLINE> Rifkind Urges Boost for UK-China Economic Co-operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind today appealed for strengthened UK-China
co-operation on a wide range of issues, especially in world
economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
In a speech titled "China and Britain in the World Economy",
delivered at the University of International Business and
Economics here today, Rifkind said he wants "UK-China bilateral
economic relations to flourish".
</P>
<P>
He told the audience that Britain's stake in China's economic
success has grown steadily. Being the largest European investor in
China, Britain now has over 1,000 joint ventures with Chinese
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Our exports to China are seven times the level in 1979, and
Chinese exports to Britain have been growing even faster, rising
16-fold in the same period," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary said "We want China to join the World
Trade Organization (WTO), accepting the obligations that
membership entails, as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to work towards that goal, including working
together with the European Commission, which represents the
European Union in these matters," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU has recognized China's right to developing
country status without diluting its WTO obligations, and said he
hoped that China could show flexibility in the negotiations on
membership.
</P>
<P>
"Britain and China have a great deal of business to do together
in the coming years," he said, pointing out that the vital issue
will be Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Ensuring the smooth and successful transition of Hong Kong is
the first priority for both countries, he said. "In my view, the
best guarantee of that success is to continue to build on the
foundations laid down 11 years ago in the Sino-British Joint
Declaration," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that Britain could take a share in China's
infrastructure, communications and transportation construction, as
China "will be able to draw on Britain's long experience as a
major financial center."
</P>
<P>
Rifkind also fielded questions raised by students of the
university.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM: Chechen Terrorists to Be Punished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said today that the Chechen terrorists who took some
3,000 people as hostages in the Daghestani city of Kizlyar, would
be punished.
</P>
<P>
"But we do not intend to use headlong methods which mean risks
for the lives of the hostages," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin made the remark after a signing ceremony of
Russian-Kirghiz documents on forming a customs union.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 Chechen terrorists, headed by Salman Raduyev, the
son-in-law of rebel Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, stormed
into Kizlyar on Tuesday and took over 3,000 people into the city
hospital as hostages.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen demanded that all Russian troops be pulled out of
Chechnya and its neighboring regions.
</P>
<P>
During the negotiations held overnight, Moscow told the Chechen
terrorists that it would not meet their demands and that their
lives are at stake if they continue their terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
Moscow also warned the gunmen that their families and relatives
would be persecuted and the Daghestani people would hate all the
Chechens for what they did to the innocent Kizlyar civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen terrorists agreed after the talks to leave the city
early this morning, when they released a majority of the
hostages. But they are still holding more than 160 hostages with
them.
</P>
<P>
The terrorists, who left the city in 11 buses and two KAMAZ
trucks, stopped about 10 kilometers from the Daghestani-Chechen
administrative border near the village of Pervomaiskoye. They
demanded that representatives from the command of Russian troops
meet with them and that their safe movements in Chechnya be
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Talks are now underway between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Mopping-up operations against other Chechen terrorists were
conducted in Kizlyar right after the convoy of the abductors and
their hostages left the city.
</P>
<P>
The raid of the terrorists left three policemen dead, 13 other
people wounded, and two missing.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The People's Insurance Company
of China (PICC) has provided coverage worth more than two billion
US dollars for joint ventures in northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province since 1980.
</P>
<P>
The Heilongjiang branch of PICC, China's No.1 insurer, has
helped the province introduce foreign capital, conduct foreign
trade and widen economic and technological cooperation with
overseas partners, said an official with the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
A foodstuff factory in Jiamusi, a city in northern
Heilongjiang, got 22.6 million yuan in indemnities from PICC after
an explosion destroyed its imported equipment. It was purchased
with loans in foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
A polyester plant received more than 800,000 US dollars for the
damage to its imported materials.
</P>
<P>
Some projects with foreign investment, such as the first phase
of the project to produce 300,000 tons of ethylene in Daqing,
China's prime oilfield, have been conducted successfully with the
insurance by PICC.
</P>
<P>
The official said that PICC has offered more than 20 kinds of
policies to about 40 percent of the joint ventures in major cities
and regions in the province, and has established business
relations with more than 100 countries and regions to provide
convenient services for its clients.

<HEADLINE> 22nd Toys and Games Fair Opens in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The 22nd Hong Kong Toys and
Games Fair opened here today with an opportunity for local and
overseas businessmen for strong sales.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC), the
 fair, which is said to be the largest of its kind in Asia and one
 of the top three such international events, attracted 930
exhibitors, including 300 from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Along with 630 of Hong Kong's leading toy makers, the fair
features a new national pavilion from Thailand and large
delegations from China, Germany, Netherlands, Israel and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
According to TDC, Hong Kong has become one of the world's top
toy exporters. Last year Hong Kong exported 67 billion HK dollar
(8.5 billion US dollars) worth of toys, dolls and games, up 14
percent over the same period in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Young, chairman of TDC's Advisory Committee, said that
the toy industry is becoming ever more competitive and price
sensitive.
</P>
<P>
He said that to remain on top, Hong Kong producers must
maximize their quality and productivity by ensuring high standards
 on all matters relating to manpower resources, working conditions
 and product safety.
</P>
<P>
He said international buyers will find here every conceivable
type of toys, dolls and games, from the most high-technology
electronics items to the simplest wooden playthings, from plush to
 plastics and a great deal more, including toy-industry machinery,
 parts, accessories and raw materials.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Hong Kong is a gateway to China, a market with a
rapidly growing appetite for toys, and this four-day fair also
provides an effective platform for manufacturers and traders to
break into the enormous market.

HONG KONG, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's property market
improved last month with a number of transactions recording the
biggest month-on-month growth since April, according to the Land
Registry.
</P>
<P>
Land transactions in December 1995 increased 32.5 percent to
10,613 compared with November.
</P>
<P>
Compared with December 1994, the growth of the property market
rose even higher at over 46.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Property analysts attributed the increase in transactions last
month to the improved secondary market and sales of new
developments including 1,192 flats from the Private Sector
Participation Scheme.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported that the secondary market continued to
dominate the transactions last month, with 7,074 second-hand
properties sold in November, up 51 percent compared with 4,679 in
September.
</P>
<P>
But, the Land Registry added, despite the increase in deals,
the number of property transactions last year was 97,469, the
lowest volume since 1990.

PHNOM PENH, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A 1,000-year-old group of
kilns have been found in Cambodia's northern province of Siem
Reap, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in the Light of Cambodia, the group of

Archaeologists believed these kilns, located about 40
kilometers north of Wat Angko, the famous capital of ancient
Cambodia, were built during the 9th century, that is, before the
Angko Dynasty, the most powerful reign in Cambodian history.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Promote Cruise Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will further
promote its cruise industry to boost the earnings of its ports,
Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik told a press conference here
today.
</P>
<P>
He said that income from cargo-handling at the country's ports
was respectable but even higher revenues were possible if the
ports can also be used as cruise terminals.
</P>
<P>
"The cabinet today agreed that the cruise industry should be
promoted as it has a lot of potential," Ling said.
</P>
<P>
If member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) could develop the region into the Caribbean of the
East, considerable earnings would be generated by the cruise
industry, said Ling.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the region's cruise destinations, like Port Klang
(Malaysia), Phuket (Thailand), Medan (Sumatra) and Singapore,
could be packaged for tourists.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, Ling said, existing or future terminals
should be equipped with cruise jetties, baggage-handling
facilities, customs clearance offices and shops to cater for
tourists.
</P>
<P>
He also named Malaysia's Langkawi, Kuantan, Pulau Pinang and
Tawau as viable cruise destinations.

<HEADLINE> Buthelezi Rejects Mandela's Call To Return To Constitutional Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 10 (Xinhua)-- Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi yesterday rebuffed President
Nelson Mandela over his call to the IFP to return to the
Constitutional Assembly, the local daily "the Citizen" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech delivered at the weekend on the 84th
anniversary celebrations of the African National Congress (ANC),
Mandela said he wanted to repeat his call for the IFP to rejoin
the Constitutional Assembly unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
However, Buthelezi, also Home Affairs Minister of the South
African government, said the president should have appealed
directly to the IFP.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's call was not genuine because the African National
Congress (ANC) had already said repeatedly they would finalise
the constitution regardless of whether the IFP was there or not,
said Buthelezi.
</P>

The IFP withdrew from the Constitutional Assembly early last
year in protest at the ANC's failure to honour an agreement on
international mediation in the Zulu autonomy before general
elecions in April 1994.

The IFP had reiterated that it would not recognise a

acknowledged privately that a constitution passed without the IFP
would be hard to enforce.

The first working draft of the final constitution was released
in November last year, but analysts said it served more to
isolate problems than to identify answers. enditem

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Calls for Stable, Constructive Sino-US ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin today
called for Sino-U.S. positive joint efforts to effect "stable and
constructive" bilateral ties with a view to maintaining and
expanding the trend of growing relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the call during a meeting with visiting former
U.S. president George Bush in Zhongnanhai, the site of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee and the central government,
today.
</P>
<P>
The past year was not a quiet year for Sino-U.S. relations,
during which he met with President Bill Clinton in New York in
October and Vice-president Gore in November in Osaka, Japan while
attending the APEC summit meeting, Jiang said. The two meetings
were fruitful and played positive roles in restoring and improving
Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The maintaining and development of a "healthy and stable"
bilateral relation not only accords with the fundamental interests
of the people of both countries, but also benefits the maintenance
of peace, stability and development in the Asian-pacific region
and in the world at large, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Citing that the question of Taiwan as the "most important and
most sensitive one" that affects the Sino-U.S. ties, Jiang said
the history of the development of Sino-U.S. relations has time and
again shown that the Taiwan issue, if not handled properly, will
exert a very destructive role on the development of bilateral
relations, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed the hope that the U.S. side would strictly
abide by the principles set in the three joint communiques signed
between the two countries in handling the Taiwan issue so as to
ensure that no major twists and turns would occur again in Sino-US
relations.
</P>
<P>
Bush held that the Sino-U.S. ties are very important to both
sides, and showed his joy to see that the bilateral relations
between the two countries have improved and developed thanks to
the joint efforts of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Bush said he hopes that the sustained development trend of the
U.S.-China relations will be maintained in the new year. He also
promised to contribute his part to promoting the bilateral
exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The former US president and Mrs. Bush are here as special
guests of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) to
attend the celebrations to mark the operation of the Ya 13-1 gas
field, co-developed by the CNOOC, the Atlantic Richfield Company
(ARCO) of the United States, and the Kuwait Foreign Petroleum
Exploration Company (KUFPEC). The 13-1 field is projected to have
an annual gas production of 3.4 billion cubic metres, of which 2.9
billion is piped to Hong Hong and 500 million cubic metres to
Hainan Province. The gas supply to the two places will be
guaranteed for at least 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia To Set Up More Breast Cancer Clinics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian Health
Ministry said today that it had targeted one breast cancer clinic
for every one million of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after opening a seminar on breast cancer here today,
Malaysian Health Minister Chua Jui Meng told reporters that the
ministry has planned to set up 20 breast cancer clinics over the
country by the year 2000 to promote early detection and treatment
of the disease.
</P>
<P>
He said 14 such clinics have already been built in the country,
and they have been successful in encouraging a significant number
of women to seek treatment, especially in the early stage of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the setting up of breast cancer clinics in 1992, 75
percent of women in the country who sought treatment in hospitals
were in the final stage of the disease. Just a year after the
clinics were open, the rate dropped to 42 percent, Chua said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed an increase in the number of breast cancer
cases in the country. It is reported that more than 3,000 patients
have been detected up till November last year compared with about
2,000 in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
There were 156 deaths from breast cancer in Malaysia in 1995
compared with 150 in 1994. It is also reported that worldwide,
breast cancer kills about 250,000 women each year.
</P>
<P>
The Health Minister also urged non-governmental organizations
and foundations to donate more equipment for the breast cancer
clinics.

<HEADLINE> Manila Notes Lack of Legal Protection for Migrant Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Foreign Secretary
Domingo Siazon today revealed that there are as many as two
million men and women working outside their countries within the
Asia Pacific region who have been victims of abuse and
exploitation caused by a lack of legal protection.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of a two-day APEC (Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation) ministerial meeting on human resources
development, Siazon said the vast numbers of these victims are
"unskilled workers."
</P>
<P>
He added that most of these cases occurred due to a lack of
social welfare and cultural sensitivity in both labor-sending and
labor receiving countries.
</P>
<P>
"This sometimes poses a classic chicken and egg dilemma for
developing nations..." Siazon said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Siazon challenged delegates attending the APEC
ministerial meeting to make a response to two major problems that
have arisen in Asia -- a massive transregional flows of migrant
labor and shortages in skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is compounded by the need in all APEC members to
continuously train and upgrade their human resources in step with
the modernization of their respective industrial and economic
structures," he said.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the labor problem in the region is
significantly "acute."
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, he said, the labor demand was for thousands in
1993, citing a similar situation in other Asian countries and
regions like Malaysia, Hong Kong and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Saizon added, these problems must be solved through
upgrading human resources toward the modernization of their
respective industrial and economic structures.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Disfavours Isolation Of Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), Salim Ahmed Salim, has made
it clear that that he does not subscribe to the isolation of
Nigeria following the executions of nine Ogoni activists last
November.
</P>
<P>
But this does not mean that he privately or publicly supports
General Sani Abacha's government in Nigeria, Salim added.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief made the remarks at the University of Dar es
Salaam on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"At no point, either privately or publicly did I endorse
support for the Abacha administration," he said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU is being pictured as if it embraces the executions,
Salim said, adding that actually he was among leaders who
appealed for clemency and after the killing he had to defer his
visit to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
On Rwanda and Burundi, Salim said both the separation of the
major tribes in those states and the recolonization theory as
suggested by certain influential people are "unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
He warned that the OAU and the international community would
not sit by if a replica of the trauma which took place in Rwanda
and Burundi happens.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Yangshuo, a small county on the
banks of the scenic Lijiang River, is attracting an increasing
number of tourists as new tourism programs are provided.
</P>
<P>
Touring the streets and lanes of Yangshuo, which is considered
to have the best landscape in the famed Guilin scenic area, one
can find numerous stalls renting out bicycles.
</P>
<P>
The service is designed for the some 50,000 Chinese and
overseas tourists who come to Yangshuo each year. They pay only
five or ten yuan (0.6 to 1.2 US dollars) for a bicycle to tour the
picturesque town for a day.
</P>
<P>
While the natural beauty is enthralling, Yangshuo is also known
as a home to Chinese painting and calligraphy. Travelers can ride
bicycles directly to rural homes to watch how local artists work
at their masterpieces. Some overseas tourists also stay to take
painting and calligraphy courses run specially for them.
</P>
<P>
The magnificent landscape and booming tourism have also
produced a by-product -- growing marriages between local girls and
boys with overseas travelers. Incomplete statistics show that 23
foreign girls have found spouses in Yangshuo.
</P>
<P>
Yangshuo is also one of the places in China where one can find
the most numerous signboards written in English, to the delight of
foreign travelers.
</P>
<P>
It is said that there are at least 5,000 people in this small
town with a population of 20,000 who can speak some English to
cater to tourist needs. Some can even speak Japanese, German and
French. A foreign language institute located at the county seat
has hired foreign teachers.
</P>
<P>
Probably because of the convenient environment, Yangshuo has
seen more and more overseas backpackers, whose number is estimated
at an impressive 60,000 annually.

<HEADLINE> China Urged to Further Curb Price Hikes in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- China should spare no efforts
to rein in price hikes in 1996, according to official reports.
</P>
<P>
"Administrative measures, including price ceilings, fiscal
subsidies and postponing of price re-adjustments, have helped the
government temporarily curb price rises," Ye Zhen, spokesman for
the State Statistics Bureau, was quoted as saying by today's
"People's Daily".
</P>
<P>
"Price hikes will rebound without these measures," Ye warned.
</P>
<P>
Cost and demand may drive up prices at the same time, and
pressures in different departments for raising prices remain
strong, and will become stronger in 1996, he cited as factors
igniting inflation.
</P>
<P>
"Some uncertain factors in economic operations and reforms may
also fuel inflation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The official, however, predicted that "it is possible to put
the rise of the retail price index under ten percent in 1996."
</P>
<P>
He explained that as retail prices rose less than nine percent
last December, and the slowdown trend will continue for a period,
the movement of commodity prices is expected to follow a "U" track
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
To contain price hikes, the government should stick to the
moderately-tight monetary policy, control investment to avoid
investment fever, develop the economy constantly, and increase the
input into agriculture so as to raise farmers' incomes and ensure
bumper harvests.
</P>
<P>
Management and supervision should be strengthened over prices,
especially those of major products, price re-adjustments should be
introduced at appropriate times, and some products in urgent
demand on the domestic market should be imported to fight
inflation, he said.

the Chinese Personnel Ministry Xu Songtao said that China is
willing to develop cooperation and exchanges on HRD with other
APEC economies on the basis of equality, mutual benefit and

<P>
He said that due consideration should be given to special

efficient utilization of human resources, and the improvement of
the quality of human resources and the level of management," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Bookstores Regain Popularity in Coastal Areas (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With much larger space and more books on shelves, the bookstore
sold 100,000 yuan-worth of books on the first day of its
reopening, three times what it used to do.
</P>
<P>
This capital of Fujian Province, newly built up a "book city"
by uniting scattered Xinhua chain stores. An official in charge of
the book city said that he has several thousands of customers
every day.
</P>
<P>
"Each day we sell many books of different kinds," he said. "It
is rare since the late 1970s, when the country started its reform
and opening-up drive."
</P>
<P>
Besides, private bookstores also attract many readers with
their flexible management.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Xiamen alone has seen more than 250
bookstores spring up in its downtown area in the past two
years. Along the business street of the city there have also
appeared dozens of bookstores.
</P>
<P>
"The re-appearance of bookstores shows that people are looking
for a spiritual balance," said Ma Yucong, a scholar with the
Academy of Social Sciences of Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
After several years of seeking only material enjoyment, people
found their spiritual world a desolate one, Ma said, adding that
the social impact of culture can not be evaluated in monetary
terms.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that less people have been visiting dance halls
and restaurants recently. Attending training courses in computer
science, foreign languages and commercial management is becoming
the choice of more people of different ages.
</P>
<P>
"It was the better-educated people in Fuzhou who first began to
make money. The future money-makers will still be these people,"
said a man named Wang who runs a bookstore, "so people are
visiting bookstores again."
</P>
<P>
However, Ma Yucong said he believed that the reappearance of
bookstores in coastal areas was not enough to prove that people
are becoming more conscious of culture.
</P>
<P>
"As the planned economy is transformed into the market economy,
people get a strong feeling of alienation," he said, calling for
administrative guidance to boost the habit of reading among the
general public.

FUZHOU, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Liu Yi, working in the
Department of Finance of southeast China's Fujian Province, visits
the "Luzhou (Oasis) Bookstore" every week.
</P>
<P>
"I prefer bookstores to dance halls," said Liu, who graduated
from the People's University of China in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Luzhou, together with several other bookstores, is located in
an area near many departments of the provincial government. With
fresh flowers outside the door and a floor space of only 20 sq m,
the store houses books on the social sciences, best-sellers and
reference works.
</P>
<P>
The rapid economic growth and the much-improved living
standards of the people in the coastal areas of the country have
become a focus of public attention during the past decade. As
color TV sets, audio-visual equipment and microwave ovens have
been introduced to ordinary households in these areas, less people
visit bookstores and spend less on books.
</P>
<P>
Bookstores were then moved out of the downtown area, and dance
halls and restaurants sprang up.
</P>
<P>
However, the sharp contrast has been seemingly changing
recently. The Xiamen Special Economic Zone, an eastern city in the
province which has experienced rapid economic growth, spent nine
million yuan (over one million US dollars) to make the Xinhua
Bookstore's Xiamen branch reopen in the city's commercial
district. Xinhua Bookstore is the largest chain store selling
books in the country.

<HEADLINE> Environment Protection Given Priority in Hainan's Five-year Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Environmental protection was
highlighted in future plans for the economic and social
development of Hainan, south China.
</P>
<P>
The tropical land is a separate province and a major vacation
resort.
</P>
<P>
For the remaining years of this century, Hainan officials
emphasized that their new economic and social development plan
states rapid commercial and industrial growth "will not be
achieved at the expensive of the environment."
</P>
<P>
Hainan Island, southwest of Hong Kong, is the largest special
economic zone in China.
</P>
<P>
The tropical tourist island is believed to be the only
well-populated land in China which is not polluted, because
industrial development only began in recent years, provincial
officials noted. Hainan will not follow the example of polluting
the environment first and cleaning its up later as in some other
developed countries, they added.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, Hainan's local governments should
continue to strictly limit or ban the industrial projects which
are technologically backward, small-scale and polluting.
</P>
<P>
All the construction projects are planned to be up to the
standards required by the provincial environment protection
program. Large public works and industrial projects, especially
major chemical works, will be required to meet environmental
standards.
</P>
<P>
Projects involving petrochemical, paper-making, metallurgical
and building material industries will be confined to the heavy
chemical industrial zone in western parts of the island. They
should also be technologically advanced, large-scale and with
their pollutants treated in an effective way, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Several anti-pollution water treatment plants will be built in
the next five years,they added.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Hainan provincial policy-making departments
said "a better environmental protection is of great significance
to the future development of the province and a sound natural
environment would certainly attract more investors and tourists".
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that Hainan's atmosphere, water, and
ecological resources remain largely or totally unpolluted.

Facing the challenge of human resources development, he said
that first, APEC must consider establishing effective information
networks on labor, capital and investment markets.
</P>
<P>
A sound system of forecasting of trends and needs in human
resources development and in industries should be evolved, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Second, he said that governments, industries and workers must
devise a mechanism through which they can all take part in
implementing cost-effective human resources development programs.
</P>
<P>
Third, he noted that technology transfer and technical
assistance should be put firmly in place as part of the overall
strategy for building strategic alliances.
</P>
<P>
And fourth, he added that a continuing forum of dialogue,
discussions and consensus-building on policy issues is necessary
given the diverse cultures and experiences of APEC members.
</P>
<P>
He indicated, "only joint action can translate the principle we
all profess into benefits that will concretely redound to our
peoples and our economies."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Philippine Labor Secretary Jose Brillantes said that
APEC is called upon to provide more opportunities for development
arising from economic changes that are being currently
experienced.
</P>
<P>
"The complementary development of economies and human resources
could unleash the march to sustainable higher progress," he added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Names New Secret Service Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres has named Ami Ayalon, former OC Navy Adm., as the new
chief of the Israeli General Security Services, Israel Radio
reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the GSS chief has been named
publicly, and it is also the first time that a man from outside
the GSS was appointed the director of the secret security
organization.
</P>
<P>
Ayalon, 59, who retired from his post as the commander of the
Israeli Navy last week, had reportedly been one of the principal
candidates for the new GSS chief.
</P>
<P>
Ayalon originally turned down the offer to be the new GSS head
some times ago, however, he reconsidered his decision following a
personal appeal from Peres.
</P>
<P>
This came after the sudden resignation this week of the
outgoing GSS head, whose name can still not be published and only
can be identified as "K," over the failure to protect late Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin who was assassinated on November 4 last
year in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The GSS head met yesterday with the members of the Services and
explained his reasons for resigning, saying he was not concerned
about the findings of the Shamgar Commission of inquiry into
Rabin's assassination.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Shamgar Commission sent a warning letter to
the GSS chief, detailing his alleged failures in running the GSS
and saying that disciplinary and legal action may be recommended
against him.
</P>
<P>
The warning letter was also sent to five senior GSS officers
and one police officer, but it is not known yet whether there will
be more resignations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel Television yesterday quoted "K" as saying
that the GSS is strong and stable, and that he will remain in the
post until his successor is settled.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Rabin's assassination, the GSS chief offered
his resignation, but it was then rejected by Peres.
</P>
<P>
However, the GSS chief handed in his resignation letter again
Monday, saying he determined to step down because of "the failure
that resulted in the terrible murder."
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Peres said in a statement that he accepted the
resignation "with regret," at the insistence of the GSS
head.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Foreign Investment Pattern Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The amount of foreign
investment poured into this largest industrial center of China
increased by 510 million US dollars in 1995, although fewer new
projects were approved by the local government.
</P>
<P>
The local government approved the establishment of 2,845
overseas-funded enterprises in 1995, 957 less than the previous
year's figure.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of overseas investment in the city's total investment
scale rose from 29.25 percent in 1994 to last year's 30.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon indicated that overseas investors would like to
gain larger shares of the Chinese market, said Uwe Rosenberger,
deputy executive of the Germany-based Hella Company.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that his company had signed, with the Pudong
Bicycle-Lamp Plant, a contract which cost an investment of 16
million marks, 55 percent of which was provided by the German
company.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Municipal Commission of
Foreign Economic Co-operation and Trade: industrial products
totalled 1,796, making up 63.13 percent of the total
overseas-funded projects. Telecommunications, household electrical
appliances and hi-tech products have also attracted overseas
investors' attention.
</P>
<P>
So far, Shanghai has approved 13,586 projects invested in by
companies from 71 countries and regions, and signed contracts
worth 34.3 billion US dollars. Hong Kong, Japan and the United

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Bid for Short-course Swimming Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is to bid for
hosting the 1999 world short-course swimming championships, a
senior official of the Hong Kong Amateur Swimming Association
(HKASA) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Wong Man Chiu, honorary secretary of the HKASA, said
that the decision was taken at an executive committee meeting held
Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The decision was based on the fact that Hong Kong has
successfully hosted three short-course World Cup meets, with the
latest event closed on Sunday. "We've obtained valuable experience
from the short-course meets," said Wong.
</P>
<P>
"Hosting swimming world championships will greatly boost local
economy and sports," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It will also strengthen Hong Kong as an international
metropolis and venue for international sporting events," he added.
</P>
<P>
The HKASA will at once ask the International Amateur Swimming
Federation (FINA), the sport's world governing body, for detailed
bidding terms and submit a formal bid to FINA after it finds the
terms acceptable. The deadline for bids is believed to be
sometime in July this year, when the summer Olympic Games are held
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"We still have many things to do to improve menus and such
facilities as that for athletes and media," the HKASA official
admitted.
</P>
<P>
"But we shall have enough time for such improvement," an
optimistic Wong added.
</P>
<P>
The last world short-course championships were held in Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil last December.

<HEADLINE> Simultaneous Polls in India Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Quashing rumors about
elections to the lower house and the state assemblies not being
held together, Indian Chief Election Commissioner T. N. Seshan
said here on Tuesday that the polls would be held simultaneously,
the Times of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
This has already been decided unanimously by the three-member
Election Commission (EC), Seshan said.
</P>
<P>
He said at a press conference in Madras, capital of Tamil Nadu,
that the polls were imminent which could come any time from now to
July.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EC would have to consider several factors
before deciding on the date, though most political parties wanted
the polls to be held in February and the ruling Congress Party and
the Janata Party wanted them to be held in April.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that climatic conditions, agricultural
operations and festivals had to be considered apart from the
preferences of the political parties.
</P>
<P>
Asked about a reported statement of Prime Minister P. V.
Narasimha Rao that he desired the general elections be held in
April, Seshan said that it was the EC which decided when the polls
should be held and that the president should abide by it.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Government Denies Allegation on Tanakpur Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government Tuesday
 denied the Opposition's allegations that it had not taken any
active initiative over a controversial water project on
Nepal-India border.
</P>
<P>
The Water Resources Ministry said in a press release that the
present coalition government had done a lot to work out its
position on the Tanakpur issue since it came to office last
September.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers recently reported that former prime minister
and president of the opposition Communist Party of Nepal (UML) Man
Mohan Adhikari had accused the government of having not taken
initiative to resolve the controversy.
</P>
<P>
It was reported when Adhikari visited India last year as the
prime minister he discussed the Tanakpur issue with his Indian
counterpart P. V. Narasimha Rao.
</P>
<P>
The Tanakpur treaty between Nepal and India was singed in 1991
by the then Nepali prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala. The
treaty allowed India to use a small part of Nepalese land near its
western border to build a barrage for India's Tanakpur hydropower
and irrigation project.
</P>
<P>
But so far the Nepali parliament has not ratified the treaty
because some legislators claimed the treaty does not provide
enough benefits for Nepal.
</P>
<P>
In its Tuesday press release, the Water Resources Ministry said
that a special committee on the Tanakpur issue was formed during a
recent session of the parliament to seek a solution to the
problem.
</P>
<P>
While attending a South Asian regional meeting in New Delhi,
Nepali Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani earlier met his
Indian counterpart and the Indian Minister for Water Resources to
discuss the issue, the ministry said.

MOSCOW -- An estimated 250 Chechen militants today set free
most of the 2,000 hostages they held in the Russian town of
Kizlyar, but are still holding about 160 people as a human shield
for their withdrawal, the Russian news media reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, the gunmen, accompanied
by some officials from the Daghestan autonomous republic where
Kizlyar is located, headed in 11 buses in the direction of their
home region.

peace Implementation Force (IFOR).
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serbs immediately denied accusation that the rocket
was fired from a Serb position and requested the IFOR to
investigate the attack. A staff member of the Bosnian Serb
presidential office said that the Serbs did not fire any rocket on
Muslim-held districts and demanded that Serb representatives join
the IFOR-led investigation so that the Serbs would not be wronged
again.

JERUSALEM -- The Palestinian National Authority Tuesday today
issued an arrest warrant for a man accused of delivering a

Yihye Ayyash.

The arrest warrant was issued after Palestinian police claimed
that Kamal Hamad was involved in the murder of Ayyash, who had
been on Israel's most wanted list for "terrorist activities"
against Jews and the Israel-PLO peace negotiations. Police said
that it was Hamad, a Palestinian building contractor in Gaza, who
gave Ayyash the booby-trapped mobile phone before it exploded and
killed Ayyash in Gaza Friday.

<P>
BANGKOK, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand expects to see
sustained growth in its industry and exports of industrial goods
this year, despite impediments including labor shortage and high
government levies on materials.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) predicts the country's
industrial productivity growth at 11.9 percent and economic growth
at 8.6 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Exports of Thai industrial goods this year are likely to grow
in value by 17.8 percent over last year to 1.6 trillion baht (64
billion US dollars), thanks to the government's export and
investment promotion measures and increasing inflow of funds from
Japan.

The export value of raw rubber is expected to rise by 2.4
percent to 65 billion baht (2.6 billion dollars) in 1996, while
exports of other rubber products will soar up by 19.6 percent to
23.74 billion baht (0.95 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Thailand's electronics industry also will see a marked
expansion this year, due to increasing demand and investment,
particularly in the fields of electronic and auto parts, and rapid
growth of telecommunications networks.
</P>
<P>
The country's export value of electrical appliances and
electronic products is expected to climb up 21.1 percent to 320.85
billion baht (12.8 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Thai garments industry expects to earn 132.35 billion baht
(5.3 billion dollars) from exports this year, up 13.6 percent over
last year, despite surging wages and tariffs on raw materials and
increasing protectionism from importing countries.
</P>
<P>
The food industry will try to export 334.02 billion baht (13.7
billion dollars) worth of food products this year, an increase of
4 percent over last year. Yet the industry must overcome some
difficulties stemming from the 1995 floods and higher sanitary
standards set by countries like Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The textiles industry is planning to make readjustments this
year with greater emphasis on labor efficiency and technology
applications to strengthen the industry's competitiveness in the
world market. Its export value this year is expected to rise by 14
percent to 189.95 billion baht (7.6 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The plastic products of Thailand will register a 22.9 percent
increase this year, earning an estimated 43 billion baht (1.7
billion dollars) in foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Fueled by the booming construction industry, the country's iron
and steel industry will also reap 21.5 billion baht this year, up
26 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Thailand's exports of footwear and parts are
expected to grow 14.6 percent to 53.3 billion baht (2.1 billion
dollars) this year, while the exports of ceramic products will hit
21.5 billion baht (0.86 billion dollars), up 26 percent from last
year.
</P>
<P>
However, the FTI said that the shortage of manpower,
particularly skilled labor, high tariffs on industrial goods and
cumbersome governmental administrative system might hinder
industrial growth.
</P>
<P>
Calling for the government and industrial sector to tackle the
existing problems immediately, the federation and other economic
institutes believed that a sustained booming could be expected in
the Thai industry.

<HEADLINE> Migrant Workers of Hunan Help Develop Local Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of
migrant workers from central China's Hunan Province have returned
to their hometowns, bringing both skills and much needed capital
for developing the local economy, said Yang Zhengwu, the
province's governor.
</P>
<P>
Each year, millions of local farmers have left Hunan to look
for work in economically booming Guangdong Province and in other
coastal areas over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
However, in recent years, a large number of these workers have
begun to return to their hometowns to help contribute to the local
economy, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Li Shuangbao, of Ningyuan County, has founded six lamp
factories since he returned to his hometown two years ago,
equipped with lamp-making techniques he got as a migrant worker in
a lamp factory in Conghua County in Guangdong province for 10
years, where he earned more than 1,800 yuan (about 217 US dollars)
per month.
</P>
<P>
Li's factories have had an annual production value of 10
million yuan over the past two years, with some products even
being exported to Europe and the US.
</P>
<P>
In Shaodong County, 15 prosperous migrant workers have returned
and set up companies that have helped boost the local economy.
</P>
<P>
Because of similar workers who opened businesses in Lanshan
County, the county's industrial output value reached 30 million
yuan (about 3.6 million US dollars) last year, a 10-fold increase
over three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Their counterparts in Hengyang County have introduced as many
as 1,000 projects and some 200 million yuan in capital to their
hometown and have helped build some 7,000 factories, 3,000 of
which they run themselves.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Tangible Achievements in National Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved marked
results in its national economic reform, focusing on enlivening
state enterprises, over the past year.
</P>
<P>
According to Feng Bing, a spokesman for the State Commission
for Restructuring the Economy, the reform entered a new
break-through stage during the 1991-1995 period, when the central
government issued a series of policies on the reform of finance,
banking, foreign exchange and foreign trade, pricing, circulation,
the modern enterprise system, social welfare and housing.
</P>
<P>
Some of them have been put into effect and others are under
experimentation, Feng said.
</P>
<P>
Major progress achieved last year included:
</P>
<P>
-- The modern enterprise system is being carried out on a trial
basis across the country;
</P>
<P>
-- All provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have
worked out a pension insurance system, and some have tried out
reform of the medical system in line with local conditions;
</P>
<P>
-- Altogether 35 major cities have opened chain stores, and the
country has set up the All-China Federation of Supply and
Marketing Co-operatives;
</P>
<P>
-- China has improved and strengthened the reform of the
macro-control of the economy by strengthening the management of
value-added and consumption taxes, and the export tax refund
system, as well as issuing a package of laws to ensure the smooth
reform of the banking system; and
</P>
<P>
-- It has continuously deepened the rural reforms, and carried
out all-round reforms in a number of cities on a trial basis.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai-Hangzhou Air Traffic Control Modernized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 10 (Xinhua) -- An air traffic control system
monitoring the Shanghai-Hangzhou area has been developed to
streamline the busiest aerial activities in China.
</P>
<P>
The east China area, covering Shanghai, China's biggest city,
and Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province, has 15 military and
civilian airports, over 50 flying zones and about 100 air routes,
and handles close to 200 landings and take-offs each year.
</P>
<P>
Improvement of air traffic control in the region was designated
as a national key project in the Eighth Five-Year Plan period
(1991-1995).
</P>
<P>
By employing modern telecommunications and computers, the new
system provides regional sharing of radar information, input,
editing, automatic transmission, and comprehensive processing and
displaying of flight data.
</P>
<P>
During its trial operation over the past few months, the area
has seen more than 100,000 safe landings and take-offs of military
and civilian flights, with one potentially serious accident
avoided.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to modernize air traffic control systems in
its other seven flight monitoring areas -- those of Shenyang,
Beijing, Lanzhou, Ji'nan, Nanjing, Guangzhou and Chengdu.

<HEADLINE> Indian Rupee Falls to All-Time Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indian rupee on Tuesday
tumbled to an all-time low of 35.91 against the US dollar, despite
successive interventions by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the
Financial Express said today.
</P>
<P>
Dealers predicted continued pressure on the rupee because of
heavy demand for dollars from importers.
</P>
<P>
Bankers said the RBI sold the greenbacks at three levels --
35.75, 35.80 and 34.84 rupees per dollar. But the amount sold by
the RBI was too small to arrest the fall, they added.
</P>
<P>
An analyst said that the fundamentals of the Indian economy did
not warrant the current fall in the rupee.
</P>
<P>
But the RBI is unable or unwilling to intervene strongly, he
said.
</P>
<P>
At some point, the central bank has to take a strong stand and
back it up. If not, speculators will constantly test it and weaken
the rupee, he added.
</P>
<P>
Some bankers also speculated that the RBI was deliberately
allowing the rupee to slip gradually against the dollar to enhance
the Indian exporters' competitiveness.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Current Deficit Reaches 7.9 Billion  Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's current deficit has
reached 7.9 billion US dollars and the deficit can be offset by
official and private capital flows, according to sources from Bank
Indonesia, the central bank, here today.
</P>
<P>
According to data from the central bank, official capital flows
are estimated at 5.7 billion dollars and private capital flows at
10.6 billion dollars which will be in the form of direct
investments portfolio capital.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Governor of Bank Indonesia Soedradjad Djiwandono
told the local press recently that the country's capital account
will still be in surplus.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Indonesia also has a stand-by loan of 2 billion
dollars that can be taken at any time needed.
</P>
<P>
So there is no need for the country to use foreign exchange
reserve to finance imports.
</P>
<P>
According to banks' data, Indonesia's foreign exchange reserve
is now recorded at 14.5 billion dollars or equivalent to between
four and five months of imports.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's current account deficit could reach 7.9 billion
dollars or 3.5 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) during
the current fiscal year (April 1995 to March 1996).
</P>
<P>
The government will promote non-oil exports and reduce
unnecessary imports to decrease the deficit to 6.9 billion dollars
or 3.1 percent of GDP in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The government recently issued a number of monetary policies to
cool down economic overheating. It increased banks' reserve
requirement from 2 to 3 percent, closed non-banking financial
institutions to new-comers, and tightened control over their
overseas borrowings.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Terrorists Leave Kizlyar Under Human Shield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chechen terrorists
left Kizlyar in northern Daghestan today under the protection of a
human shield formed by more than 160 hostages, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The terrorists, who stormed into the city of Kizlyar early
Tuesday morning and seized over 2,000 people hostage, left the
city at 07:15 Moscow time (04:15 GMT) under the human shield,
which also included several Daghestani officials and reporters.
</P>
<P>
The terrorists, whose number was estimated at some 600, have
reportedly left the settlement of Novogroznensky, 50 kilometers
east of Grozny, the capital of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
They left Kizlyar in 11 buses, and took 10-15 hostages as a
human shield in each coach, local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
The release of the remaining 2,000 hostages in the city
hospital in Kizlyar became possible thanks to the talks held by
Daghestani authorities with the terrorists, a spokesman of
Moscow's headquarters dealing with the crisis said.
</P>
<P>
"The terrorists were told that their demands would not be
accepted by Moscow, that the (Chechen) militants will face
inevitable death, their families will be persecuted, while the
peoples of Daghestan will feel hatred to all the Chechens," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"In the final end, they succeeded in convincing them that their
criminal action was senseless," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The terrorists headed by Slaman Raduyev, 28, the son-in-law of
rebel Chechen president Dzhokhar Dudayev, had demanded an
immediate withdrawal of Russian troops not only from Chechnya, but
also the whole North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said three policemen were killed, 13 wounded and
two are reported missing in the Kizlyar attack. Nothing has been
said about the civilian death toll so far. The number of
militants killed is not known either.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Cabinet Orders Reduction of Deficit (by Yu Zuncheng) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's current account
deficit has caused such grave concern to the cabinet that it has
ordered financial institutions to tackle the problem urgently and
consistently.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet has requested that the current account deficit
should decrease to only 3-4 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) within the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Last year Thailand suffered a 334.5 billion baht (13.38 billion
US dollars) trade deficit and the current account deficit rose
sharply to 295.5 billion baht (11.82 billion dollars), or 7.1
percent of GDP, according to a report of the central bank, the
Bank of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Import overshot exports, which meant the trade deficit alone,
has aggravated the current account deficit by 1.2 percent of GDP
while increase in investment was another factor leading to the
huge deficit, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank, a series of measures will be
adopted this year to ease the situation. Under the measures,
fiscal and monetary policy implementation must be disciplined
while the budget will be balanced to cool spiraling inflation and
calm the rising current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry, the Bank of Thailand and the National
Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) have submitted ways
to the cabinet to bring current account deficit under control.
</P>
<P>
The three agencies have set a goal to bring down inflation to
4.9-5 percent, from 5.8 percent in 1995, and the current account
deficit to 6.5-7.0 percent of GDP this year.
</P>
<P>
To solve the current account deficit problem, they will take
steps to promote public savings and oversee investment to benefit
the long-term economy.
</P>
<P>
Exports must be accelerated while imports must be monitored,
particularly to help Thailand become more self-reliant or reduce
dependence on imports, the bank report said.
</P>
<P>
Offshore spending and expenses in cargo freight and patents
must also be curbed, Bank of Thailand Deputy Governor Chaiyawat
Wibulswat suggested.
</P>
<P>
He said the Thai currency remains stable and ways to tackle the
current account deficit will not affect the baht.
</P>
<P>
At a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Finance Minister Surakiat
Sathirathai insisted that the exchange rate of the baht must
remain stable and that the basket of currency system, being used
to determine the baht exchange rate, is still appropriate and
should be maintained.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Urges Establishment of New Peace Deal With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A DPRK newspaper today called
for the establishment of a new peace agreement between Pyongyang
and Washington to replace the existing Korean Armistice Agreement
signed in 1953.
</P>
<P>
As enormous military forces between the two sides of the Korean
military demarcation line have been locked in intense
confrontation, a mere armistic agreement is insufficient to
preclude any possible contingency, Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece
of the Workers' Party of Korea, said in a commentary.
</P>
<P>
At a time when the north and the south have signed a joint
declaration of mutual non-aggression and when the nuclear
framework agreement between the DPRK and the U.S. has entered the
stage of implementation, conditions are now ripe for Washington
and Pyongyang to strike a new peace deal, which is also
imperative, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Once the new peace-guaranteeing mechanism is in place, the
paper said, tension in the Korean peninsular will be eased and a
favorable situation conducive to national peace and reunification
will appear.
</P>
<P>
It urged the U.S. to change its hostile policy toward Pyongyang
and respond positively to the DPRK proposal.

and governments of other countries to make arrangements for visa
abolition.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes the British Government will take the lead in
the arrangement for visa abolition for HKSAR passport holders.
</P>
<P>
He said that the preparations for the issue of HKSAR passports
will be done in cooperation between the Chinese and British sides,
adding that the Chinese side has adopted practical and flexible
steps toward a sound cooperation between the two sides.

CANBERRA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Joint world number one Monica
Seles Wednesday easily downed Belgium's Dominique Monami 6-1, 6-2
in the Peters International tournament in Sydney, warm-up for the
upcoming Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
Playing in front of a crowd of 7,000, Seles completed the
second-round match which lasted just 55 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The match was the Yugoslav-born American's first since she went

September. It was also her first appearance in Australia since she
won her third successive Australian Open title in January, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Seles, 22, will go on to play next week's Australian Open
while Graf has withdrawn because she is recovering from surgery
to remove bone fragments from her foot.
</P>
<P>
In the dramatic men's actions, there were full of surprising
upsets.
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Richard Krajicek was beaten by Greg Rusedski of
Britain on Tuesday, losing his chance to enter the second round.
</P>
<P>
Then, the Canadian-born Briton again showed his prowess
by whitewashing Germany's Carsten Arriens with 6-0, 6-0 in just 29
minutes.

<HEADLINE> Over 268,000 New Zealanders Receive Food Grants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Over a quarter of one
million New Zealanders have been given grants to buy food since
December 1994, according to figures released by the opposition
Labor Party today.
</P>
<P>
Labor social welfare spokeswoman Annette King said that over
268,000 special needs grants for food were approved by the Income
Support Service between December 1994 and November 1995.
</P>
<P>
"The explosion in the number of grants for food shows the low
and modest income earners are continuing to miss out on any
benefit from the government's much flaunted economy," she said.
</P>
<P>
She noted the rise in grants coincided with reports of
continued requests for help from food banks.
</P>
<P>
"In this 11-month period more than one quarter of a million New
Zealanders needed financial assistance to fill the most basic
human need -- hunger. This is a horrifying statistic," she stated.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Expected To Rally in 1995-96 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Wool International (WI)
projected today that wool prices were expected to rally in the
second half of the 1995-96 season.
</P>
<P>
But, the strengthening of wool prices would depend largely on
the Chinese buying, WI, a statutory body responsible for selling
Australia's wool stockpile of 2.6 million bales, said in its
January Insight.
</P>
<P>
"The extend of the recovery will be heavily dependent on the
level of Chinese buying," WI said.
</P>
<P>
The body also forecast that the world demand for wool would
remain subdued.
</P>
<P>
Last year, subdued demand in the world market and the failure
of China's return to the market had weakened wool prices, which
dipped to a seasonal low of 575 Australian cents (425.5 US cents)
per kilogram clean.
</P>
<P>
Also last year, WI has twice revised its forecast of wool
prices down to 640 cents (473.6 US cents) a kilogram from 820
cents (606.8 US cents) per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
WI said that a total of 82,500 bales must be sold so as to
complete the minimum requirement for the March quarter of 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has assured that the Provincial Council elections to
be held this month will be free and fair.
</P>
<P>
She told government Members of Parliament and Provincial
Councilors on Tuesday that there should not be any thuggery or
violence as there had been at earlier elections.
</P>
<P>
She was confident that the government party could win the
elections without violence and warned that any government
supporter involved in violence during the elections would be
severely dealt with.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial Council elections have been called following the
dissolution of two of them in the North Central Province and the
Sabaragamuwa Province which were controlled by the main Opposition
United National Party.
</P>
<P>
The United National Party has gone to court on the issue
challenging the legality of the dissolution. The cases have been
filed against the governors of the two provinces who gazetted the
dissolution.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the government is contemplating the dissolution of
two more of the five United National Party controlled Provincial
Councils.
</P>
<P>
It initially proposed to table a motion of no-confidence
against the Chief Minister of the Central Province.
</P>
<P>
In the North Western Provincial Council, the governor has
refused to sanction the budget passed by the council.
</P>
<P>
Consequently the council finds it difficult to operate and has
gone to court to compel the governor to sanction the budget.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- India demonstrated its new
generation main battle tank (MBT) Arjun at an unveiling ceremony
here on Tuesday, the Indian Express reported today.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao unveiled the
home-made tank at the army garrison ground, Delhi cantonment.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the 58.5-ton Arjun with superior
firepower and high mobility is designed to meet the Indian army's
most stringent specifications. Its first prototype was ready in
1983.
</P>
<P>
The unveiling ceremony was believed to pave the way for the
serial production of the Arjun tank for induction into the armored
corps of India.
</P>
<P>
The high-speed (72 km per hour on road and 40 kmph on rocky
terrain) and 1,400-horse power tank with 120-mm rifled barrel gun
has a capacity to fire six to eight rounds a minute.
</P>
<P>
It is equipped with an integrated fire control system and a
thermal imager. The fuel capacity of the tank is 1,640-liters and
it gives a mileage of 8.5 km to a liter.
</P>
<P>
The special features of the low silhouette tank include low
smoke emission from the engine and a fully integrated day-and-
night target finder which are described as a tactical advantage in
war.
</P>
<P>
The sophisticated radar system in the tank can spot a target at
the distance of 5 km even in a severe dust storm and can down it
with accurate fire at a distance of 2.5 km.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vetoes Welfare Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today vetoed a bill to overhaul the nation's primary welfare
programs, which cleared Congress late last year.
</P>
<P>
In his veto message, Clinton said the Republican bill "does too
little to move people from welfare to work," but said he was
willing to work with Congress on a new version "to enact real,
bipartisan reform."
</P>
<P>
Clinton called on Congress to address what he called
shortcomings in the legislation, largely in the areas of work and
child care.
</P>
<P>
The House and Senate passed the bill the week before Christmas,
but by margins of less than the two-thirds majorities needed to
override Clinton's veto, the 12th of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
The bill would have replaced federal guarantees to the Aid to
Families with Dependent Children program with block grants that
could be used by the states to fashion their own welfare plans.
</P>
<P>
The bill also would have capped the total amount of federal
funding for welfare over the next seven years, with estimated
savings of 58 billion U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Much of eastern
U.S.A. remained crippled today as record snow falls kept workers
and children at home for a second day. At least 87 deaths were
blamed on the snow storms, some of the worst in the last 70 years.
</P>
<P>
Federal government in the Washington area remained largely
closed. Unessential workers and school children had another day
off in many cities and towns across the eastern region.
</P>
<P>
Major airports in New York, Philadelphia and Newark reopened
today, with passengers stranded at terminals for two days lining
up at check-ins. A Japan Airlines flight made a successful landing
at New York's Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Grocery stores in northern Virginia were open today, but some
had little food left on their shelves. Postal services in
northern Virginia, New York and some other cities were interrupted
for the second day, leaving residents without newspapers and mail.
</P>
<P>
The worst blizzard in 70 years left Philadelphia with 30 inches
of snow and dumped over 27 inches in New York City. In Washington,
D.C., snow began falling again in the morning but stopped in the
afternoon, leaving a record 27 inches of snow on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press said at least 87 deaths were blamed on the
three-day storm. Many of the deaths were caused by traffic
accidents. But two people were killed by carbon monoxide poisoning
after they stayed too long in their cars with the engines running
and the tail-pipes stuck in the snow.
</P>
<P>
As the blizzard roared to the Atlantic, a new but weaker storm
was heading toward the region. The weather forecast said three to
five inches of snow was possible overnight in Massachusetts with

<HEADLINE> Mexico Protests Against U.S. Warning of Insicurity in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) today described as
"unacceptable" the warnings for tourists issued by the U.S. State
Department about alleged insecurity in the Mexico city.
</P>
<P>
Top officials of the PRI's National Executive Committee said in
a statement that the Mexican capital is as safe as any other big
metropolises in the world.
</P>
<P>
They urged U.S. authorities and media not to whip up
sensationalism for the purposes of their elections at home.
</P>
<P>
The statement condemned the allegations of the U.S. State
Department as "groundless, unjust and misleading," arguing that
foreigners are much safer in Mexico City than in several American
cities.
</P>
<P>
PRI leaders said the complaints by Mexican immigrants against
U.S. authorities increased by 20 percent in the United States, but
the Mexican authorities have never attempted to play up the
rampant violence and crime in some U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
They accused some countries including the U.S. of disrupting
the tourism industry in Mexico, one of the country's key foreign
exchange earners, at a time when the Mexican government is trying
to secure an economic recovery.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Gunfire from unknown
assailants wounded Harry Marsant, a Haitian legislator, Monday
afternoon as he was leaving the parliament building in
Port-au-Prince, the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Marsant, injured in the right jaw by a bullet, was out of
danger but remained in a private hospital, said reports reaching
here quoting parliamentary sources.
</P>
<P>
Marsant declared through a radio message from the hospital that
he will continue his "fight against the insecurity that prevails
in the country" in spite of the attack.
</P>
<P>
Disarmament has been considered a priority by the government so
that a climate of security can be achieved to enable the transfer
of power when Rene Preval will take over as president on February
7.
</P>
<P>
The attack against Marsant is the third of its kind against
legislators of the ruling Lavalas coalition since Jean-Hubert
Feuille and Gabriel Fortune were shot downtown in Port-au-Prince
in November.
</P>
<P>
The former, a cousin of President Jean Bertrand Aristide, died
while the latter was critically wounded.

<P>
BELGRADE, January 9 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed and 18
others were injured as a trolley bus was attacked by a rocket
today in downtown Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
It was the worst attack since cease-fire was executed in the
city on October 12 last year, according to the NATO-led peace
Implementation Force (IFOR).
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serbs immediately denied accusation that the rocket
was fired from a Serb position and requested the IFOR to
investigate the attack.
</P>
<P>
A staff member of the Bosnian Serb presidential office said
that the Serbs did not fire any rocket on Muslim-held districts
and demanded that Serb representatives join the IFOR-led
investigation so that the Serbs would not be wronged again.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the Serbs were blamed for a February 5 mortar blast
that killed 68 people in a Sarajevo market.
</P>
<P>
But the U.N.-led peacekeeping mission later announced that
evidence was insufficient to establish who fired the mortar
shell.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Oppositions Make New Demand on Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi mainstream opposition
parties demanded that all functions related to the electoral
process be stopped until a neutral caretaker government is formed
to conduct the upcoming general elections.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting of their liaison committee last night, the
opposition parties -- the Awami (people's) League, the Jatiya
(national) Party and the Jamaat-e-Islami -- observed that present
political crisis in the country could be resolved only through
acceptance of the opposition demand.
</P>
<P>
The meeting urged those who have filed nominations to withdraw
their candidature from the "one-party farcical" election, saying
that "the Election Commission is just making a farce by changing
election schedule time and again. This will not end the crisis."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP) has completed nomination of its candidates to all 300
parliamentary seats in accordance with the Election Commission's
request while the mainstream opposition parties have boycotted the
polls process.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Election Commission was forced once again to
announce a polls reschedule shifting the date of the national
elections from February 7 to February 15.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister is the only obstacle to constituting a
caretaker government. After her resignation all the political
parties will decide on the election and its schedule," one of the
opposition leader stressed.

<HEADLINE> More Youths in Chile to Get Job Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Chile plans to offer
job-training courses to 20,000 young people this year at a cost
of about 7.5 billion pesos (18.5 million U.S. dollars)
under a youth education program, the Labor Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government spent 6.6 billion pesos (16.3 million
dollars) on training 17,908 young people under the Young Chile
program, 19.4 percent more than planned. And all the trainees
found a job, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The youth program, set up in 1991, is aimed at generating
opportunities mainly for young people aged 15-24, who come from
low-income families and are either unemployed, underemployed,
inactive but willing to work, or have stopped studying.
</P>
<P>
Young Chile, funded by federal money and a loan from the
Inter-American Development Bank, was initially targeted at
training 100,000 young people between 1991 and 1995 with a budget
of about 83 million dollars. To date, the program has provided
jobs for 128,115 young people.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean authorities decided to extend the program in 1995
to give another 15,000 young people a chance. Last March,
President Eduardo Frei promised that 70,000 more young people
would benefit from the program over a three-year period.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean government demanded that every trainee should be
secured a job before a training course is selected and approved.

PANAMA CITY, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Panamanian
civilians and students marched today outside of the U.S. Southern
Command in commemoration of the 21 Panamanians killed by
U.S. soldiers 32 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were stopped, for the first time in history,
by Panamanian riot police when they were heading towards the main
entrance of the U.S. Southern Command headquarters.
</P>
<P>
A mass will be held for the martyrs in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
On January 9, 1964, some 200 students from the National
Institute intended to hoist a Panamanian national flag in the then
canal zone, but they were repressed violently by the U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one Panamanians were killed and more than 400 wounded in
the three days of violence. The then Panamanian government broke
off diplomatic relations with the United States on the same day.
</P>
<P>
The incident created hostilities between Panamanians and the
U.S. army based in the canal zone.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the major newspapers in this capital city carried
articles today to observe the patriotic movement by Panamanians.

ISLAMABAD, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Five people were killed and
eight others injured in a rocket attack on Kabul, according to a
report from Radio Kabul, Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban student militia fired rockets to bomb the Kabul's

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mehmud Mestiri, leader of the UN special mission on
Afghanistan, will arrive here on Friday to resume his peace
mission in the war-torn country, said a UN official.
</P>
<P>
"Mestiri comes here with a renewed and strong mandate of the UN
General Assembly as well as full support of the Security Council
and many other countries interested in an early solution of the
Afghan conflict," the official told local press here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Ambassador Mestiri counts on full support of the Afghan
leaders and the people who will be of great help to him in
promoting peace in Afghanistan," said the official.
</P>
<P>
He said Mestiri also looked forward to receiving full
cooperation of all the neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Mestiri has made several rounds of attempts throughout last
year to end the nearly four-year conflict in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
However, his efforts have so far not yet bear any result as all
warring factions are unwilling to give in to each other.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Encourages Second Rice Crop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the Thai Ministry
of Agriculture and Cooperatives are optimistic that the second
rice crop this year will be successfully harvested thanks to a
sufficient supply of water from major reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
As last year's extensive flooding caused damage to farmland,
the ministry is encouraging the second rice crop to maintain the
overall rice output level.
</P>
<P>
The ministry wants to encourage rice production this year also
because rice exports last year hit a six-year high by topping 6
million tons, exceeding the ministry's target of 5.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
As a result, local paddy stock is running critically low at
less than 1 million tons of paddy, the equivalent of 500,000-
600,000 tons of milled rice.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rice price for the new crop has increased by 5
percent, fetching 4,500 baht (180 US dollars) per ton.

PARIS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) will make great efforts to
strengthen economic cooperation with China and promote mutual
understanding between the international community and China.
</P>
<P>
Jean Cloude Paye, secretary general of the OECD, was speaking
at the end of a two-day symposium in Paris on China's economy,
co-sponsored by the OECD and China.
</P>
<P>
Paye said China's economy now has become part of the world
economy, which is "both an opportunity and challenge" to the whole
world.
</P>
<P>
He believed that continued dialog between the international
community and China is helpful to integrating China's economy with
the global economy and will bring huge benefits to the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, an assistant minister of China's Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation ministry, said at the conference that the
objective and appropriate evaluation of China's economy and its
effect on the world economy will help China to join in
international cooperation and competition in a positive
environment. "Overestimating China's economic situation will be
harmful," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is confident of planning national
economic development and social progress for the coming 15 years.
It is also optimistic about achieving faster growth, said Long.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that the Chinese government also faces
mounting pressure on population, environment, employment and
inflation due to a weak agricultural industry and a shortage of
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Discussions were made during the symposium on China's long-term
strategy on developing industry, agriculture, energy and trade.
</P>
<P>
High-level officials and economists from the United States,
Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Switzerland, Italy and Holland,
as well as economic advisers of large multinational corporations

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Xu Youfang, China's minister of
forestry, has pointed out the focuses of the country's forestry
for the next five years at a provincial working session held in
this capital of south China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
These refer to speeding up the industrialization of forestry,
revitalizing forestry with advanced science and technology and
strengthening the management of forest resources.
</P>
<P>
The forest coverage in China is 13.92 percent, with more than
5.3 million ha area afforested, more than 3.3 million ha hillsides
closed for forestation, and more than 2.4 billion trees
voluntarily planted every year.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 billion yuan (about 24 billion US dollars) was
earned from forestry last year, due to increases in afforested
area and timber storage.
</P>
<P>
According to a long-range plan, by the year 2000, the
afforested area would increase by 10 million ha, with the forest
coverage reaching 15.5 percent, and the total output value of the
forestry sector scoring 304 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, the plan says, the country will have 29
million more ha of afforested area, forest coverage will reach 17
percent, and the total output value of forestry will be more than
1,000 billion yuan (about 120 billion US dollars).

<HEADLINE> New Technique for Protecting Cultural Relics Rewarded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The State Cultural Relics
Bureau has handed out its annual awards for 1995 to six items of
new technology for protecting cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
The top award went to eight technicians from the Suzhou Museum
of Silk and Satins in east China's Jiangsu Province and the
Beijing-based Museum of Chinese History, who have jointly
developed a technique for copying ancient embroidery with
traditional methods.
</P>
<P>
The copies they have thus made, according to Chinese experts,
are almost the same as the originals in terms of texture and
appearance.
</P>
<P>
The originals were fragments of embroidery unearthed from tombs
of the Tang Dynasty (618-907) in northwest China's Qinghai
Province.
</P>
<P>
The second award went to repair techniques for a Qin Dynasty
(221-206 B.C.) bronze carriage drawn by terracotta horses and a
technique to consolidate the walls of grottoes by grouting.
</P>
<P>
The carriage, found in the pits attached to the tomb of the
first emperor of Qin, had been broken into 1,338 pieces.
</P>
<P>
In repairing this precious relic, technicians from the Museum
of Terracotta Warriors and Horses in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province have developed some new techniques and improved
traditional repair tools.
</P>
<P>
The tech to consolidate rocks of grottos has for the first time
solved the problem of weathering of rocks of grottos, such as that
in the famous Yulin Grottos in northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
Also rewarded are the techniques to consolidate color
wall-paintings in Shuilu Nunnery in Shaanxi, the studies on the
lighting installation for the No. 2 pit of the terracotta warriors
and horses, and the technique to consolidate ancient silks.
</P>
<P>
The annual awards, initiated in 1991, have now gone to programs
covering the areas of earth structures, ancient wooden structures,
stone structures and other kind of relics. Those on the
deprivation of water from lacquers and protection of paper-relics
are leading ones in the world.
</P>
<P>
China has now nearly ten formal institutions in cultural relics
protection, involving more than 100 of technicians.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Airlines to Upgrade Maintenance Facility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian national flag
carrier, the state-run airlines Garuda Indonesia, is considering
changing the status of Garuda maintenance facility (GMF) from a
strategic business unit into a subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
This step is in anticipation of fiercer competition among
airplane hangars operating in the Asia-Pacific (ASPAC) region in
the upcoming trade liberalization era, according to a report from
Ekonomi Neraca newspaper here today quoting Garuda technical
director Suratman.
</P>
<P>
A number of prominent airlines such as Singapore Airlines,
Malaysian Airlines and Cathay Pacific have started converting the
status of their maintenance facilities into subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
Suratman said that the tendency is partially prompted by a
surging score of foreign airlines (from outside the region)
entrusting hangars in the ASPAC to upkeep their fleets.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 Garuda maintenance facility handled care and
maintenance of five foreign aircraft and 48 local airplanes.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to increase GMF's market, the hangar plans to add more
facilities as well as to improve the quality of its human
resources.
</P>
<P>
GMF has potential to attract more foreign airlines as it has
obtained internationally-recognized certificates such as from the
Federal Aviation of America.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Deficit Exceeds Single Currency Criterion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Germany's budget deficit in 1995
exceeded 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), a condition
set by the Maastricht Treaty for entry to the European Union's
single currency system, leaving Luxembourg the only EU member
qualified for monetary union so far, German Finance Minister Theo
Waigel said today.
</P>
<P>
At a closed meeting of the ruling Christian Social Union party,
Waigel blamed the excessive public debt on higher deficits in
states and towns, aggravated by lower than expected GDP growth. He
said the figures would be released soon.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister stressed that Germany will meet the 3
percent deficit criteria for monetary union by 1997, and become one
of the first batch of the the EU's 15 nations entering the single
currency system in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Successful Change in Large Ethylene Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- After a month-long trial run,
China has called the changes made in a large ethylene company a
success, raising its production capacity from 300,000 to 400,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
The changes in the Yangzi Petrochemical Corporation in this
capital city of east China's Jiangsu Province were part of
China's major construction projects in the Eighth Five-Year Plan
(1991-1995). The investment for raising production by 100,000 tons
was 612 million yuan, only one-fifth of what would be needed for
building a new company.
</P>
<P>
By borrowing experiences from a similar transformation project
in the Yanshan Petrochemical Corporation in Beijing, the project
was carried out without altering the existing production
process. No extra land or workers were required and there was no
production halt during the 15-month-long transformation period,
which was the first move of its kind either in China or abroad.
</P>
<P>
The major equipment for the project was imported from other
countries and the new production line is completely automated.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- China will establish a special
development fund to promote the publication of books in the
languages of Chinese minorities, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the government will set aside a fund of
more than 10 million yuan (1.205 U.S. dollars) to resolve chronic
financial problems faced by minority publishers.
</P>
<P>
It added that compared with books in mandarin and teaching
materials, books in ethnic languages usually have higher costs but
lower prices.
</P>
<P>
As the result, most of the minority publishers rely on state
subsidies to offset losses, the paper explained.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Yu Youxian, head of the State Press and
Publication Administration, as saying that the minority publishers
should also deepen the reform of distribution.
</P>
<P>
China yesterday held a national meeting on the publication of
books in ethnic languages.
</P>
<P>
The meeting revealed that there now are 36 publishing houses
nationwide which publish books in 23 ethnic languages.
</P>
<P>
China has 55 minority ethnic groups with a population of about
100 million.

<HEADLINE> Cities to Control Noise Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A group of big cities in China
are planning to build protective screens against nose along busy
highways, according to an official in the Chinese Acoustics
Society (CAS) quoted by today's "China Daily" here.
</P>
<P>
The move indicate that local governments are paying more
attention to noise pollution, which is getting worse due to
urbanization and industrial development, said Guo Xiulan, director
of CAS and a senior engineer with the National Environmental
Protection Agency (Nepa).
</P>
<P>
Screens protecting against noise have so far been installed in
less than 10 cities in the country. In most cities the noise on 80
percent of the highways exceeds State standards on noise emission.
</P>
<P>
Screen have been installed on some highways in Beijing where
the average traffic noise exceeds 70 decibels, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
She also disclosed that Nepa has presented a draft law on noise
pollution prevention and control to the National People's Congress
for deliberation.
</P>
<P>
The draft law sets general requirements on noise control, and
local governments will then be required to adopted effective
measures to implement the law.

<HEADLINE> State of Chinese Children Comprehensively Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Vaccination rates for three
major diseases have climbed to 80 percent for Chinese children,
according to a government survey.
</P>
<P>
The diseases are polio, diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (sometimes
known as "DPT") and measles.
</P>
<P>
The survey also said China has reached six out of 10 targets
for children approved in 1992 by the State Council as Outlines for
Development Plans for Children in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The accomplished targets are reported to include tuberculosis
vaccination for children (Bacille-Calmette-Guerin inoculation or
BCG) in addition to inoculations stated earlier.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of childhood measles decreased by 96.4 percent,
compared to a time when planned immunity was not publicized. The
death rate from the disease dropped by 97.4 percent compared to
the same earlier period.
</P>
<P>
Also, childhood diarrhea treatment by taking oral fluid was
widely adopted in more than 80 percent of Chinese urban and rural
areas. The childhood malnutrition rate dropped by 23.8 percent
across the country, compared to 1990.
</P>
<P>
Two other accomplished goals initially sought that the
mortality rate for children under 5 years of age be reduced by
one-third from the 1990 level, and required compulsory education
for all school-aged children -- except in a few underdeveloped,
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
China ratified the Convention on the Rights of Children in
December, 1991. It called for improvement of children's living
conditions, and support of childhood protection and development.
</P>
<P>
Some 98.7 percent of all school-aged children were able to go
to school in 1994, about nine-tenths of one percent more than in
1990. The gap between more school-aged boys than girls who were at
school was narrowed by 39.1 percent from 1990 to 1994.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Border Patrol today
began to build a three-meter-high fence along the border between
Mexico and the United States, to prevent illegal Mexican
immigrants from crossing into U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
The 2-kilometer-long wire fence will be built between the
community of Sunland Park, New Mexico, and Anapra, a neighborhood
of Ciudad Juarez, which sits on the northern border of the Mexican
state of Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
The fence wall will be completed in a few months at a cost of
approximately 150,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The project, which includes a lighting system, is part of
"Operation Blockade" designed to provide permanent watch over 35
kilometers of the U.S.-Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Border Patrol authorities said the zone where the fence
wall is being built has become one of the major corridors used by
illegal aliens to enter U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
It has also been used by Mexican gangs from the border city of

<HEADLINE> Walesa to Resume Job of Shipyard Electrician </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Former Polish president Lech
Walesa is planning to resume his job at Gdansk Shipyard as an
electrician, reported Polish Television tonight.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Radio Gdansk Monday, Walesa said he hoped
to return to the Gdansk Shipyard, where he started to work in
1967, in three months to pick up his old job as a shipyard
electrician.
</P>
<P>
Walesa took an unpaid leave from the shipyard in 1990 when he
was elected Polish president. The period is expected to expire by
March 29, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The 52-year-old former president returned to Gdansk, where he
founded the Solidarity Trade Union in 1980, immediately after he
left office on December 22. He was defeated in a presidential poll
in November by Aleksander Kwasniewski, Chairman of the Socialist
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Walesa had previously planned to visit Warsaw regularly to
discuss with rightist leaders coalition among rightist political
parties, but such talks have not happened yet so far.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Walesa has declined the offer to be the
Chairman of the Solidarity Trade Union at Gdansk Shipyard and
preferred to be an electrician at the shipyard.
</P>
<P>
The shipyard's management has expressed understanding of
Walesa's decision and agreed to arrange for him a job as an
electrician.

BUENOS AIRES, January 9 (Xinhua) -- No less than 30 percent of

along with the increase of prisoners addicted to intravenous drugs,
the principal means of infection of the disease through the
exchange of syringes.
</P>
<P>
But it is difficult to obtain the exact figure for the HIV
carrier as testing cannot be done without the consent of the
prisoners, the official said.

Official statistics on inmates who agreed to the test show

BONN, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Germany supports Poland's entry
into the European Union and NATO, German President Roman Herzog
and Chancellor Helmut Kohl told Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a banquet at the presidential office for the Polish
president, who is in Germany on his first official visit since
taking over presidency last month, Herzog said Poland could only
make its way back into Europe through joining the EU and NATO,
adding that Poland may trust Germany in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Herzog noted that the fact Kwasniewski made his first visit to
Germany reflected how important Germany and Poland should
cooperate closely in building the future of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski said Poland wishes to play an active role in the
integration of eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that Poland will become a member of the EU
within the century, because the Polish currency is tending to be
stable and inflation is falling.
</P>
<P>
The Polish president also said the second stop of his tour is
Paris, adding that "the axis of Paris -- Bonn -- Warsaw is the
pillar of Europe."
</P>
<P>
Earlier at a welcoming ceremony for Kwasniewski, Kohl said that
Poland needs to create necessary conditions for the entry into the
organizations by continuing its reform.
</P>

Kwasniewski arrived here Tuesday afternoon and leaves for Paris
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Village Lab Results in Fatter Cattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Jingxiang, a farmer in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, took a test
tube from a refrigerator and observed the vaccine growing in it
against the sunlight coming through the window.
</P>
<P>
It was a scene at Huxi Village in Shawan County, the county's
only village with a lab.
</P>
<P>
The lab was built last October in collaboration with the Fodder
Research Institute of this capital of northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, according to Pan Pu, secretary of the
village's Party branch.
</P>
<P>
"We found that the traditional cattle-fattening techniques did
not work well. But through the county committee for science and
technology we introduced a patent for producing cattle-fattening
vaccine using a microbiological fermentation technique from Fudan
University in Shanghai, and built this lab," he said.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is the second-largest animal husbandry base in China,
but its meat output is less than that of Shandong Province, east
China, which has far less grassland than Xinjiang. Shandong
attaches great importance to cattle-fattening techniques and has
obtained the largest share of the meat market in the country.
</P>
<P>
Having set its eyes on the prospective future market in the
region, Huxi Village spent 70,000 yuan building a lab to cultivate
vaccine which can improve the protein content of cattle
fodder. Zhou Jingxiang, who has had over seven years' experience
of herding, was hired as the director. He has an assistant around
20 years old. Several engineers lent the village a hand in
preparing for the lab and gave Zhou and his assistant technical
education.
</P>
<P>
The lab is located in a 30-sq-m office of the village
committee. It contains a refrigerator, a multi-speed oscillator,
culture boxes, a high-pressure cooker, thermometers, a humidistat,
angle flasks and text tubes.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou, the main raw material used for the vaccine
is cottonseed sterilized at a high temperature. Some 100 ml of
culture base is mixed with three kg of cottonseed oil extract. So
far, 1.5 tons of vaccine have been produced, and it is selling
well.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang, the largest commodity cotton production base in
China, yielded over 900,000 tons of cotton last year. However, the
cottonseed used to be mostly used as fertilizer by farmers after
being extracted, because it contains a poisonous element and is
not fit for animal feed.
</P>
<P>
Taking up a handful of vaccine from a wooden basin, Zhou said,
"Mix one kg of this stuff with 100 kg of corn, bran or stalks, and
the protein content in the fermented fodder will surpass 45
percent. It is even higher than that of soybean, which used to
have the highest protein content. Also, it can be completely
substituted for fish powder."
</P>
<P>
According to Pan Pu, the lab will have seven to eight staff
members this spring. "They will start processing finished fodder,"
Pan said. "The customers can use it right after they take it home
and be free from the trouble of mixing it."

<HEADLINE> Honduras, El Salvador to Demarcate Common Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Honduras and El Salvador
will use satellites to mark out 100 kilometers of their
common border this year as part of attempts to end a dispute over
border zones.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are trying to speed up the demarcation process
which was ordered by the International Court in The Hague in
1992. The Court demanded both nations mark 374.5 kilometers of
their common borderline to end a dispute in the zones known as
"bolsones" which were used as retreats for National Liberation
Front guerrillas during the civil war in El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
Last year, only 32 of the planned 50 kilometers were marked
using the conventional ground system. And so far only 112
kilometers have been demarcated as work was delayed last
year due to the Salvadoran government's financial problems.
</P>
<P>
The 100 kilometers planned for this year is expected to cost
the two countries' Foreign Ministries some 3 million lempiras
(300,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Raul Andino, chairman of the special border demarcation
committee, met with Honduran President Carlos Roerto Reina on
Monday to inform him of the progress made in the tasks of boundary
marking which were initiated in 1992.

<HEADLINE> New Appointment Consistent with Russian Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The appointment of Yevgeny
Primakov as Russia's new foreign minister is imperative to
carrying forward the country's foreign policy and fulfilling its
strategic commitments, the president's office announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, 66, head of Russia's foreign intelligence service,
and one of President Boris Yeltsin's longest serving senior
officials, succeeds Andrei Kozyrev, who resigned last week to
serve in the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
Kozyrev had been criticized for being too pro-Western and
Primakov's appointment may signal a hardening of attitudes toward
the West. His experience in Middle East and Oriental affairs could
also signal a shift of emphasis in Russia's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"Primakov will carry out a tougher policy not because he comes
from foreign intelligence, but simply because such a course is
supported by most experts and public opinion," said Sergei Rogov,
head of the U.S.A. and Canada Institute, an independent Moscow
think tank.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, a veteran diplomat with a background in Middle East
and Asian affairs, also knows the ropes of the Russian
bureaucracy. He is highly acclaimed for his "prudence and
constructiveness."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin chose Primakov because of his extensive experience in
international affairs, said the president's spokesman Sergei
Medvedev. He understands how the Foreign Ministry operates and can
take charge immediately, said Medvedev.
</P>
<P>
After a career as a journalist and political analyst, he rose
to become an alternate member of the Soviet Communist Party
Politburo in 1989. He was a close adviser to Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who named him deputy foreign minister in
1989. Primakov was appointed to head the Foreign Intelligence
Service in the fall of 1991 when the former KGB was divided into
domestic and foreign services.

SHANGHAI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Industrial output value in
China's largest metropolis registed a 17.1 percent rise, reaching
525.389 billion yuan in 1995, an official with the municipal
Statistics Bureau said here today.

including automobiles, contributed 45.1 percent to the total
industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
The rate of sales soared to 98.1 percent and the purchase value
of export-oriented products totalled 78.2 billion yuan, 35 percent
up over that in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the success to new reform measures
taken in 1995, improved management, and reduction in production
costs.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Hold 3,000 People Hostage in Daghestan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Chechen rebels, led by Dzhokhar
Dudayev's son-in-law, rounded up as hostage some 3,000 civilians
at Kizlyar in neighboring Daghestan today.
</P>
<P>
Salman Raduyev and 600 of his fighters occupied a
general-purpose hospital, a maternal hospital and three high-rise
apartment buildings in the city on the border between Daghestan
and Chechnya, according to an Itar-Tass report.
</P>
<P>
Daghestan and Chechnya are autonomous regions of the Russian
Federation.
</P>
<P>
Two hostages were reportedly killed while a gunfight between
the rebels and the government troops led to further deaths and
injuries.
</P>
<P>
Raduyev told a Daghestan negotiator in the afternoon that the
Russian troops have to pull out from Chechnya, Daghestan as well
as from the entire northern Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
He refused to release the hostages right away.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations resumed at 19:00 hours at the request of the mayor
of Kizlyar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian President Boris Yeltsin called an emergency
meeting at noon.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech, Vyacheslav Mikhailov, Minister of
Nationality Affairs and Regional Policies, said that the Russian
Federation will resort to military force as well as peaceful
negotiations to iron out the Kizlyar hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
The minister warned that hostages must be released and
terrorist criminals must be punished.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president instructed the formation of a special
headquarters to deal with the crisis and entrusted Daghestan head
of state, Magomedali Magomedov, to investigate into the incident
as well as to negotiate with the Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
A special unit of armed forces is being dispatched to Kizlyar.
</P>
<P>
In June last year, some 50 Chechen rebels held some 1,000
civilians hostage in Budennovsk in southern Russia. More than 100
hostages died in the ensuing fights between the rebels and Russian
government troops that twice tried to storm the hospital where the
hostages were held.

<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital approved
the establishment of 1,552 overseas-funded companies with a
contractual sum of 2.74 billion US dollars of investment last
year, according to the latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
Beijing used an actual total of 1.9 billion US dollars out of
the contractual sum last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that contracted investment by business people
from Europe, the United States and Japan accounted for 35 percent
of the total in 1995, compared with 23.8 percent for the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that the city has scored substantial
achievements in curbing overseas investment in real estate and
entertainment projects while directing more investment toward the
manufacturing sector last year.
</P>
<P>
So far, nearly 4,000 overseas-funded enterprises have become
operational, and 120 of the world's 500 biggest companies have
invested in the Chinese capital.

<P>
WUHAN, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A research team of the Yangtze
River Water Conservation Committee studied four major
international rivers and their branches in southwest China's
Yunnan Province recently.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for experts to conduct a comprehensive
examination of the rivers in that area.
</P>
<P>
The group waw affiliated with China's Ministry of Water
Conservation, the designer of the Three-Gorges Dam project and the
"South Water Transferred to the North" project.
</P>
<P>
The rivers that were studied were the Yuanjiang, the Lancang,
the Nujiang, and the Iriwaddy, that have a total drainage area of
850,000 sq km.
</P>
<P>
Most parts of the rivers have never been examined before,
except for branches. They run through Yunnan Province in an area
of 210,000 sq km, with 150 billion cubic meters of water
resources, and a theoretical power is 256.74 million kw.
</P>
<P>
"This investigation is of far-reaching consequences for the
development of water power of the southwest China and for the
local economy," Tu Shanchao, the team's leader, said.

<HEADLINE> Successful Change in Large Ethylene Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- After a month-long trial run,
China has called the changes made in a large ethylene company a
success, raising its production capacity from 300,000 to 400,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
The changes in the Yangzi Petrochemical Corporation in this
capital city of east China's Zhejiang Province were part of
China's major construction projects in the Eighth Five-Year Plan
(1991-1995). The investment for raising production by 100,000 tons
was 612 million yuan, only one-fifth of what would be needed for
building a new company.
</P>
<P>
By borrowing experiences from a similar transformation project
in the Yanshan Petrochemical Corporation in Beijing, the project
was carried out without altering the existing production
process. No extra land or workers were required and there was no
production halt during the 15-month-long transformation period,
which was the first move of its kind either in China or abroad.
</P>
<P>
The major equipment for the project was imported from other
countries and the new production line is completely automated.

If found guilty, Stanislaus can expect little mercy from the FA
for offending on two major counts, the use of a performance
enhancing drug within a timescale which embraced a competitive
match.
</P>
<P>
"Any traces of a performance enhancing drug, particularly after
a match, must be treated as a matter of the utmost seriousness,"

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A system for protecting
intellectual property rights has taken shape in Shandong Province
in east China thanks to the work of local authorities over the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
Following the establishment of the provincial copyright bureau
1993, a number of local branches were set up in major cities,
including Qingdao, Weifang, and Binzhou, and in 1994 an office of
copyright of musical works was opened in Jinan, the provincial
capital.
</P>
<P>
The provincial copyright company is part of a plan to increase
the number of copyrights. An intellectual property rights joint
inspection group, consisting of officials of the science and
technology commission and the copyright bureau, was recently set
up.
</P>
<P>
These have laid a foundation for better intellectual property
rights protection, a provincial official explained.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the organizations have done a lot
of work. In 1994, there was a large-scale voluntary registering
move province-wide, and last year, there were three province-wide
copyright inspections. Over the past two or so years, copyright
departments have seized and confiscated 1.2 million copies of
pirated books and 11,000 laser discs, and shut down over 140
illegal business outlets.
</P>
<P>
These actions have improved intellectual property rights
protection in the province significantly, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, local authorities have dealt with over 50
copyright dispute cases over the past two or so years, and 1,313
cases of trademark infringement, six of which involved overseas
parties.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Nations Agree to Speed Up Free Trade Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Commerce ministers from the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) agreed to
make further tariff concessions among their countries in the
second round of trade negotiations to be held at Colombo in March
this year.
</P>
<P>
This would help the seven member SAARC nations to achieve the
cherished objectives of the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA)
preferably by the year 2000 but not later than 2005, the ministers
noted in a joint statement adopted yesterday at the conclusion of
a two-day meeting here.
</P>
<P>
This is the first ever meeting of commerce ministers of the
seven member SAARC comprising India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka,
Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Maldives.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the commerce ministers underscored the need
for an institutional mechanism for settlement of trade disputes
within the region and agreed to promote a SAARC arbitration board.
</P>
<P>
They also decided that the next SAARC commerce ministers
meeting will be held in Pakistan in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here today, Indian Minister of
State for Commerce P. Chidambaram said that the second round of
trade negotiations at Colombo would be to expand the list of 226
tariff lines covered under the first round to the maximum
possible.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations would also consider removal of para-tariff,
non-tariff and other trade control barriers within a specific time
frame, and discuss proposals for expanding and deepening the
concessions under the SAARC preferential trading arrangement
framework.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S President Bill Clinton
said today that budget talks between he and Republican
congressional leaders would be in recess until next Wednesday, but
adding a final agreement "is clearly within reach".
</P>
<P>
At a White House briefing after today's talks Clinton said that
both sides explore areas for compromise. "It will require some
additional steps to bridge the gaps."
</P>
<P>
Earlier at the Capitol Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole told
reporters, "While the talks are going to be in recess for a while,
we stand ready to continue discussions when the White House has
new ideas to present."
</P>
<P>
"We have some fundamental differences. We have not ironed those
out," Dole said.
</P>
<P>
Budget talks among Clinton, Dole, House Speaker Newt Gingrich
and other congressional leaders and administration officials had
been going almost daily since late December.
</P>
<P>
"We remain totally committed to getting to a balanced budget,"
Gingrich told reporters. "We are doing everything we can to reach
out in a bipartisan way."

<HEADLINE> Aid Airlift to Sarajevo Ends Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The last plane carrying
humanitarian aid to Sarajevo touched down at Sarajevo airport
today, thus ending the three and half year aid operation, the
longest of its kind in history.
</P>
<P>
A French C-130 military transport cargo plane carrying symbolic
relief aid from Ancona city in Italy flew into Sarajevo to mark
the end of the key lifeline air bridge linking Sarajevo with the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug news agency quoted UNHCR (U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees) spokesman Ron Redmon as saying today in Geneva that the
air bridge is now definitely put to an end. There was no need for
the airlift, which started in July, 1992, to continue because
roads in and out of Sarajevo are open under the Bosnia peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Until October of this year, the Muslim-dominated Sarajevo had
been under Serb siege soon after the ethnic conflict flared up in
early April. The air bridge was symbolically opened by the
then-president of France Francois Mitterrand who flew into
Sarajevo on July 3, 1992, with the first humanitarian flight.
</P>
<P>
In October 1993, the airlift of humanitarian aid had surpassed
the 1948-1949 Berlin airlift which lasted 462 days.
</P>
<P>
Planes from more than 20 countries and five international
organizations have flown 12,951 sorties and sent into Sarajevo
160,677 metric tons of food, medicine and other supplies, thus
saving the 380,000 population in the city from starvation.
</P>
<P>
Most of the humanitarian activities had been carried out by the
U.N. Protection Force and UNHCR. More than 200 U.N. soldiers died
and 1,600 were wounded while conducting their peace mission in the
former Yugoslavia over the past three and half years.
</P>
<P>
The worst incident during the airlift operation occurred on
September 3, 1992, when an Italian G-222 aircraft was shot down
and the four-men crew died instantly.
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR data, about three and half million people in
ex-Yugoslavia received a total of 1.1 million metric tons of
relief aid, 80 percent of which went into Bosnia-Herzegovina where
2.7 million people live.

LUANDA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Angola's rebel UNITA leader
Jonas Savimbi has accepted the date of the next peace talks with
President Eduardo Dos Santos, proposed by visiting Portuguese
President Mario Soares.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Abel Chivuduvudu who is Savimbi's senior
political advisor. He had just held a closed-door meeting with
the Portuguese President. However, he did not reveal the date.
</P>
<P>
He added that the proposed talks should be held in a place
that would "bear fruit".
</P>
<P>
Chivuduvudu said Savimbi had been "well prepared" for the
summit talks.
</P>
<P>
He said the UNITA delegation would arrive at Luanda to resume
talks with the government negotiators on the building of the
National United Army.
</P>
<P>
On the resumption of the camping of the guerilla forces and
government troops, the official said the UNITA soldiers would
act according to the agenda set by the United Nations special
envoy in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also reiterated UNITA's willingness to abide
by the Angolan peace accord signed last year.
</P>
<P>
"We have signed the peace agreement. And we would act on
it," he said.

WASHINGTON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The marathon budget talks
between U.S. President Bill Clinton and congressional Republican
leaders broke down on Tuesday after months of effort to strike a
compromise plan for balancing federal budget in seven years.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, the two sides had been moving toward each other
in offers to cull savings from Medicare, Medicaid, welfare and
other domestic programs, and in tax-cut proposals.
</P>
<P>
At least for now, a halt was coming to the White House talks
among Clinton, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader
Bob Dole and other congressional leaders and administration
officials.
</P>
<P>
A failure of the talks left unclear whether a third partial
federal shutdown involving hundreds of thousands of civil servants
would occur on January 27, when a temporary spending bill covering
scores of programs is due to lapse.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Terrorists Demand Hot Line with Kremlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chechen militants, who took
up to 3,00 people hostage in Kizlyar in northern Daghestan
bordering Chechnya have refused to continue talks with local
authorities and demanded a direct communications line to talk with
the Russian leadership in Moscow, reports reaching here said
tonight.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen terrorists also threatened to burn the town of
Kizlyar down to ashes, the reports added.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 Chechen militants headed by Salman Raduyev, 28, the
son-in-law of rebel Chechen president Dzhokhar Dudayev, stormed
into Kizlyar early this morning and seized the city hospital and
several buildings nearby. They are keeping 3,000 people as hostage
in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
They demand an immediate withdrawal of Russian troops not only
from Chechnya but also from its neighboring regions. The demand
has been seen in Moscow as "unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin already ordered his "power
ministers" to take radical measures to stop the terrorist act.

<HEADLINE> Veteran Politician Cautions against Chaos in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The killing of one of Turkey's
leading industrialists indicated that Turkey entered "a painful
period of chaos," said the chairman of the Democratic Left Party
(DSP).
</P>
<P>
Bulent Ecevit made the remarks at the DSP parliament group
meeting today following the killing of Ozdemir Sabanci, chief
executive of Toyota-Sa, a joint venture between the powerful
Sabanci Holding and Japan's Toyota.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said the increasing terrorist attacks in all the
provinces, the recent prison riots and the killing of Sabanci
today indicated that Turkey had entered "a painful period of
chaos."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the cabinet held an emergency meeting this
afternoon on the assassination of Sabanci and promised to take
the responsible to justice.
</P>
<P>
Ozdemir Sabanci, 54, the youngest of Sabanci's five-brother
family, was killed along two of his aides by leftist gunmen
around 11:00 a.m. local time (09:00 GMT) today in his office in
the 28-storey twin tower of Sabanci center, in downtown Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul police sealed of the building immediately until late
afternoon but no suspects were found inside. Local television
reported that the killing was reported to police only 45 minutes
after the attack on the 25th floor.
</P>
<P>
Two people, including a woman, were reportedly involved in the
attack, and the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front
(DHKP/C) has claimed responsibility for the assassination.
</P>
<P>
A man, who said he was a member of the organization, called
local press offices, saying they would continue to "take revenge
on blood that is spilled by facism."
</P>
<P>
Necdet Menzir, former Istanbul police chief, told Show tv this
evening that the killing was "professionally" planned and
conducted, since the Sabanci center was believed to be heavily
protected by security units and advanced monitor system.
</P>
<P>
The DHKP/C organization is regarded as one of the leading
extremist groups in Turkey, which has increased its violent
activities in 1995.

Police say the grs to

<HEADLINE> PNA Issues Arrest Warrant for Suspected Murderer of Ayyash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) today issued an arrest warrant for a man accused
of delivering a booby-trapped cellular phone that killed prominent
Hamas activist Yihye Ayyash.
</P>
<P>
The arrest warrant was issued after Palestinian police claimed
that Kamal Hamad was involved in the murder of Ayyash, who had
been on Israel's most wanted list for "terrorist activities"
against Jews and the Israel-PLO peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The police said that it was Hamad, a Palestinian building
contractor in Gaza, who gave Ayyash the booby-trapped mobile phone
before it exploded and killed Ayyash in Gaza Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ayyash, nick-named "the Engineer" among Palestinians, belonged
to the Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas. He was said to be an
expert in making bombs to be used for attacking Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
Hamad reportedly fled to the U.S. soon after Ayyash's death
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Israel Radio reported that the PNA might ask
Israel to extradite Hamad for the alleged killing.

<HEADLINE> Flamingo Emigration Arouses Curiosity Of Ecologists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Flamingo emigration became the
hot subject of curiosity in Kenya as flocks of Kenyan and
international scientists rushed to the ancient Lake Simbi Nyaima,
second home for thousands of flamingos.
</P>
<P>
The lake, situated in Kenya's western Homa Bay district and a
lasting charm for international tourists, now became the "refugee
camp" of over 4,000 flamingos from lakes in Kenya's central Rift
Valley Province.
</P>
<P>
"Why are the flamingos emigrating? Their conservation needs
become a big question mark," said Peter Masinde, an ecologist
from the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS).
</P>
<P>
Dozens of researchers, including scientists from the
University of Nairobi, the Egerton University, the World Wildlife
Fund and the United Nations Environment Program, have now,
together with the flamingos, settled down in the lakes.
</P>
<P>
Wilbur Ottichilo, the KWS chief scientist, said they were
collecting ecological data to initiate "a comprehensive
conservation plan".
</P>
<P>
The migrant flamingos in Lake Simbi Nyaima were reported to
be from Lakes in Kenya's Rift Valley Province, including Lake
flamingos, one of the most famous homes for flamingos in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The others are Lake Bogoria and Lake Baringo.
</P>
<P>
The pink birds which attract hundreds of tourists to Lake
Nakuru, first flew to Lake Simbi Nyaima, some 200 kilometers from
Nakuru two months ago, said Ottichilo.
</P>
<P>
The numbers have since tripled. An estimated number of 4,000
flamingos have been settled down at the Lake Simbi Nyaima.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists attributed the flamingos emigration to the
reduction of the size of Lake Nakuru and lack of algae which is
the food of flamingos.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Lake Nakuru is very bad. The flamingos are
experiencing severe food shortage as the lake is drying up. But
they will go back once the situation improves," said an
ecologist.
</P>
<P>
"The search for the causes of the massive emigration is still
going on," he said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin's Spokesman on New Russian Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin's
spokesman Sergei Mevedev tonight described the newly-appointed
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov as a skilled and professional
diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev told reporters here that Yeltsin appointed Primakov
earlier today to the post of Foreign Minister after comprehensive
consultations with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and a number
of experts.
</P>
<P>
"Boris Yeltsin proceeded from the fact that Primakov has a
broad experience in foreign affairs and is far not a freshman in
diplomacy," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Being well aware of both the structure and the routine of the
Foreign Ministry, the appointee is able to start working without a
"set-up phase" and preserve the continuity of Russia's foreign
policy, Medvedev said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the president will guarantee that the
country's foreign policy will remain the same, emphasizing that
the appointment was made in full compliance with constitution. The
candidacy was proposed by Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin signed a decree appointing Primakov to succeed Andrei
Kozyrev as Foreign Minister earlier today. The president dismissed
Kozyrev last Friday. The former Russian Foreign Minister was
elected to the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian
Parliament, last month.
</P>
<P>
Before the appointment, Primakov headed the Russian Foreign
Intelligence Service, the foreign branch of the former KGB.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the appointment, a FSB official said," Primakov
is a solid professional and a firm supporter of the policy of the
Russian President."
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here believe the newly-appointed Foreign Minister
will firmly oppose the eastward expansion plan of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and insist on a foreign policy firmly
defending Russian's national interests.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, 66, was born in Kiev, Ukraine, into the family of
employees, and spent his childhood in Tbilisi, Georgia. He
graduated from the Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies in 1953.
</P>
<P>
In 1962-1970, he was a news analyst, deputy editor and
communist daily Pravda's correspondent in the Middle East. A
communist party member since 1959, he was elected an alternate
member of the party Central Committee at the 27th party congress
and promoted to full membership at the April 1989 Central
Committee plenum.
</P>
<P>
From 1989 to 1991, he chaired the Council of the Union (one of
the two chambers of the Soviet parliament) and was a member of the
Soviet Presidential Council and member of the Soviet Union's
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
In September 1991, Primakov was appointed the head of KGB's
first main directorate (foreign branch) and the first deputy chief
of the KGB. In November 1991, he was appointed director of the
Soviet Union's Central intelligence Service, and in December --
the director of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service.
