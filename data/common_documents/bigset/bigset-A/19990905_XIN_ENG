BRASILIA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso and his visiting Venezuelan counterpart, Hugo
Chavez, started Saturday a working meeting in Manaus, capital of
Amazonas state, on the border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This is Cardoso's fourth meeting with Chavez, and both will try
to tighten the relations between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso said at his arrival at a Manaus hotel for his meeting
with Chavez that the relationship between Brazil and Venezuela "is
very direct."
</P>
<P>
Chavez will brief Cardoso "of everything necessary about the
Venezuelan political scenario and his country's relations with the
other South American countries," said Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia said that the
two presidents will discuss the topic of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC), which causes concern in both countries.

Brazil is willing to collaborate with Colombia if the Pastrana
government requests it, while Chavez will negotiate directly with
the FARC, the biggest Colombian guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian foreign minister spoke about the substitution of
the Venezuelan Congress with the National Constitutional Assembly.
Despite all his cares, "Chavez brings an ingredient of novelty,"
he said.

"This is the first time in this decade that a leader has new
ideas, different from the common pattern. They must be regarded
with respect," said Lampreia.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al Sharaa said Saturday that peace with Israel is possible
within months if there were sincere intentions from the parties
concerned.
</P>
<P>
Sharaa made the remarks in a news briefing following his talks
with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak would
trace the steps of his predecessor Yitzhak Rabin and Syria is
willing to resume the peace process from where it left in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He said Syrian stance on the Middle East peace process has not
changed and Syria believes in the just and comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
He hailed his talks with Albright as "good, meaningful,
positive and open," saying he discussed with her the Middle East
peace process specially on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks and the
means to improve the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
During the briefing, Albright said that the U.S. is willing to
support the Middle East peace process on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
"With enough flexibility and political will that goal (peace in
the Middle East) can be attained," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
"Peace, based on the Land for Peace principle, would be in
favor of all parties and would help resolve all differences
including the security demands, she said, adding that peace also
ensures the economic growth in the region.
</P>
<P>
Albright said a glimpse of hope came to the horizon following
the Israeli-Palestinian agreement on Wye pact Friday expressing
hope that it should help "illuminate the whole region."
</P>
<P>
On her talks with the Syrian officials , she said they were
targetted to find out potentials for resuming the peace process.
</P>
<P>
She also asked the parties concerned in South Lebanon to show
self-restraint saying they have to restore quietude and revive
the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on possible proposals for resuming the
peace talks on the Syrian-Israeli track, the U.S. Secretary of
State said she had some assessments which she discussed with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Those would be presented to
President Hafez al Assad, she added without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
She hoped her visit to Damascus could help move the peace
process towards the right direction urging all sides to continue
the march of peace.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived here from Gaza earlier in the day to discuss the
means of continuing peace process on the Syrian track with the
Damascus officials.
</P>
<P>
Albright has visited Egypt, Israel, Palestinian self-rule area
and left for Beirut, Lebanon later in the afternoon. She is
expected to fly to Egyptian Red Sea city of Sharm El-Sheikh to

<HEADLINE> Journalists Invited to Tripoli for Revolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TRIPOLI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Libyan government has
invited over 200 foreign journalists to cover the celebrations for
the 30th anniversary of the revolution that brought Libyan leader
Muammar Ghaddafi to power.
</P>
<P>
"So far 184 journalists have arrived," an official at the press
center told Xinhua Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Celebrations to mark the 30th anniversary of revolution are
underway around the country.
</P>
<P>
On September 1, 1969, a group of young officers led by Ghaddafi
overthrew the monarchy in a military coup and established the
Libyan Arab Republic, which was later renamed the Great Socialist
People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the week-long celebrations will be a grand
military parade in central Tripoli on Monday in the presence of
African leaders who will be attending an extraordinary summit
meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
The summit, to be held in Libya's port city of Sirte on
September 8-9, will be preceded by a preparatory session of the
OAU Council of Ministers in a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
To ensure success of both the anniversary and the summit, the
Libyan government has chartered aircraft to ferry the journalists
from parts of Africa to Tripoli, said the official.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day summit, themed "Strengthening OAU Capacity
to Enable It Meet the Challenges of the New Millennium," the
African leaders are to review the 36-year-old OAU Charter.
</P>
<P>
They are also expected to issue a declaration to set "clear
directions" regarding the future political, economic and social
activities of the OAU.
</P>
<P>
The OAU Charter has never been revised since it was signed in
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia by 31 heads of states and governments on May
25, 1963.
</P>
<P>
Staging the anniversary extravaganza and hosting the
pan-African summit were considered as part of the Libyan
government's efforts to reach out to the international community
after the United Nations suspended its sanctions on Libya, which
has been in place since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council suspended its sanctions in April
after Libya handed over two Libyans suspected of blowing up the
Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988 which killed 270
people.
</P>
<P>
A formal lifting of the sanctions has yet to be approved by the
Security Council and the country was still under more severe
sanctions from the United States.

<HEADLINE> Albright Discusses Peace Tracks with Lebanese PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Saturday afternoon held talks with Lebanese
Prime Minister Salim Hoss on the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Hoss, who is also the foreign minister,
held a joint news conference with Albright.
</P>
<P>
He said he had told Albright Lebanon's stance over its
commitment for the peace process in the region, especially the
implementation of the United Nations Resolution 425 and the
Israeli pullout from Golan Heights it captured from Syria in
the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted by the U.N. after Israeli first
invasion to the country, calls for an unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel is currently occupying parts of south Lebanon with
the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has been also demanding Israel withdraw from Golan
Heights and insisting talks on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks
be conducted simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Syria, with a 350,000 troops stationed in Lebanon, is
believed an undisputed power broker in the country.
</P>
<P>
Hoss also said his government and people will continue
supporting the resistance movement as long as Israel occupies
Lebanon's lands.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is leading a
guerrilla in the country trying to oust Israeli troops out
of the country.
</P>
<P>
For her part, Albright said she was happy to be in Lebanon as
the first American diplomat to use the Beirut airport over past 16
years.
</P>
<P>
During Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war, Americans had become
the main targets of the country's warring military groups and
since then its citizens were banned from travelling to Lebanon
and airliners barred from landing at its airport.
</P>
<P>
Albright said her regional tour aimed to reviving the peace
talks, which she thought will not be complete without the
participation of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who came here two hours ago, has left for Jerusalem
to brief Israeli leaders over Syrian and Lebanese stance over the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
She is expected to fly to Egyptian Red Sea city of Sharm
El-Sheikh to attend a signing ceremony of a new peace deal between
the Palestinians and Israel.

<P>
KAMPALA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has said that the United Nations should play a bigger
role in bringing about and maintaining peace in the Great Lakes
region.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when holding talks with a U.N. fact-finding
 commission of the actions of the world body during the 1994
genocide in Rwanda here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Museveni expressed happiness that the U.N. had at long last
taken the appropriate measures appointing such a high powered
commission to look into the problem of genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the world body can still come in to assist in
the crisis of the Democratic Republic of the Congo which is partly
a result of events in Rwanda by facilitating the peace observers
and enforcers as prescribed by the Lusaka agreement.
</P>
<P>
The five-man commission, headed by Ingvar Carlson who is a
former Swedish prime minister, was constituted by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan due to persistent accusation leveled
at the U.N. that the organization failed to act and at times acted
wrongly before and during the genocide.
</P>
<P>
The commission had met with Rwandan government representatives,
visited genocide sites and spoken to genocide survivors before
coming to Uganda. It will go on to Tanzania after their Uganda
visit.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, extreme Hutus in Rwanda killed more than 500,000
Tutsi and moderate Hutu people, the biggest ethnic killing in

JOHANNESBURG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government Saturday commended the results of the independence
referendum in East Timor, saying that it was a significant step
towards resolving the ongoing conflict in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement by the United Nations, over 78
percent of the East Timorese voted in favor of independence from
Indonesia in Monday's direct ballot to choose the territory's
future.
</P>
<P>
"We salute the East Timorese who turned out in significant
numbers and exercising their democratic right to determine their
own future," the South African Department of Foreign Affairs said
a statement.
</P>
<P>
"They have done this with calm and dignity despite ongoing
violence and intimidation," it added.
</P>
<P>
However, the department said that it was concerned about the
escalation in violence since the referendum.
</P>
<P>
South Africa asked the East Timorese to respect and abide by
the outcome of the referendum and has endorsed the UN Security
Council's demand on the Indonesian local authorities in East Timor
to arrest those responsible for the violence.
</P>
<P>
The statement said South Africa backed the United Nations,
saying that it would continue to play a pivotal role in the
post-ballot period in East Timor.

of Monday's referendum were released, forcing U.N. personnel,
international observers and foreign journalists to be evacuated
from the region's capital, Dili, to Bali and Australia.

into Indonesia in 1976. But Indonesia's claim to the territory

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Launches Land Reform Policy Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe launched a Land Reform
Policy Research Network in east town of Nyanga Saturday, aiming to
strengthen research and training capacity on land reform.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the cabinet committee on resettlement and rural
development, Joseph Msika, stressed the need for action research
to support the land reform inception phase.
</P>
<P>
"The resettlement process is now in progress, albeit not as
satisfactorily as expected," the Zimbabwe News Agency quoted the
chairman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the two-year inception phase launched in January this
year, the Zimbabwean government aims to resettle 41,100 families
on 300,000 hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
The Land Reform Policy Research Network is an initiative of the
Southern African Regional Institute for Policy Studies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch, Director of the institute Sam Moyo said
the network had a historical mission to correct the intellectual
and policy biases against small holder farmers. Research had
shown that these farmers are a lot more efficient than they were
generally regarded, he added.
</P>
<P>
"It is through research that the government gets to know the
concern of people involved in land reform, both the benefactors
and the victims of land reform, including farm workers," Moyo
said.
</P>
<P>
Some 44 representatives of government, universities and
non-governmental organizations attended the launching ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Justifies Downing of Intruding U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said Saturday
that no permission was given for the U.S. registered plane downed
on August 29 by its anti-craft forces to overfly its northern
border with Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The Johannesburg-bound aircraft was shot down near the northern
town of Adwa, about 40 kilometers from the Eritrean border. A
British and a Swedish, who were piloting the plane, were killed in
the incident.
</P>
<P>
"While the Ethiopian government regrets the loss of life, it
cannot be held responsible for the downing of an aircraft under
such condition s and circumstances," the Ethiopian government said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Ethiopian authorities were not
aware of the identity of the fast moving intruder plane traveling
across the battle lines in the no-fly zone from the direction of
the capital of an enemy state.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, "It is true that permission was
requested and granted allowing the flight to enter Ethiopian
territory on the basis of its request that in fact specifically
stressed that the plane would avoid flying over Eritrean airspace
at all times."
</P>
<P>
"Permission was, therefore, granted for the flight to enter
Ethiopia via Djibouti and fly over southeast Ethiopia to Kenya, "
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"This aircraft, however, entered Ethiopian territory from
Eritrea directly south of Asmara (the capital of Eritrea) at high
speed with neither notification nor permission," it added.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Defense Force therefore took the measures
required of any vigilant defense force at a time of combat.
</P>
<P>
The statement also request the governments of the U.S., South
Africa, Sweden and Britain to share whatever information they have
in order to ascertain the nature of the mission of the intruder
aircraft and why it flew over areas clearly known to be forbidden
territory.

</P>
<P>
Princess Sirindhorn arrived in Phuket earlier Saturday to greet
President Jiang and his entourage at the Phuket airport.
</P>
<P>
Also greeting Jiang at the airport was governor of the province,
Chadej Insawang.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, as representatives of Thai King Bhumibol
Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit, Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn and
the king's grand-daughters bid farewell to Jiang and his wife,
Wang Yeping.
</P>
<P>
Also seeing Jiang off at the airport was Thai Prime Minister

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo, Kabbah hold Talks on Security in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo and his Sierra Leonean counterpart Tejan Kabbah held
talks Friday in Abuja, stressing the need for strengthening the
present security situation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The one-day discussion was said to be one of the regular
consultation between the two leaders on the consolidation of
peace, security and stability in Sierra Leone and the sub- region
in general, reported the Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement shortly after the two leader's talks in the
presidential lounge of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in
Nigeria's capital, both leaders agreed that further confidence
building measures would be taken immediately to ensure the success
of the peace agreement, particularly the early commencement of the
disarmament, democratization and reintegration program.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah's sudden visit to Nigeria came as the first 1200
Nigerian soldiers, who have been defending his government against
rebel attacks, flew home Thursday following the signing of the
Lome Peace Agreement.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that he is seeking further assurance from
Obasanjo so that Nigeria's withdrawal of forces will be gradual
enough for him to establish his own security measures, but this is
difficult because the Sierra Leonean government has no army of
its own after most former soldiers fled or joined the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Implement Agro-Led Economic Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has chosen
Agricultural Development Led Industrialization, an
agricultural-led economic strategy, as the base for the country's
overall development, a government press release said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The strategy aims to take full advantage of Ethiopia's massive
agricultural and industrial potential while ensuring that the
country will be less prey to adverse weather conditions, such as
low rainfall and the resultant drought, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
The major objective of the Agricultural Development Led
Industrialization is to increase the productivity of small farmers
and thereby improve food security in both rural and urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian industry and services depend on the performance of
agriculture, which provides raw materials, generates the necessary
foreign currency to purchase vital imports, and feeds work force
of the country.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural development strategy was declared on the
occasion that the Horn of Africa country is sparing no effort to
realize food self- sufficiency, the release said
</P>
<P>
Specific policies have been introduced to provide technical and
 institutional support to farmers, including fertilizer supply and
 distribution, improved seed supply and distribution, development
of small- scale irrigation, and conservation of natural resources
and environment, it added.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Send Military Observer to Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa could send a
military observer to the troubled Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) as early as Sunday to monitor the peace process, President
Thabo Mbeki's spokesman Parks Mankahlana said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana confirmed the deployment of observers to the central
African country would be the first step in enforcing the
cease-fire which was finally sealed in Zambian capital Lusaka
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Mbeki held separate meetings in Pretoria with
Rwandan Vice- President Paul Kagame and Emile Ilunga, the leader
of the Rwandan-backed faction of the major Congolese Rally for
Democracy (RCD) rebel group.
</P>
<P>
Ilunga and his Ugandan-backed RCD rival, Ernest Wamba dia
Wamba, were among the last rebel leaders to add their signatures
to the peace accord at the talks in the Zambian capital on August
31.
</P>
<P>
Six countries with troops involved in the DRC conflict signed
the cease- fire text on July 10 while a separate rebel group, the
Congo Liberation Movement, signed on August 1.
</P>
<P>
The agreements demanded an end to hostilities within 24 hours
of the signing, called on the United Nations to deploy a
peace-keeping force within four months and urged the government
and the rebels to hold talks on the country's future.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mbeki asked his Foreign Minister Nkosazana Zuma to
delay her departure for a special Organization of African Unity
(OAU) meeting in Libya so that she would continue work on the DRC
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Zuma's spokesman Khangelane Hlongwane said the minister was
scheduled to leave for Sirte, Libya, Saturday but would instead
leave later next week.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the OAU's Council of Ministers on Monday and
Tuesday will look at mechanisms to make the body more effective.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks between the foreign ministers, the heads of
state or government from the OAU members will gather Wednesday for
a two-day summit.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrive in Egypt for Signing of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright have arrived here Saturday to attend the signing ceremony
of a peace treaty between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah II of Jordan, which was the second Arab country,
after Egypt, to sign a peace treaty with Israel, has also arrived
at the Red Sea port to witness the signing of the revised Wye
interim accord.
</P>
<P>
The anticipated signing ceremony came after more than one month
of grueling talks between the Palestinians and Israel over the
implementation of the United States-brokered Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
The revised version of the land-for-peace deal will take effect
Sunday, after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak submits it to his
cabinet. Later in the week, Barak will forward the pact to
Israel's Knesset (parliament) in its special session.
</P>
<P>
According to the new agreement, Israel will implement the
remaining phases of troops withdrawal stipulated in the original
Wye deal, which was signed and then frozen by Barak's hard-line
predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu late 1998 after carrying out the
first of the three-stage pullout from 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel will begin in a few days to hand over 11 percent of the
West Bank to the Palestinians and final withdrawal will be
completed by January 20, under the deal.
</P>
<P>
The two sides played brinkmanship on the number of Palestinian
prisoners to be released by Israel. The Palestinians demanded
freedom for 400 Palestinian political prisoners while Israel
refused to let go of those who had killed Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised Wye accord, Israel will set free a total of
350 Palestinian prisoners jailed in Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also set February 15, 2000 as the deadline for
drafting the framework for the so-called final status talks
between Israel and the Palestinians, which will deal with thorny
issues such as Jerusalem, Palestinian statehood and border,
refugees and distribution of water resources.
</P>
<P>
The final talks are expected to be concluded by next September,
according to the revised Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
The deal allows for a safe passage between the Gaza Strip and
the West Bank for the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In exchange, Israel gets security promises from the Palestinian
side, including the confiscation of illegal weapons among the
Palestinians, captures of Palestinian fugitives and the provision
of the list of Palestinian police to Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a last-minute session here, Israeli envoy Gilead Sher and
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat would decide on the exact date
for Israel to begin withdrawing troops from 7 percent of the West
Bank and release the first of 350 Palestinian security prisoners.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso confirmed Saturday the resignation of
Development, Industry and Commerce Minister Clovio Carvalho.
</P>
<P>
The president did not reveal the name of Carvalho's successor,
whom he praised as "an honest and hard-working man."
</P>
<P>
The former minister criticized the present national economic
policy of austerity in the presence of Finance Minister Pedro
Malan during a seminar organized by the Brazilian Social Democracy
Party and held here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Carvalho called "mediocre" the economic growth level and
"cowardice" the excess of cautiousness with which the government
has been dealing with the development issue.
</P>
<P>
His decision to resign was taken after the constant pressuring
from the government allied parties and the cronies of Malan.
</P>
<P>
Carvalho has been one of the most loyal assistants of Cardoso
since the now president assumed the finance portfolio in 1993, and
before the last cabinet reshuffle he was the chief of the
Presidency Civil House.

<HEADLINE> UK House Prices Could Rise By One-Third: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- House prices in Britain could
increase by one third by the end of next year unless interest
rates are put up swiftly, a leading bank in the City predicted.
</P>
<P>
An independent report by Deutsche Bank said this could push the
cost of an average home up from 75,000 pounds (120,000 U.S.
dollars) to more than 100,000 pounds (160,000 dollars) by the end
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England needs to act quickly to slow the current
aggressive housing market, which is already 10 percent higher than
it was a year ago, it added.
</P>
<P>
Prices in the South, which traditionally have the fastest
recovery, could rise by 35 percent in the next 16 months while in
the North East they could rise by a fifth, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Ciaran Barr, economist at Deutsche Bank, said, "Real incomes
are rising, the cost of buying is not too much and beyond that
real house prices are not overvalued at all."
</P>
<P>
It is believed these conditions could potentially trigger rapid
growth in the housing market in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
According to Barr, the housing boom could mean the economy
overshoots the Bank of England's inflation target of 2.5 percent
by as much as 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted
unanimously to keep interest rates on hold at 5 percent last
month.
</P>
<P>
It is also believed here that the report's findings will
increase the pressure on the MPC, which meets next Tuesday and
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Compliance Satisfactory in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has achieved
satisfactory results in resolving potential millennium bug (Y2K)
related problems in most state sectors, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We have moved into a phase of working on contingency plans,"
said V.K. Samaranayake, chairman of the Council for Information
Technology (CINTEC), which is the government task force
responsible for coordinating millennium compliance efforts.
</P>
<P>
Samaranayake said that other than the health sector, Sri Lanka
was confident critical sectors like finance, water distribution
and power generation, air and sea ports were millennium compliant.
</P>
<P>
"The health sector is behind, but it is not worrying in a way,"
he said, adding that the problem only lies in embedded chips in
some old medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug, or year 2000 problem, refers to the danger
some computers will not recognize dates beyond 1999 because their
programmers once used only two digits to refer to years. As a
result it could disrupt systems from airlines to bank teller
machines to power grids.
</P>
<P>
Y2K readiness means updating computer codes to recognize the
"00" in two-digit date fields as 2000 and not 1900.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's Central Bank said contingency plans were in the
process of being completed before September 30, the revised
deadline as most banks were unable to complete their testing by
June 30, the earlier deadline.
</P>
<P>
All testing in the telecommunications sector has been completed
by June and checked by two Y2K specialists from British Telecom.
The sector is geared to look at possibilities of getting a team of
three Y2K professionals from the World Bank within the next two
months to carry out a final round of checking.
</P>
<P>
Extra care has been taken to ensure that the aviation sector is
100 percent prepared because of the international linkage. "We had
completed testing all critical equipment of air traffic services
and navigation services by mid this year," said Rambukpotha,
chairman of the Airports and Civil Aviation Y2K Task Force.
</P>
<P>
As to the health sector, the Health Department has directed all
hospitals to submit their Y2K readiness reports to the Task Force
by the end of this month.

<HEADLINE> Lukin: China Feat Prompts Envy in Friends, Jealousy in Foes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Vladimir Lukin has visited
China six times in the past 14 years, and each time China's great
progress brought him new surprises.
</P>
<P>
Lukin, who heads the International Affairs Committee of the
Russian State Duma, or lower house of the parliament, has been
following China's development for decades.
</P>
<P>
"Over the 50 years since its founding, especially in the past
two decades following the advent of the reform and opening-up
policy, China has made great strides in its socio-economic
development, which invokes envy from friends and jealousy among
enemies," Lukin said in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
When he first visited Shenzhen in 1985 as a scholar, Lukin was
surprised at the modernization of the city located near Hong Kong.
In his subsequent visits, he found this first special economic
zone of China more and more beautiful.
</P>
<P>
He said China's rise is a feat with world-wide importance in
the 20th century. Although it has yet to complete its
reunification. Hong Kong has already returned to the motherland
and Macao will come back soon. The reunification across the Taiwan
Straits, Lukin said, will be achieved eventually.
</P>
<P>
Lukin also praised China's economic achievements. It is
something of world significance for China to raise the living
standard of people in such a wide expanse of land over such a
short period, he said, and he is even happier to see changes among
ordinary Chinese, who are wearing more smiles and more beautiful
clothes.
</P>
<P>
China is also militarily stronger, but within the proper limit,
Lukin said. Rather than making its neighbors nervous, China
advances its national defense only to the point whereby other
world powers would respect it and heed its interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lukin pointed out, China still faces problems such
as population, environment, political restructuring and
reorganization of large state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the Chinese friends will tackle these problems
smoothly," Lukin said.
</P>
<P>
On relations between Russia and China, Lukin said that current
bilateral ties are actually better than those during the 1950s
when more weight was put on ideology. The two sides are now more
pragmatic and both emphasize mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
Lukin acknowledged the presence of problems in bilateral
economic relations. However, these problems were mainly a result
of Russia's current economic difficulties and have fortunately had
no bearing on bilateral political relations and people-to-people
exchanges, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lukin said Russia and China have established a strategic
cooperation partnership  oriented toward the 21st century. They
now have frequent high-level visit exchanges and both treat each
other candidly. The completion of border demarcation by the two
countries is also an achievement of far-reaching importance.
</P>
<P>
He praised China for its respect for and understanding of
Russia. China, which also experienced social and economic
difficulties in the past, never makes carping comments on Russia,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In the diplomatic field, Lukin said, Russia and China both
advocate a multipolar world and want to see stronger roles of the
United Nations and the U.N. Security Council in international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Lukin, once a Russian ambassador, stressed that a stronger
China poses no threat to the world. From the perspectives of its
history, tradition, and national trait, China is not an aggressive
country.
</P>
<P>
Instead, China is a country that focuses on its own affairs,
Lukin said. "The construction of the Great Wall was not for
expansion but for defense."
</P>
<P>
China poses no threat to Russia either, Lukin said. He
dismissed as sheer eyewash the saying that Chinese leaders want to
take Siberia from Russia and annex it into China.

LONDON -- House prices in Britain could increase by one third

a leading bank in the City predicted.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists recently recovered
an Inca empire site high in the Andes mountains in the province of
Arequipa, south Peru.
</P>
<P>
The site, at an altitude of 2,900 meters, is said to be the
first Inca ruin ever found in Peru. Archaeologists suppose in the
site once stood over 40 huge buildings made by polished stones,
along whose relics some ancient pottery has been found.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, a group of preserved frozen mummies
sacrificed to the Inca gods 500 years ago has been discovered on
top of a snow-clad volcano at an altitude of 6,000 meters in the
same area.
</P>
<P>
The vast Inca empire, with its advanced culture and powerful
armies, spanned most of the Andes along South America's western
coast in the middle of the 15th century. In 1532, it collapsed
under the Spanish conquest.

<HEADLINE> Weatherspoon's Miracle Shot Denies Comets Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Weatherspoon's final shot
as time expired provided the greatest ending to a WNBA playoff
game as the New York Liberty forced a decisive third game in the
Finals with a 68-67 victory over the Houston Comets in Houston.
</P>
<P>
Tina Thompson'e shot provided a 67-65 lead for the Comets with
2.4 seconds to play. As the sellout crowd of 16,285 began
celebrating what it thought were the winning points, Weatherspoon
took the inbounds pass from Becky Hammon and took two dribbles
before letting fly with a shot on the right side that banked off
the top of the box and cleanly through the net, stunning and
silencing the crowd.
</P>
<P>
"It felt pretty good," said Weatherspoon. "When it left my
hand, I was just praying praying it would give us an opportunity
to play Game Three. I've made one of those before, but never in a
game. I was going to live or die with that shot."
</P>
<P>
Guard Cynthia Cooper had a sinking feeling on the shot that
sunk the Comets and forced a decisive Game Three on Sunday at the
Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
"My thought, when it was in the air, was that it was a bucket,"
she said. "I've never seen that before. It was a bucket, a 3-
pointer, and we'll play tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
The incredible shot capped a wild comeback for the Liberty, who
erased an 18-point first-half deficit. Crystal Robinson scored 16
of her 21 points in the second half for New York, which dug itself
a 15-2 hole in the first nine minutes as Houston tried to run the
Liberty out of the Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
The Liberty responded every time the Comets threatened to pull
away for a win. In a addition to wiping out the 18 point deficit,
they erased a nine-point gap in the final 9:10.
</P>
<P>
Kym Hampton erased a four-point gap with a three-pointer and a
jumper to give New York a 63-62 lead with 1:24 remaining. Sheryl
Swoopes and Thompson combined for three free throw, but Robinson
answered with a tough three pointer to forge a 65-65 tie with 16.3
seconds remaining, setting up the dramatic finish.
</P>
<P>
New York shot 39 percent (22-of-56) but stayed in the game by
hitting 8-of-16 shots from beyond the arc. The Liberty also had a
34-28 rebounding advantage, grabbing 13 on the offensive glass.
</P>
<P>
The Comets made only 30 percent (15-of-50) of their shots but
built a 32-16 edge in free throws, attempting 42 to New York's 22.
Houston has made 55-of-71 foul shots in the two games compared to
New York making only 23-of-37.
</P>
<P>
New York snapped Houston's 14-game home winning streak that
spanned to the regular season. The Comets suffered their only home
loss on June 28 to the expansion Orlando Miracle.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Control Tobacco Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar taking measures to
control tobacco and conduct tobacco-free activities in the wake of
the alarming stage of smoking condition reached in the country in
terms of the number of smokers, the amount of tobacco and age of
smokers.
</P>
<P>
Surveys show that 38 percent of the adults in Myanmar were
smokers in 1973 and the percentage went up to 46.6 in 1993,
official newspaper the New Light of Myanmar Sunday quoted Myanmar
Minister of Health Major-General Ket Sein as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to an estimate of the World Health Organization, an
adult smoker in Myanmar consumes 2,000 to 3,000 cigarettes per
year.
</P>
<P>
Another survey also shows that youths between 10 to 20 years of
age in Myanmar have smoked in one way or another, Ket Sein said at
a seminar here on Saturday on tobacco-free initiative, sponsored
by the ministry.

<HEADLINE> China's First Arctic Expedition Retrospected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
And more than 50 elite Chinese polar researchers from various
fields participated in the event, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that the global climate changes reflected in
the Arctic area require multi-field collaboration, and that it is
not possible for people from any single field to carry out such an
inspection of the earth.
</P>
<P>
"It is not common to have such a large-scale comprehensive
expedition," said the chief scientist, adding that China's latest
Arctic expedition expects to significantly advance the nation's
Arctic research, and will train a group of outstanding scholars
for China's future polar study in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Chen had been to both the South and the North poles many times
over the past decade, and now he is a key figure in charge of
China's polar study.
</P>
<P>
"Global climate changes are the result of the integrated effect
of many factors. During the expedition, we employed various means,
such as yachts and helicopters, to carry out multi-site
simultaneous observation of the integrated effect of the ice, the
atmosphere, and the sea," the scientist explained.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the Arctic area studied by the Chinese had
been largely unexplored by the international science community. In
many of the marine areas that the Chinese expedition ship traveled,
there was almost no guidance available in the present marine maps
and materials.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, the success of the expedition fully demonstrated
the Chinese scientists' strong sense of responsibility for the
global changes and environmental problems and their positive
contributions to scientific understanding of the North pole.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned that some relevant research institutes from
the U.S. and Canada were quite helpful to China's Arctic
expedition, and that some researchers from Russia, the Republic of
Korea, and Japan also joined the expedition. So, the expedition
was an example of successful international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The chief scientist told the reporter that the expedition
turned out to be a big success and that the planned targets were
fulfilled. "International cooperation is an important trend in
polar study. The Chinese and foreign scientists had wide-ranging
exchanges during the expedition," he said, hoping that this trend
will continue and be further strengthened.

<HEADLINE> 2000 Fed Cup Tennis to Be Played Under New 13-Team Format </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- starting with the 2000
competition, the women's Fed Cup Tennis Championship will be
contested over just two weeks with a 13-team, three-group format
similar to the one used in World Cup Soccer.
</P>
<P>
The new format, which involves three World Groups of four
nations each and an automatic second round berth for the defending
champion, was announced Saturday at the National Tennis Center in
New York.
</P>
<P>
Italy, a losing semifinalist this year, will host Group A. In
the Fed Cup draw held Saturday, Spain, Germany and Croatia would
join Italy in round-robin play.
</P>
<P>
The Slovak Republic, the other losing semifinalist, will host
Group B and would be joined by Switzerland, Austria and the Czech
Republic.
</P>
<P>
The loser of the 1999 Fed Cup final between the United States
and Russia, to be played at Palo Alto, California later this month,
will be the host nation for Group C. That grouping would include
France, Belgium and Australia in the first round and will be
played during the week of April 24.
</P>
<P>
The three winners from each of the Groups advance to the
semifinals along with the defending champion. The semifinals and
finals both will be contested during the week of November 20.
</P>
<P>
The first round and semifinals will be a best-of-three
competition, with two singles and one doubles match. The final
will be a best-of-five competition, similar to the men's Davis Cup,
with four singles matches and one doubles match. All matches will
be best-of-three sets with a tiebreak only in the first two sets.
</P>
<P>
The three nations which finish last in their World Group round-
robin competition will be relegated automatically to Regional
Qualifying Group One the following year. The three nations who win
their regional qualifying group automatically qualify for the
World Grooup the following year.
</P>
<P>
"The International Tennis Federation is convinced that the new
Fed Cup format will help to boost the competition's image," ITF
President Francesco Ricci Bitti said.
</P>
<P>
Bitti also conceded that the new format was devised to combat
two major problems with the old format -- diminishing player
commitment due to tennis calendar constraints and limited time for
the successful promotion of Fed Cup competition by national
associations.

in Myanmar will be privatized by being sold to national
entrepreneurs, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar
reported Sunday.

<P>
According to official figures, during the first half of this
year, a total of 74 state-owned economic enterprises (SEE)
including four factories, seven rice mills, 57 cinemas and six
hotels were included in the privatization plan.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has, since January 1995, been implementing a
privatization plan for its SEEs, aimed at transforming them into
effective business organizations.
</P>
<P>
There were a total of 36,275 private industrial enterprises in
Myanmar by the end of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Agassi, Capriati Reach Four Round at U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Americans Andre Agassi and
Jennifer Capriati, two of the more compelling comeback stories of
1999, registered impressive victories Saturday to advance to the
fourth round of the U.S. Open Tennis Championships.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who resurrected his sagging career this year by winning
the French Open and reaching the Wimbledon finals, overcame the
antics of fellow American Justin Gimelstob with a 6-1,6-4, 3-6, 6-
4 win.
</P>
<P>
Capriati, the former teenage prodigy returning to the scene of
her greatest triumphs, ousted 11th seed Nathalie Tauziat of France
6-3, 1-6, 6-1 in the women's competition.
</P>
<P>
Two American women's seeds took different routes in advancing
to the round of 16.
</P>
<P>
Second seed and defending champion Lindsay Davenport routed
fellow American Amy Frazier 6-1, 6-1 in just 46 minutes. Davenport,
the Wimbledon champion, is now 7-0 lifetime against Frazier,
having beating her on the way to the Bank of West Classic title
last month in California.
</P>
<P>
Seventh seed Serena Williams had to rally from the brink of
defeat to beat 16-year-old Kim Clijsters of Belgium, the youngest
player in the main draw 4-6, 6-2, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Capriati reached the U.S. Open semifinals in 1991 at the age of
15, was ranked sixth in the world and seemed destined for a great
career before she ran into personal and legal problems and plunged
from the rankings.
</P>
<P>
In other women's play, fifth seed Mary Pierce of France ousted
Spain's Angeles Montolio 6-0, 7-6 (7-4); ninth seed Julie Halard-
Decugis of France advanced when countrywoman Amelie Cocheteux
retired in the opening set; and No. 16 Conchita Martinez of Spain
held off Russia's Elena Dementieva 6-2, 2-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Sabine Appelmans of Belgium rallied to defeat Spain's Magui
Serna 0-6, 6-1, 6-3 in the lone matchup between unseeded women.
</P>
<P>
For the men, Kafelnikov, the third seed from Russia, downed
Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden, 6-1, 6-4, 6-4, and No. 12 Richard
Krajicek of the Netherlands beat countryman John Van Lottum 6-4, 6-
1, 6-4.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Story of Fashion Designer Liu Ming (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Fashion designer Liu Ming
needs only a piece of cloth and some pins to create an exquisite
gown that is ready for the runway.
</P>
<P>
Her needle-less, thread-less technique gained her instant fame
following a demonstration at a contest in Sichuan province in 1990,
and again at the Spring Festival Evening Party, televised live by
China Central Television (CCTV) the following year.
</P>
<P>
"I got the inspiration from the Indian Sari and the popular
method in Japan in which dresses are cut out right on the models,"
Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Liu was only 18 when she got her first job in the fashion
business, designing dresses for a local modeling team in Chongqing
city. Due to a money shortage, she had to make dresses as simply
as possible.
</P>
<P>
"I was not aware that I was creating an original dressmaking
method, I only knew it saves both money and cloth," said Liu. With
her nimble fingers, she can make a rose out of a napkin, and a
wedding dress out of mosquito netting and string. She has adapted
her distinct vision to create kimono, cheong-sam, evening dresses
and beachwear.
</P>
<P>
"Before that, I was never ambitious enough to become a fashion
designer," she recalled. "My biggest ambition was to become a
tailor and have a small workshop of my own."

<TEXT>
<P>
Even this simple wish seemed unattainable for Liu, who worked
for years as a pigment mixer in a local tannery before signing up
with the modeling team.
</P>
<P>
"I worked in the tannery and attended classes in a fashion
center. I also hired an art tutor to teach me art basics," she
recalled.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the dressmaking demonstration at CCTV, Liu formed
her own modeling team and looked for fashion shows in which to
show off her unusual work. "I became ambitious enough to present
my own idea of fashion design," she said.
</P>
<P>
But as China opened up wider to the outside world, the country'
s dressmaking industry faced mounting competition from name brand
clothing manufacturers at home and abroad as well as exclusive
dress shops.
</P>
<P>
To make herself more marketable, Liu enrolled at the Central
Institute of Arts and Crafts to receive formal training in fashion
design. "I wanted to prepare myself to become a fashion designer
in the real sense," she said.
</P>
<P>
With her unique artistic flair which combines Chinese tradition
and culture, Liu created two collections, "Dream of China" and "
Yunyou," and won wide acclaim in the fashion circle as a designer
with great potential.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, she was named "Excellent Fashion Designer" in the
country's top national garment design contest.
</P>
<P>
Now, the 30-year old Liu has her own company and workshops, has
developed two name brands and is custom-making dresses for stores
in the busiest shopping district in Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
With a smile, she said she expects two things in the future: a
new collection of dresses -- and a baby.

BELGRADE, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's official news
agency Tanjug carried an editorial Saturday, accusing Bernard
Kouchner, head of the U.N. mission, of making decisions that
wantonly trample upon the sovereignty of Yugoslavia and go against
the U.N. Security Council resolution 1244.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said that after his decision Friday that the
German mark will serve as the major official currency in the
province of Kosovo, Kouchner declared the establishment of customs
on the Yugoslav border with Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Under the support of Kouchner, the illegal government formed by
the illegal ethnic Albanian "Kosovo Liberation Army" has now got
control of the tax and customs revenues in Kosovo and has been
sharing the money with the U.N. mission, it said.
</P>
<P>
The editorial pointed out that Kouchner's action has caused
uneasiness among local Serbs, for they believe what Kouchner has
done is to sever Kosovo's ties with Yugoslavia.

WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Saturday hailed the new accord reached between Israel and the
Palestinians, but he also said much hard work remained for
permanent peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at his presidential retreat at
Camp David, Clinton cautioned that "There is much hard work ahead,
" singling out those of negotiations between Syria and Israel and
between Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the new accord, so-called Wye Two agreement,
could be a "stepping stone" to a broader peace in the region and
he pledged U.S. support for such efforts.
</P>
<P>
"We will do everything we can to be supportive all along the
way and to achieve our larger goal -- a just and lasting
comprehensive peace in the entire region, including Syria and
Lebanon," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The new accord was signed on Saturday at the Egyptian Red Sea
resort of Sharm el-Sheikhh, which called for further withdrawal of
Israeli troops from the West Bank and the release of hundreds of
Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, starting in 10 days.

<HEADLINE> Structural Reforms Create "Miracle Economy" in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Since the onset of the Asian
financial crisis in 1997, the Australian economy, recently
described by U.S. economist Paul Krugman as a "miracle economy",
has continued to record a strong growth.
</P>
<P>
This performance, more or less marvelous, has benefited from
the robust policy framework, a fruit of progressive structural
reforms in the 1980s and 1990s, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The country's gross domestic product (GDP) grew around 5
percent in 1998, despite many of its major Asian trading partners
experiencing recession and a consequent slowdown in world economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Australian economy has outperformed not only that of its East
Asian neighbors, but most other rich countries as well, the
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the country's GDP growth was faster
than that of the United States and more than doubled the aggregate
one of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development
(OECD).
</P>
<P>
Besides, over a longer period, its GDP has been the fastest
growing one of all the developed economies bar Ireland and Norway.
</P>
<P>
During the 1990s, Australian economic growth has averaged 3.2
percent a year, compared with 2.5 percent for the United States, 2.
1 percent for New Zealand, 1.9 percent for Britain and Canada, and
1.8 percent for Japan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inflation and interest rates have been kept low
successfully. During the past nine years, its inflation rate has
averaged just 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
A very ready explanation for the "miracle economy" is that the
country is reaping reward economic reforms embodied in "four
pillars", the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The first pillar is financial deregulation, which has led to
the floating of Australian dollar, the admission of foreign banks
into Australia and a number of other results.
</P>
<P>
This serves as a firmer framework for Australian economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The second pillar is the introduction of a more stringent
National Competition Policy.
</P>
<P>
The National Competition Policy is an important element of the
economic structural reform in recent years. It was passed
unanimously by the country's state and territory governments in
April 1995.
</P>
<P>
The policy includes a nationally applied competition law which
ensures government businesses and privatized public monopolies do
not enjoy an unfair advantage over their competitors.
</P>
<P>
A key objective of the policy is to increase competition in
sectors where competition has been limited by regulatory barriers,
particularly in communications, energy and transportation sectors.
</P>
<P>
A fully open market for telecommunications was introduced in
1997. And recently, the National Electricity Market started to
allow free trade of electricity between the eastern states.
</P>
<P>
An obvious result of the reform is an overall rising of the
country's productivity, at an average annual rate of 2.4 percent
over the past four years, compared to a historic record of only 1.
4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The third pillar is the vigorous reforms of the labor market in
the past three and a quarter years.
</P>
<P>
The Workplace Relations Act 1996 has accelerated the move from
centralized wage fixing to enterprise bargaining, and ensured
wages and workplace practices are consistent with the
circumstances of individual firms.
</P>
<P>
During the past four years, the country's unit labor costs have
risen by only 1.8 percent annually compared to 7 percent in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the new Job Network and programs of improving work
force skills and abilities have encouraged and assisted job search
by unemployed people.
</P>
<P>
The reforms help increase responsiveness of the labor market to
changes in the economy, reduce impediments to job creation and
participation in employment, and improve productivity.
</P>
<P>
The fourth pillar is the government's consistent efforts to pay
off debt and balance budget.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the four pillars, Australia is embracing the most
comprehensive tax reform in its history.
</P>
<P>
The new tax system will bring Australians significant cuts in
their income tax, and business and exporting costs will be
dramatically reduced. Individuals are encouraged to achieve more
and Australian business and exports will become more competitive.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the International Monetary Fund and the OECD predict
that Australia will grow faster than all Group-7 economies next
year, and the Australian government expects its economy to grow at
a solid 3 percent in 1999-2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Australians believe the ongoing structural reforms, plus a new
tax system, will propel Australia's strong growth momentum into
the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes Overseas Investment in Building Materials Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- China's State Administration
of Building Materials Industry (SABMI) will present 69 projects,
which call for an aggregate investment of 1.9 billion U.S. dollars,
to overseas investors during the coming investment and trade fair
to be held in southeast coastal open city of Xiamen on September 8-
12.
</P>
<P>
China now has received 5 billion U.S. dollars worth of overseas
funds in the thriving industry, China Daily's Business Weekly
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"SABMI will try to create more favorable investment climate for
overseas investors," said Huang Jinfeng, an official with the
administration.
</P>
<P>
She said SABMI has taken measures to maintain market order,
including setting price floors for relevant products and working
with related departments to combat fake products.
</P>
<P>
However, she stressed that all overseas-funded projects must
meet international environmental protection standards.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics reported a 2.3 percent year-on-year growth
in building materials exports totaling 1.02 billion U.S. dollars
in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Huang attributed the growth to increased tax rebate rates. Such
rate for cement export increased from 11 percent in 1998 to 15
percent in 1999 while that for glasses and non-metallurgical
products up from 9 percent to 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
Diversified strategy and improved quality also promoted
building materials exports, she noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Paraguay's president
Saturday appointed Carlos Mateo Balmelli as foreign minister to
succeed Miguel Abdon Saguier dismissed for failure to obtain the
extradition of two former military leaders who were granted asylum
in Argentina and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Saguier told the press that President Luis Gonzalez Macchi
asked him to resign over the telephone because of pressures from
relatives of the assassinated Vice President Jose Maria Argana,
according to reports reaching here from Asuncion.
</P>
<P>
Argentina Thursday rejected a request by Paraguay for the
extradition of failed coup leader former army chief Lino Oviedo,
who is accused of instigating Vice President Argana's
assassination in March. Oviedo requested political asylum in
Argentina on March 28.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Uruguay turned down Paraguay's extradition
request for former Defense Minister General Jose Segovia, said to
be a close associate of Oviedo, who is accused of stealing 450,000
U.S. dollars while serving under former President Raul Cubas Grau.
</P>
<P>
The dismissed Paraguayan foreign minister said he did his best
to get both extraditions, especially the one of Oviedo.
</P>
<P>
Saguier said that the president was pressured by Defense
Minister Nelson Argana, son of the assassinated Vice President,
and Argana's widow, Marylin Contreras.
</P>
<P>
The Paraguayan government earlier Friday recalled for an
indefinite time its ambassadors to Uruguay and Argentina.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economic Powerhouse to Increase International Presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province,
with the third largest gross domestic product in the country, will
make efforts to increase its presence in the global economy in the
coming century.
</P>
<P>
"The province will take measures to tap markets all over the
world while introducing more overseas funds and talented people,"
said Shandong Provincial Governor Li Chunting.
</P>
<P>
As part of these efforts, the province will encourage more
local enterprises, including State-owned enterprise groups and
large private businesses, to open subsidiaries abroad.
</P>
<P>
Li said that his province, with a population of 88 million,
boasts rich natural resources and has made marked progress in
economic development over the past few decades.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, Shandong is now the country's largest producer
of grain, edible oil, vegetables, fruit, cement, crude salt,
washing machines, and several other agricultural and industrial
products.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, when China introduced its reform and opening
policies, Li said, the province has opened up to the outside world
step by step.
</P>
<P>
The cities of Qingdao and Yantai, both tourist attractions, are
among the first 14 Chinese coastal cities open to overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
To date, the province as a whole has established economic and
trade ties with 180 foreign countries and regions including the
Republic of Korea, Germany, the United States, Britain, Canada,
Australia, Japan, and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of overseas investors, including 26 of the
world's top 100 multinationals, have injected some 21 billion U.S.
dollars into Shandong, accounting for about one-tenth of the
province's total investment.
</P>
<P>
Local foreign trade has grown by 15.9 percent annually in the
past two decades, with exports rising 13.4 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that Shandong handled 16.6 billion U.S.
dollars of imports and exports last year, making up 22.5 percent
of the province's GDP.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Buyi People Take to Modern Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 5 (Xinhua) -- "My forefathers used to live
in shabby, broken huts together with livestock and never adopted
any advanced farming skills," said Xu Mingqing, a villager of the
Buyi people of Libo County in southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
But after 1949, when the People's Republic was founded and
people of different ethnic groups were granted equal rights, the
Buyi began to change their primitive way of life.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jiali, a local official in charge of minority people's
affairs, told Xinhua that for hundreds of years, the Buyi had been
in a state of hostility with the Han, China's major group, and
other minority people, due to suppression by the dynastic feudal
rulers.
</P>
<P>
Buyi people used to avoid contact with the outside and shun all
modern concepts and ways of life, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, over the past five decades, the Buyi, now with a
population of 2.1 million, have experienced great changes and
achieved much progress, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Xu Mingqing is one of the first Buyi villagers to do business
and has adopted modern farming techniques with the use of
chemicals, fertilizers, machinery and, in recent years, greenhouse
technology.
</P>
<P>
Like Xu, most local villagers in Boli County, where 60 percent
of the population are ethnic Buyi, have now said farewell to
poverty and are much better off.
</P>
<P>
Meng Qiliang, administrator of the Qiannan Buyi and Miao
Autonomous Prefecture, attributed these changes to the central
government policy on minority people and measures to help
underdeveloped areas catch up with the rest of the nation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt to Free E. Timor's Separatist Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
free East Timorese separatist leader Xanana Gusmao on Wednesday
(September 8) by handing him over to the UN Mission in East Timor
(UNAMET), a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Xanana's release would be effective as soon as possible
following the government's decision to grant him amnesty, Antara
News Agency quoted State Secretary/Justice Minister Muladi as
saying Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Xanana was serving a 20-year prison term but the amnesty would
effectively erase some 10 years from his term.
</P>
<P>
"His release will be carried in a short time. But he will first
be flown to Dili, capital of East Timor, where he will be handed
over to UNAMET," Muladi said.
</P>
<P>
Following Saturday's announcement of the results of the August
30 direct ballot, Xanana called on the East Timorese people to
reconcile in the new spirit of brotherhood to maintain peace and
order in the territory.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement by the U.N., over 78 percent of
East Timorese voted in favor of independence from Indonesia in
Monday's direct ballot to choose the territory's future.
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, Muladi disclosed that Indonesia will
continue to maintain security in East Timor in the second phase,
starting from the announcement of the direct ballot's results up
to the endorsement of the ballot's outcome by the general meeting
of the People's Consultative Assembly in November.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Indonesia accepts the ballot's outcome
sincerely and in a sportmanlike spirit," he said.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move has never been recognized by the
U.N.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the Indonesian government proposed to
give wide-ranging autonomy to East Timor. In May, the U.N.,
Indonesia and Portugal signed an agreement on the holding of a
direct ballot in East Timor to decide the territory's future.

<HEADLINE> Building Two Industrial Corridors In Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
Province has decided to build two industrial corridors along the
Dadu and Minjiang rivers to replace the forest industry as a new
economic growth area.
</P>
<P>
This comes in response to a State ban on logging last year to
protect the environment and stop soil erosion. Forestry used to be
a major industry along the two rivers, which run through the
cities of Ya'an and Leshan and the Tibet autonomous prefectures of
Aba and Garze.
</P>
<P>
The development program calls for the region to be built into
the largest energy consuming industrial base in that part of China
over the next five to ten years. Its abundant water resources and
30 types of mineral resources make it suitable for developing
energy. On the two rivers, power stations may be built with a
combined generating capacity of several tens of millions of kw.
</P>
<P>
There are 60 small hydro-electric power stations with an
aggregate generating capacity of 80,000 kw in Shimian County on a
key section of the Minjiang River and 20 more with a generating
capacity of 50,000 kw are being built.
</P>
<P>
The county has 14 energy consuming enterprises and it produces
40,000 tons of silicon, carbon ferromanganese, and eletrolysis
zinc and about 45 percent of the county's revenue. Its output of
silicon ranks third in the country and it has become the largest
foreign exchange earner from silicon exports in this part of China.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 industrial enterprises have been established by
investors from Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang province in east
China and Chongqing municipality along the Dadu.

sustained a deep cut over his left eye. Under the IBF rules,
points decide the winner if the injury which ends the fight occurs
after the sixth round.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian, Venezuelan Presidents Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso met with his Venezuelan counterpart, Hugo Chavez,
on Saturday to discuss ways of strengthening bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from their four-hour meeting in Manaus, capital of
Amazonas state bordering Venezuela, Cardoso told reporters that
Chavez briefed him on the political reforms in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso said Chavez told him that Venezuela would stay in
democracy.
</P>
<P>
Peace and democracy are very important for Brazilians, Cardoso
said.
</P>
<P>
The summit was held in the middle of a controversial process of
reforming the constitutional and institutional systems in
Venezuela. No joint statement was made at the end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Foreign Ministry's spokesmen said before the meeting
that the two presidents would examine the political situation in
neighboring Colombia in view of its worsening internal armed
conflict.

<TEXT>
<P>
Argentina frustrated Brazil's weak attack, centered around
crowd favorites Ronaldinho and Ronaldo Assis who found little room
to operate.
</P>
<P>
Brazil coach Wanderley Luxemburgo changed three players at
halftime in an attempt to beef up Brazil with Elber, Alex and
Marcos Assuncao taking the place of Ronaldo Assis, Ze Roberto and
Vampeta.
</P>
<P>
The changes helped galvanise Brazil but the goal from Crespo
ended the game as a contest.

<HEADLINE> Simitis: Only One Superpower Cannot Secure World Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis Saturday stressed in the northern Greek city of
Thessaloniki that only one superpower could not safeguard world
peace.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 64th Thessaloniki international trade fair,
Simitis said that a single superpower was not a factor for global
stability and that was why a politically powerful European Union
(EU) was needed more than ever as a factor in global equilibrium,
the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He added that joining the euro zone would make Greece part of
the EU bloc that was set to become a key player in the global
arena as a counterweight to a single superpower, currently the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Greece, which is now the only country of the 15 EU members
which fails to join the euro zone, is to apply for euro zone
membership by mid-March 2000 with approval expected at the EU's
summit in June of the same year.

MOSCOW, September 5 (Xinhua) -- An explosion badly damaged a
five-story apartment building housing military officers in
southern Russia, killing at least six people and injuring 65, said
news reports early Sunday local time.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the explosion was unknown, but suspicion at once
fell on Islamic rebels who have been fighting Russian troops in
some nearby villages in Dagestan for the past week.
</P>
<P>
Rescue teams arrived at the scene in the town of Buinaksk in
Dagestan, and the casualty toll was expected to rise, the Interfax

<HEADLINE> Seven Teams Assured of Play-off for Euro 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Norway and Slovenia in Group Two, Germay and Turkey in Group
Three, Sweden in Group Five, Romania and Portugal in Group Seven
are on the merge to book the tickets for the final, which will be
co-hosted by Belgium and the Netherlands next summer.
</P>
<P>
Only when the penultimate round of qualifying matches is played
on Wednesday can any of these teams make certain of their place in
the finals alongside the co-hosts and the sole qualifiers to date,
the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Wales, Russia, Iceland and Estonia are back in contention after
victories on Saturday, and the closest fight of all is in Group
Four where Ukraine (16 points), Russia (15), Iceland (15)and world
champions France (15) are separated by one point.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine and France drew 0-0 in Kiev on Saturday, Russia beat
Armenia 2-0 in Moscow and Iceland beat Andorra 3-0 in Reykjavik.
</P>
<P>
Although France have slipped to fourth on goal difference, they
still have as good a chance as any of the three teams above them
of qualifying with their two matches remaining against Armenia
away and Iceland at home.
</P>
<P>
Russia, who started the qualifying campaign with three straight
defeats, chalked up their fifth successive win with their victory
over Armenia. If they beat Andorra as expected on Wednesday and
then beat Ukraine at home in their final match, they could yet
qualify as winners.
</P>
<P>
The nine group winners qualify automatically along with the
runner-up with the best record. The eight remaining second-placed
teams play off against each other for the remaining four places.
</P>
<P>
Denmark, champions in 1992, scored their third successive
victory with a 2-1 win over Switzerland in Copenhagen, a vital win
after Wales came from behind to win 2-1 in Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Italy (14 points) will clinch the group if they beat Denmark(11)
in Naples on Wednesday, but Wales (9) and Switzerland (8)are still
in with a chance of a finals place.
</P>
<P>
Norway (19 points), who beat Greece 1-0 in Oslo thanks to a
goal from Oyvind Leonhardsen, and Slovenia (17), who beat Georgia
2-1 with Milenko Acimovic and Zlatko Zahovic scoring,have pulled
clear of Latvia (12) points.
</P>
<P>
Norway will qualify for the finals if they beat Slovenia at
home on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reigning champions Germany (15) and Turkey (15) will fill the
top positions in Group Three after two goals from Oliver Bierhoff
gave Germany a 2-1 win over Finland in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
Turkey crushed Northern Ireland 3-0 in Belfast with Arif Erdem
scoring three goals in four minutes either side of halftime - one
of the fastest international hat-tricks recorded.
</P>
<P>
In Group Five Sweden (16 points) scored an important 1-0 win
over Bulgaria in Stockholm. They scored midway through the second
half via substitute Niklas Alexandersson, who had only come on two
minutes earlier.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria, already eliminated, were reduced to 10 men when Milen
Petkov was sent off and the result left Sweden poised to qualify
next Wednesday when they should beat Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
England (12 points) crushed Luxembourg 6-0 at Wembley with
skipper Alan Shearer scoring his first hat-trick for his country.
England moved ahead of Poland (12) on goal difference and whoever
wins Wednesday's match in Warsaw between the two will finish
second behind a victorious Sweden.
</P>
<P>
In Group Six Spain (15) advanced towards the finals with a 3-1
win over Austria in Vienna. While Spain are almost certain of
qualifying as winners, Cyprus and Israel will keep up their
challenge for the runners-up spot when they meet in Limassol on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Austria are not out of it mathematically but appeared
demoralised - although they redeemed some pride after losing 9-0
to Spain in March.
</P>
<P>
In Group Seven Romania (20), who beat Slovakia 5-1 in
Bratislava, and Portugal (19) - despite being held to a shock 1-1
draw by a 10-man Azerbaijan - cannot realistically be caught.
Their meeting in Bucharest on Wednesday is likely to determine who
win the group.
</P>
<P>
The only match played in Group Eight saw Croatia (14) beat
Ireland (12) 1-0 with a last minute goal from new Arsenal signing
Davor Suker, top scorer in the 1998 World Cup, to move Croatia to
the top of the standings.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia could move above the Irish if they beat Macedonia on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
While the Czech Republic (24) have already won Group Nine with
eight successive victories, Scotland (11) and Estonia (10)moved to
the front of a four-team queue for second place with wins over
Bosnia and the Faroe Islands respectively.
</P>
<P>
Scotland won 2-1 in Bosnia while Estonia beat the Faroes 2-0.
The Czechs won 4-0 against Lithuania who, like Bosnia, have eight
points.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Hotel Chain to Remain in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Spanish Sol-Melia hotel
chain will maintain its investments in Cuba despite the threat of
a possible sanction from the United States, said Cuban
Vice President Carlos Lage Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The official said it is absurd that the United States will
pretend to apply Chapter 4 of the so-called Helms-Burton law that
would affect the executives of the hotel chain.
</P>
<P>
The United States would violate an agreement adopted two years
ago with the European Union with the threat of an eventual
application of the Helms-Burton law, said Lage.
</P>
<P>
The Sol-Melia executives consider that there is no sanction
yet, but a warning of a possible sanction, explained Lage.
</P>
<P>
The Sol-Melia is one of the main hotel companies in Cuba, where
tourism is the main source of hard currency for the country.
</P>
<P>
Chapter 4 of the Helms-Burton law foresees that the United
States will deny a visa to the executives of firms that do
business in Cuba in properties confiscated to U.S. citizens in
Havana.
</P>
<P>
Lage called the Helms-Burton law "arbitrary, illegal,
irrational and absurd."
</P>
<P>
Most countries have criticized the Helms-Burton
extraterritoriality, with which the United States pretends since
1996 to harden the blockade against the island.

<HEADLINE> Edwards Reveals Spikey Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scot finished third in Spain last week when he was pinned
hot favorite to take the title he won in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But Edwards, who returned to winning ways at the Scotstoun
Stadium in Glasgow, revealed it all went wrong in the final in the
run-up.
</P>
<P>
"My local video shop was closed this week so I had to watch a
horror video from Seville," said Edwards, who set a Scottish all-
comers record of 17.07 meters at the CGU Challenge between Britain
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I discovered that the measurement of my run-up was wrong
because my new spikes were an inch longer than my old ones.
</P>
<P>
"That changed my center of gravity and caused me to over-rotate.
I am very annoyed with myself because I had trained all year for
the worlds. I feel a bit stupid really."

<HEADLINE> UNAMET Policeman Shot in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A civilian policeman of the
United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) was shot and 27
houses were burned by mobs following the announcement of the
results of the August 30 autonomy ballot on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
East Timor police spokesman Captain Widodo said Chandlen, a
UNAMET civilian policeman from the United States, was shot in
Liquisa district at about 9:00 a.m. He was hit in his left side so
that he had to be evacuated to Dili, capital of East Timor,
reports reaching here Sunday from Dili, said.
</P>
<P>
Widodo said pro-integrationists burned three houses in the
district of Aileu, about 47 kilometers south of Dili at 11:00 a.m.
local time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, crowds burned ten houses at around the same time in
Bobonaro, about 138 kilometers west of Dili, and 14 other houses
and kiosks in Becora, East Dili and at Mercado Lama market in
Dili, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that until 6:00 p.m. about 3,500 people had
been evacuated to East Nusa Tenggara province of Indonesia by land
because they were afraid of possible violence.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement by the U.N., over 78 percent of
East Timorese voted in favor of independence from Indonesia in
Monday's direct ballot to choose the territory's future.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move has never been recognized by the
U.N.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the Indonesian government proposed to
give wide-ranging autonomy to East Timor. In May, the U.N.,
Indonesia and Portugal signed an agreement on the holding of a
direct ballot in East Timor to decide the territory's future.

<HEADLINE> Irvine: I Couldn't Be Shumacher's Number Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irvine's four-year association with Ferrari will draw to a
close at the end of the current season as he makes way for Rubens
Barrichello.
</P>
<P>
Barrichello was confirmed Saturday morning as the new number
two at Maranello, the Brazilian signing a two-year contract which
sees him become partner to Schumacher.
</P>
<P>
Irvine will now almost certainly take up the vacancy left by
Barrichello at Stewart-Ford, who are set to become Jaguar from
next season after the American motor giant's buy-out of the
legendary British car manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old will be handed the number one role he has
craved for so long, with Johnny Herbert retaining his seat in a
line-up which will be confirmed shortly after next weekend's
Italian Grand Prix at Monza.
</P>
<P>
Irvine has been frustrated at continually having to concede
second best to Schumacher on many occasions, the two-time former
world champion always given priority in all aspects of Ferrari's
operation.
</P>
<P>
Only now, with Schumacher still recovering from a broken right
leg sustained in the British Grand Prix in early July, has Irvine
known what it is like to be number one at the famous Prancing
Horse marque.
</P>
<P>
But Irvine fully realises the status quo would have returned
for next season, with the German resuming his influential status
and the Ulsterman relegated to back seat driver again.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been impossible to stay with Ferrari as number
two to Michael Schumacher," confirmed Irvine, who still has the
world title in his sights.
</P>
<P>
He lies one point behind current leader and reigning world
champion Mika Hakkinen in the standings going into the last four
races at Monza, the European at the Nurburgring, Malaysia and
Japan.

<P>
NEW DELHI, September 5 (Xinhua) --
</P>
<P>
The Indian National Congress:
</P>
<P>
The Congress, founded in 1885 to oppose British rule, has ruled
India for around 45 of the 50 years since independence in 1947.
</P>
<P>
Jawahar Lal Nehru ruled India as its first prime minister at
the head of a Congress government from 1947 to 1964.
</P>
<P>
Indira Gandhi, Nehru's daughter, headed the country's Congress
government twice from 1966 to 1977 and from 1980 to 1984 when she
was killed by her body guard.
</P>
<P>
Rajiv Gandhi replaced his mother as Congress leader and prime
minister in 1984 and he was assassinated in 1989 by a suicide
bomb.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1996, a minority Congress government took office
and won over enough members of parliament to attain a majority
after two years.
</P>
<P>
The party got only 141 seats in the 545-member low house of
parliament in the 1998 elections. In order to prevent the Indian
People's Party (BJP) from coming to power, the Congress, which
could not come to power itself, decided to offer its support from
outside to the UF which then formed a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
On March 16, 1998, Sonia Gandhi, who was appointed new
president of the Congress Party on March 14, was unanimously
elected as chairperson of the Congress Parliamentary Party.
</P>
<P>
The Congress in its 1999 election manifesto pledged to provide
a "stable, able and experienced government" if it were elected in
the coming Lok Sabha elections.
</P>
<P>
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP, Indian People's Party):
</P>
<P>
The Bharatiya Janata Party, founded in 1980 as a breakaway
group of the People's party, is the largest parliamentary party in
India. The BJP got its first taste of power at the national level
after the inconclusive 1996 elections during which the party won
193 seats with its alliance. Its government, however, fell within
a fortnight after failing to establish a majority in the hung
parliament.
</P>
<P>
During the 1998 elections, the BJP obtained 182 seats in the
Lower House of parliament and on March 19, 1998, Atal Bihari
Vajpayee, leader of BJP, was sworn-in as Indian prime Minister at
the head of a two-tied 43 member coalition which included a number
of new faces.
</P>
<P>
On April 17, 1999, the 13-month Vajpayee coalition government
was defeated by one vote in the vote of confidence in the Lower
House of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
In its manifesto of 1999 election, the BJP-led National
Democratic Alliance pledged to continue the reform process to
ensure that the national economy grow on the principle that "India
shall be built by Indians."

NEW DELHI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- India is one of the
countries with an ancient civilization in the world. It became a
unified country in 4th century BC.
</P>
<P>
European colonists began to invade India in the 16th century.
The Pulasi War between India and Britain broke out in 1757. India
was defeated and became a British colony. Britain occupied all the
territory of India in 1849.
</P>
<P>
An uprising against the British by the Indian people took place
in 1857.
</P>
<P>
In June 1947, Britain promulgated "Mountbatten Plan", which
divided India into India and Pakistan. After a prolonged struggle
against British colonial rule, India became independent within the
commonwealth on August 15, 1947. In November 1949, the Constituent
Assembly approved a republican Constitution, providing for a
president as head of state.
</P>
<P>
India became republic on January 26, 1950, although remaining a
member of the commonwealth.

The Hammers were awarded an 8,500 pounds fine for "improper

Metz.

<P>
Trouble flared when Metz scored midway through the second half
to level the score 2-2 on aggregate.
</P>

The violence involved coin throwing and it is understood
Hammers supporters shook fencing before ultimately celebrating a 3-
2 aggregate win.
</P>
<P>
The Upton Park club have also received another 3,500 pounds
fine for "failing to observe competition regulations" laid down by
European football's governing body.

It relates to a technical offence regarding the initial
registration of players ahead of one of their earlier games in the

<HEADLINE> England Whitewash Luxembourg in Euro Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- England whitewashed Luxembourg
6-0 Saturday, making a perfect tune-up for its final group match
against Poland in Euro 2000 qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
Alan Shearer found back his form in the match with a hatrick
goals.
</P>
<P>
England swept a toothless Luxembourg team aside with five goals
in the first 43 minutes of a totally one-sided match -- and they
also had two other goals disallowed for offside.
</P>
<P>
Shearer got the first from the penalty spot in the 12th minute
and added two more in the 27th and 33rd to take his tally for his
country to 27 in 52 internationals, making him England's sixth
highest goalscorer along with David Platt.
</P>
<P>
Real Madrid winger Steve McManaman, known for his ball trickery
but not his shooting prowess, scored the other two in the 29th and
43rd minutes. They were his first goals for his country in 25
appearances.
</P>
<P>
Michael Owen completed a fairy-tale comeback by scoring a
brilliant last-minute goal after coming on as substitute 25
minutes from the end.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Liverpool striker, only just back from a five-
month injury lay-off, curled a delightful right-foot shot round
the defence and inside the far post from outside the area.
</P>
<P>
Shearer, who has been widely criticsed for his lack of goals
recently for both Newcastle United and his country, said
afterwards: "You have to put the ball in the back of the net...I
did that today and have nobody to answer to.
</P>
<P>
"I am just delighted that we have three points and that sets us
up nicely for the trip to Poland.
</P>
<P>
"We know what we've got to do. We've been there and won before
but that is history. We have to go and do it again.
</P>
<P>
"There is no confidence crisis -- give me the ball and I will
put it in the net.
</P>
<P>
England manager Kevin Keegan added: "I was pleased ... it was
105 degrees out there and I thought they applied themselves very
well.
</P>
<P>
"I suppose in the second half you could be a little bit
disappointed -- I know the players will be, but they dug in and
got players behind the ball.
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted for Alan Shearer. He has got lots of confidence
in himself. He doesn't need people to have confidence in him but
it wouldn't hurt sometimes. That hat-trick will give him a
terrific boost.
</P>
<P>
"I'm also pleased for Michael Owen. He needed 30 minutes out
there and he got that... the goal was smashing too."
</P>
<P>
England needed to collect all three points from the match and
win in Poland to be sure of qualifying for the play-offs for next
summer's finals.
</P>
<P>
There was never any doubt they would complete the first half
successfully as they surged forward from the start.
</P>
<P>
Coach Kevin Keegan's inspired selection of 20-year-old
Newcastle United midfielder Kieron Dyer at right back paid off
handsomely.
</P>
<P>
Dyer was brought down for the penalty and a hand in both of
Shearer's other goals before going off injured at halftime.
</P>
<P>
England eased off in the second half though they squandered
several other chances and veteran left back Stuart Pearce,recalled
at the age of 37 after a two-year absence, had a goal disallowed.
</P>
<P>
McManaman should have completed his hat-trick but he failed to
connect with a perfect cross from substitute Gary Neville in the
63rd minute.
</P>
<P>
Shearer and McManaman were not the only positive indicators for
Keegan as he prepares for the Poland match.
</P>
<P>
Though he failed to score Robbie Fowler teamed up well with
Shearer up front, creating one goal for his captain and having a
goal disallowed when Shearer was adjudged offside.
</P>
<P>
The England defence was never seriously troubled and the
midfield was efficient even if David Beckham, the only Manchester
United player in the starting line-up seemed less effective in the
center than in his usual role wide on the right.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Suspends Troop Withdraw from S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 4 (Xinhua) - Nigeria has suspended a phased
withdrawal of its troops in Sierra Leone following warnings of a
possible new rebel attack on Freetown, the commander of the
Nigerian troops in Sierra Leone said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
General Gebriel Kpamber announced this on the Sierra Leone
radio and television after Sierra Leonean President Tejan Kabbah
made an urgent visit to Nigeria Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria Thursday began the phased withdrawal of its 12,000
troops, which constitutes the backbone of the 14,000-strong west
African peace-keeping force ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
"The movement of Nigerian ECOMOG troops to Nigeria, which
started this week, has stopped forthwith," said Kpamber, who had
travelled with Kabbah to the talks in Nigeria. "Let me say here
that the rumors spreading throughout the country... that rebels
are coming to attack Freetown once more are unfounded and
baseless," the Nigerian general said.
</P>
<P>
But even if the rebels tried to attack, "we are prepared to
protect you and your property," he told the Sierra Leoneans
through the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian troops will remain in Sierra Leone, he said,
adding that they, together with the United Nations military
mission, are to help disarm combatants.
</P>
<P>
The general's announcement clearly signified a change from the
Nigerian government's former stance of pulling out most of their
troops within half a year.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Information Minister Dapo Sarumi said last week that
Nigeria's 12,000-strong contingent in the ECOMOG would be
airlifted in phases at a rate of 2,000 troops a month.
</P>
<P>
A battalion will be left behind at the end of the withdrawal
for the modified role of disarming and ensuring security in Sierra
Leone which has suffered a nine-year-old civil war, according to
the minister.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's original troop withdrawal is mainly based on
financial considerations. Nigeria has also been repeatedly
calling on the United Nations to take over its peace-keeping role
in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The Nigeria-dominant ECOMOG force moved into Sierra Leone from
Liberia in the middle of 1997 to support the elected President
kabbah, who was ousted earlier by a coup of the country's military
junta.
</P>
<P>
Since late 1997, the ECOMOG had been fighting with Sierra
Leonean rebels, until June this year when a cease-fire agreement
was reached in Togolese capital Lome.

SHARM EL SHEIKH, EGYPT, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The
Palestinians and Israel signed a revised peace agreement here in
the small hours of Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in the presence of Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, Jordanian King Abdullah al Hussein,
U.S. Secretary of state Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony came after more than one month of
grueling talks between the Palestinians and Israel over the
implementation of the U.S.-brokered Wye agreement in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
The revised version of the land-for-peace deal will take effect
Sunday, after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak submits it to his
cabinet. Later in the week, Barak will forward the pact to
Israel's Knesset (parliament) in its special session.
</P>
<P>
According to the new agreement, Israel will implement the
remaining phases of troops withdrawal stipulated in the original
Wye deal, which was signed and then frozen by Barak's hard-line
predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu after carrying out the first of the
three-stage pullout from 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel will begin in a few days to hand over 11 percent of the
West Bank to the Palestinians and final withdrawal will be
completed by January 20, under the deal.

SHARM EL SHEIKH, EGYPT, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The
Palestinians and Israel signed a revised peace agreement here in
the small hours of Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in the presence of Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein,
U.S. Secretary of state Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony came after more than one month of grueling
talks between the Palestinians and Israel over the implementation
of the U.S.-brokered Wye agreement in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, Barak, Arafat, Abdullah and Albright spoke at the
ceremony, outlining the importance of the revised peace deal,
hoping to revive the peace process on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
The revised version of the land-for-peace deal, brokered by
Albright during her current shuttle diplomacy in the region, will
take effect Sunday, after Barak submits it to his cabinet. Later
in the week, Barak will forward the pact to Israel's Knesset
(parliament) in its special session.
</P>
<P>
According to the new agreement, Israel will implement the
remaining two phases of troops withdrawal stipulated in the
original Wye deal, which was signed and then frozen by Barak's
hard-line predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu after carrying out the
first pullout from 2 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised deal, Israel will begin in a few days to hand
over the remaining 11 percent of the West Bank land to the
Palestinians and the final troops withdrawal will be completed by
January 20.
</P>
<P>
The two sides played brinkmanship on the number of Palestinian
political prisoners to be released by Israel. The Palestinians
demanded freedom for 400 Palestinian political prisoners while
Israel refused to let go of those who had killed Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised Wye accord, Israel will set free a total of
350 Palestinian prisoners jailed in Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also set February 15, 2000 as the deadline for
drafting the framework for the so-called final status talks
between Israel and the Palestinians, which will deal with thorny
issues such as Jerusalem, Palestinian statehood and border,
refugees and distribution of water resources.
</P>
<P>
The final talks are expected to be concluded by next September,
according to the revised Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
The deal allows for a safe passage between the Gaza Strip and
the West Bank for the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In exchange, Israel gets security promises from the Palestinian
side, including the confiscation of illegal weapons among the
Palestinians, captures of Palestinian fugitives and the provision
of the list of Palestinian police to Israel.

</P>
<P>
Princess Sirindhorn arrived in Phuket earlier Saturday to greet
President Jiang and his entourage at the Phuket airport.
</P>
<P>
Also greeting Jiang at the airport was governor of the province,
Chadej Insawang.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, as representatives of Thai King Bhumibol
Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit, Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn and
the king's grand-daughters bid farewell to Jiang and his wife,
Wang Yeping.
</P>
<P>
Also seeing Jiang off at the airport was Thai Prime Minister

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo, Kabbah hold Talks on Security in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo and his Sierra Leonean counterpart Tejan Kabbah held
talks Friday in Abuja, stressing the need for strengthening the
present security situation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The one-day discussion was said to be one of the regular
consultation between the two leaders on the consolidation of
peace, security and stability in Sierra Leone and the sub- region
in general, reported the Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement shortly after the two leader's talks in the
presidential lounge of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in
Nigeria's capital, both leaders agreed that further confidence
building measures would be taken immediately to ensure the success
of the peace agreement, particularly the early commencement of the
disarmament, democratization and reintegration program.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah's sudden visit to Nigeria came as the first 1200
Nigerian soldiers, who have been defending his government against
rebel attacks, flew home Thursday following the signing of the
Lome Peace Agreement.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that he is seeking further assurance from
Obasanjo so that Nigeria's withdrawal of forces will be gradual
enough for him to establish his own security measures, but this is
difficult because the Sierra Leonean government has no army of
its own after most former soldiers fled or joined the rebels.

NEW YORK, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Asia Society, a non-profit
U.S. educational institution in New York announced Saturday that
it will run a large photo exhibition to depict the changes in the
50 years of modern China.
</P>
<P>
"No place on earth has changed so much over the last 50 years
as China," the society said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
It plans to show 160 photos done by 33 photographers from Asia,
Europe and the United States from October 8 through January 2,
2000.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Implement Agro-Led Economic Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has chosen
Agricultural Development Led Industrialization, an
agricultural-led economic strategy, as the base for the country's
overall development, a government press release said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The strategy aims to take full advantage of Ethiopia's massive
agricultural and industrial potential while ensuring that the
country will be less prey to adverse weather conditions, such as
low rainfall and the resultant drought, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
The major objective of the Agricultural Development Led
Industrialization is to increase the productivity of small farmers
and thereby improve food security in both rural and urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian industry and services depend on the performance of
agriculture, which provides raw materials, generates the necessary
foreign currency to purchase vital imports, and feeds work force
of the country.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural development strategy was declared on the
occasion that the Horn of Africa country is sparing no effort to
realize food self- sufficiency, the release said
</P>
<P>
Specific policies have been introduced to provide technical and
 institutional support to farmers, including fertilizer supply and
 distribution, improved seed supply and distribution, development
of small- scale irrigation, and conservation of natural resources
and environment, it added.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Send Military Observer to Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa could send a
military observer to the troubled Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) as early as Sunday to monitor the peace process, President
Thabo Mbeki's spokesman Parks Mankahlana said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana confirmed the deployment of observers to the central
African country would be the first step in enforcing the
cease-fire which was finally sealed in Zambian capital Lusaka
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Mbeki held separate meetings in Pretoria with
Rwandan Vice- President Paul Kagame and Emile Ilunga, the leader
of the Rwandan-backed faction of the major Congolese Rally for
Democracy (RCD) rebel group.
</P>
<P>
Ilunga and his Ugandan-backed RCD rival, Ernest Wamba dia
Wamba, were among the last rebel leaders to add their signatures
to the peace accord at the talks in the Zambian capital on August
31.
</P>
<P>
Six countries with troops involved in the DRC conflict signed
the cease- fire text on July 10 while a separate rebel group, the
Congo Liberation Movement, signed on August 1.
</P>
<P>
The agreements demanded an end to hostilities within 24 hours
of the signing, called on the United Nations to deploy a
peace-keeping force within four months and urged the government
and the rebels to hold talks on the country's future.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mbeki asked his Foreign Minister Nkosazana Zuma to
delay her departure for a special Organization of African Unity
(OAU) meeting in Libya so that she would continue work on the DRC
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Zuma's spokesman Khangelane Hlongwane said the minister was
scheduled to leave for Sirte, Libya, Saturday but would instead
leave later next week.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the OAU's Council of Ministers on Monday and
Tuesday will look at mechanisms to make the body more effective.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks between the foreign ministers, the heads of
state or government from the OAU members will gather Wednesday for
a two-day summit.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government Saturday commended the results of the independence
referendum in East Timor, saying that it was a significant step
towards resolving the ongoing conflict in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement by the United Nations, over 78
percent of the East Timorese voted in favor of independence from
Indonesia in Monday's direct ballot to choose the territory's
future.
</P>
<P>
"We salute the East Timorese who turned out in significant
numbers and exercising their democratic right to determine their
own future," the South African Department of Foreign Affairs said
a statement.
</P>
<P>
"They have done this with calm and dignity despite ongoing
violence and intimidation," it added.
</P>
<P>
However, the department said that it was concerned about the
escalation in violence since the referendum.
</P>
<P>
South Africa asked the East Timorese to respect and abide by
the outcome of the referendum and has endorsed the UN Security
Council's demand on the Indonesian local authorities in East Timor
to arrest those responsible for the violence.
</P>
<P>
The statement said South Africa backed the United Nations,
saying that it would continue to play a pivotal role in the
post-ballot period in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Violence again erupted in the region Saturday after the results
of Monday's referendum were released, forcing U.N. personnel,
international observers and foreign journalists to be evacuated
from the region's capital, Dili, to Bali and Australia.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, which had been a Portuguese colony, was integrated
into Indonesia in 1976. But Indonesia's claim to the territory
has not been recognized by the international community.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Launches Land Reform Policy Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe launched a Land Reform
Policy Research Network in east town of Nyanga Saturday, aiming to
strengthen research and training capacity on land reform.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the cabinet committee on resettlement and rural
development, Joseph Msika, stressed the need for action research
to support the land reform inception phase.
</P>
<P>
"The resettlement process is now in progress, albeit not as
satisfactorily as expected," the Zimbabwe News Agency quoted the
chairman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the two-year inception phase launched in January this
year, the Zimbabwean government aims to resettle 41,100 families
on 300,000 hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
The Land Reform Policy Research Network is an initiative of the
Southern African Regional Institute for Policy Studies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch, Director of the institute Sam Moyo said
the network had a historical mission to correct the intellectual
and policy biases against small holder farmers. Research had
shown that these farmers are a lot more efficient than they were
generally regarded, he added.
</P>
<P>
"It is through research that the government gets to know the
concern of people involved in land reform, both the benefactors
and the victims of land reform, including farm workers," Moyo
said.
</P>
<P>
Some 44 representatives of government, universities and
non-governmental organizations attended the launching ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Justifies Downing of Intruding U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said Saturday
that no permission was given for the U.S. registered plane downed
on August 29 by its anti-craft forces to overfly its northern
border with Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The Johannesburg-bound aircraft was shot down near the northern
town of Adwa, about 40 kilometers from the Eritrean border. A
British and a Swedish, who were piloting the plane, were killed in
the incident.
</P>
<P>
"While the Ethiopian government regrets the loss of life, it
cannot be held responsible for the downing of an aircraft under
such condition s and circumstances," the Ethiopian government said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Ethiopian authorities were not
aware of the identity of the fast moving intruder plane traveling
across the battle lines in the no-fly zone from the direction of
the capital of an enemy state.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, "It is true that permission was
requested and granted allowing the flight to enter Ethiopian
territory on the basis of its request that in fact specifically
stressed that the plane would avoid flying over Eritrean airspace
at all times."
</P>
<P>
"Permission was, therefore, granted for the flight to enter
Ethiopia via Djibouti and fly over southeast Ethiopia to Kenya, "
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"This aircraft, however, entered Ethiopian territory from
Eritrea directly south of Asmara (the capital of Eritrea) at high
speed with neither notification nor permission," it added.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Defense Force therefore took the measures
required of any vigilant defense force at a time of combat.
</P>
<P>
The statement also request the governments of the U.S., South
Africa, Sweden and Britain to share whatever information they have
in order to ascertain the nature of the mission of the intruder
aircraft and why it flew over areas clearly known to be forbidden
territory.

<HEADLINE> Peace With Israel Possible: Syrian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al Sharaa said Saturday that peace with Israel is possible
within months if there were sincere intentions from the parties
concerned.
</P>
<P>
Sharaa made the remarks in a news briefing following his talks
with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak would
trace the steps of his predecessor Yitzhak Rabin and Syria is
willing to resume the peace process from where it left in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He said Syrian stance on the Middle East peace process has not
changed and Syria believes in the just and comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
He hailed his talks with Albright as "good, meaningful,
positive and open," saying he discussed with her the Middle East
peace process specially on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks and the
means to improve the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
During the briefing, Albright said that the U.S. is willing to
support the Middle East peace process on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
"With enough flexibility and political will that goal (peace in
the Middle East) can be attained," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
"Peace, based on the Land for Peace principle, would be in
favor of all parties and would help resolve all differences
including the security demands, she said, adding that peace also
ensures the economic growth in the region.
</P>
<P>
Albright said a glimpse of hope came to the horizon following
the Israeli-Palestinian agreement on Wye pact Friday expressing
hope that it should help "illuminate the whole region."
</P>
<P>
On her talks with the Syrian officials , she said they were
targetted to find out potentials for resuming the peace process.
</P>
<P>
She also asked the parties concerned in South Lebanon to show
self-restraint saying they have to restore quietude and revive
the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on possible proposals for resuming the
peace talks on the Syrian-Israeli track, the U.S. Secretary of
State said she had some assessments which she discussed with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Those would be presented to
President Hafez al Assad, she added without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
She hoped her visit to Damascus could help move the peace
process towards the right direction urging all sides to continue
the march of peace.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived here from Gaza earlier in the day to discuss the
means of continuing peace process on the Syrian track with the
Damascus officials.
</P>
<P>
Albright has visited Egypt, Israel, Palestinian self-rule area
and left for Beirut, Lebanon later in the afternoon. She is
expected to fly to Egyptian Red Sea city of Sharm El-Sheikh to
attend a signing ceremony of a new peace deal between the
Palestinians and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Journalists Invited to Tripoli for Revolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TRIPOLI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Libyan government has
invited over 200 foreign journalists to cover the celebrations for
the 30th anniversary of the revolution that brought Libyan leader
Muammar Ghaddafi to power.
</P>
<P>
"So far 184 journalists have arrived," an official at the press
center told Xinhua Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Celebrations to mark the 30th anniversary of revolution are
underway around the country.
</P>
<P>
On September 1, 1969, a group of young officers led by Ghaddafi
overthrew the monarchy in a military coup and established the
Libyan Arab Republic, which was later renamed the Great Socialist
People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the week-long celebrations will be a grand
military parade in central Tripoli on Monday in the presence of
African leaders who will be attending an extraordinary summit
meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
The summit, to be held in Libya's port city of Sirte on
September 8-9, will be preceded by a preparatory session of the
OAU Council of Ministers in a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
To ensure success of both the anniversary and the summit, the
Libyan government has chartered aircraft to ferry the journalists
from parts of Africa to Tripoli, said the official.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day summit, themed "Strengthening OAU Capacity
to Enable It Meet the Challenges of the New Millennium," the
African leaders are to review the 36-year-old OAU Charter.
</P>
<P>
They are also expected to issue a declaration to set "clear
directions" regarding the future political, economic and social
activities of the OAU.
</P>
<P>
The OAU Charter has never been revised since it was signed in
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia by 31 heads of states and governments on May
25, 1963.
</P>
<P>
Staging the anniversary extravaganza and hosting the
pan-African summit were considered as part of the Libyan
government's efforts to reach out to the international community
after the United Nations suspended its sanctions on Libya, which
has been in place since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council suspended its sanctions in April
after Libya handed over two Libyans suspected of blowing up the
Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988 which killed 270
people.
</P>
<P>
A formal lifting of the sanctions has yet to be approved by the
Security Council and the country was still under more severe
sanctions from the United States.

<HEADLINE> Albright Discusses Peace Tracks with Lebanese PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Saturday afternoon held talks with Lebanese
Prime Minister Salim Hoss on the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Hoss, who is also the foreign minister,
held a joint news conference with Albright.
</P>
<P>
He said he had told Albright Lebanon's stance over its
commitment for the peace process in the region, especially the
implementation of the United Nations Resolution 425 and the
Israeli pullout from Golan Heights it captured from Syria in
the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted by the U.N. after Israeli first
invasion to the country, calls for an unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel is currently occupying parts of south Lebanon with
the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has been also demanding Israel withdraw from Golan
Heights and insisting talks on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks
be conducted simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Syria, with a 350,000 troops stationed in Lebanon, is
believed an undisputed power broker in the country.
</P>
<P>
Hoss also said his government and people will continue
supporting the resistance movement as long as Israel occupies
Lebanon's lands.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is leading a
guerrilla in the country trying to oust Israeli troops out
of the country.
</P>
<P>
For her part, Albright said she was happy to be in Lebanon as
the first American diplomat to use the Beirut airport over past 16
years.
</P>
<P>
During Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war, Americans had become
the main targets of the country's warring military groups and
since then its citizens were banned from travelling to Lebanon
and airliners barred from landing at its airport.
</P>
<P>
Albright said her regional tour aimed to reviving the peace
talks, which she thought will not be complete without the
participation of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who came here two hours ago, has left for Jerusalem
to brief Israeli leaders over Syrian and Lebanese stance over the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
She is expected to fly to Egyptian Red Sea city of Sharm
El-Sheikh to attend a signing ceremony of a new peace deal between
the Palestinians and Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has said that the United Nations should play a bigger
role in bringing about and maintaining peace in the Great Lakes
region.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when holding talks with a U.N. fact-finding
 commission of the actions of the world body during the 1994
genocide in Rwanda here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Museveni expressed happiness that the U.N. had at long last
taken the appropriate measures appointing such a high powered
commission to look into the problem of genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the world body can still come in to assist in
the crisis of the Democratic Republic of the Congo which is partly
a result of events in Rwanda by facilitating the peace observers
and enforcers as prescribed by the Lusaka agreement.
</P>
<P>
The five-man commission, headed by Ingvar Carlson who is a
former Swedish prime minister, was constituted by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan due to persistent accusation leveled
at the U.N. that the organization failed to act and at times acted
wrongly before and during the genocide.
</P>
<P>
The commission had met with Rwandan government representatives,
visited genocide sites and spoken to genocide survivors before
coming to Uganda. It will go on to Tanzania after their Uganda
visit.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, extreme Hutus in Rwanda killed more than 500,000
Tutsi and moderate Hutu people, the biggest ethnic killing in

<P>
MAPUTO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's National Electoral
 Commission has fixed and published the timetable for all the
major steps leading up to the presidential and parliamentary
elections that will be held on December 3 and 4.
</P>
<P>
The first step is the registration of political parties and
coalitions who wish to contest the elections. They have until
September 30 to inform the national electoral commission.
</P>
<P>
Between September 21 and 30, the electoral registers resulting
from the current voter registration exercise, which is to end on
September 17, will be published so that any irregularities or
omissions may be detected.

</P>
<P>
As for the results of the elections, these will be made known
officially by December 19.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrive in Egypt for Signing of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright have arrived here Saturday to attend the signing ceremony
of a peace treaty between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah II of Jordan, which was the second Arab country,
after Egypt, to sign a peace treaty with Israel, has also arrived
at the Red Sea port to witness the signing of the revised Wye
interim accord.
</P>
<P>
The anticipated signing ceremony came after more than one month
of grueling talks between the Palestinians and Israel over the
implementation of the United States-brokered Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
The revised version of the land-for-peace deal will take effect
Sunday, after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak submits it to his
cabinet. Later in the week, Barak will forward the pact to
Israel's Knesset (parliament) in its special session.
</P>
<P>
According to the new agreement, Israel will implement the
remaining phases of troops withdrawal stipulated in the original
Wye deal, which was signed and then frozen by Barak's hard-line
predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu late 1998 after carrying out the
first of the three-stage pullout from 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel will begin in a few days to hand over 11 percent of the
West Bank to the Palestinians and final withdrawal will be
completed by January 20, under the deal.
</P>
<P>
The two sides played brinkmanship on the number of Palestinian
prisoners to be released by Israel. The Palestinians demanded
freedom for 400 Palestinian political prisoners while Israel
refused to let go of those who had killed Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised Wye accord, Israel will set free a total of
350 Palestinian prisoners jailed in Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also set February 15, 2000 as the deadline for
drafting the framework for the so-called final status talks
between Israel and the Palestinians, which will deal with thorny
issues such as Jerusalem, Palestinian statehood and border,
refugees and distribution of water resources.
</P>
<P>
The final talks are expected to be concluded by next September,
according to the revised Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
The deal allows for a safe passage between the Gaza Strip and
the West Bank for the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In exchange, Israel gets security promises from the Palestinian
side, including the confiscation of illegal weapons among the
Palestinians, captures of Palestinian fugitives and the provision
of the list of Palestinian police to Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a last-minute session here, Israeli envoy Gilead Sher and
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat would decide on the exact date
for Israel to begin withdrawing troops from 7 percent of the West
Bank and release the first of 350 Palestinian security prisoners.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Development Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso confirmed Saturday the resignation of
Development, Industry and Commerce Minister Clovio Carvalho.
</P>
<P>
The president did not reveal the name of Carvalho's successor,
whom he praised as "an honest and hard-working man."
</P>
<P>
The former minister criticized the present national economic
policy of austerity in the presence of Finance Minister Pedro
Malan during a seminar organized by the Brazilian Social Democracy
Party and held here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Carvalho called "mediocre" the economic growth level and
"cowardice" the excess of cautiousness with which the government
has been dealing with the development issue.
</P>
<P>
His decision to resign was taken after the constant pressuring
from the government allied parties and the cronies of Malan.
</P>
<P>
Carvalho has been one of the most loyal assistants of Cardoso
since the now president assumed the finance portfolio in 1993, and
before the last cabinet reshuffle he was the chief of the
Presidency Civil House.

<HEADLINE> UK House Prices Could Rise By One-Third: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- House prices in Britain could
increase by one third by the end of next year unless interest
rates are put up swiftly, a leading bank in the City predicted.
</P>
<P>
An independent report by Deutsche Bank said this could push the
cost of an average home up from 75,000 pounds (120,000 U.S.
dollars) to more than 100,000 pounds (160,000 dollars) by the end
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England needs to act quickly to slow the current
aggressive housing market, which is already 10 percent higher than
it was a year ago, it added.
</P>
<P>
Prices in the South, which traditionally have the fastest
recovery, could rise by 35 percent in the next 16 months while in
the North East they could rise by a fifth, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Ciaran Barr, economist at Deutsche Bank, said, "Real incomes
are rising, the cost of buying is not too much and beyond that
real house prices are not overvalued at all."
</P>
<P>
It is believed these conditions could potentially trigger rapid
growth in the housing market in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
According to Barr, the housing boom could mean the economy
overshoots the Bank of England's inflation target of 2.5 percent
by as much as 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted
unanimously to keep interest rates on hold at 5 percent last
month.
</P>
<P>
It is also believed here that the report's findings will
increase the pressure on the MPC, which meets next Tuesday and
Wednesday.

BRASILIA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso and his visiting Venezuelan counterpart, Hugo
Chavez, ended Saturday a four-hour meeting behind closed doors in
the city of Manaus in Amazonia state without making a joint

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Suspends Troop Withdraw from S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 4 (Xinhua) - Nigeria has suspended a phased
withdrawal of its troops in Sierra Leone following warnings of a
possible new rebel attack on Freetown, the commander of the
Nigerian troops in Sierra Leone said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
General Gebriel Kpamber announced this on the Sierra Leone
radio and television after Sierra Leonean President Tejan Kabbah
made an urgent visit to Nigeria Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria Thursday began the phased withdrawal of its 12,000
troops, which constitutes the backbone of the 14,000-strong west
African peace-keeping force ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
"The movement of Nigerian ECOMOG troops to Nigeria, which
started this week, has stopped forthwith," said Kpamber, who had
travelled with Kabbah to the talks in Nigeria. "Let me say here
that the rumors spreading throughout the country... that rebels
are coming to attack Freetown once more are unfounded and
baseless," the Nigerian general said.
</P>
<P>
But even if the rebels tried to attack, "we are prepared to
protect you and your property," he told the Sierra Leoneans
through the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian troops will remain in Sierra Leone, he said,
adding that they, together with the United Nations military
mission, are to help disarm combatants.
</P>
<P>
The general's announcement clearly signified a change from the
Nigerian government's former stance of pulling out most of their
troops within half a year.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Information Minister Dapo Sarumi said last week that
Nigeria's 12,000-strong contingent in the ECOMOG would be
airlifted in phases at a rate of 2,000 troops a month.
</P>
<P>
A battalion will be left behind at the end of the withdrawal
for the modified role of disarming and ensuring security in Sierra
Leone which has suffered a nine-year-old civil war, according to
the minister.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's original troop withdrawal is mainly based on
financial considerations. Nigeria has also been repeatedly
calling on the United Nations to take over its peace-keeping role
in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The Nigeria-dominant ECOMOG force moved into Sierra Leone from
Liberia in the middle of 1997 to support the elected President
kabbah, who was ousted earlier by a coup of the country's military
junta.
</P>
<P>
Since late 1997, the ECOMOG had been fighting with Sierra
Leonean rebels, until June this year when a cease-fire agreement
was reached in Togolese capital Lome.

ATHENS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis Saturday stressed in the northern Greek city of
Thessaloniki that only one superpower could not safeguard world
peace.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 64th Thessaloniki international trade fair,
Simitis said that a single superpower was not a factor for global
stability and that was why a politically powerful European Union
(EU) was needed more than ever as a factor in global equilibrium,
the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He added that joining the euro zone would make Greece part of
the EU bloc that was set to become a key player in the global
arena as a counterweight to a single superpower, currently the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Greece, which is now the only country of the 15 EU members
which fails to join the euro zone, is to apply for euro zone
membership by mid-March 2000 with approval expected at the EU's
summit in June of the same year.

Norway and Slovenia in Group Two, Germay and Turkey in Group
Three, Sweden in Group Five, Romania and Portugal in Group Seven
are on the merge to book the tickets for the final, which will be
co-hosted by Belgium and the Netherlands next summer.
</P>
<P>
Only when the penultimate round of qualifying matches is played
on Wednesday can any of these teams make certain of their place in
the finals alongside the co-hosts and the sole qualifiers to date,
the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Wales, Russia, Iceland and Estonia are back in contention after
victories on Saturday, and the closest fight of all is in Group
Four where Ukraine (16 points), Russia (15), Iceland (15)and world
champions France (15) are separated by one point.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine and France drew 0-0 in Kiev on Saturday, Russia beat
Armenia 2-0 in Moscow and Iceland beat Andorra 3-0 in Reykjavik.
</P>
<P>
Although France have slipped to fourth on goal difference, they
still have as good a chance as any of the three teams above them
of qualifying with their two matches remaining against Armenia
away and Iceland at home.
</P>
<P>
Russia, who started the qualifying campaign with three straight
defeats, chalked up their fifth successive win with their victory
over Armenia. If they beat Andorra as expected on Wednesday and
then beat Ukraine at home in their final match, they could yet
qualify as winners.
</P>
<P>
The nine group winners qualify automatically along with the
runner-up with the best record. The eight remaining second-placed
teams play off against each other for the remaining four places.
</P>
<P>
Denmark, champions in 1992, scored their third successive
victory with a 2-1 win over Switzerland in Copenhagen, a vital win
after Wales came from behind to win 2-1 in Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Italy (14 points) will clinch the group if they beat Denmark(11)
in Naples on Wednesday, but Wales (9) and Switzerland (8)are still
in with a chance of a finals place.
</P>
<P>
Norway (19 points), who beat Greece 1-0 in Oslo thanks to a
goal from Oyvind Leonhardsen, and Slovenia (17), who beat Georgia
2-1 with Milenko Acimovic and Zlatko Zahovic scoring,have pulled
clear of Latvia (12) points.
</P>
<P>
Norway will qualify for the finals if they beat Slovenia at
home on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reigning champions Germany (15) and Turkey (15) will fill the
top positions in Group Three after two goals from Oliver Bierhoff
gave Germany a 2-1 win over Finland in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
Turkey crushed Northern Ireland 3-0 in Belfast with Arif Erdem
scoring three goals in four minutes either side of halftime - one
of the fastest international hat-tricks recorded.
</P>
<P>
In Group Five Sweden (16 points) scored an important 1-0 win
over Bulgaria in Stockholm. They scored midway through the second
half via substitute Niklas Alexandersson, who had only come on two
minutes earlier.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria, already eliminated, were reduced to 10 men when Milen
Petkov was sent off and the result left Sweden poised to qualify
next Wednesday when they should beat Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
England (12 points) crushed Luxembourg 6-0 at Wembley with
skipper Alan Shearer scoring his first hat-trick for his country.
England moved ahead of Poland (12) on goal difference and whoever
wins Wednesday's match in Warsaw between the two will finish
second behind a victorious Sweden.
</P>
<P>
In Group Six Spain (15) advanced towards the finals with a 3-1
win over Austria in Vienna. While Spain are almost certain of
qualifying as winners, Cyprus and Israel will keep up their
challenge for the runners-up spot when they meet in Limassol on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Austria are not out of it mathematically but appeared
demoralised - although they redeemed some pride after losing 9-0
to Spain in March.
</P>
<P>
In Group Seven Romania (20), who beat Slovakia 5-1 in
Bratislava, and Portugal (19) - despite being held to a shock 1-1
draw by a 10-man Azerbaijan - cannot realistically be caught.
Their meeting in Bucharest on Wednesday is likely to determine who
win the group.
</P>
<P>
The only match played in Group Eight saw Croatia (14) beat
Ireland (12) 1-0 with a last minute goal from new Arsenal signing
Davor Suker, top scorer in the 1998 World Cup, to move Croatia to
the top of the standings.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia could move above the Irish if they beat Macedonia on
Sunday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Spanish Hotel Chain to Remain in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Spanish Sol-Melia hotel
chain will maintain its investments in Cuba despite the threat of
a possible sanction from the United States, said Cuban
Vice President Carlos Lage Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The official said it is absurd that the United States will
pretend to apply Chapter 4 of the so-called Helms-Burton law that
would affect the executives of the hotel chain.
</P>
<P>
The United States would violate an agreement adopted two years
ago with the European Union with the threat of an eventual
application of the Helms-Burton law, said Lage.
</P>
<P>
The Sol-Melia executives consider that there is no sanction
yet, but a warning of a possible sanction, explained Lage.
</P>
<P>
The Sol-Melia is one of the main hotel companies in Cuba, where
tourism is the main source of hard currency for the country.
</P>
<P>
Chapter 4 of the Helms-Burton law foresees that the United
States will deny a visa to the executives of firms that do
business in Cuba in properties confiscated to U.S. citizens in
Havana.
</P>
<P>
Lage called the Helms-Burton law "arbitrary, illegal,
irrational and absurd."
</P>
<P>
Most countries have criticized the Helms-Burton
extraterritoriality, with which the United States pretends since
1996 to harden the blockade against the island.

<HEADLINE> Edwards Reveals Spikey Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scot finished third in Spain last week when he was pinned
hot favorite to take the title he won in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But Edwards, who returned to winning ways at the Scotstoun
Stadium in Glasgow, revealed it all went wrong in the final in the
run-up.
</P>
<P>
"My local video shop was closed this week so I had to watch a
horror video from Seville," said Edwards, who set a Scottish all-
comers record of 17.07 meters at the CGU Challenge between Britain
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I discovered that the measurement of my run-up was wrong
because my new spikes were an inch longer than my old ones.
</P>
<P>
"That changed my center of gravity and caused me to over-rotate.
I am very annoyed with myself because I had trained all year for
the worlds. I feel a bit stupid really."

<HEADLINE> UNAMET Policeman Shot in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A civilian policeman of the
United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) was shot and 27
houses were burned by mobs following the announcement of the
results of the August 30 autonomy ballot on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
East Timor police spokesman Captain Widodo said Chandlen, a
UNAMET civilian policeman from the United States, was shot in
Liquisa district at about 9:00 a.m. He was hit in his left side so
that he had to be evacuated to Dili, capital of East Timor,
reports reaching here Sunday from Dili, said.
</P>
<P>
Widodo said pro-integrationists burned three houses in the
district of Aileu, about 47 kilometers south of Dili at 11:00 a.m.
local time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, crowds burned ten houses at around the same time in
Bobonaro, about 138 kilometers west of Dili, and 14 other houses
and kiosks in Becora, East Dili and at Mercado Lama market in
Dili, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that until 6:00 p.m. about 3,500 people had
been evacuated to East Nusa Tenggara province of Indonesia by land
because they were afraid of possible violence.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement by the U.N., over 78 percent of
East Timorese voted in favor of independence from Indonesia in
Monday's direct ballot to choose the territory's future.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move has never been recognized by the
U.N.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the Indonesian government proposed to
give wide-ranging autonomy to East Timor. In May, the U.N.,
Indonesia and Portugal signed an agreement on the holding of a
direct ballot in East Timor to decide the territory's future.

<HEADLINE> Irvine: I Couldn't Be Shumacher's Number Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irvine's four-year association with Ferrari will draw to a
close at the end of the current season as he makes way for Rubens
Barrichello.
</P>
<P>
Barrichello was confirmed Saturday morning as the new number
two at Maranello, the Brazilian signing a two-year contract which
sees him become partner to Schumacher.
</P>
<P>
Irvine will now almost certainly take up the vacancy left by
Barrichello at Stewart-Ford, who are set to become Jaguar from
next season after the American motor giant's buy-out of the
legendary British car manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old will be handed the number one role he has
craved for so long, with Johnny Herbert retaining his seat in a
line-up which will be confirmed shortly after next weekend's
Italian Grand Prix at Monza.
</P>
<P>
Irvine has been frustrated at continually having to concede
second best to Schumacher on many occasions, the two-time former
world champion always given priority in all aspects of Ferrari's
operation.
</P>
<P>
Only now, with Schumacher still recovering from a broken right
leg sustained in the British Grand Prix in early July, has Irvine
known what it is like to be number one at the famous Prancing
Horse marque.
</P>
<P>
But Irvine fully realises the status quo would have returned
for next season, with the German resuming his influential status
and the Ulsterman relegated to back seat driver again.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been impossible to stay with Ferrari as number
two to Michael Schumacher," confirmed Irvine, who still has the
world title in his sights.
</P>
<P>
He lies one point behind current leader and reigning world
champion Mika Hakkinen in the standings going into the last four
races at Monza, the European at the Nurburgring, Malaysia and
Japan.

<P>
NEW DELHI, September 5 (Xinhua) --
</P>
<P>
The Indian National Congress:
</P>
<P>
The Congress, founded in 1885 to oppose British rule, has ruled
India for around 45 of the 50 years since independence in 1947.
</P>
<P>
Jawahar Lal Nehru ruled India as its first prime minister at
the head of a Congress government from 1947 to 1964.
</P>
<P>
Indira Gandhi, Nehru's daughter, headed the country's Congress
government twice from 1966 to 1977 and from 1980 to 1984 when she
was killed by her body guard.
</P>
<P>
Rajiv Gandhi replaced his mother as Congress leader and prime
minister in 1984 and he was assassinated in 1989 by a suicide
bomb.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1996, a minority Congress government took office
and won over enough members of parliament to attain a majority
after two years.
</P>
<P>
The party got only 141 seats in the 545-member low house of
parliament in the 1998 elections. In order to prevent the Indian
People's Party (BJP) from coming to power, the Congress, which
could not come to power itself, decided to offer its support from
outside to the UF which then formed a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
On March 16, 1998, Sonia Gandhi, who was appointed new
president of the Congress Party on March 14, was unanimously
elected as chairperson of the Congress Parliamentary Party.
</P>
<P>
The Congress in its 1999 election manifesto pledged to provide
a "stable, able and experienced government" if it were elected in
the coming Lok Sabha elections.
</P>
<P>
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP, Indian People's Party):
</P>
<P>
The Bharatiya Janata Party, founded in 1980 as a breakaway
group of the People's party, is the largest parliamentary party in
India. The BJP got its first taste of power at the national level
after the inconclusive 1996 elections during which the party won
193 seats with its alliance. Its government, however, fell within
a fortnight after failing to establish a majority in the hung
parliament.
</P>
<P>
During the 1998 elections, the BJP obtained 182 seats in the
Lower House of parliament and on March 19, 1998, Atal Bihari
Vajpayee, leader of BJP, was sworn-in as Indian prime Minister at
the head of a two-tied 43 member coalition which included a number
of new faces.
</P>
<P>
On April 17, 1999, the 13-month Vajpayee coalition government
was defeated by one vote in the vote of confidence in the Lower
House of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
In its manifesto of 1999 election, the BJP-led National
Democratic Alliance pledged to continue the reform process to
ensure that the national economy grow on the principle that "India
shall be built by Indians."

<P>
NEW DELHI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- India is one of the
countries with an ancient civilization in the world. It became a
unified country in 4th century BC.
</P>
<P>
European colonists began to invade India in the 16th century.
The Pulasi War between India and Britain broke out in 1757. India
was defeated and became a British colony. Britain occupied all the
territory of India in 1849.
</P>
<P>
An uprising against the British by the Indian people took place
in 1857.
</P>
<P>
In June 1947, Britain promulgated "Mountbatten Plan", which
divided India into India and Pakistan. After a prolonged struggle
against British colonial rule, India became independent within the
commonwealth on August 15, 1947. In November 1949, the Constituent
Assembly approved a republican Constitution, providing for a
president as head of state.
</P>
<P>
India became republic on January 26, 1950, although remaining a
member of the commonwealth.

The Hammers were awarded an 8,500 pounds fine for "improper
conduct of the supporters" during the second leg of the final in
Metz.
</P>
<P>
Trouble flared when Metz scored midway through the second half
to level the score 2-2 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
The violence involved coin throwing and it is understood
Hammers supporters shook fencing before ultimately celebrating a 3-
2 aggregate win.
</P>
<P>
The Upton Park club have also received another 3,500 pounds
fine for "failing to observe competition regulations" laid down by
European football's governing body.
</P>
<P>
It relates to a technical offence regarding the initial

<HEADLINE> England Whitewash Luxembourg in Euro Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- England whitewashed Luxembourg
6-0 Saturday, making a perfect tune-up for its final group match
against Poland in Euro 2000 qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
Alan Shearer found back his form in the match with a hatrick
goals.
</P>
<P>
England swept a toothless Luxembourg team aside with five goals
in the first 43 minutes of a totally one-sided match -- and they
also had two other goals disallowed for offside.
</P>
<P>
Shearer got the first from the penalty spot in the 12th minute
and added two more in the 27th and 33rd to take his tally for his
country to 27 in 52 internationals, making him England's sixth
highest goalscorer along with David Platt.
</P>
<P>
Real Madrid winger Steve McManaman, known for his ball trickery
but not his shooting prowess, scored the other two in the 29th and
43rd minutes. They were his first goals for his country in 25
appearances.
</P>
<P>
Michael Owen completed a fairy-tale comeback by scoring a
brilliant last-minute goal after coming on as substitute 25
minutes from the end.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Liverpool striker, only just back from a five-
month injury lay-off, curled a delightful right-foot shot round
the defence and inside the far post from outside the area.
</P>
<P>
Shearer, who has been widely criticsed for his lack of goals
recently for both Newcastle United and his country, said
afterwards: "You have to put the ball in the back of the net...I
did that today and have nobody to answer to.
</P>
<P>
"I am just delighted that we have three points and that sets us
up nicely for the trip to Poland.
</P>
<P>
"We know what we've got to do. We've been there and won before
but that is history. We have to go and do it again.
</P>
<P>
"There is no confidence crisis -- give me the ball and I will
put it in the net.
</P>
<P>
England manager Kevin Keegan added: "I was pleased ... it was
105 degrees out there and I thought they applied themselves very
well.
</P>
<P>
"I suppose in the second half you could be a little bit
disappointed -- I know the players will be, but they dug in and
got players behind the ball.
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted for Alan Shearer. He has got lots of confidence
in himself. He doesn't need people to have confidence in him but
it wouldn't hurt sometimes. That hat-trick will give him a
terrific boost.
</P>
<P>
"I'm also pleased for Michael Owen. He needed 30 minutes out
there and he got that... the goal was smashing too."
</P>
<P>
England needed to collect all three points from the match and
win in Poland to be sure of qualifying for the play-offs for next
summer's finals.
</P>
<P>
There was never any doubt they would complete the first half
successfully as they surged forward from the start.
</P>
<P>
Coach Kevin Keegan's inspired selection of 20-year-old
Newcastle United midfielder Kieron Dyer at right back paid off
handsomely.
</P>
<P>
Dyer was brought down for the penalty and a hand in both of
Shearer's other goals before going off injured at halftime.
</P>
<P>
England eased off in the second half though they squandered
several other chances and veteran left back Stuart Pearce,recalled
at the age of 37 after a two-year absence, had a goal disallowed.
</P>
<P>
McManaman should have completed his hat-trick but he failed to
connect with a perfect cross from substitute Gary Neville in the
63rd minute.
</P>
<P>
Shearer and McManaman were not the only positive indicators for
Keegan as he prepares for the Poland match.
</P>
<P>
Though he failed to score Robbie Fowler teamed up well with
Shearer up front, creating one goal for his captain and having a
goal disallowed when Shearer was adjudged offside.
</P>
<P>
The England defence was never seriously troubled and the
midfield was efficient even if David Beckham, the only Manchester
United player in the starting line-up seemed less effective in the
center than in his usual role wide on the right.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economic Powerhouse to Increase International Presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province,
with the third largest gross domestic product in the country, will
make efforts to increase its presence in the global economy in the
coming century.
</P>
<P>
"The province will take measures to tap markets all over the
world while introducing more overseas funds and talented people,"
said Shandong Provincial Governor Li Chunting.
</P>
<P>
As part of these efforts, the province will encourage more
local enterprises, including State-owned enterprise groups and
large private businesses, to open subsidiaries abroad.
</P>
<P>
Li said that his province, with a population of 88 million,
boasts rich natural resources and has made marked progress in
economic development over the past few decades.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, Shandong is now the country's largest producer
of grain, edible oil, vegetables, fruit, cement, crude salt,
washing machines, and several other agricultural and industrial
products.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, when China introduced its reform and opening
policies, Li said, the province has opened up to the outside world
step by step.
</P>
<P>
The cities of Qingdao and Yantai, both tourist attractions, are
among the first 14 Chinese coastal cities open to overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
To date, the province as a whole has established economic and
trade ties with 180 foreign countries and regions including the
Republic of Korea, Germany, the United States, Britain, Canada,
Australia, Japan, and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of overseas investors, including 26 of the
world's top 100 multinationals, have injected some 21 billion U.S.
dollars into Shandong, accounting for about one-tenth of the
province's total investment.
</P>
<P>
Local foreign trade has grown by 15.9 percent annually in the
past two decades, with exports rising 13.4 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that Shandong handled 16.6 billion U.S.
dollars of imports and exports last year, making up 22.5 percent
of the province's GDP.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Buyi People Take to Modern Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 5 (Xinhua) -- "My forefathers used to live
in shabby, broken huts together with livestock and never adopted
any advanced farming skills," said Xu Mingqing, a villager of the
Buyi people of Libo County in southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
But after 1949, when the People's Republic was founded and
people of different ethnic groups were granted equal rights, the
Buyi began to change their primitive way of life.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jiali, a local official in charge of minority people's
affairs, told Xinhua that for hundreds of years, the Buyi had been
in a state of hostility with the Han, China's major group, and
other minority people, due to suppression by the dynastic feudal
rulers.
</P>
<P>
Buyi people used to avoid contact with the outside and shun all
modern concepts and ways of life, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, over the past five decades, the Buyi, now with a
population of 2.1 million, have experienced great changes and
achieved much progress, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Xu Mingqing is one of the first Buyi villagers to do business
and has adopted modern farming techniques with the use of
chemicals, fertilizers, machinery and, in recent years, greenhouse
technology.
</P>
<P>
Like Xu, most local villagers in Boli County, where 60 percent
of the population are ethnic Buyi, have now said farewell to
poverty and are much better off.
</P>
<P>
Meng Qiliang, administrator of the Qiannan Buyi and Miao
Autonomous Prefecture, attributed these changes to the central
government policy on minority people and measures to help
underdeveloped areas catch up with the rest of the nation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt to Free E. Timor's Separatist Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
free East Timorese separatist leader Xanana Gusmao on Wednesday
(September 8) by handing him over to the UN Mission in East Timor
(UNAMET), a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Xanana's release would be effective as soon as possible
following the government's decision to grant him amnesty, Antara
News Agency quoted State Secretary/Justice Minister Muladi as
saying Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Xanana was serving a 20-year prison term but the amnesty would
effectively erase some 10 years from his term.
</P>
<P>
"His release will be carried in a short time. But he will first
be flown to Dili, capital of East Timor, where he will be handed
over to UNAMET," Muladi said.
</P>
<P>
Following Saturday's announcement of the results of the August
30 direct ballot, Xanana called on the East Timorese people to
reconcile in the new spirit of brotherhood to maintain peace and
order in the territory.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement by the U.N., over 78 percent of
East Timorese voted in favor of independence from Indonesia in
Monday's direct ballot to choose the territory's future.
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, Muladi disclosed that Indonesia will
continue to maintain security in East Timor in the second phase,
starting from the announcement of the direct ballot's results up
to the endorsement of the ballot's outcome by the general meeting
of the People's Consultative Assembly in November.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Indonesia accepts the ballot's outcome
sincerely and in a sportmanlike spirit," he said.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move has never been recognized by the
U.N.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the Indonesian government proposed to
give wide-ranging autonomy to East Timor. In May, the U.N.,
Indonesia and Portugal signed an agreement on the holding of a
direct ballot in East Timor to decide the territory's future.

<HEADLINE> Building Two Industrial Corridors In Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
Province has decided to build two industrial corridors along the
Dadu and Minjiang rivers to replace the forest industry as a new
economic growth area.
</P>
<P>
This comes in response to a State ban on logging last year to
protect the environment and stop soil erosion. Forestry used to be
a major industry along the two rivers, which run through the
cities of Ya'an and Leshan and the Tibet autonomous prefectures of
Aba and Garze.
</P>
<P>
The development program calls for the region to be built into
the largest energy consuming industrial base in that part of China
over the next five to ten years. Its abundant water resources and
30 types of mineral resources make it suitable for developing
energy. On the two rivers, power stations may be built with a
combined generating capacity of several tens of millions of kw.
</P>
<P>
There are 60 small hydro-electric power stations with an
aggregate generating capacity of 80,000 kw in Shimian County on a
key section of the Minjiang River and 20 more with a generating
capacity of 50,000 kw are being built.
</P>
<P>
The county has 14 energy consuming enterprises and it produces
40,000 tons of silicon, carbon ferromanganese, and eletrolysis
zinc and about 45 percent of the county's revenue. Its output of
silicon ranks third in the country and it has become the largest
foreign exchange earner from silicon exports in this part of China.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 industrial enterprises have been established by
investors from Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang province in east
China and Chongqing municipality along the Dadu.

<HEADLINE> Structural Reforms Create "Miracle Economy" in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Since the onset of the Asian
financial crisis in 1997, the Australian economy, recently
described by U.S. economist Paul Krugman as a "miracle economy",
has continued to record a strong growth.
</P>
<P>
This performance, more or less marvelous, has benefited from
the robust policy framework, a fruit of progressive structural
reforms in the 1980s and 1990s, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The country's gross domestic product (GDP) grew around 5
percent in 1998, despite many of its major Asian trading partners
experiencing recession and a consequent slowdown in world economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Australian economy has outperformed not only that of its East
Asian neighbors, but most other rich countries as well, the
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the country's GDP growth was faster
than that of the United States and more than doubled the aggregate
one of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development
(OECD).
</P>
<P>
Besides, over a longer period, its GDP has been the fastest
growing one of all the developed economies bar Ireland and Norway.
</P>
<P>
During the 1990s, Australian economic growth has averaged 3.2
percent a year, compared with 2.5 percent for the United States, 2.
1 percent for New Zealand, 1.9 percent for Britain and Canada, and
1.8 percent for Japan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inflation and interest rates have been kept low
successfully. During the past nine years, its inflation rate has
averaged just 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
A very ready explanation for the "miracle economy" is that the
country is reaping reward economic reforms embodied in "four
pillars", the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The first pillar is financial deregulation, which has led to
the floating of Australian dollar, the admission of foreign banks
into Australia and a number of other results.
</P>
<P>
This serves as a firmer framework for Australian economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The second pillar is the introduction of a more stringent
National Competition Policy.
</P>
<P>
The National Competition Policy is an important element of the
economic structural reform in recent years. It was passed
unanimously by the country's state and territory governments in
April 1995.
</P>
<P>
The policy includes a nationally applied competition law which
ensures government businesses and privatized public monopolies do
not enjoy an unfair advantage over their competitors.
</P>
<P>
A key objective of the policy is to increase competition in
sectors where competition has been limited by regulatory barriers,
particularly in communications, energy and transportation sectors.
</P>
<P>
A fully open market for telecommunications was introduced in
1997. And recently, the National Electricity Market started to
allow free trade of electricity between the eastern states.
</P>
<P>
An obvious result of the reform is an overall rising of the
country's productivity, at an average annual rate of 2.4 percent
over the past four years, compared to a historic record of only 1.
4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The third pillar is the vigorous reforms of the labor market in
the past three and a quarter years.
</P>
<P>
The Workplace Relations Act 1996 has accelerated the move from
centralized wage fixing to enterprise bargaining, and ensured
wages and workplace practices are consistent with the
circumstances of individual firms.
</P>
<P>
During the past four years, the country's unit labor costs have
risen by only 1.8 percent annually compared to 7 percent in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the new Job Network and programs of improving work
force skills and abilities have encouraged and assisted job search
by unemployed people.
</P>
<P>
The reforms help increase responsiveness of the labor market to
changes in the economy, reduce impediments to job creation and
participation in employment, and improve productivity.
</P>
<P>
The fourth pillar is the government's consistent efforts to pay
off debt and balance budget.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the four pillars, Australia is embracing the most
comprehensive tax reform in its history.
</P>
<P>
The new tax system will bring Australians significant cuts in
their income tax, and business and exporting costs will be
dramatically reduced. Individuals are encouraged to achieve more
and Australian business and exports will become more competitive.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the International Monetary Fund and the OECD predict
that Australia will grow faster than all Group-7 economies next
year, and the Australian government expects its economy to grow at
a solid 3 percent in 1999-2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Australians believe the ongoing structural reforms, plus a new
tax system, will propel Australia's strong growth momentum into
the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes Overseas Investment in Building Materials Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- China's State Administration
of Building Materials Industry (SABMI) will present 69 projects,
which call for an aggregate investment of 1.9 billion U.S. dollars,
to overseas investors during the coming investment and trade fair
to be held in southeast coastal open city of Xiamen on September 8-
12.
</P>
<P>
China now has received 5 billion U.S. dollars worth of overseas
funds in the thriving industry, China Daily's Business Weekly
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"SABMI will try to create more favorable investment climate for
overseas investors," said Huang Jinfeng, an official with the
administration.
</P>
<P>
She said SABMI has taken measures to maintain market order,
including setting price floors for relevant products and working
with related departments to combat fake products.
</P>
<P>
However, she stressed that all overseas-funded projects must
meet international environmental protection standards.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics reported a 2.3 percent year-on-year growth
in building materials exports totaling 1.02 billion U.S. dollars
in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Huang attributed the growth to increased tax rebate rates. Such
rate for cement export increased from 11 percent in 1998 to 15
percent in 1999 while that for glasses and non-metallurgical
products up from 9 percent to 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
Diversified strategy and improved quality also promoted
building materials exports, she noted.

<HEADLINE> Paraguayan President Appoints New Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Paraguay's president
Saturday appointed Carlos Mateo Balmelli as foreign minister to
succeed Miguel Abdon Saguier dismissed for failure to obtain the
extradition of two former military leaders who were granted asylum
in Argentina and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Saguier told the press that President Luis Gonzalez Macchi
asked him to resign over the telephone because of pressures from
relatives of the assassinated Vice President Jose Maria Argana,
according to reports reaching here from Asuncion.
</P>
<P>
Argentina Thursday rejected a request by Paraguay for the
extradition of failed coup leader former army chief Lino Oviedo,
who is accused of instigating Vice President Argana's
assassination in March. Oviedo requested political asylum in
Argentina on March 28.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Uruguay turned down Paraguay's extradition
request for former Defense Minister General Jose Segovia, said to
be a close associate of Oviedo, who is accused of stealing 450,000
U.S. dollars while serving under former President Raul Cubas Grau.
</P>
<P>
The dismissed Paraguayan foreign minister said he did his best
to get both extraditions, especially the one of Oviedo.
</P>
<P>
Saguier said that the president was pressured by Defense
Minister Nelson Argana, son of the assassinated Vice President,
and Argana's widow, Marylin Contreras.
</P>
<P>
The Paraguayan government earlier Friday recalled for an
indefinite time its ambassadors to Uruguay and Argentina.

2.4 seconds to play. As the sellout crowd of 16,285 began
celebrating what it thought were the winning points, Weatherspoon
took the inbounds pass from Becky Hammon and took two dribbles
before letting fly with a shot on the right side that banked off
the top of the box and cleanly through the net, stunning and
silencing the crowd.
</P>
<P>
"It felt pretty good," said Weatherspoon. "When it left my
hand, I was just praying praying it would give us an opportunity
to play Game Three. I've made one of those before, but never in a
game. I was going to live or die with that shot."
</P>
<P>
Guard Cynthia Cooper had a sinking feeling on the shot that
sunk the Comets and forced a decisive Game Three on Sunday at the
Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
"My thought, when it was in the air, was that it was a bucket,"
she said. "I've never seen that before. It was a bucket, a 3-
pointer, and we'll play tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
The incredible shot capped a wild comeback for the Liberty, who
erased an 18-point first-half deficit. Crystal Robinson scored 16
of her 21 points in the second half for New York, which dug itself
a 15-2 hole in the first nine minutes as Houston tried to run the
Liberty out of the Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
The Liberty responded every time the Comets threatened to pull
away for a win. In a addition to wiping out the 18 point deficit,
they erased a nine-point gap in the final 9:10.
</P>
<P>
Kym Hampton erased a four-point gap with a three-pointer and a
jumper to give New York a 63-62 lead with 1:24 remaining. Sheryl
Swoopes and Thompson combined for three free throw, but Robinson
answered with a tough three pointer to forge a 65-65 tie with 16.3
seconds remaining, setting up the dramatic finish.
</P>
<P>
New York shot 39 percent (22-of-56) but stayed in the game by
hitting 8-of-16 shots from beyond the arc. The Liberty also had a
34-28 rebounding advantage, grabbing 13 on the offensive glass.
</P>
<P>
The Comets made only 30 percent (15-of-50) of their shots but
built a 32-16 edge in free throws, attempting 42 to New York's 22.
Houston has made 55-of-71 foul shots in the two games compared to
New York making only 23-of-37.
</P>
<P>
New York snapped Houston's 14-game home winning streak that
spanned to the regular season. The Comets suffered their only home
loss on June 28 to the expansion Orlando Miracle.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Control Tobacco Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar taking measures to
control tobacco and conduct tobacco-free activities in the wake of
the alarming stage of smoking condition reached in the country in
terms of the number of smokers, the amount of tobacco and age of
smokers.
</P>
<P>
Surveys show that 38 percent of the adults in Myanmar were
smokers in 1973 and the percentage went up to 46.6 in 1993,
official newspaper the New Light of Myanmar Sunday quoted Myanmar
Minister of Health Major-General Ket Sein as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to an estimate of the World Health Organization, an
adult smoker in Myanmar consumes 2,000 to 3,000 cigarettes per
year.
</P>
<P>
Another survey also shows that youths between 10 to 20 years of
age in Myanmar have smoked in one way or another, Ket Sein said at
a seminar here on Saturday on tobacco-free initiative, sponsored
by the ministry.

<HEADLINE> China's First Arctic Expedition Retrospected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
And more than 50 elite Chinese polar researchers from various
fields participated in the event, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that the global climate changes reflected in
the Arctic area require multi-field collaboration, and that it is
not possible for people from any single field to carry out such an
inspection of the earth.
</P>
<P>
"It is not common to have such a large-scale comprehensive
expedition," said the chief scientist, adding that China's latest
Arctic expedition expects to significantly advance the nation's
Arctic research, and will train a group of outstanding scholars
for China's future polar study in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Chen had been to both the South and the North poles many times
over the past decade, and now he is a key figure in charge of
China's polar study.
</P>
<P>
"Global climate changes are the result of the integrated effect
of many factors. During the expedition, we employed various means,
such as yachts and helicopters, to carry out multi-site
simultaneous observation of the integrated effect of the ice, the
atmosphere, and the sea," the scientist explained.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the Arctic area studied by the Chinese had
been largely unexplored by the international science community. In
many of the marine areas that the Chinese expedition ship traveled,
there was almost no guidance available in the present marine maps
and materials.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, the success of the expedition fully demonstrated
the Chinese scientists' strong sense of responsibility for the
global changes and environmental problems and their positive
contributions to scientific understanding of the North pole.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned that some relevant research institutes from
the U.S. and Canada were quite helpful to China's Arctic
expedition, and that some researchers from Russia, the Republic of
Korea, and Japan also joined the expedition. So, the expedition
was an example of successful international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The chief scientist told the reporter that the expedition
turned out to be a big success and that the planned targets were
fulfilled. "International cooperation is an important trend in
polar study. The Chinese and foreign scientists had wide-ranging
exchanges during the expedition," he said, hoping that this trend
will continue and be further strengthened.

<HEADLINE> 2000 Fed Cup Tennis to Be Played Under New 13-Team Format </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- starting with the 2000
competition, the women's Fed Cup Tennis Championship will be
contested over just two weeks with a 13-team, three-group format
similar to the one used in World Cup Soccer.
</P>
<P>
The new format, which involves three World Groups of four
nations each and an automatic second round berth for the defending
champion, was announced Saturday at the National Tennis Center in
New York.
</P>
<P>
Italy, a losing semifinalist this year, will host Group A. In
the Fed Cup draw held Saturday, Spain, Germany and Croatia would
join Italy in round-robin play.
</P>
<P>
The Slovak Republic, the other losing semifinalist, will host
Group B and would be joined by Switzerland, Austria and the Czech
Republic.
</P>
<P>
The loser of the 1999 Fed Cup final between the United States
and Russia, to be played at Palo Alto, California later this month,
will be the host nation for Group C. That grouping would include
France, Belgium and Australia in the first round and will be
played during the week of April 24.
</P>
<P>
The three winners from each of the Groups advance to the
semifinals along with the defending champion. The semifinals and
finals both will be contested during the week of November 20.
</P>
<P>
The first round and semifinals will be a best-of-three
competition, with two singles and one doubles match. The final
will be a best-of-five competition, similar to the men's Davis Cup,
with four singles matches and one doubles match. All matches will
be best-of-three sets with a tiebreak only in the first two sets.
</P>
<P>
The three nations which finish last in their World Group round-
robin competition will be relegated automatically to Regional
Qualifying Group One the following year. The three nations who win
their regional qualifying group automatically qualify for the
World Grooup the following year.
</P>
<P>
"The International Tennis Federation is convinced that the new
Fed Cup format will help to boost the competition's image," ITF
President Francesco Ricci Bitti said.
</P>
<P>
Bitti also conceded that the new format was devised to combat
two major problems with the old format -- diminishing player
commitment due to tennis calendar constraints and limited time for
the successful promotion of Fed Cup competition by national
associations.

<P>
According to official figures, during the first half of this
year, a total of 74 state-owned economic enterprises (SEE)
including four factories, seven rice mills, 57 cinemas and six
hotels were included in the privatization plan.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has, since January 1995, been implementing a
privatization plan for its SEEs, aimed at transforming them into
effective business organizations.
</P>
<P>
There were a total of 36,275 private industrial enterprises in
Myanmar by the end of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Agassi, Capriati Reach Four Round at U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Americans Andre Agassi and
Jennifer Capriati, two of the more compelling comeback stories of
1999, registered impressive victories Saturday to advance to the
fourth round of the U.S. Open Tennis Championships.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who resurrected his sagging career this year by winning
the French Open and reaching the Wimbledon finals, overcame the
antics of fellow American Justin Gimelstob with a 6-1,6-4, 3-6, 6-
4 win.
</P>
<P>
Capriati, the former teenage prodigy returning to the scene of
her greatest triumphs, ousted 11th seed Nathalie Tauziat of France
6-3, 1-6, 6-1 in the women's competition.
</P>
<P>
Two American women's seeds took different routes in advancing
to the round of 16.
</P>
<P>
Second seed and defending champion Lindsay Davenport routed
fellow American Amy Frazier 6-1, 6-1 in just 46 minutes. Davenport,
the Wimbledon champion, is now 7-0 lifetime against Frazier,
having beating her on the way to the Bank of West Classic title
last month in California.
</P>
<P>
Seventh seed Serena Williams had to rally from the brink of
defeat to beat 16-year-old Kim Clijsters of Belgium, the youngest
player in the main draw 4-6, 6-2, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Capriati reached the U.S. Open semifinals in 1991 at the age of
15, was ranked sixth in the world and seemed destined for a great
career before she ran into personal and legal problems and plunged
from the rankings.
</P>
<P>
In other women's play, fifth seed Mary Pierce of France ousted
Spain's Angeles Montolio 6-0, 7-6 (7-4); ninth seed Julie Halard-
Decugis of France advanced when countrywoman Amelie Cocheteux
retired in the opening set; and No. 16 Conchita Martinez of Spain
held off Russia's Elena Dementieva 6-2, 2-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Sabine Appelmans of Belgium rallied to defeat Spain's Magui
Serna 0-6, 6-1, 6-3 in the lone matchup between unseeded women.
</P>
<P>
For the men, Kafelnikov, the third seed from Russia, downed
Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden, 6-1, 6-4, 6-4, and No. 12 Richard
Krajicek of the Netherlands beat countryman John Van Lottum 6-4, 6-
1, 6-4.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Story of Fashion Designer Liu Ming (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Fashion designer Liu Ming
needs only a piece of cloth and some pins to create an exquisite
gown that is ready for the runway.
</P>
<P>
Her needle-less, thread-less technique gained her instant fame
following a demonstration at a contest in Sichuan province in 1990,
and again at the Spring Festival Evening Party, televised live by
China Central Television (CCTV) the following year.
</P>
<P>
"I got the inspiration from the Indian Sari and the popular
method in Japan in which dresses are cut out right on the models,"
Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Liu was only 18 when she got her first job in the fashion
business, designing dresses for a local modeling team in Chongqing
city. Due to a money shortage, she had to make dresses as simply
as possible.
</P>
<P>
"I was not aware that I was creating an original dressmaking
method, I only knew it saves both money and cloth," said Liu. With
her nimble fingers, she can make a rose out of a napkin, and a
wedding dress out of mosquito netting and string. She has adapted
her distinct vision to create kimono, cheong-sam, evening dresses
and beachwear.
</P>
<P>
"Before that, I was never ambitious enough to become a fashion
designer," she recalled. "My biggest ambition was to become a
tailor and have a small workshop of my own."

<TEXT>
<P>
Even this simple wish seemed unattainable for Liu, who worked
for years as a pigment mixer in a local tannery before signing up
with the modeling team.
</P>
<P>
"I worked in the tannery and attended classes in a fashion
center. I also hired an art tutor to teach me art basics," she
recalled.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the dressmaking demonstration at CCTV, Liu formed
her own modeling team and looked for fashion shows in which to
show off her unusual work. "I became ambitious enough to present
my own idea of fashion design," she said.
</P>
<P>
But as China opened up wider to the outside world, the country'
s dressmaking industry faced mounting competition from name brand
clothing manufacturers at home and abroad as well as exclusive
dress shops.
</P>
<P>
To make herself more marketable, Liu enrolled at the Central
Institute of Arts and Crafts to receive formal training in fashion
design. "I wanted to prepare myself to become a fashion designer
in the real sense," she said.
</P>
<P>
With her unique artistic flair which combines Chinese tradition
and culture, Liu created two collections, "Dream of China" and "
Yunyou," and won wide acclaim in the fashion circle as a designer
with great potential.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, she was named "Excellent Fashion Designer" in the
country's top national garment design contest.
</P>
<P>
Now, the 30-year old Liu has her own company and workshops, has
developed two name brands and is custom-making dresses for stores
in the busiest shopping district in Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
With a smile, she said she expects two things in the future: a
new collection of dresses -- and a baby.

BELGRADE, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's official news
agency Tanjug carried an editorial Saturday, accusing Bernard
Kouchner, head of the U.N. mission, of making decisions that
wantonly trample upon the sovereignty of Yugoslavia and go against
the U.N. Security Council resolution 1244.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said that after his decision Friday that the
German mark will serve as the major official currency in the
province of Kosovo, Kouchner declared the establishment of customs
on the Yugoslav border with Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Under the support of Kouchner, the illegal government formed by
the illegal ethnic Albanian "Kosovo Liberation Army" has now got
control of the tax and customs revenues in Kosovo and has been
sharing the money with the U.N. mission, it said.
</P>
<P>
The editorial pointed out that Kouchner's action has caused
uneasiness among local Serbs, for they believe what Kouchner has
done is to sever Kosovo's ties with Yugoslavia.

WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Saturday hailed the new accord reached between Israel and the
Palestinians, but he also said much hard work remained for
permanent peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at his presidential retreat at
Camp David, Clinton cautioned that "There is much hard work ahead,
" singling out those of negotiations between Syria and Israel and
between Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the new accord, so-called Wye Two agreement,
could be a "stepping stone" to a broader peace in the region and
he pledged U.S. support for such efforts.
</P>
<P>
"We will do everything we can to be supportive all along the
way and to achieve our larger goal -- a just and lasting
comprehensive peace in the entire region, including Syria and
Lebanon," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The new accord was signed on Saturday at the Egyptian Red Sea
resort of Sharm el-Sheikhh, which called for further withdrawal of
Israeli troops from the West Bank and the release of hundreds of
Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, starting in 10 days.

concerns over rampant organized crimes in Kosovo, urging the "
Kosovo Liberation Army" to completely halt violence and hand in
all weapons by September 19.

<HEADLINE> First Incan Site Recovered in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists recently recovered
an Inca empire site high in the Andes mountains in the province of
Arequipa, south Peru.
</P>
<P>
The site, at an altitude of 2,900 meters, is said to be the
first Inca ruin ever found in Peru. Archaeologists suppose in the
site once stood over 40 huge buildings made by polished stones,
along whose relics some ancient pottery has been found.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, a group of preserved frozen mummies
sacrificed to the Inca gods 500 years ago has been discovered on
top of a snow-clad volcano at an altitude of 6,000 meters in the
same area.
</P>
<P>
The vast Inca empire, with its advanced culture and powerful
armies, spanned most of the Andes along South America's western
coast in the middle of the 15th century. In 1532, it collapsed
under the Spanish conquest.

<HEADLINE> Lukin: China Feat Prompts Envy in Friends, Jealousy in Foes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Vladimir Lukin has visited
China six times in the past 14 years, and each time China's great
progress brought him new surprises.
</P>
<P>
Lukin, who heads the International Affairs Committee of the
Russian State Duma, or lower house of the parliament, has been
following China's development for decades.
</P>
<P>
"Over the 50 years since its founding, especially in the past
two decades following the advent of the reform and opening-up
policy, China has made great strides in its socio-economic
development, which invokes envy from friends and jealousy among
enemies," Lukin said in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
When he first visited Shenzhen in 1985 as a scholar, Lukin was
surprised at the modernization of the city located near Hong Kong.
In his subsequent visits, he found this first special economic
zone of China more and more beautiful.
</P>
<P>
He said China's rise is a feat with world-wide importance in
the 20th century. Although it has yet to complete its
reunification. Hong Kong has already returned to the motherland
and Macao will come back soon. The reunification across the Taiwan
Straits, Lukin said, will be achieved eventually.
</P>
<P>
Lukin also praised China's economic achievements. It is
something of world significance for China to raise the living
standard of people in such a wide expanse of land over such a
short period, he said, and he is even happier to see changes among
ordinary Chinese, who are wearing more smiles and more beautiful
clothes.
</P>
<P>
China is also militarily stronger, but within the proper limit,
Lukin said. Rather than making its neighbors nervous, China
advances its national defense only to the point whereby other
world powers would respect it and heed its interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lukin pointed out, China still faces problems such
as population, environment, political restructuring and
reorganization of large state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the Chinese friends will tackle these problems
smoothly," Lukin said.
</P>
<P>
On relations between Russia and China, Lukin said that current
bilateral ties are actually better than those during the 1950s
when more weight was put on ideology. The two sides are now more
pragmatic and both emphasize mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
Lukin acknowledged the presence of problems in bilateral
economic relations. However, these problems were mainly a result
of Russia's current economic difficulties and have fortunately had
no bearing on bilateral political relations and people-to-people
exchanges, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lukin said Russia and China have established a strategic
cooperation partnership  oriented toward the 21st century. They
now have frequent high-level visit exchanges and both treat each
other candidly. The completion of border demarcation by the two
countries is also an achievement of far-reaching importance.
</P>
<P>
He praised China for its respect for and understanding of
Russia. China, which also experienced social and economic
difficulties in the past, never makes carping comments on Russia,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In the diplomatic field, Lukin said, Russia and China both
advocate a multipolar world and want to see stronger roles of the
United Nations and the U.N. Security Council in international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Lukin, once a Russian ambassador, stressed that a stronger
China poses no threat to the world. From the perspectives of its
history, tradition, and national trait, China is not an aggressive
country.
</P>
<P>
Instead, China is a country that focuses on its own affairs,
Lukin said. "The construction of the Great Wall was not for
expansion but for defense."
</P>
<P>
China poses no threat to Russia either, Lukin said. He
dismissed as sheer eyewash the saying that Chinese leaders want to
take Siberia from Russia and annex it into China.

LONDON -- House prices in Britain could increase by one third
by the end of next year unless interest rates are put up swiftly,
a leading bank in the City predicted.
</P>
<P>
An independent report by Deutsche Bank said this could push the
cost of an average home up from 75,000 pounds (120,000 U.S.
dollars)to more than 100,000 pounds (160,000 dollars) by the end
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England needs to act quickly to slow the current
aggressive housing market, which is already 10 percent higher than
it was a year ago, it added.
</P>
<P>
Prices in the South, which traditionally have the fastest
recovery, could rise by 35 percent in the next 16 months while in
the North East they could rise by a fifth, according to the report.

<P>
NEW DELHI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Inflation rate of India rose
by 0.11 percentage points to 1.67 percent for the week ended
August 21, following a sharp rise in prices of edible oil and
fuel.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve Bank of India, the annual inflation
rate, based on the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), went up during the
week to 1.67 percent compared to 1.56 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
However, the figure was less than one-fourth of 8.39 percent in
the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts indicated that the country's inflation is expected to
rise in the coming month on account of a likely hike in petroleum
prices by the incoming government and increased demand for
manufactured products.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Compliance Satisfactory in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has achieved
satisfactory results in resolving potential millennium bug (Y2K)
related problems in most state sectors, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We have moved into a phase of working on contingency plans,"
said V.K. Samaranayake, chairman of the Council for Information
Technology (CINTEC), which is the government task force
responsible for coordinating millennium compliance efforts.
</P>
<P>
Samaranayake said that other than the health sector, Sri Lanka
was confident critical sectors like finance, water distribution
and power generation, air and sea ports were millennium compliant.
</P>
<P>
"The health sector is behind, but it is not worrying in a way,"
he said, adding that the problem only lies in embedded chips in
some old medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug, or year 2000 problem, refers to the danger
some computers will not recognize dates beyond 1999 because their
programmers once used only two digits to refer to years. As a
result it could disrupt systems from airlines to bank teller
machines to power grids.
</P>
<P>
Y2K readiness means updating computer codes to recognize the
"00" in two-digit date fields as 2000 and not 1900.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's Central Bank said contingency plans were in the
process of being completed before September 30, the revised
deadline as most banks were unable to complete their testing by
June 30, the earlier deadline.
</P>
<P>
All testing in the telecommunications sector has been completed
by June and checked by two Y2K specialists from British Telecom.
The sector is geared to look at possibilities of getting a team of
three Y2K professionals from the World Bank within the next two
months to carry out a final round of checking.
</P>
<P>
Extra care has been taken to ensure that the aviation sector is
100 percent prepared because of the international linkage. "We had
completed testing all critical equipment of air traffic services
and navigation services by mid this year," said Rambukpotha,
chairman of the Airports and Civil Aviation Y2K Task Force.
</P>
<P>
As to the health sector, the Health Department has directed all
hospitals to submit their Y2K readiness reports to the Task Force
by the end of this month.

JOHANNESBURG, September 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is quietly
preparing its soldiers for a peace mission in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), despite official denials that the
military has identified resources for the mission, Sunday World
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
A group of senior officers, all volunteers, are being trained
at the South African National Defense Force headquarters south of
Pretoria in the roles they will play as military liaison officers
and observers, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
No official word has been given whether they will participate
in the United Nations peace mission in the DRC, but they have been
lectured extensively on the geopolitical situation in the country
by an expert from the Institute for Security Studies.
</P>
<P>
Their course ends on September 17 and they have been advised to
be prepared to be away for between six months and a year,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The group was chosen after rigorous selection, including
medical and psychometric testing. The officers range in rank from
captain to colonel.
</P>
<P>
The UN plans to send about 20,000 troops to the DRC for a
peacekeeping mission in which South Africa is likely to play a
major role.
</P>
<P>
South African leaders have indicated that the country was
waiting for the official request of the UN.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Congolese Rally for Democracy rebel group
finally added their names on the Lusaka cease-fire agreement last
Tuesday, officially ending the year-long conflict in the central
African country.
</P>
<P>
Under the Lusaka agreement, the first peace enforcement measure
would be for the UN to dispatch a fact-finding military liaison
team.
</P>
<P>
A peacekeeping force under the auspices of the UN and the
Organization of African Unity would then be deployed.

<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- This year is the 52nd year the
American-born Sidney Shapiro has spent in China.
</P>
<P>
Shapiro's arrival in 1947 in Shanghai marked the prelude to his
extraordinary life experience connected with China.
</P>
<P>
Shapiro must still remember that before the People's Republic
of China was founded in 1949, he helped to collect and deliver
medicines to the Communist Party of China under the disguise of an
American lawyer in downtown Shanghai enveloped in the White terror
of Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
He must remember that to embrace the peaceful liberation of
Peking, Shapiro practiced all nights long revolutionary songs
together with his friends as some big names in modern China's
literature like Mao Dun and Yang Hansheng.
</P>
<P>
And that after new China was founded, Shapiro devoted himself
to translating Chinese literary works and established his
reputation as one to put China's classic "Heroes of the Marshes"
into English.
</P>
<P>
Today, the legendary 85-year-old senior lives in a typical
Beijing residence, "Siheyuan" as it is called, wearing cloth shoes
in the summer and silk yarn-padded jacket in the winter, just like
an ordinary Beijinger does.
</P>
<P>
His room is simple but neatly packed, with only the
calligraphic works and photos by some famous Chinese writers and
artists like Guo Moruo and Wu Zuoren on the wall portraying him as
one with some extraordinary past.

<P>
In his autobiography entitled "My China", Shapiro compared his
life experience to "a particle" in "the centrifuge that created
one of the most momentous changes in Chinese history".
</P>
<P>
China has made an amazing try of human effort -- under a very
unfavorable circumstance, pulling a country from the abyss of
degeneration to a seemingly fair society, he said.
</P>
<P>
Still today, the old man believes that the success of the
Chinese revolution "has brought a better life to the Chinese
people."
</P>
<P>
Shapiro, a Wall Street lawyer before the World War II, arrived
in China after 12,000-mile of hardship, cherishing the hope to
find nothing but a job.
</P>
<P>
No sooner had he arrived than he noticed that "the country is
like a volcano on the verge of eruption", that there were people
starved to death everywhere, the wealthy and the ruling class were
cruel and dumb, and the economy was about to collapse.
</P>
<P>
It was not until he ran counter into Feng Zi (meaning the
phoenix in Chinese), a progressive dramatist and actress, later
his dearest wife, that Shapiro started involved actively in the
Chinese revolution.
</P>
<P>
His office on the upper-class-concentrated fourth avenue of
Shanghai became a temporary liaison venue for Chinese
revolutionaries. And so did his home, where late into the night,
people gathered to listen to the radio broadcasting from Yan'an,
the then headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party, around his
precious small radio set he brought along from the United States.
</P>
<P>
October 1, 1949, was an unforgettable day for Shapiro and all
Chinese. That day, he stood on the Tian'anmen Square along with
tens of thousands of Chinese. On hearing the late Chinese leader
Chairman Mao Zedong declaring the founding of new China, he felt
the "excitement spread through his body like an electric current."

<HEADLINE> Nepal-China's Tibet Trade Fair Opens in Kathmandu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Nepal-China's Tibet Trade
Fair '99 opened here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Twenty eight enterprises are participating in the four-day
trade fair with about 2,000 kinds of industrial commodities and
cottage industry products on exhibition.
</P>
<P>
While inaugurating the opening ceremony of the trade fair, Xu
Minyang, vice-chairman of the Tibetan Autonomous Region and head
of the Tibetan Trade Delegation, said that China always laid great
emphasis on the development of trade relations with Nepal and has
formulated a series of preferential policies to promote trade and
economic cooperation between the two countries, especially between
Nepal and the Tibetan Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
He said six trade fairs have so far been held alternatively in
Lhasa of China's Tibetan Autonomous Region and Kathmandu, the
capital of Nepal. These trade fairs have played a very important
role in promoting bilateral trade and economic cooperation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Nepal and Tibet, which are linked by common
mountains and rivers, have been increasing greatly in recent
years. Two-way trade between Tibet and Nepal reached 23 million
U.S. dollars in 1998 and 21.01 million U.S. dollars in the first
half of 1999, an increase of 160.47 percent over the same period
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from the Tibetan delegation, a great
amount of deals is expected from the trade fair, which attracts
businessmen from Nepal, India, Pakistan and Bhutan.

Following the founding of New China, Shapiro worked as an
expert in the Foreign Languages Publishing and Distribution
Administration, rounding off the English versions of a large
number of modern Chinese literary works like "The Family" and "The
Immense Forest and Snowfield", which were sold to other parts of
the world.
</P>
<P>
Elected a member of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference together with a dozen
of foreigners who joined the Chinese nationality, Shapiro took
numerous inspection tours around the country.
</P>
<P>
Shapiro, who once joined the Chinese leaders in the 1960s in
the building of the Shisanling reservoir on the outskirts of
Beijing, one of the earliest water projects in the country, has
now found much more big water conservation projects built or being
built across the land, like the Gezhouba, the Three Gorges and the
Xiaolangdi projects.
</P>
<P>
The change of Shenzhen perhaps left the deepest impression of
all on Shapiro, who visited it twice in 31 years. When Shapiro
first stood on the Luohu Bridge, a frontier pass, to greet his
mother from Hong Kong in 1963, Shenzhen which was behind him was
only a small fishing village. When he visited Shenzhen with his
wife in 1994, he couldn't help gasping at the vigor and vitality
Shenzhen has shown as a city first developed in the country's
reform and opening-up drive that began some two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
Every two or three years, the retired Shapiro would go back to
the U.S. However, every trip of his lasted no more than two or
three weeks, as he finds he could not be separated long from the
Chinese society, which has some kind of "warmth and affection that
is calm and comfortable."
</P>
<P>
For Shapiro, doing Chinese shadow boxing -- Taijiquan, and
tasting the green Longjing (Dragon Well) tea has become a part of
his life. "I fell in love with the Phoenix , and also the Dragon,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> China, UPU Turn New Page of Cooperation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- As the postal world is
undergoing big changes, China is increasing its influence in the
work of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) by hosting the 22nd
Universal Postal Congress (UPC) and assuming important
responsibilities in the UPU, the top UPU official Thomas Leavey
said here in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said that in his experience as both a delegate to the UPC
and later the Director General of the International Bureau of the
UPU, he has been impressed by the selection of people of the
Chinese delegation to UPU meetings.
</P>
<P>
"They are high quality people with good background and
understanding of the issues, and in most cases with the ability to
speak French or English," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since China's membership of the UPU was restored in 1972, it
has been well represented in major UPU meetings, assuming the vice-
chairmanship of four UPC. In mid 1980s, the UPU recruited the
first senior official from China in the 125-year history of the
special agency of the United Nations. Qu Delu from China is now
the Secretary of the Technical Cooperation and Postal Development
Committee under the UPU, coordinating the UPU's assistance to the
developing countries to improve postal services.
</P>
<P>
Leavey said that as the head of both working groups on terminal
dues and express mail services (EMS), China has played a key role
in handling some of the most difficult issues of the UPU's studies
and work.
</P>
<P>
For example, to handle the terminal dues issue, it has to be
taken into consideration the interests of all countries, both the
developed countries and the developing countries. There are also
many technical aspects regarding costs and payments.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has done an excellent job in helping the UPU
come forward with a proposal on resolving the issue in the 22nd
Universal Postal Congress that is going on in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that as China grows into a major
economy power in the next 25 years, it will assume greater
influence in the postal world.

<HEADLINE>   China Crashes South Korea in Asian Championship Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUKUOKA, Japan, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Hu Weidong drilled in
three 3-pointers in a row down the stretch as China took revenge
on South Korea by a 63-45 rout Sunday in the Asian Basketball
Championship for Men.
</P>
<P>
China, who was upset by South Korea 86-72 in the last version
of the tournament two years ago, claimed the only berth to the
2000 Sydney Olympic Games allocated in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia became the first West Asian country to win the
bronze medal of the bia-annual championship, which was set up in
1960, after outplaying the Chinese Taipei 93-67 in a 3-4 places
playoff.
</P>
<P>
Hu, awarded the Most Valuable Player of the championship, led
China a 12-0 run with 5:16 left to build a 56-40 advantage over
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old forward, who was in his fourth appearance of
the Asian champoinships, scored 16 points, while teammate Gong
Xiaobin contributed 15 and four rebounds in the game.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't blink a while when I made that three baskets, " Hu
said. "I knew I had that chance and I was confident of my shots."
</P>
<P>
Starting the game slowly, South Korea took a brief lead from
Kim Young-man's three-pointer at 15-13 with 7:13 remaining in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
Point guard Li Xiaoyong answered with three-pointer and began a
12-0 run for China before Li's two free-throws made the mark 25-15
with 2:29 to play at halftime, where China built a 29-21 lead.
</P>
<P>
But South Korea striked back at 44-40 when Li Xiang-min was
fouled out before China set off to its late run.
</P>
<P>
"We had advantage on strength over the South Koreans, so we
just came out and played our best game as much as possible," said
China's head coach Jiang Xingquan.
</P>
<P>
China beat up South Korea on free throws as Chinese players hit
14-of-16 while South Koreans had no chance to stand behind the
line.

<TEXT>
<P>
The 85 years of China's membership of the UPU reflects the
significant improvement of the country's international position.
</P>
<P>
When China joined the UPU in 1914, it still had its postal
services controlled by foreign powers. Shortly after new China was
founded in 1949, China was shut out of the UPU for the following
two decades. However, Beijing now is hosting the 22nd UPC, which
was recognized as a milestone in the history of UPU.
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years, China will assume the chairmanship of
the Council of Administration (CA), an executive arm of the UPU to
carry out its strategies and planned acts around the world.
</P>
<P>
"This will be the five years when China plays an important role
in the work of UPU," the General Postmaster of the State Postal
Bureau (SPB) of China Liu Liqing said.
</P>
<P>
Leavey said that the U.S. hosting of the 20th UPC and its work
as the chairman of the CA of the UPU had laid a foundation for his
election as the Director General of the International Bureau of
the UPU.
</P>
<P>
"You may say that the way we worked there led to my election as
Director General," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese postal staff have consulted with all
member countries of the UPU in preparation for the UPC and will
work closely with them in its five-year term of chairmanship of
the CA of the UPU.
</P>
<P>
He said that the experience will help China "understand better
the issues that affect the postal world and the relationships that
countries have to one another with regard to postal matters."
</P>
<P>
"All these will be valuable for China as it increases its
influence and its role in the international area," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the UPU chose China as the place to hold this UPC
because China is a prominent player in the international community.
It maintains good relations with both the developing countries and
the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that as the head of the Council of Administration of
the UPU and the biggest developing country in the world, China
will set a good example for other developing countries with its
successful experience of improving postal services. Over 70
percent of the 189 members of the UPU are developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"I look to China now to assume even broader influence in the
work of the UPU," he said.

LUSAKA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Malawian army, exclusively

<HEADLINE> Liberal Paper Banned for "Disrespect for Islamic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A newspaper which supports
President Mohammad Khatami has been banned on "charges of
disrespect for Islamic Sanctities and the status of supreme
leader."
</P>
<P>
The Persian-language daily Neshat was ordered Saturday to
close down by the Tehran Public Court, the public relations
office of Tehran Justice Department said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The ban, issued on the basis of both the Press Law and the
Constitution, will hold until the time of trail of the paper on
the charges leveled by the Tehran Justice Department as public
prosecutor, according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Neshat carried an article which called for
abolishing the death penalty, saying that capital punishment by
hanging or vengeance laws are not solutions to murder and
corruption on earth.
</P>
<P>
The daily this week published an astonishing open letter by a
co-founder of the opposition Iran Liberation Movement to supreme
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, urging him to distance himself from
the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
In response, the supreme leader said on Thursday that vengeance
laws are one of the fundamental basics of Islam, calling those
opposed them as "apostates," who could be put to death.
</P>
<P>
The president warned pro-government newspapers against
exceeding the limits. "Those who want the good of this nation
should avoid making any attempt to undermine the religious
foundation of the country," Khatami said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Managing director and editor-in-chief of the daily, Latif
Safari and Mashallah Shamsolvaezin, were summoned to the Tehran
Justice Department to receive the ban.
</P>
<P>
The department said repeated summons and bails have proved
ineffective in preventing the daily from repeating its
offense. Neshat was the successor of Tous and Jameah, which had
been closed down on press charges.
</P>
<P>
The department Neshat had obtained the permit for a
sports-cultural daily, and its request for being active
politically was not approved by the press supervisory board.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen rebels of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) have been killed in an armed clash in
eastern Turkey, the semi-official Anatolia news agency reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the Turkish security forces clashed with
the PKK militants Saturday night when they were making search for
the PKK rebels in Gurpinar-Catak town in Van province bordering Iran.
</P>
<P>
During the armed clash, 15 PKK rebels were killed and one
officer and six soldiers of the security forces also died and five
other soldiers were wounded, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
The wounded were taken to Van Military Hospital for medical
treatment, added the agency.
</P>
<P>
Imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan ordered an end to the
armed struggle against the Turkish government and people after he
had been sentenced to death for treason.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government has refused to negotiate with the PKK
who have been fighting a 15-year-long war for an independent state
in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The war has claimed at least 37,000 lives.

<P>
AMMAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- During Jordanian King Abdullah
Bin Hussein's upcoming visit to Kuwait, Jordan will not make an
official request to Kuwait for compensation for Jordanian workers
expelled in the 1990-91 Gulf Crisis.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, who is due in Kuwait Monday, is the first Jordanian
ruler to visit Kuwait in nearly a decade. Jordanian officials
confirmed that the compensation issue will not be on the agenda of
the visit, Jordan Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Although the two leaders are expected to discuss all issues
of mutual concern, the issue of compensation has become a U.N.,
not a bilateral issue," said an unnamed Jordanian official.
</P>
<P>
At least 25,000 Jordanian workers were expelled from Kuwait in
the 1990-91 Gulf Crisis when Jordan was found to be sympathetic
with Iraq after his troops stormed into Kuwait. The two countries
resumed full diplomatic ties earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian expelled workers were reportedly demanding 3.3
billion U.S dollars in compensation for their holdings in
companies, factories, printing houses and quarries.
</P>
<P>
Jordan hoped King Abdullah`s visit to Kuwait would help usher
in a chapter in bilateral relations, Jordan Times said. Abdullah
will hold talks with Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber Ahmad Sabah during
his visit.

<HEADLINE> Germany Writes Off Debts for Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Germany has agreed to write off
50 million Deutsche marks (27 million U.S. dollars) of debts for
Jordan to support the kingdom`s development projects and its role
in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by German Minister of Economic
Cooperation and Development Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul Saturday
evening in Amman at a press briefing at the end of her two-day
visit to the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
She said the German side proposed the money be used in
development, education and poverty alleviation projects.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement, the fifth phase of a debt relief program
offered by Bonn over the past few years, followed a similar
debt-swap of 70 million Jordanian dinars (98 million dollars) and
a cancellation of 11 million dinars (15.4 million dollars)
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Jordan`s total foreign debts amounted to 6.8 billion dollars
by the end of 1998, of which 446 million dollars owed to Germany.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom is projected to pay 822 million dollars in cash for
its foreign debts in 1999, and 1 billion dollars in the year 2000,
according to figures released in 1998 by the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Germany will allocate 68 million marks (36.8 million dollars)
in aid and assistance to Jordan in 1999, and the same amount will
be allocated in 2000, said Wieczorek-Zeul at the press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The minister also voiced appreciation for Jordanian King
Abdullah Bin Hussein`s efforts to improve ties with all parties
in the region and his efforts to revive the Mideast peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti-Jordanian Ties to be Consolidated: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior Kuwaiti official
has said that Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein's visit to
Kuwait due on Monday will help consolidate bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
"No doubt the visit will open a new chapter for stronger
Kuwaiti-Jordanian ties on sound principles for the interest of
the two peoples," said Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister Sabah
Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah in an interview with local Arabic daily Al-Rai
Al-Aam published Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But when asked if official talks will tackle the issues of
Jordanian laborers, compensation claims and economic ties, Sabah
denied there is any specific agenda, saying "the two sides will
discuss anything suitable in a spirit of cooperation."
</P>
<P>
As Jordan sympathized with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War
triggered by Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait in 1990,
tens of thousands of Jordanian workers were expelled from Kuwait
after the war.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports and speculations that the issues
concerning the return of the Jordanian laborers and their
compensation claims could be discussed during Abdullah's visit.
</P>
<P>
But Kuwait appears not to be ready to accept Jordanian workers
in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti officials also denied reports that Jordan had made
official compensation claims for those who used to work in the
Gulf emirate.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Jordan have been improving their relations over
the past two years, which was marked by a number of visit
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Amman reopened its embassy in Kuwait last March, when Jordan's
Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah Al-Khatib paid an official visit here,
marking a normalization of ties between the two Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Mohammed Al-Mufdhi Al-Qaraan was appointed as
Jordan's new ambassador to Kuwait, the first since the 1991 Gulf
War.

MOSCOW, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia will firmly crack down
the 2,000 rebels from the Chechen republic who crossed the border
into Dagestan early Sunday morning, said First Deputy Interior
Minister Vladimir Kolesnikov.
</P>
<P>
In an address on the Dagestan television, he urged all male

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- At least 35 foreign firms had
applied to set up joint ventures with their Nigerian partners
between June and August, according to Nigerian National Office for
Technology Acquisition and Promotion (NOTAP).
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Sunday quoted
NOTAP's Chief Executive, David Okongwu, as describing it as a
phenomenal rise in the number of applications compared with years
of military rule when no foreign firms wanted to do business,
especially manufacturing here. There was no application at all
between January and April this year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the foreign investment flowed into three sectors --
manufacturing, engineering services and textiles.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, old agreements are being renewed which may lead to
re-opening of shut factories.

BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- World archery powerhouse South
Korea monopolized all four gold medals at the Asian Archery
Championships after winning Sunday's men's and women's team finals
here.
</P>
<P>
South Korean men defeated hosts China 251-242 while its women
won 251-228 over Japan in the finals.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Taipei took home the men's team bronze medal. The women
's team bronze went to China, who was edged unexpectely by Japan
by one point in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the tournament, South Korea also took the men's and
women's individual titles.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Archery Association Vice President Wang Zhengfu said
the Chinese squad produced a stable performance in the men's
competition but its women archers still have the shortcoming of
lack of mental strength.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since 1996 that the Chinese women did not
enter the final.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that during the semifinals a Chinese archer
scored as low as four points, which spelled loss in such a high-
level international event.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the hosting of the championships provided valuable
experience for staging of the World Archery Championships in China
in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.N. Committee of Blocking Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Trade Ministry on
Sunday accused the U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking its health
and oil spare parts contracts, the Iraqi News Agency INA reported.
</P>
<P>
INA quoted a spokesman for the ministry as saying that U.S. and
British representatives in the Sanctions Committee had suspended
two contracts worth 107 million U.S. dollars during the
committee's meeting held last month.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that one contract Iraq's health ministry
signed with a French company contain laboratory stuffs which is
worth 87 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
He added that the other one that Iraq's oil ministry contracted
with a company of the United Arab Emirates contains oil spare parts
valued at 20 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that these two contracts were signed
under the fifth phase of the Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food program which
expired last May.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, now in its sixth phase, Iraq is
allowed to sell limited amount of oil in every six months to buy
food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its 24 million
people.
</P>
<P>
Since the fourth phase of the deal, the ceiling of the amount
of oil Iraq is allowed to sell has been raised to 5.2 billion
dollars from 2 billion dollars for the first three phases.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British envoys in the
Sanctions Committee of hampering the endorsement of its contracts,
arguing that the oil-for-food deal has failed to alleviate the
suffering of the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> Corruption &AMP; Fraud Are Problems in Every Nation: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, China's top
legislator, said here today that the containment and punishment of
economic and financial fraud and corruption related to public
rights is a major issue in every country, and prosecutors should
learn from each other's experiences and promote international
cooperation in this field to combat these crimes.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress, made the remark at the opening ceremony of the 4th
Annual Conference and General Meeting of the International
Association of Prosecutors in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Dealing with the crimes of fraud and corruption is a major
theme of this year's conference.
</P>
<P>
As mankind enters a new millennium, all countries attach vital
importance to economic development, the raising of people's living
standards, and promoting social stability, and public prosecution
plays an important role in this regard, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fraud and corruption seriously affect the normal operation  of
public rights and violate the principles of fairness and justice
in the market economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is convinced that prosecutors present at the
conference will conduct exchanges among themselves, draw on
collective wisdom, and absorb useful ideas and put forward
measured to effectively fight against the crimes of fraud and
corruption throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that the Chinese government attaches great
importance to the fight against fraud and corruption, noting that
there are clear provisions for the punishment of these crimes in
the newly revised criminal law and criminal procedure law.
</P>
<P>
"The judicial bodies in this country are also making
unremitting efforts to achieve this end," he said.
</P>
<P>
China has also put the principle of governing the country
according to law and building China into a socialist country with
the rule of law into the nation's constitution, he said, stressing
that this lays a solid legal foundation for combating these crimes

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Secretary of State K. Albright met with Syrian President
Hafez Assad Saturday for the first time in two years, seeking to
build on her success in closing an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal
that was signed at a hastily convened ceremony early this morning.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Surrounded by a panoply of Middle East leaders and Secretary
of State K. Albright, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, signed an agreement that
Washington hopes will quickly usher in a new era of peace across
the region.
</P>
<P>
-- Indian national elections begin Saturday, requiring a month
of voting and 800,000 polling locations for the 605 million people
eligible to cast a ballot. The vote is the third in 40 months, a
result of fragmented and sometimes treacherous politics that
produce easy-to-disassemble coalition governments.

<HEADLINE> Science and Technology Developing Fast in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's science and technology has made great progress over the
past 50 years, especially since the country adopted the reform and
opening-up policy in 1978.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, some 35,000 research papers written by Chinese
scientists were published in foreign magazines, nearly triple the
figure in 1989, ranking the ninth in the world as opposed to
fifteenth in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The number of patents applied for and granted in China now rank
21st and 24th, respectively, among 120 countries and regions
worldwide, showing the growing creativity of Chinese scientists
and technicians.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government appropriated a total of 46.65 billion
yuan for the developments of science and technology in 1998, an
increase of nearly nine-fold over 1978, with an average annual
rise of 11.2 percent over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
China succeeded in developing its first electron tube computer
and semi-conductor triode in 1958 and 1959, respectively. In 1964,
China successfully tested an A-bomb and launched the first carrier
rocket. In 1965, the country synthesized artificial bovine insulin,
the first of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Cultural Revolution (1966-76) caused serious damage to the
progress of the country's science and technology progress, but the
introduction of the reform and opening-up policy in 1978 has
allowed this sector to recover from this setback, and many drives
to boost scientific and technological development have been
launched since then.
</P>
<P>
The "program to tackle key scientific and technological
problems" was launched in 1982, targeted at solving the country's
most important scientific and technological problems. Between 1991
and 1995, a total of 180 key scientific and technological problems
had been tackled, creating some 60,000 scientific and
technological achievements, with cumulative economic returns
topping 60 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate rural economic development by taking advantage of
scientific and technological progress, the country implemented the
"Sparks Program" to help farmers apply agricultural technologies,
and by the end of 1998 the program had completed 45,000 scientific
research projects. Last year alone, the program created output
value totaling 33.3 billion yuan ($4.2 billion).

<P>
To sharpen the competitive edge for enterprises and enhance
their technological creativity, the country launched a "
Technological Innovation Program" in 1996. By the end of 1998,
this program had arranged some 520 key technological innovation
projects, and 1,420 new products went into trial production.
</P>
<P>
To follow the world's latest high-tech achievements, the
country launched a high-tech scientific research program called "
863" in 1986, which has so far produced 1,468 scientific
achievements, more than 670 of which meet international advanced
standards.
</P>
<P>
To put high-tech research achievements into commercial and
industrial use, the country created the "Torch Program" in 1988 to
commercialize high-tech research results. By the end of 1998, this
program had carried out a total of 15,000 projects, and in that
year alone created an output value totaling 73.2 billion yuan,
with taxes and profits hitting 13.25 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The booming new and high-tech sector has boosted the
estabnlishment of new and high-tech development zones throughout
the country. The number of high-tech development zones in China
had risen from 27 in 1991 to 53 last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Science and Technology, the
country has adopted an all-round opening-up policy in developing
science and technology since 1978, and has conducted wide-ranging
exchanges and cooperation with their foreign counterparts. So far,
China has cooperated with 150 countries and regions on scientific
and technological research, and signed nearly 100 cooperative
agreements between governments.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, more than 400,000 foreign scientists
and technicians have come to work in China, and the country has
sent about 200,000 scientific and technological managerial
personnel to study abroad.
</P>
<P>
Expanding scientific and technological cooperation worldwide
has boosted China's technological trade growth. In 1998, the
country signed 6,254 technological introduction contracts valued
at 16.38 billion US dollars, representing huge increases over the
1991 figures.

<HEADLINE> Newspapers Tell History of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Though most people throw away
the daily newspaper after skimming through them, Lou Shiwei, a
journalist with the Hangzhou Daily in Hangzhou, capital of east
China's Zhejiang Province, considers the papers a "window to
history" and has been collecting Chinese newspapers for about 15
years.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, Lou has collected more than 10,000 different
newspapers published in China over the past 100 years.
</P>
<P>
"Newspapers record major historical events, and you learn
something different from them than you do from reading history
books," Lou said.
</P>
<P>
The most valuable copy Lou has may be a copy of the Ta Kung Pao
published on August 15, 1945, which carries the story of the
surrender of the Japanese invaders in China at the end of World
War II. The type size of the story's headline, "Japan Surrenders,"
was even bigger than that of the paper's masthead.
</P>
<P>
"Even now, when reading this article, I can't help feeling
excited and proud and scenes of the celebrations by Chinese 54
years ago on the victory over the Japanese invaders appear before
my eyes," Lou said.
</P>
<P>
The day he accumulated the largest number of newspapers was
July 1, 1997, when Hong Kong returned to the motherland and he
bought dozens of papers, including the 97-page edition of the
Guangzhou Daily, and the silk edition of the Zhejiang Daily, all
focused on Hong Kong's return.
</P>
<P>
In his collection, Lou said, the papers published before 1949,
when the People's Republic of China was founded, are usually full
of stories about floods, drought, famine, plague, and other
calamities, while those issued after 1949 feature articles about
economic development and social progress.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 years ago, Lou added, a person earning 10,000 yuan a
year was a big story on papers, but that is no longer news today,
nor is a person earning 100,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Lou's collection also reflects the changes in the press itself
in China. The papers he gathered 10 years ago were mainly daily
newspapers, but now he has a collection including morning papers,
evening news and Sunday papers, and he has the first issues of
more than 200 morning and evening papers.

<P>
HONG KONG, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Democratic elections have
already been established in Hong Kong and the Basic Law has paved
the way for the electoral system to be extended in the years ahead,
said a government spokesman Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In response to a media report suggesting that for Hong Kong to
be successful in the 21st century, democracy should be introduced
in Hong Kong, the government spokesman said: "Elected
representatives are able to reflect in the legislature the views
of different sectors of the community."
</P>
<P>
"From being a concept, 'one country, two systems' has become a
reality. The various institutions of Hong Kong including the
executive, legislature and judiciary are exercising the
constitutional checks and balances in accordance with the Basic
Law," the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
"The government is firmly committed to maintaining the level
playing field and the rule of law. Decisions on policies and
projects are made in accordance with Hong Kong's overall interest,
" the spokesman said, adding "This principle applies to the
Cyberport project, as it does to all major projects."
</P>
<P>
"The administration has given a full account of the Cyberport
proposal to the Legislative Council, and various infrastructure
developments relating to the Cyberport received the council's
support," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, General Secretary
of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, has called for
continuing research and study of Chinese history from the
standpoint of historical materialism.
</P>
<P>
This will be of great importance for advancing China's current
cause of development, said Jiang in a letter to Bai Shouyi, a
professor at Beijing Normal University, congratulating him on the
publication of The General History of China.
</P>
<P>
China has attached importance to historical research since
ancient times, Jiang said, and that is one reason Chinese
civilization is the only ancient one handed down from generation
to generation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that all Chinese, especially young people, should
study Chinese history in order to acquire a correct viewpoint on
life and values.
</P>
<P>
He also asked Chinese to study foreign history and use it as a
reference.
</P>
<P>
The General History of China, compiled by Bai Shouyi and 500
other historians and archeologists, relates the comprehensive
history of the world's most populous country from remote antiquity
until 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded.

<HEADLINE> China Gives Great Importance to Combating Fraud, Corruption: Top Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
given great importance to combating fraud and corruption, said Han
Zhubin, China's top prosecutor, at the opening ceremony here today
of the 4th annual meeting of the International Association of
Prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Dealing with the crimes of "fraud and corruption" is on the
agenda for academic discussion at the conference.
</P>
<P>
After long efforts, China's public prosecutions have developed
a series of effective measures to curb and prevent fraud and
corruption through vitalizing the legal system and enhancing
education and supervision, said Han, procurator-general of the
Supreme People's Procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
Chinese prosecution offices also help government bodies and
companies involved in corruption cases to analyze management
loopholes for further prevention, and have contributed greatly to
the economic development and social stability of the country, he
added.
</P>
<P>
In the past 50 years, and especially in the last 20 years of
reform and opening up, Chinese prosecution offices have brought to
court a large number of corrupt officials and those engaged in
crimes of fraud, and have punished them according to law, Han
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Corruption and fraud endanger social morality and threaten
economic development and social stability in all countries, and
should be viewed as common enemies to the entire international
community," Han said.
</P>
<P>
"China is willing to cooperate with all colleagues from
friendly countries through deepening understanding, seeking common
ground and putting aside differences, and learning from each
others' strong points to contribute to the peace and happiness of
humanity," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, China, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Wang Yanmei of China
repeated the feat two years ago as she claimed the last world
record on the final day of the Asian weightlifting Championships
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old strongwoman snatched 123.5 kilograms at her
third attempt in the women's over 75kg division, beating the new
world record of 123.0kg set by her junior compatriot Zhao Nan just
one minute ago.
</P>
<P>
"Before the meet I set my sight on breaking the snatch world
record, and now my dream comes true," said Wang, who claimed the
last world record in the snatch on the final day at the Asian
Championships in Yangzhou, southeast China in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Wang also lifted 150.0kg in the clean and jerk for a
comfortable winning total of 272.5kg, followed by Bharti Singh of
India with 210.0kg.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 105kg category, Hossein Tavakoli of Iran
celebrated a new Asian record with a jerk of 225.5kg, 0.5kg
heavier than the previous record set by Chinese Cui Wenhua.
</P>
<P>
The World championships winner Cui, still not fully recovered
for leg injury, took the snatch gold with 187.5kg. But he had to
settle for the silver in jerk and total behind Tavakoli.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully Cui will be in form at the World Championships to be
held in Athens, Greece this November," said Li Shunzu, Chinese
national team coach.
</P>
<P>
"Though Tavakoli denied Cui's superiority in the jerk in Asia
tonight, we don't think he will be a tough rival for Cui at
neither the World Championships nor Sydney Olympic Games next year.
"
</P>
<P>
Another strongman from Iran Hossein Rezazadeh made a clean
sweep for three titles in the over 105kg class and smashed the
snatch Asian record with 200.0kg. The previous record was 195.5kg.
</P>
<P>
The seven-day Asian championships witnessed 11 new world
records and it was the first time in history that the annual gala
combined six individual competitions, including senior, junior and
youth in both men's and women's events.

JAKARTA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 3,400 East Timorese
flocked the Dili port on Sunday to seek shelter in other areas of
Indonesia, such as Kupang in East Nusa Tenggara province and
Surabaya, East Java, Antara News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
People began flocking the port on Saturday afternoon shortly
after the United Nations announced the result of August 30
autonomy ballot in which 78.5 percent of valid votes cast,
rejected Indonesia's offer for an autonomy package.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 2,000 East Timorese who had previously sought
shelter in the East Timor Police Office left for the port at 6:30
a.m. on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the Dili (capital of East Timor) Navy Base Lt.
Col. TH Widihartono said the Indonesian Navy Force prepared four
ships to carry the East Timorese to Kupang and Surabaya.
</P>
<P>
Another report said some 2,000 East Timorese are taking refuge
in Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo's house in east Dili
following Saturday's announcement of the ballot in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Some incidents have been occurred in East Timor following the
announcement of the ballot result. At least 25 people were killed
and dozens of others were injured in a clash between
pro-integration and pro-independence groups in Dili on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, a civilian policeman of the United Nations Mission

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Ratifies Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel's cabinet Sunday
overwhelmingly ratified a peace deal Prime Minister Ehud Barak
signed with Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat
in Egypt Saturday night to revive the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The 23-member cabinet voted 21-2 to approve the agreement on
the implementation of the U.S.-brokered Wye accords, paving the
way for further Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank and the
launch of permanent peace talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Natan Sharansky from the Yisrael b'Aliya,
or Russian immigrant party, and Housing Minister Yitzhak Levy of
the right-wing National Religious Party, were the only two
ministers who voted against the deal.
</P>
<P>
The accord, signed at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of
Sharm el-Sheikh in the presence of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, is the first agreement since Barak took
office in July promising to revive the peace process on all
tracks.
</P>
<P>
Barak said at the cabinet meeting that the major
achievement of the agreement was to have delayed the transfer
of some land from joint control to full Palestinian control by
three months.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Israel would complete the troop
withdrawals stipulated by the Wye agreement, signed and then
frozen by Barak' hard-line predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu last
year, by January 2000, rather than by mid-November under the
original Wye timeline.
</P>
<P>
Under the new deal, Israel and the Palestinians are
supposed to have entered an advance stage of permanent talks
by early 2000, which would help reduce the potential risk of
confrontation between the two sides raised by the troop
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Barak said the agreement would enhance Israel's security in a
long run, Israel Radio reported.
