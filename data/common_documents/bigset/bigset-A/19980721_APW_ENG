Russian organized crime affects at least 26 countries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian organized crime gangs are active in at
least 26 countries, a top law enforcement official said Tuesday,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Col. Vladimir Selivanov, head of the Interior Ministry's
organized crime department, said the countries in which Russian
organized crime is most active are the United States, Germany,
Switzerland, Israel, Turkey and the Netherlands.
	   Most groups focus on crimes including money laundering, bank
fraud, drug trafficking, kidnapping, and smuggling alcohol,
strategic materials, arms and automobiles.
	   Selivanov also blamed foreign nationals illegally residing in
Russia for some of the country's crime problems. He said crimes by
foreigners increased 27 percent in the first quarter of 1998
compared with last year.

	   HILVERSUM, Netherlands (AP) _ Justin Rose, the 17-year-old
English golfer who shot to fame by coming in fourth in the British
Open, confirmed Tuesday that he has turned professional.
	   Rose, who missed out on a 69,875-pound (dlrs 114,874) pay day
because he played the British Open as an amateur, will start his
first tournament as a professional Thursday when he tees off in the
Dutch Open.
	   ``Since my early childhood I have always wanted to play
professional golf,'' Rose said in a press release issued by
Scottish-based Carnegie Sports Management, the management group
that is overseeing his professional career.
	   ``I have had an enjoyable and rewarding career as an amateur and
I have a great deal of positives to take into the professional
ranks. I am very excited about the challenges and experiences that
lie ahead,'' Rose added.
	   Rose's 1-under-par 69 in Sunday's final round at the Royal
Birkdale club left Rose two shots behind Open winner Mark O'Meara
who beat Brian Watts in a playoff and one place behind Tiger Woods.
His performance was the best by an amateur at the British Open
since 1953.
	   Rose's pro career begins Thursday, a week short of his 18th
birthday, when he joins a field including the likes of Phil
Mickelson, Lee Westwood and Nick Price chasing the 475,000 guilders
(dlrs 219,145) winner's cheque at the Hilversumsche course outside
this town 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of Amsterdam.

Gas tanker drivers reject deal to end strike, harbor pilots walk
</HEADLINE>
out &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Gas tanker truck drivers on Tuesday
rejected a deal to end their two-day strike, while harbor pilots
began a 14-day stoppage which the government said could mean ``huge
losses'' for the country.
	   Labor leaders representing the 2,000 striking tanker drivers had
persuaded government officials and employers to agree to review
written testing procedures _ the strikers' main demand.
	   But the striking truckers were not convinced by the deal
negotiated by their leaders during a three-hour meeting, and
rejected the proposal. They asked for more information about the
proposed review and further talks.
	   Meanwhile, some gas pumps in major cities were already running
dry, and the National Association of Gas Vendors said up to 70
percent of gas stations could be out of supplies on Wednesday.
	   Labor unrest also seriously disrupted imports and exports by sea
Tuesday _ the first of a 14-day stoppage by the country's 80 harbor
pilots who are responsible for steering large vessels into ports.
	   The pilots, whose action effectively closed ports to cargo
ships, demand the right to set their own working conditions.
	   Recent legislation forced them under the supervision of higher
officials and Infrastructure Minister Joao Cravinho told reporters
that the government ``would not yield'' to the pressure.
	   ``Only in a Banana republic can 80 individuals bend the country
to their corporate interests'' he said.
	   Cravinho said more than 90 percent of harbor pilots were under
investigation for corruption, extortion and criminal association
linked to their work before it came under senior supervision. Of
the 30 pilots at Lisbon port, 22 are currently suspended pending
the outcome of police investigations.
	   The pilots also want a 5 percent pay hike, a risk subsidy and
revised career scales.

Chanel's Triumphant New Looks at Couture
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Lacroix, Feraud shows &QL; 
 &UR; With APPhotos &QL; 
 &UR; By SUZY PATTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Fashion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Karl Lagerfeld's Tuesday fall-winter couture show
for Chanel was a triumph of innovative true haute couture over the
siren temptations of blitz-the-media showmanship seen this week --
notably at Givenchy and Dior.
	   For a few years now, Lagerfeld has given up his own shock-wave
clothes that made their eyes pop at Chanel to serve the true
clients here in a kinder, gentler way.
	   Shown on the shop at Rue Cambon, it was exciting just to watch
real clothes, such as a tweed suit with hidden buttons, scoop neck,
a long pin-tuck pleated skirt, to the ankle tops.
	   The skirts were almost all long and full, but there were many
beautifully-cut slim jackets fastened by new ``chain link'' buttons
that could be worn with any length skirt.
	   It all looked glamorous, with legendary Naomi Campbell modeling
one of the adorable full-skirted suits with an opening and silk
panel in back. She and Linda Evangelista were the ``big sisters to
most this group that included younger models like fiery-haired
Karen Elsen ad Crystelle St. Louis.
	   Fabrics like soft boucles in hazy shades of gray and creamy tan
were also paired with floaty silk camisole blouses, that turned
into jackets in some outfits.
	   U.S. merchandisers were enthusiastic: ``I loved it.'' said
Nicole Fischelis, fashion director of Saks. ``The new proportions,
the gracefulness of the trumpet flared skirts. It was totally
elegant.''
	   ``And can be worn by several kinds of figure,'' added Joan Kaner
of Nieman Marcus.
	   The gleam of silvery threads lit up some suits, an occasional
brick wool dress with blouson top came just below the knee, for
those who would rather go short.
	   Towards late-day, the Chanel girls slipped into feathery-light
clothes, sometimes a black lacy suit with an easy, flared jacket, a
light and easy skirt, just above the ankle.
	   ``These clothes are meant to be proud, dignified and natural''
Lagerfeld's program announced, and yes, that was the spirit.
	   Tuxedo ideas looked so feminine with the looser bolero or
camisole-inspired tops. An incredible gray jersey evening dress
with plunging neckline and gold-button shoulder details, and a
trumpet skirt with panels was the ultimate in chic.
	   Marabou trim on dramatic capes, delicate beaded dresses,
all-over beaded models and starry astral themes on tulle or lace
were outstanding for the Chanel girl making a grand entrance.
	   Accessories? Simple and unique: the flat black sandals with
slightly open fronts looked perfect with these long, full clothes.
A cashmere bouclette boa rolled around those loose camisoles looked
good, like the low chain belts for long, full skirts.
	   Christian Lacroix's collection starts at cocktail time, with a
dark boucle suit with scattered checks and pearly satin lining, or
a suit with white off-shoulder jacket and coral satin skirt.
	   But evening dresses are where this couturier's great creativity
comes out, this time based largely on 17th-century Spanish
painting.
	   The lace over lace, the feather inserts, the black dresses with
arabesques all had a Spanish, but not costumey, air. There was
refreshing color throughout, from parma violets through old gold,
bright crimsons and buttercup yellow taffeta.
	   Silhouettes were blessedly simplified compared with past
extravagant outfits.
	   One sensational number was the strapless turquoise brocade with
its big jeweled scarab pin and cape-coat gathered in back. And the
shimmering ``Infanta'' bride with her puffy sleeves, tiny waist and
skirt over an iridescent red underskirt was sheer beauty.
	   At Louis Feraud, his daughter Kiki, chief designer since Feraud
retired, also liked party clothes and clearly shares with her
father a love of color, fun and themes.
	   She also likes race tracks -- an ``elegant sport,'' she says.
	   Indeed some of the clothes in this rich collection had the
``derriere'' interest and curvy silhouette of the sidesaddle riders
of old but, this time, with plenty of bright colors, feathers and
sparkles.
	   Ivana Trump, in the audience wearing a fitted silk cyclamen
short suit, didn't seem to fall for any one look here but said she
was pleased: ``I saw much of interest, a beautiful use of color.''

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ On the first day of talks aimed at
bridging differences with the United States, Pakistan argued
Tuesday against the U.S.-led economic sanctions prompted by nuclear
testing .
	   U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who arrived in
Pakistan from India, is on a mission aimed at preempting a nuclear
arms race in South Asia, following the underground nuclear tests
that the uneasy neighbors conducted last May.
	   ``Pakistan understands US concerns over the increasing threat of
an arms race and escalation, and welcomes US interest in preventing
further deterioration of the security situation in South Asia,''
said a Pakistan foreign ministry statement issued late Tuesday,
after Talbott's first round of talks with Pakistan's Foreign
Secretary Shamshad Ahmed.
	   More substantive talks were planned for Wednesday with Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif and Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub.
	   Slow progress was reported out of India where Talbott held two
days of talks with Indian officials.
	   ``Both sides are looking for areas of agreement,'' U.S. Embassy
spokeswoman in India, Kiki Munshi, told reporters Tuesday. ``This
is a process. It's not a one-shot thing. There is steady
movement.''
	   In India, a senior Foreign Ministry official said India will
propose a nuclear no-first-use agreement to Pakistan when the two
prime ministers meet next week.
	   Sharif and Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India will meet at a summit
of seven heads of state next week in Colombo, the Sri Lankan
capital.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anoynymity, said
discussions on an agreement not to use nuclear weapons first could
later be broadened to a regional level. He did not specifically
name China. India has said China's nuclear power was its primary
concern when it decided to go nuclear.
	   It will be their first meeting since the two countries conducted
nuclear tests in May, each declaring itself a nuclear weapons
state. The tests provoked international condemnation and economic
sanctions.
	   Vajpayee, elected just two months before authorizing the tests,
and Sharif also are expected to try to end a deadlock over resuming
high-level bilateral talks on the disputed territory of Kashmir,
that has been the cause of two wars between Pakistan and India.
	   During Talbott's talks with Ahmed, Pakistan pressed for world
involvement in settling the Kashmir dispute.
	   India has rejected international mediation in the Kashmir
dispute. Both countries lay claim to a united Kashmir, divided
between Pakistan and India by the departing British in 1947.
	   Most analysts expect Talbott to push Pakistan to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and possibly to roll back its nuclear
program.
	   Pakistan also has said it won't sign the test ban treaty that
would give an advantage to rival India.
	   Pakistan's fragile economy, which depends more heavily than
India's on international loans, has suffered from economic
sanctions the United States imposed on both countries after their
nuclear tests.
	   There is a possibility that Pakistan may seek a moratorium on
its debt repayment, Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said earlier.
	   Foreign exchange reserves have fallen to dlrs 600 million,
nearing a record low.
	   In New Delhi, diplomats said Tuesday that other rich donor
nations that clamped anti-nuclear sanctions on India have no plans
to resume suspended aid.
	   The European Union's current chair, Austria, is to begin
discussions with India on behalf of the union to reassess political
and strategic developments, diplomatic sources said. But plans are
at such a tentative stage that no one would discuss details.

Brundtland shakes up WHO top team on first day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout with reaction. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Gro Harlem Brundtland, the new U.N. health chief
started her promised shakeup of the World Health Organization on
Tuesday by naming a much-changed top team.
	   The former Norwegian prime minister pledged that ``we will not
be losing time'' in implementing new programs to combat smoking
among young people and malaria. She promised ``urgent attention''
to the fight against AIDS.
	   A packed hall of WHO staff watched as Brundtland named her new
``Cabinet.'' Hundreds more apparently anxious workers silently
followed her speech in the corridors outside.
	   ``What we do here in Geneva and in the regional offices matters
very little if it does not lead to a difference on the ground,''
Brundtland said.
	   WHO at 50 has faced criticism for being preoccupied with
internal problems and lack of focus. Outgoing Director-General
Hiroshi Nakajima, of Japan, was accused by opponents of bad
management and being a poor communicator.
	   At Brundtland's request, many senior managers ``made available
their posts.''
	   In their place, she named a team with members from all the WHO's
six regions. There are six women among the nine new senior
managers.
	   Germany's Michael Scholtz was recruited from pharmaceutical firm
SmithKline Beecham to take charge of the WHO's health technology
and drugs division.
	   ``We need the experience and the knowledge that is there in
private industry,'' Brundtland told a news conference later,
although stressing that WHO must be ``people-friendly.''
	   She stressed that raising funds for the agency must be a
priority.
	   Former Tunisian health minister Souad Lyagoubi-Ouahchi and U.S.
communicable diseases expert David Heymann, already with WHO, were
among other team members.
	   George Moose, U.S. ambassador to U.N. offices in Geneva,
welcomed the changes. The new team ``is not only highly
professional, technically qualified and experienced, but ... also
reflects balance in terms of gender and geography,'' he said.
	   ``This is a serious sweep,'' said Daniel Warner, a specialist in
international organizations at the Graduate Institute of
International Studies in Geneva, calling the shakeup ``long
overdue.''
	   In New York, the Rockefeller Foundation announced a dlrs 2.5
million grant for Brundtland to recruit outside health experts for
the WHO.
	   Brundtland also announced a new code of conduct requiring senior
officials to disclose private sector interests such as
shareholdings and directorships, to send a ``clear message of high
standards.''
	   She is the third woman to take up a major U.N. post in the space
of a year, following human rights chief Mary Robinson and deputy
director-general Louise Frechette.
	   Brundtland was nominated as the health agency's director-general
in January. Her appointment was confirmed in May by its annual
assembly.
	   WHO organizes massive vaccination efforts, coordinates global
response to epidemics and fosters the widespread distribution of
medicines. It has more than 3,500 staff worldwide, some 1,300 of
them based in Geneva.

Iraq says 1,000 still missing from Gulf War
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Baghdad said Tuesday that more than 1,000
Iraqis are still missing from the 1991 Gulf War and is calling on
foreign countries to pressure Kuwait to help account for them.
	   The National Assembly has sent messages to humanitarian
organizations and parliaments in Arab and other countries, calling
on them to press Kuwait, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   The agency said Iraq believes many of the missing are still
detained by Kuwaiti authorities who should ``immediately reveal
their fate and return them to Iraq.''
	   There was no immediate comment from Kuwait.
	   Kuwait repeatedly has said that 600 people _ including more than
500 Kuwaitis, more than a dozen Saudis and other foreign nationals
_ are still unaccounted for since Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
which set off the Gulf War.
	   Iraq has repeatedly denied that it is holding any Kuwaitis in
its jails.

Algeria says Red Cross will be allowed to visit prisons
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMs with Red Cross, Algerian and Chanet comment. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A senior Red Cross official plans to go to Algeria
to discuss resuming visits to prisoners, the organization said
Tuesday, a day before U.N. diplomats are to arrive in Algeria for a
fact-finding tour.
	   Jean-Daniel Tauxe, director of operations for the International
Committee of the Red Cross, will travel to Algiers on a date to be
agreed with the Algerian authorities, an ICRC statement said. A
date in October has been proposed.
	   Discussions will focus on conditions and arrangements for the
resumption of visits. Following a disagreement over conditions,
Algeria asked the Red Cross to suspend prison visits and other
humanitarian operations in 1992.
	   The statement came after Algerian ambassador to Geneva,
Mohamed-Salah Dembri, told the U.N. committee reviewing adherence
to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that
Algeria was agreeable to allowing Red Cross officials back into its
prisons.
	   ``The program drawn up by the ICRC will include prison visits
and that doesn't perturb us in the least,'' Dembri said.
	   The organization demanded regular, private access to all
detainees and detention centers.
	   Since 1992, it has been carrying out regular missions to the
country from Tunisia, ICRC spokeswoman Beatrice Megevand said.
	   Members of the U.N. committee told an Algerian government
delegation it had not adequately addressed queries about widespread
massacres and other atrocities, and prison visits by the
International Red Cross.
	   ``What we are looking for are some answers,'' committee member
Thomas Buergenthal, of the United States, said.
	   Committee chairman Christine Chanet told reporters some of the
delegation's answers were ``a bit feeble.''
	   Dembri told committee members that they may have misinterpreted
the delegation's responses.
	   A six-member U.N. team led by former Portuguese President Mario
Soares is to fly to Algiers Wednesday.
	   The Washington-based group Human Rights Watch said in a press
statement Tuesday that the visit shouldn't be seen as a substitute
for more in-depth investigations by U.N. experts on torture and
extrajudicial executions.
	   Algeria has steadfastly rejected claims there is a serious human
rights crisis in the country. Instead, it insists the killings are
an internal affair and that terrorism is the major problem.
	   Some countries and international human rights groups have
suggested that the army or government-armed self-defense forces
might have had at least a passive role in some massacres.
	   The Algerian government has been fighting an Islamic insurgency
for the last six years in a conflict which has left at least 75,000
people dead.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ A senior Red Cross official plans to go to Algeria
to discuss resuming visits to prisoners, the organization said
Tuesday, a day before U.N. diplomats are to arrive in Algeria for a
fact-finding tour.
	   Jean-Daniel Tauxe, director of operations for the International
Committee of the Red Cross, will travel to Algiers on a date to be
agreed with the Algerian authorities, an ICRC statement said. A
date in October has been proposed.
	   Discussions will focus on conditions and arrangements for the
resumption of visits. Following a disagreement over conditions,
Algeria asked the Red Cross to suspend prison visits and other
humanitarian operations in 1992.
	   The statement came after Algerian ambassador to Geneva,
Mohamed-Salah Dembri, told the U.N. committee reviewing adherence
to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that
Algeria was agreeable to allowing Red Cross officials back into its
prisons.
	   ``The program drawn up by the ICRC will include prison visits
and that doesn't perturb us in the least,'' Dembri said.
	   The organization demanded regular, private access to all
detainees and detention centers.
	   Members of the U.N. committee told an Algerian government
delegation it had not adequately addressed queries about widespread
massacres and other atrocities, and prison visits by the
International Red Cross.
	   ``What we are looking for are some answers,'' committee member
Thomas Buergenthal, of the United States, said.
	   Committee chairman Christine Chanet told reporters some of the
delegation's answers were ``a bit feeble.''
	   Dembri told committee members that they may have misinterpreted
the delegation's responses.
	   A six-member U.N. team led by former Portuguese President Mario
Soares is to fly to Algiers Wednesday.
	   The Washington-based group Human Rights Watch said in a press
statement Tuesday that the visit shouldn't be seen as a substitute
for more in-depth investigations by U.N. experts on torture and
extrajudicial executions.
	   Algeria has steadfastly rejected claims there is a serious human
rights crisis in the country. Instead, it insists the killings are
an internal affair and that terrorism is the major problem.
	   Some countries and international human rights groups have
suggested that the army or government-armed self-defense forces
might have had at least a passive role in some massacres.
	   The Algerian government has been fighting an Islamic insurgency
for the last six years in a conflict which has left at least 75,000
people dead.

Man charged with murder in arson killing of three brothers

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A 23-year-old man appeared in
court Tuesday on charges of murdering three young brothers in a
firebomb attack during a week of sectarian violence set off when
Protestant marchers were stopped from parading through a hostile
Catholic neighborhood.
	   Thomas Robert Garfield Gilmour of Ballymoney denied the charges,
police said during a hearing in Belfast Magistrates Court. Gilmour
had no criminal record and denied being a member of any
paramilitary organization, police said.
	   The Quinn brothers _ Richard, 11, Mark, 10, and Jason 9 _ were
killed in a July 12 arson attack on their home in Ballymoney, 40
miles (65 kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   A number of other people are being held for questioning in the
case, but police declined Tuesday to give a specific number.
	   Gilmour was ordered to be jailed pending a further court
appearance on Aug. 12.
	   Police believe the family was targeted because the boy's mother,
29-year-old Chrissie Quinn, was a Catholic who lived with a
Protestant boyfriend.
	   The attack was the worst incident of violence which followed a
violent standoff between Protestant marchers and security forces
blocking them from parading through a Catholic neighborhood in
Portadown, 25 miles (40 kms) southwest of Belfast.
	   Stunned by the killings, some leaders of the Orange Order called
for an end to the confrontation between its marchers and security
forces. The numbers of protesters camped near the Drumcree Anglican
church has dwindled to a token presence.
	   In Newry, 35 miles (55 km) south of Belfast, an explosion in a
police station parking lot late Tuesday afternoon _ apparently
caused by a mortar shell _ caused no injuries.
	   Police, who believed the device was fired from the back of a
van, called in a bomb disposal team to examine an object lying in
the parking area at Corry Square station.
	   There was no indication of who was responsible. But mortars were
a weapon used by the Irish Republican Army, so suspicion fell on
dissidents who oppose the present cease-fire and the participation
of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party in Northern Ireland's new
Assembly.
	   Police and soldiers were inside the base at the time of the
attack, a Royal Ulster Constabulary spokeswoman said, but no onw
was reported hurt.

President Menem renounces intention to seek third straight term
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEVIN GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ In a surprise move, President
Carlos Menem on Tuesday renounced his intention to seek a third
straight term in next year's presidential race.
	   Menem told a press conference at the Olivos presidential palace
that he would ``definitely'' not seek another term as president,
adding ``I will leave power December 10'' of next year.
	   ``After a prolonged analysis, I have resolved to exclude myself
from whatever course of action to compete in 1999,'' Menem said,
flanked by his ministers, governors and other members of his
Peronist party.
	   ``I don't want anything or anybody to interfere with the
objective of making Argentina a country that's worth living in,''
he said.
	   In order to seek a third consecutive term, currently barred
under Argentina's 1994 constitution, Menem supporters had talked
for months of either seeking a constitutional amendment, or asking
the Supreme Court to declare the ban on a third term
unconstitutional.
	   Opposition leaders reacted skeptically to the president's
surprise announcment.
	   ``I don't believe one word he says,'' said Carlos Alvarez, a
leader of the left-leaning Frepaso party, one of two that make up
the Alliance opposition.
	   Menem's announcement brings to a close an issue that has gripped
Argentina for most of the year.
	   The months of Menem re-election talk had caused a rift in his
party, particularly with his rival for the presidential nomination,
Buenos Aires Governor Eduardo Duhalde, and stalled many of the
country's top legislative efforts, including tax and labor code
reforms.
	   ``This ends the the internal political fighting,'' said Antonio
Cafiero, a Peronist senator and top party official.
	   Menem had remained tight-lipped of his intentions, while
allowing aides to speak openly of holding referendums to
demonstrate his popular support.

Expelled aid groups warn of epidemics in Kabul
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Aid groups expelled from the Afghan capital by the
Taliban religious militia warned Tuesday of the risk of epidemics,
and insisted they be allowed to resume work -- but on their own
conditions.
	   Thirty-eight international aid groups pulled out of Kabul
Monday, following a Taliban edict for them all to move into a
dilapidated dormitory on the outskirts of the capital, or leave the
country.
	   Representatives of six French groups held a news conference in
Paris, and said that Taliban troops turned up Monday, without
notification, at aid centers and workers' homes.
	   They said they were forced to leave immediately, and that the
centers were boarded up.
	   ``One million Afghans are now without humanitarian aid and the
consequences will be felt immediately,'' said Alain Boinet, of the
aid group Solidarites.
	   ``There are risks of epidemics, deaths, and people fleeing the
area en masse.''
	   Boinet said cholera was the main threat to the population,
especially in the summer season, and that there had already been
outbreaks in the north of the country.
	   Jacky Mamou, president of Doctors of the World, urged the
Taliban authorities ``to reflect well on what has happened and the
risks in coming weeks and months.''
	   ``We are completely open to a renewal of dialogue. But we want
direct dialogue,'' he said. ``We will not accept any constraints,
or anything other than total access.''
	   Most of the aid workers fled to neighboring Pakistan.
	   The United Nations and the Red Cross did not fall under the
Taliban edict, and say they have no immediate plans to withdraw
their staff from the Afghan capital.
	   The aid groups provided subsidized food, clean water, medicine
and clothes and were repairing neighborhoods heavily damaged by
civil war.
	   Among the international groups that pulled out were Save the
Children, Care International and Children in Crisis.
	   The French groups were Doctors Without Borders, Doctors of the
World, Action against Hunger, ACTED, Pharmacists Without Borders,
and Solidarites.
	   Two weeks ago, the Taliban ordered the aid groups to relocate to
dormitories once used by students of Kabul's technical schools. The
battered buildings have been empty since Islamic insurgents swept
Afghanistan's communists from power in 1992.
	   Aid workers refused to move, voicing security concerns and
saying they couldn't afford to refurbish the dormitories.
	   Relations between the Taliban army and international aid groups
have been strained since 1996 when the religious militia swept into
Kabul, and imposed its harsh version of Islamic law.

Mandela visits Brazil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ South African President Nelson Mandela
signed trade agreements with Brazilian President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso on Tuesday, the second day of an official visit.
	   During an open-air lunch in the gardens of the Alvorada
presidential residence, Mandela and his newlywed Graca Machel were
treated to a show of Brazilian folklore.
	   Mandela and his wife arrived in the capital Brasilia, Monday
evening for a brief visit before heading to Argentina, where he
will attend the July 24 Mercosur Presidential Summit.
	   Mercosur is the customs union composed of Brazil, Argentina,
Uruguay and Paraguay.
	   In 1997 Brazil chalked up a dlrs 30 million surplus in its dlrs
700 million trade with South Africa. Brazil's chief exports to
South Africa are coffee, orange juice and soybeans. Its principal
imports from that country include diamonds, metals and gold.
	   Before leaving for Argentina on Wednesday, Mandela will visit
Congress. He may also meet with Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the
presidential candidate of the leftist Workers Party.

Don't look for McGwire-Griffey-Bonds vs. world soon

 &UR; Eds: will be updated with Italy-China game. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A modern day Murderers' Row of McGwire, Griffey and
Bonds, backed by pitching from Maddux, Glavine and Cone will not be
taking on the world for several years, if at all.
	   Plenty of financial aspects need to be ironed out before U.S.
Major League players participate in the Olympics or other
international events, the head of the sport's world governing body
said Tuesday.
	   ``They have their long league season. It's not possible to bring
the major leaguers in without the right accords,'' said
International Baseball Association President Aldo Notari in a
telephone interview from Florence.
	   ``I am talking about economic values. There are huge interests
involved in their league.''
	   Notari met on Monday with Paul Beeston, Major League baseball's
chief operating officer, and Donald Fehr, head of the players'
union, to discuss the issue.
	   ``If the owners can reach an agreement with the players first,
then we can make progress,'' Notari said.
	   Notari was in Florence for the opening game Tuesday night of the
World Championships , with Italy facing first-time participant
China.
	   The other 14 teams see action Wednesday, including defending
champion Cuba against Spain, and the United States _ with a roster
filled with collegiate players _ against the Netherlands.
	   Notari ruled out major leaguers playing at the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney, Australia, which overlap with the baseball playoffs. But he
said players from the AAA minor leagues will be in Sydney.
	   These championships are the first to allow professional players.
But there is only a smattering, none from the majors.
	   ``And it is still going to be difficult for 2004 in Athens,'' he
said. ``We hope that by then that the problems will be resolved.
But everything still needs to be agreed.''
	   Sticking points include dates and security, Notari said.
	   ``The Olympics or worlds would be different and better with all
the best players. The panorama would be changed,'' he added. ``Not
just the United States would be strong. There's Puerto Rico, the
Dominican Republic, and others.''
	   Notari said he hoped the United States would bid to host the
2001 worlds. The last U.S. host was St. Petersburg, Florida, in
1974 _ the last time the country won the title.

Turkish villagers discover oil after earthquake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADANA, Turkey (AP) _ Villagers returning to their fields after a
deadly earthquake discovered oil oozing out of a water well,
officials said Tuesday.
	   They dug the well a day before a magnitude-6.3 quake struck this
southern region, Adana Gov. Oguz Kaan Koksoz told ATV television.
	   ``All they got at first was dirty water,'' Koksoz said. ``When
they came back, there was oil.''
	   Officials from the state-owned pipeline company, Botas, were
dispatched to the village of Soysali to inspect the well.
	   ``We are hoping that the reserve is quite a large one,'' said
Botas official Fatih Sen.
	   Although surrounded by a number of countries with large oil
resources, Turkey is poor in petroleum.
	   The June 27 quake killed 140 people and injured more than 1,000.

Hailing IMF loan, Russian government promises real reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS. RECASTS, UPDATES thruout with new material, quotes,
analysis, CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government vowed Tuesday to ignore resistance
from parliament and push ahead with an austerity program _ raising
hopes that a new international bailout may be the last one Russia
needs.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said the government will impose
the economic reforms _ including spending cuts and tougher tax
collection _ by decree if necessary.
	   The reforms were demanded by the International Monetary Fund as
a condition for a new dlrs 11.2 billion loan approved Monday.
	   The first payment, expected to arrive later this week, will go
directly to the Central Bank and is intended largely to assure
investors and the markets that Russia can pay its bills and defend
its currency if necessary.
	   The loan _ part of a package expected to reach dlrs 17 billion
this year and next _ is the latest in a series Russia has received
since post-Soviet economic reforms began in 1992.
	   Past loans have been used to stall for time and temporarily prop
up Russian markets, while fundamental problems went unresolved.
	   Kiriyenko says he's committed to changing that.
	   ``What is important, both for the (International Monetary) Fund
and for ourselves, is ... balancing our expenses and revenues,''
Kiriyenko said, referring to the key problems of Russia's budget
deficit and abysmal tax collections.
	   ``The fund's loan is only one part of the (austerity) program,''
he said at a news conference. ``All the main things we have to do
ourselves, here in Russia.''
	   Kiriyenko's main stumbling block is the Communist-dominated
lower house of parliament, or the State Duma, which has
consistently blocked government reforms.
	   Former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin appeared eager to find
compromises with the Communist opposition in parliament and
demonstrated little aptitude for economic reform. However,
Kiriyenko _ a 35-year-old technocrat named premier in March _
appears less interested in compromises and more in pushing economic
reforms.
	   After parliament approved plans to raise only about one-third of
new revenues the government sought, Kiriyenko and President Boris
Yeltsin issued decrees last weekend raising property taxes and
import duties and expand a value-added tax to cover a wider range
of goods.
	   Kiriyenko said he was prepared to bypass parliament again to
push through the austerity program, which is a condition for the
IMF and other lenders.
	   ``I still hope that at least two main bills ... those on the
income tax and the land tax, and possibly several more minor ones _
will be reviewed and approved by the State Duma,'' he said. ``If
not, we will have to continue to act through government decrees and
orders.''
	   ``The failure to adopt bills ... forces even harsher measures,''
Kiriyenko said.
	   The government's deputy chief of staff, Sergei Vasilyev,
cautioned that the new loan was ``not a cure-all.''
	   ``It simply wins us time for deep economic changes and
structural reforms,'' he said at a separate news conference.
	   Russia's economy spent most of this decade in a painful
recession. It was showing its first signs of modest growth before
the latest financial crunch hit in the spring, triggered by a
combination of the Asian financial crisis, a fall in world oil and
gas prices and the government's budget deficit.
	   After months in a tailspin, the markets began recovering when
the IMF loan package was first announced last week. But stock

Portugal's gas tanker drivers reject deal to end strike, harbor

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal's gas tanker truck drivers
rejected a deal Tuesday to end their two-day strike, while harbor
pilots began a 14-day stoppage which the government said could mean
``huge losses'' for the country.
	   Labor leaders representing the 2,000 striking tanker drivers had
persuaded government officials and employers to agree to review
written testing procedures _ the strikers' main demand.
	   But the striking truckers rejected the deal negotiated by their
leaders during a three-hour meeting, saying they needed more
information about the proposed review and further talks.
	   Meanwhile, some gas pumps in major cities were already running
dry, and the National Association of Gas Vendors said up to 70
percent of gas stations could be out of supplies on Wednesday.
	   Labor unrest also seriously disrupted imports and exports by sea
Tuesday _ the first of a 14-day stoppage by the country's 80 harbor
pilots who are responsible for steering large vessels into ports.
	   The pilots, whose action effectively closed ports to cargo
ships, want a 5 percent pay hike, a risk subsidy and revised career
scales in addition to the right to set their own working
conditions.
	   Recent legislation forced them under the supervision of higher
officials and Infrastructure Minister Joao Cravinho told reporters
that the government ``would not yield'' to the pressure.
	   ``Only in a banana republic can 80 individuals bend the country
to their corporate interests'' he said.
	   Cravinho said more than 90 percent of harbor pilots were under
investigation for corruption, extortion and criminal association
linked to their work before it came under senior supervision. Of
the 30 pilots at Lisbon port, 22 are currently suspended pending
the outcome of police investigations.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Four members of a U.N. observer mission to
Tajikistan were shot and killed while patrolling the north-central
part of the country, U.N. officials said Tuesday.
	   The report differed from that of Tajik officials, who said the
observers died in an accident when their car plunged off a cliff in
the Pamir Mountains about 170 kilometers (100 miles) east of the
capital of the Central Asian country, Dushanbe. The U.N. report
came too late for Tajik officials to comment.
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said information from U.N. officials
at the site confirmed the four had been shot and killed Monday
while on patrol near Garm, about 90 miles east of the capital. The
four, whose bodies were found Tuesday, included two military
observers from Poland and Uruguay, a civilian affairs officer from
Japan and a Tajik interpreter.
	   The U.N. special representative for Tajikistan, Jan Kubis,
recalled all field teams to Dushanbe and was in contact with the
president and opposition groups to ensure those responsible were
brought to justice, Eckhard said.
	   ``The members of the Security Council condemn this murder,''
council President Sergey Lavrov of Russia said after the council
was briefed on the situation.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan was ``deeply depressed'' about the
deaths and condemned them, Eckhard said. Annan repeated that
security of U.N. personnel rests with host countries.
	   About 70 U.N. observers are stationed in Tajikistan to monitor
provisions of a peace deal reached last year that ended the former
Soviet republic's civil war.

 &UR; Netanyahu wants several issues discussed int talks &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Tuesday he wanted Israeli-Palestinian negotiations over an American
peace proposal to include other issues besides a long overdue
Israeli troop withdrawal.
	   The Palestinians have said they agreed to enter the latest round
of direct talks with the understanding that only two issues _ the
scope of a West Bank troop withdrawal and the PLO covenant _ would
be on the agenda.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat complained that no progress had
been made in the first 48 hours of talks with Israel. ``Until now,
nothing has come out of all the sessions that have been held,
nothing that can give any positive indication of improving their
(the Israelis') position,'' Arafat said.
	   Netanyahu however said he was determined to reach an agreement.
	   The direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians
began on Sunday at the urging of the United States, which has said
it has exhausted its role as a mediator.
	   The Palestinians have been attending the talks reluctantly,
setting a week's time limit and saying they would not accept any
changes in the U.S. proposal for a 13 percent pullback that was
first made in January.
	   But Netanyahu said in an interview with Israel TV that there
were more issues, such as the extradition of suspects and reduction
of the Palestinian police force, that he wanted discussed. ``There
are at least eight or nine other issues and I want specific answers
on all of them,'' he said.
	   ``When the Americans came out with their proposal ... it was
very specific about one thing only, the percentages of a withdrawal
which Israel is not willing to carry out in the next redeployment.
It wasn't clear what, if anything, would happen with the third
withdrawal. It wasn't clear or specific at all regarding the
obligations of the Palestinians, and we have advanced greatly on
these issues since then and we are trying to complete them,'' he
said.
	   In the first two sessions Sunday and Monday, Israel proposed
that only 10 percent of the land be handed over to full Palestinian
control, while the remaining 3 percent be declared a nature reserve
with a ban on construction.
	   ``We rejected the proposals,'' said Palestinian negotiator
Hassan Asfour. ``We are not here to negotiate with the Israelis. We
are here to hear from them a `yes' to the American initiative.''
	   Netanyahu referred to the proposal in an interview with Israel
TV as a ``bridging concept which came up between ourselves and the
United States some time ago,'' but would not elaborate on the
specifics.
	   Both Arafat and Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
consulted with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Tuesday and Israel
radio reported that Israel asked Mubarak to pressure the
Palestinians to take a more flexible position on the process.
	   Negotiators from both sides were meeting at a kibbutz outside
Jerusalem for further talks Tuesday.
	   Despite the ongoing deadlock, far-right members of Netanyahu's
government, apparently concerned that the prime minister would
eventually agree to a 13 percent pullback, threatened to topple the
government.
	   Chief among those threatening to leave were Cabinet hawk Ariel
Sharon, considered most capable of leading a right-wing revolt, and
Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan, leader of the far-right Tsomet
Party.
	   Eitan said he would quit the coalition if Netanyahu handed over
more than 7 percent of the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu's coalition has 61 legislators in the 120-seat
parliament. A departure of Tsomet, which has five lawmakers, would
rob Netanyahu of his parliamentary majority.
	   Netanyahu's critics have said he has been avoiding a decision on
a troop pullback for months _ even at the cost of alienating the
United States _ because he fears losing power.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's coaching carousel continues to spin, with
Cesare Maldini officially out as head of the national soccer team,
the federation announced Tuesday.
	   Maldini and federation president Luciano Nizzola met in Turin on
Saturday and agreed to the change. Nizzola will decide on a
successor ``in the coming days,'' a statement from his office said.
	   Newspaper reports Tuesday said Dino Zoff, former 'keeper and
captain of the Azzurri and now in Serie A club Lazio of Rome's
front office, will be hired as coach this week, the third person to
hold the post in 19 months.
	   A federation spokesman declined to comment.
	   Maldini, whose contract expires at the end of the year, has been
offered another position with the national soccer body.
	   Maldini took over from Arrigo Sacchi _ who was sent packing in
part because of a dismal 1996 European Championships _ in December
1996. Under Maldini, Italy scraped into the World Cup finals
through a two-game playoff and lost to eventual champion France in
the quarterfinals on penalty kicks.
	   During his tenure, the team had 11 wins, 7 draws and one loss _
2-0 to England in an exhibition match last year _ while scoring 30
goals and allowing 12.
	   He was widely criticized in Italy for relying on tactics that
were too defense-minded.
	   Maldini, on vacation in Tuscany, was tight-lipped.
	   ``Talk about the national soccer team? I don't need to issue
statements, so I will not talk about that matter,'' he told the
ANSA news agency hours before the official announcement was made in
Rome.
	   Zoff, also a candidate to replace Sacchi in 1996, captained
Italy to its last major triumph, the 1982 World Cup title. He
played in a record 112 games for the country.
	   He has had brief stints as coach of Lazio and Juventus of Turin
in Serie A.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia - After some of the heaviest fighting in
weeks, a senior U.S. envoy stepped up efforts Tuesday to cobble
together peace talks in Kosovo, admitting that progress has been
slow.
	   Albanian sources reported continued fighting near the strategic
central town of Orahovac.
	   The fighting around Orahovac has cast doubt on the possibility
of a negotiated settlement between Serbia, which dominates what
remains of Yugoslavia, and the independence-minded Albanians who
make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, who acts as
a go-between, met with Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate ethnic Albanian
leader, a day after he conferred with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic in Belgrade.
	   While no details were available on Hill's talks with Milosevic,
Zoran Lilic, a top aide, said Yugoslavia was ready to offer the
highest level of autonomy to the Kosovo Albanians.
	   But he said Yugoslavia expects further efforts from all
international organizations and particularly from the United
States, which, he claimed, has a lot of influence on the Kosovo
Albanians.
	   Before meeting Rugova, Hill indicated that no quick solution to
the Kosovo crisis was in sight. Asked if progress had been made, he
said, ``That would be too strong but we are trying.''
	   ``There are a number of issues related to the political track we
are working on,'' he added without elaboration.
	   Rugova's main party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, on Tuesday
condemned what it called the ``violence and massacre by Serb forces
in Orahovac,'' which appeared largely under Serb control.
	   On Monday, Rugova declared that all Kosovo Albanian political
parties would unite ``in the next few days'' in a coalition
government. But it was unlikely the rebels would accept the
self-styled government's authority.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Serb police and ethnic Albanian rebels were
reported to have clashed near Orahovac for a fourth day.
	   Serb authorities escorted reporters to the southern edge of
Orahovac on Monday to see weapons captured from the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which launched a strong attack there Saturday.
	   But Serb escorts refused to allow reporters into the center of
town, saying Albanian snipers were still firing at police. In the
distance, smoke billowed from fires in the area, suggesting the
conflict there was not quite over.
	   On Tuesday, the Kosovo Information Center, which is close to
ethnic Albanian politicians, claimed Serb forces were still
shelling KLA positions in Orahovac on Tuesday and that fighting was
also raging in outlying villages.
	   The center said at least 36 Albanians had been killed, including
women and children. State radio in Tirana, Albania, reported
Tuesday evening that eleven dead were still lying in the streets.
	   Late Monday police brought 12 bodies to a morgue in Prizren, 75
kilometers (45 miles) south of Pristina, apparently people killed
in the fierce fighting around Orahovac, the center said.
	   It also reported that some 250 ethnic Albanians had been taken
to Prizren from Orahovac, many of them women and children, in the
past three days. Police started releasing them in groups on Tuesday
following interrogation.
	   But Albanian state radio said that of 200 Albanian men held in a
prison in Prizren, 20 were released on Tuesday, and one of them
reportedly said that those still in prison were in serious
condition.
	   Earlier in the day, the Albanians claimed about 100 ethnic
Albanians had been detained in a police crackdown in Prizren, but
it was not clear if they were part of the 200 or so prisoners.
	   And the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said Albanian gunmen
attacked and lead and zinc mine 32 kilometers (20 miles) west of
Pristina late Monday but were driven off by security guards.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed.
	   House-to-house battles in Orahovac forced as many as 25,000
residents from the town and its surroundings to the KLA-controlled
town of Malisevo, 16 kilometers (10 miles) to the north, according
to local media reports.
	   Serb police say as many as 600 KLA rebels tried to seize the
town, capturing and shutting down a power plant before moving on to
the post office. The police forced them to flee by car or by foot,
leaving weapons behind.

Canada escalates effort to expel suspected war criminals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Criticized in the past for lax pursuit of war
criminals, Canada on Tuesday announced a five-fold increase in
funding to root out Nazi-linked suspects and immigrants accused of
modern-day war crimes.
	   The government said it will allocate dlrs 46.8 million (dlrs 31
million U.S.) over three years to strengthen efforts to bring war
criminals to justice.
	   The funds will enable the Justice Department to open new
investigations of World War II cases and allow the Immigration
Department to deport scores of people suspected of crimes in modern
conflicts. The two departments' war-crimes units will work together
more closely.
	   Jewish organizations have denounced Canada's past efforts to
track down Nazi war criminals. The new initiative appeared to be
part of a series of steps to rebut such charges.
	   ``Canada is not a safe haven for war criminals,'' Justice
Minister Anne McLellan said in announcing the funding.
	   Since 1987, the government has investigated 1,571 suspected war
criminals from World War II. Ninety cases are being actively
pursued, and deportation proceedings are under way in nine of the
cases.
	   About one-fourth of the new money will go toward dealing with
World War II cases. The rest goes to the Immigration Department to
help it rid Canada of an estimated 320 suspects from more recent
conflicts, ranging from Rwanda to the former Yugoslavia.
	   According to an Immigration Department report, members of death
squads, torturers and individuals accused of genocide have entered
Canada in recent years.
	   ``Let it be clear to war criminals and all those involved in
crimes against humanity who have fled to Canada that we are
determined to remove them from Canadian soil,'' said Immigration
Minister Lucienne Robillard.
	   Amendments to Canada's Extradition Act, introduced in Parliament
in May, are designed to ease extradition of suspected war criminals
for trial either in another country or before an international
tribunal.
	   In the 1980s and early 1990s, Canada made a few unsuccessful
attempts to prosecute suspected World War II war criminals.
Starting in 1995, the government shifted its strategy, seeking
instead to strip suspected war criminals of their citizenship and
deport them on grounds they concealed information about their past
when they entered Canada.
	   Of the 14 cases initiated since 1995, three suspects left the
country before deportation was ordered, two suspects died before
completion of their cases, and nine other cases are pending.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ Moldova will pay its dlrs 215 million
debt to the Russian gas monopoly by selling bonds and handing over
some of the country's gas assets, the government said Tuesday.
	   Moldova is prepared to set up a joint venture between its gas
assets and Gazprom, Deputy Prime Minister Ion Sturza said at a news
conference. Gazprom would have a 50-percent stake in the venture
worth about dlrs 100 million, he said.
	   ``It is possible that we would issue dlrs 90 million bonds for
ten years and pass them to Gazprom also,'' Sturza said.
	   Gazprom slashed gas exports to Moldova in half on July 1 because
of the debts and threatened to cut supplies Aug. 1.
	   Of Moldova's debt, dlrs 75 million are penalties and Sturza said
those might be pardoned.
	   Moldova's breakaway Trans-Dniester region owes about dlrs 400
million to Gazprom but that debt is being negotiated separately.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Fires have killed 156 people in Moscow so far this
year, a news agency reported Tuesday.
	   The 9,500 fires in the Russian capital also caused 8 million
rubles (dlrs 1.3 million) in damages, ITAR-Tass said, quoting the
city's firefighting administration.
	   The report said that 36.9 percent of the fires were started by
smokers.

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Heavy rains sent rivers and streams
over their banks in eastern Slovakia, killing at least 23 people,
including at least five children, police said Tuesday.
	   At least 20 other people were missing Tuesday following the
flash floods, which swept across a dozen villages, washing away
bridges, homes and roads, police reported.
	   Slovak radio also said about 3,500 people were forced to seek
shelter on higher ground.
	   According to the private Markiza TV station, some 1,000 rescue
workers were in action to help people affected by the flooding.
	   A government spokesman estimated that damage to state roads and
the railroad system surpassed 100 million Slovak crowns (dlrs 3
million).
	   A Roma village of 500, built by the Svinka river, was completely
destroyed by the floodwater. At least five children were killed
there.
	   In the neighboring Czech Republic, the CTK news agency quoted
policeman Elemir Cuprak as saying that 11 of the victims died in
the county of Sabinov, 360 kilometers (225 miles) northeast of
Bratislava.
	   Cuprak said the worst damage occurred in the country's biggest
Gypsy settlement near the Jarovnice village, where water destroyed
most of the houses. He said panic caused by the floods makes
assessment of death toll and damages in the settlement difficult.
	   A 2-year-old child drowned and two persons were missing near
Prerov, 400 kilometers (250 miles) northeast of Bratislava, CTK
said.
	   Slovak radio said the downpour began about 6:30 p.m. (1630 GMT)
Monday in northeastern Slovakia and that water levels in local
streams rose rapidly by up to six meters (yards), trapping victims.

Developing countries helped to line up intellectual property laws
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Developing countries will get help to bring their
laws on copyrights and other intellectual property into line with
an international accord by the Millennium, the World Trade
Organization said Tuesday.
	   The WTO and the World Intellectual Property Organization will
provide assistance to governments to prepare legislation, training
and institution-building, the two organizations said in a joint
statement.
	   The countries have until January 1, 2000 to conform to the WTO
Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights.
	   The accord sets new international standards for laws on
copyright, patents, trademarks and other intellectual property
aimed at preventing piracy and counterfeit goods.

Lost ranger returns home after 10-day ordeal in rain forest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ A forest ranger lost in the Guyanese
jungle for 10 days returned home this week, bruised and
mosquito-bitten but otherwise in good health.
	   Raymond Houston, 51, disappeared July 4 while helping teen
volunteers work on a Guyana Forestry Commission station about 90
miles (140 kilometers) southwest of Georgetown.
	   Houston, a 20-year veteran of the forestry commission, had gone
into the bush to find some students he thought were lost. He lost
his bearings in heavy rain.
	   Fighting off fatigue and mosquitoes, he hiked for days through
swamps filled with caimans and poisonous snakes. ``Once, I was so
tired I slept in a swamp holding on to a tree,'' Houston said. ``I
prayed a lot and asked God for sustenance.''
	   He stumbled out of the jungle Wednesday at a logging camp 20
miles away. He was treated for dehydration and hundreds of insect
bites before being brought home on Sunday.

Russian, German defense ministers discuss Kosovo, other issues

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new quotes, more details on talks. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian and German defense ministers agreed
that a political solution is needed to end the crisis in the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo, a news agency reported Tuesday.
	   The two ministers held talks in the Black Sea resort of Sochi,
touching on Kosovo, defense technology cooperation and other
issues, the Interfax news agency said.
	   ``The Kosovo situation is developing extremely unfavorably,''
said Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev. ``It is most important
to get representatives of the conflicting sides to the negotiating
table through joint efforts.''
	   Russia and Germany have many similar views on Kosovo, although
Germany has ``its own accents,'' said German Defense Minister
Volker Ruehe. ``A political solution to the problem is needed.''
	   Sergeyev said tensions in Kosovo threaten peace and stability
throughout the Balkans. He said the Kosovo Liberation Army is
receiving reinforcements and that this jeopardizes attempts to
settle the conflict.
	   Ruehe noted that officials from Germany and Russia are working
on the development of a new An-70 cargo plane, and their
recommendations are expected by late September.
	   Russia and Germany plan joint paratrooper exercises next year,
he said.

Russian security agency says dispute with South Korea over
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service believes
that the recent spy dispute with South Korea is over, a spokesman
said Tuesday.
	   The dispute began July 4 when Russia ordered the expulsion of a
South Korean diplomat on espionage charges. His alleged Russian
contact was arrested for treason.
	   South Korea retaliated by expelling a Russian diplomat in Seoul.
	   The two countries then agreed to limit the number of
intelligence agents assigned to one another's diplomatic missions.
	   ``We exchanged blows, which was not too pleasant,'' said Yuri
Kobaldze, spokesman for the Foreign Intelligence Service.
	   ``But today, I think the two parties have calmed down and
realized that no spy scandals or expulsions should stand in the way
of the normal development of bilateral relations,'' he said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The spy incident ``can be considered to be over,'' he said.
	   The dispute was the most serious between Russia and South Korea
since the former adversaries opened formal diplomatic relations in
1990. The former Soviet Union was a longtime ally of Seoul's rival,
communist North Korea.

In-flight row with unruly passengers prompts unscheduled landing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ An unruly passenger aboard a British
charter plane carrying vacationers to Turkey early Tuesday prompted
the pilot to make an unscheduled landing in Bucharest, airport
officials said.
	   No one apparently was hurt in the incident.
	   The man, identified in a report by the Meiafax news agency as
Michael Ian Williams, 26, caused a commotion on board the Boeing
757 belonging to Flying Colors, a private British company, by
violent behavior first toward his companion, then to flight
attendants.
	   Sorin Stoicescu, the Otopeni airport commander, read the pilot's
report saying the man became abusive and tried to enter the
cockpit. But the pilots locked the door. It was not clear how he
was restrained. Mediafax said Williams was unarmed.
	   The plane, which took off from Manchester, England, was bound
for Turkey. It proceeded on its journey some time after the
incident, the officials said.
	   Williams was held by Romanian border police in a room at
Bucharest's Otopeni airport, pending the arrival of consular
officials from the British Embassy.
	   He was subsequently declared deported and put on a Romanian
Tarom flight bound for London.

Militant adviser: Islam bans killing tourists, civilians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A study by the man considered to be the
religious adviser to Egypt's most violent militant group says that
Islam bans killing tourists and civilians.
	   Ninety-six foreigners and hundreds of civilians have been killed
in attacks since extremists began a violent campaign in 1992 to
overthrow the secular government of President Hosni Mubarak and
install strict religious rule.
	   It was not clear if the study by Mohammed Mokhtar Mustafa would
have a significant impact on the militant movement, which has
appeared fractured in the wake of a government crackdown.
	   Muntasser el-Zayyat, a lawyer close to the insurgents, said
Mustafa is a senior member of a board of six men who lead al-Gamaa
al-Islamiya or the Islamic Group.
	   ``A non-fighting civilian, who is not involved in the least in
the actions of war or battle, is not to be targeted with death,''
Mustafa wrote in the introduction to a nearly 500-page book
entitled ``The Ruling on Killing Civilians in Islamic Law.'' Parts
of the study were obtained by The Associated Press Tuesday.
	   The study was written in London in late 1997 and is not expected
to be released in Egypt.
	   Mustafa, who lives in London, was not available for comment. He
was imprisoned in Egypt for seven years for taking part in the 1981
assassination of President Anwar Sadat.
	   ``Religious duty, injustice and the suppression our people face
are the causes which drove some Islamic groups to do what they
did,'' Mustafa wrote.
	   ``But while these causes justify allowing Islamic groups to
oppose their regimes, their Jihad (holy war) must abide by the
rules of Shariah (Islamic law).''
	   Six members of al-Gamaa al-Islamiya murdered 58 tourists and
four Egyptians in a November attack on a Pharaonic temple in
southern Egypt.
	   The attack, which devastated Egypt's vital tourism industry,
shocked some of the group's leaders living in exile in Europe.
	   They called for a cease-fire in Egypt.
	   Rifai Taha, an exiled hard-liner believed to be al-Gamaa's
mastermind, said the group would target Egypt's tourism industry,
but not tourists.
	   More than 1,200 people, mostly police and militants, have been
killed in the insurgents' six-year violent campaign.
	   El-Zayyat has offered to mediate between militant leaders and
government officials, but the government has said it will not deal
with people it considers criminals.

Serb police claim victory over KLA in strategic town

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police and ethnic Albanian
rebels reportedly clashed near a strategic town in central Kosovo
for a fourth day Tuesday, and Albanian sources claimed at least 36
Albanians had been killed.
	   Meanwhile, a senior U.S. envoy stepped up efforts Tuesday to
cobble together peace talks in Kosovo, admitting that progress has
been slow.
	   Serb authorities escorted reporters to the southern edge of
Orahovac on Monday to see weapons captured from the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which launched a strong attack there Saturday.
	   Serb escorts refused to allow reporters into the center of town,
saying Albanian snipers were still firing at police. In the
distance, smoke billowed from fires in the area.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which is close to ethnic Albanian
politicians, claimed Serb forces were still shelling KLA positions
in Orahovac and that fighting was also raging in outlying villages.
	   The center said at least 36 Albanians had been killed, including
women and children.
	   The fighting cast doubt on the possibility of a negotiated
settlement between Serbia, which dominates what remains of
Yugoslavia, and the independence-minded Albanians who make up 90
percent of Kosovo's population.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with Ibrahim Rugova, the
moderate ethnic Albanian leader, a day after he conferred with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade.
	   No details on Hill's talks with Milosevic were available. When
asked before meeting Rugova if progress had been made, Hill said,
``That would be too strong but we are trying.''
	   Rugova's main party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, on Tuesday
condemned what it called the ``violence and massacre by Serb forces
in Orahovac,'' which appeared largely under Serb control.
	   Elsewhere, the Albanians claimed about 100 ethnic Albanians had
been detained in a police crackdown in Prizren, southwest of the
capital, Pristina.
	   The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said Albanian gunmen attacked a
lead and zinc mine 32 kilometers (20 miles) west of Pristina late
Monday but were driven off by security guards.
	   Late Monday police brought 12 bodies to a morgue in Prizren, 75
kilometers (45 miles) south of Pristina, apparently people killed
in the fierce fighting around Orahovac, the center said.
	   It also reported that some 250 ethnic Albanians had been taken
to Prizren from Orahovac, many of them women and children, in the
past three days. Police started releasing them in groups on Tuesday
following interrogation.
	   But Albanian state radio said that of 200 Albanian men held in a
prison in Prizren, 20 were released on Tuesday, and one of them
reportedly said that those still in prison were in serious
condition.

GM's Canada truck plant to be shut down by Wednesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSHAWA, Ontario (AP) _ Production at the last General Motors
plant still operating in Canada will be shut down Wednesday,
disrupting work on a new pickup truck, company and union officials
said.
	   The shutdown of the Oshawa truck plant is due to a shortage of
parts caused by two GM strikes in Michigan.
	   The plant is the lead assembly site for GM's new GMC Sierra and
Chevy Silverado pickup, a redesigned version of the company's
best-selling vehicle.
	   Company spokesman Greg Gibson said the parts shortage was
halting the final stages of production Tuesday afternoon. He said
work on preliminary stages would continue into the night, and the
entire assembly line was expected to stop early Wednesday.
	   About 3,800 people work at the truck plant. By Wednesday, 3,000
are expected to be laid off, while the others will be working on
non-production tasks.
	   GM had stockpiled parts to keep the Oshawa plant operating on a
reduced scale as technicians worked out the bugs prior to
full-scale production of the 1999 models. The new trucks were
supposed to start arriving in showrooms in September.

Report: Two Russian journalists kidnapped in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two Russian journalists were taken hostage and
held for several hours in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, a news
agency reported Tuesday.
	   Ethnic Albanian gunmen stopped a car carrying TV reporters Oleg
Safiulin and Oleg Galanov late Monday, forced them out of the car,
blindfolded them and escorted them to a nearby house, ITAR-Tass
said in a report from the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade.
	   After a several hours' interrogation, the journalists were
released, although their interpreter was still being held, the news
agency said, quoting Russian diplomats in Yugoslavia.
	   A reporter for the Russian newspaper Izvestia, Sergei Mitin, was
beaten by gunmen from the Kosovo Liberation Army on Friday,
ITAR-Tass said. The gunmen also seized Mitin's car.
	   ``Regrettably, Russian journalists heading for Kosovo do not
fully understand that the area is a high risk zone,'' an
unidentified Russian diplomat was quoted as telling ITAR-Tass.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Three strong explosions shook the
Macedonian capital and two locations near the Yugoslav border early
Tuesday, a day before the scheduled visit by NATO's top civilian
official to this Balkan country.
	   No group claimed responsibility for the blasts, which all
occurred around 3 a.m. (0100 gmt). They caused considerable damage
but no injuries.
	   But the blasts raised fears of unrest in Macedonia, which
borders Yugoslavia's volatile Kosovo province, where the majority
ethnic Albanians are seeking secession from Serbia, the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence
for Kosovo, claimed responsibility for a series of explosions in
January in Kumanovo and two other Macedonian towns populated by
ethnic Albanians.
	   There are fears that Kosovo fighting could spill over to
Macedonia. NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana is due in Macedonia
on Wednesday to discuss the Kosovo crisis with Macedonian
officials.
	   Fears of a broader Balkan conflict also prompted the United
Nations Security Council Tuesday to add about 300 troops to the
750-strong U.N. peacekeeping force already in Macedonia. The
council also agreed to extend the force's mandate until Feb. 28.
	   The majority of the new troops, 230, would be deployed at nine
new observation posts along the Kosovo and Albanian borders. In
addition, a reserve group of about 60 soldiers in two platoons
would patrol the ground and air.
	   The blast in the capital Skopje shattered windows at a downtown
publishing company and was so intense that it woke up residents
several kilometers (miles) from the scene.
	   ``The explosion was very strong, it woke us up and we all came
down to see what was going on,'' said Jovica Andjelkovic, a
37-year-old Skopje resident.
	   Later state radio reported that the second blast occurred in
front of the Macedonian army barracks in Kumanovo, 45 kilometers
(28 miles) north of Skopje. .
	   The third explosion a short time later damaged a locomotive of a
train passing through Tabanovci, along the border with Serbia,
about 2 kilometers (1.3 miles) north of Kumanovo. The state radio
said that the railway traffic was halted for several hours.
	   Macedonian government has recently reported a number of
incidents involving arms smuggling for ethnic Albanian fighters in
Kosovo, but has repeatedly denied that the KLA is active in the
former Yugoslav republic.
	   Late Monday, however, Macedonian Defense Minister Lazar
Kitanovski announced he was sending more troops to the borders to
prevent KLA groups from using the country to smuggle weapons to
fighters into Kosovo.

Yemen tribesmen ambush ministers' convoy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Interior Ministry confirming attack

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Armed tribesmen on Tuesday opened fire at a
convoy carrying Yemen's interior minister and other high-ranking
officials, but all survived, the Interior Ministry said.
	   One of the officials, Gov. Naji al-Dhulaimi of al-Jawf province,
was injured in the right shoulder, the ministry said in a
statement. It did not give other details.
	   A police official said earlier Tuesday that al-Dhulaimi was
flown by helicopter to a military hospital in San`a, the capital,
along with six injured security guards.
	   Three of the guards suffered serious wounds, said the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The ambush was carried out by a few tribes together to protest
against a recent 40 percent government hike in fuel prices, a
tribal leader said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Interior Minister Hussein Mohammed Arab and Local Administration
Minister Sadek Amin Abu Ras, who escaped unhurt, returned to San`a
aboard the helicopter that ferried the injured.
	   The head of the national security organization, Ghaleb al-Qams,
was among those in the convoy, which was attacked in the hills that
straddle the provinces of al-Jawf and Marib. The oil rich region is
170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of San`a.
	   The attackers hid behind rocks in the mountainous terrain and
began shooting as soon as the convoy of eight cars appeared, said
the tribal leader.
	   The ministers had arrived in the region earlier Tuesday to
review government troops.
	   The troops were sent to quell unrest which started June 19 when
the government raised the prices of gasoline, kerosene and cooking
gas to meet International Monetary Fund demands to remove
subsidies.
	   Security forces cordoned off the area after the ambush and
helicopter gunships hovered in search of the attackers, witnesses
said.
	   In its drive for financial reform, the government has already
cut other subsidies and stepped up privatization of
state-controlled companies.
	   An official death toll from the clashes has not been released,
but the Yemen Times newspaper said earlier this month that 52
people have been killed and 214 injured.
	   Tribesmen also have blown up seven pipelines in the area.
	   Large parts of Yemen are lawless, inhabited by tribes who do not
hesitate to use firearms in settling scores with rivals or to
express discontent with the government.

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain, (AP) _ Firefighters were optimistic Tuesday
that a four-day blaze that has charred 26,000 hectares (64,250
acres) of forest and crop land in Spain's northeastern Catalonia
region would be under total control within 24 hours.
	   Two thirds of the land affected was forest while the remainder
was scrubland and crops, mostly cereals, a regional fire department
spokesman said.
	   ``The flames are out but there are still burning embers that
could rekindle the fires if we are not very careful,'' Carlos
Fernandez said.
	   Reduced temperatures, wind changes and a more humid atmosphere
had aided the firefighters, although earlier forecasts of overnight
showers had been revised, Fernandez said.
	   Temperatures in much of Spain have reached 38 degrees Celsius
(100 Fahrenheit) on a daily basis for over a week, quickening the
spread of Catalonia's worst fire for four years.
	   The four-day-old blaze, centering around an area 100 kilometers
(60-miles) northwest of Barcelona, has forced the evacuation of
some 600 vacationers from campsites, country houses and holiday
complexes. There were no fresh reports of evacuations Tuesday.
	   Some 2,000 people, including firefighters, police and volunteers
joined the battle to extinguish the fire that started Saturday from
causes yet to be established.

Flash floods kill at least 23 people in eastern Slovakia

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Heavy rains sent rivers and streams
over their banks in eastern Slovakia, killing at least 23 people,
including at least five children, Slovak police said Tuesday.
	   At least 20 other people were missing Tuesday following the
flash floods, which swept across a dozen villages, washing away
bridges, homes and roads, police reported.
	   Slovak radio also said about 3,500 people were forced to seek
shelter on higher ground.
	   The private TV station Markiza reported some 1,000 rescue
workers were helping people affected by the flooding.
	   A government spokesman estimated that damage to state roads and
the railroad system surpassed 100 million Slovak crowns (dlrs 3
million).
	   A Roma village of 500 by the Svinka river was completely
destroyed by the floodwater. At least five children were killed
there.
	   The CTK news agency quoted policeman Elemir Cuprak in
neighboring Czech Republic as saying that 11 of the victims died in
the county of Sabinov, 360 kilometers (225 miles) northeast of
Bratislava.
	   Cuprak said the worst damage occurred in the country's biggest
Gypsy settlement near the Jarovnice village, where water destroyed
most of the houses. He said chaotic conditions caused by the floods
made it difficult to determine a death toll immediately.
	   A 2-year-old child drowned and two persons were missing near
Prerov, 400 kilometers (250 miles) northeast of Bratislava, CTK
said.
	   Slovak radio said the downpour began about 6:30 p.m. (1630 GMT)
Monday in northeastern Slovakia and that water levels in local
streams rose rapidly by up to six meters (yards), trapping victims.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ New U.N. health chief Gro Harlem Brundtland on
Tuesday started her promised revamp of the World Health
Organization by naming a much-changed top team.
	   The former Norwegian prime minister pledged that ``we will not
be losing time'' in implementing new programs to combat smoking
among young people and malaria. She promised ``urgent attention''
to the fight against AIDS.
	   A packed hall of WHO staff watched as Brundtland named her new
``Cabinet.'' Hundreds more apparently anxious workers silently
followed her speech in the corridors outside.
	   ``What we do here in Geneva and in the regional offices matters
very little if it does not lead to a difference on the ground,''
Brundtland said.
	   The 50-year-old WHO has faced criticism for being preoccupied
with internal problems and lack of focus. Outgoing Director-General
Hiroshi Nakajima, of Japan, was accused by opponents of bad
management and being a poor communicator.
	   At Brundtland's request, many senior managers ``made available
their posts.''
	   In their place, she named a team with members from all the WHO's
six regions. There are six women among the nine new senior
managers.
	   Germany's Michael Scholtz was recruited from pharmaceutical firm
SmithKline Beecham to take charge of the WHO's health technology
and drugs division.
	   ``We need the experience and the knowledge that is there in
private industry,'' Brundtland told a news conference later,
although stressing that WHO must be ``people-friendly.''
	   She stressed that raising funds for the agency must be a
priority.
	   Former Tunisian health minister Souad Lyagoubi-Ouahchi and U.S.
communicable diseases expert David Heymann, already with WHO, were
among other team members.
	   Brundtland's ``management skill and her dedication to the cause
of global health are already making a mark,'' said Donna Shalala,
U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services.
	   Shalala praised Brundtland's determination to combat smoking.
	   ``This is a serious sweep,'' said Daniel Warner, a specialist in
international organizations at the Graduate Institute of
International Studies in Geneva, calling the shakeup ``long
overdue.''
	   In New York, the Rockefeller Foundation announced a dlrs 2.5
million grant for Brundtland to recruit outside health experts for
the WHO.
	   Brundtland also announced a new code of conduct requiring senior
officials to disclose private sector interests such as
shareholdings and directorships, to send a ``clear message of high
standards.''
	   She is the third woman to take up a major U.N. post in the space
of a year, following human rights chief Mary Robinson and deputy
director-general Louise Frechette.
	   Brundtland was nominated as the health agency's director-general
in January. Her appointment was confirmed in May by its annual
assembly.
	   WHO organizes massive vaccination efforts, coordinates global
response to epidemics and fosters the widespread distribution of
medicines. It has more than 3,500 staff worldwide, some 1,300 of
them based in Geneva.

Mexico's Imsa, Brazil's CSN set up joint venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) _ Mexican conglomerate Grupo Imsa said
Tuesday it agreed to form a dlrs 300 million joint venture with
Brazil's Companhia Siderurgica Nacional.
	   The new company, CSN-Imsa Acos Revestidos SA, will manufacture
and distribute processed steel for construction and home appliance
industries in southern Brazil, Imsa said in a press release.
	   Operations are scheduled to begin in the third quarter of the
year 2000, with annual capacity estimated at 450,000 metric tons
(500,000 US tons).
	   CSN will have a 51 percent stake in the venture and Imsa 49
percent. The location of the manufacturing facility had not been
determined but was expected to be either in the Brazilian state of
Santa Catarina or the state of Parana, the company said.
	   CSN-Imsa Acos Revestidos will have capacity to produce 110,000
metric tons (120,000 US tons) of cold, rolled steel; 200,000
(220,000 US tons) of galvanized and galvalume steel, and 140,000
(155,000 US tons) of pre-painted steel.
	   Grupo Imsa's steel division, Imsa Acero, is the largest producer
of galvanized, galvalume and prepainted steel in Latin America.
	   CSN, based in the state of Rio de Janeiro, is the largest
integrated steel producer in Latin America with a total annual
capacity of 5.1 million metric tons of molten steel.

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ After years of conjecture about
apartheid's chain of command, a former Cabinet minister on Tuesday
detailed how former President P.W. Botha ordered the destruction of
a church headquarters.
	   Adriaan Vlok, who is seeking amnesty for violent acts he ordered
as Botha's law and order minister, said Botha dictated the Aug. 31,
1988, attack in Johannesburg.
	   Khotso House, home of the anti-apartheid South African Council
of Churches, was heavily damaged in the bombing. The blast injured
a few people but caused no deaths.
	   The bombing was a key element earlier this year in a court trial
over Botha's refusal to appear before the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, the panel investigating human rights abuses during
white minority rule.
	   Vlok told the commission's amnesty committee on Tuesday how he
met Botha twice in private to discuss suspicions that African
National Congress activists used Khotso House as a base of
operations.
	   ``Mr. Botha said it was not a house of peace anymore but a house
of danger,'' Vlok said. ``Mr. Botha said, `You must make that
building unusable. And whatever you do, you must make sure no
people are killed.''
	   Others, including a former national police chief, have alleged
that Botha ordered the bombing. But no accusation was as direct _
and from such a senior official _ as the one made by Vlok.
	   Botha has denied authorizing the bombing. Apartheid-era
government leaders claim such attacks were the work of rogue
operatives.
	   Vlok said he passed Botha's order on to Gen. Johan van der
Merwe, the former security branch chief and police chief.
	   ``Van der Merwe was more of an expert in this area, and we
decided to use explosives to damage the building,'' Vlok said.
	   Among those at Tuesday's hearing was Welcome Ntumba, 53, a
security guard who was wounded in the bombing and has not been able
to work since then.
	   Asked later if he forgave Vlok, Ntumba said: ``No. I'm still
angry. Where can I get money? It's 10 years ago.''
	   Vlok, the only apartheid-era Cabinet minister to apply for
amnesty to the Truth Commission, apologized for the attack.
	   ``I'm really sorry and I truthfully regret having done this and
I accept responsibility for covering it up,'' Vlok said.
	   Vlok also seeks amnesty for the bombing of the Congress of South
African Trade Unions headquarters in 1988, and a series of bomb
blasts at theaters showing the film ``Cry Freedom,'' which starred
U.S. actor Denzel Washington as anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko.
	   The commission can grant amnesty to those who confess fully to
politically motivated abuses committed during apartheid. President
Nelson Mandela's government, elected in 1994's first all-race
elections, created the commission in 1996.

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - European Union envoy David Hannay met
Tuesday with President Glafcos Clerides to discuss stalled peace
talks.
	   Hannay did not meet with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash,
who has refused to hold talks with the EU envoy. Denktash is
insisting that the international community first recognize his
breakaway state and that the EU end its discussions on admitting
Cyprus.
	   Tensions have been rising on the island following Turkish
warnings that it will prevent any Cypriot deployment of Russian
anti-aircraft missiles. Greece has warned that it will aid Cyprus
if Turkey takes military action.
	   Hannay said his talks with Clerides, the Greek Cypriot leader,
centered on peace talks ``and the increase in tensions in recent
weeks.''
	   Talks between Clerides and Denktash stalled in August when
Denktash first demanded recognition for his breakaway state and
that the EU end its talks with Cyprus.
	   Hannay criticized Denktash in his Monday arrival statement,
saying that the Turkish Cypriot leader ``prefers isolation to
dialogue and this is a pity.''
	   ``I have not known any international problem that has been
helped to be solved by not talking about it,'' he said.
	   Hannay addressed Turkish Cypriot businessmen Tuesday and urged
them to drop objections to Cyprus' entry into the EU.
	   ``Turkish Cypriots would be equal partners in Cyprus' EU
membership, getting a say in the development of EU's future,'' he
said.
	   Cyprus has been divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion sparked by
an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. A breakaway
Turkish Cypriot state in the north is recognized only by Turkey,
which maintains 35,000 troops on the island.

Council condemns NGO expulsion from Kabul
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout to UPDATE with council condemning Taliban move,
UN pledging to stay.
 &UR; With BC-Afghanistan-Aid Workers
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council on Tuesday condemned
the forced withdrawal of international aid organizations from the
Afghan capital and said it supported U.N. efforts to maintain
relief operations in their absence.
	   The council also repeated its condemnation of the Taliban's
``continued abuse of rights of women and girls, particularly in the
areas of health and education,'' said council President Sergey
Lavrov of Russia.
	   Lavrov's comments underscored the strained relations between the
United Nations and the Taliban religious leaders, who have imposed
a strict version of Islam in the 85 percent of Afghanistan they
control. But they also demonstrated the delicacy of the U.N. role
in the country.
	   Last week, the U.N. envoy to Afghanistan warned that patience
was running out with the Taliban and that the world body was coming
under pressure from donors to simply withdraw its 60 international
workers from the country.
	   But the U.N. humanitarian aid coordinator, Sergio Vieira de
Mello, has pledged to stay in Kabul and Afghanistan as a whole
despite the problems, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Tuesday.
	   The United Nations didn't fall under the latest Taliban edict,
which forced about 200 aid workers from 38 international aid
organizations to pull out of Kabul on Monday rather than move into
war-damaged student dormitories. The aid workers said they feared
for their safety at the dormitories, and didn't have the money to
make extensive repairs.
	   United Nations and the Red Cross, which also didn't fall under
the edict, would maintain their programs in Kabul using existing
resources, local staff and Afghan-based aid groups, Eckhard said.
	   Nevertheless, the absence of the international non-governmental
organizations, which implemented U.N. aid programs, and the
freezing of EU funds for new projects, ``will have a detrimental
effect on 400,000 people in Kabul who have depended directly on NGO
assistance programs for food, medicines and basic services,'' he
said.
	   To try to stave off the immediate effects, one expelled group,
Save the Children, delivered a month's supply of anti-diarrheal and
anti-cholera drugs to local hospitals, program manager Kurt Tjossem
said in a phone interview after crossing the border into Pakistan.
	   A prolonged pullout, he said, ``could be a devastating lesson to
be learned,'' by the Taliban, he said.
	   The 15-member Security Council ``condemned the measures taken
recently by the Taliban authorities which make it impossible for
most NGOs to continue their work in Kabul, which in turn hinders
the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the population of the
city,'' Lavrov said.
	   The council expressed their support of U.N. relief programs that
are continuing, Lavrov said in comments to reporters after the
council was briefed on the situation by de Mello.
	   The council also condemned the death Monday of two U.N.
employees in the eastern city of Jalalabad, Lavrov said.

Former presidential candidate declares new Nigerian party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A former presidential candidate Tuesday
declared the founding of a new political party, the first since
Nigeria's military ruler announced his transition to democracy
program.
	   Tunji Braithwaite said the primary concern of the newly formed
Democratic Advanced Movement would be to ensure that the rule of
law is upheld in Nigeria, a country where human rights and
political freedoms have often been prime targets of military
dictators. It would also push for better housing and improved
public schools, he said.
	   Braithwaite withdrew as a possible presidential contender for
the Grassroots Democratic Movement earlier this year, saying the
process was rigged in favor of the country's late dictator, Gen.
Sani Abacha.
	   Eventually, all five state-sanctioned parties, including the
Grassroots Democratic Movement, nominated Abacha for elections
initially slated for August.
	   On Monday, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar announced presidential
elections for early next year and promised a return to civilian
government in May 1999. He said any Nigerians were free to form
political parties.
	   Among other things, he also dissolved the five
government-sanctioned parties and canceled the results of elections
conducted during the Abacha years.
	   On Tuesday, government officials took over the head offices of
the five parties in the capital of Abuja, under the watch of armed
anti-riot police. No disruptions were reported.
	   Senior civil servants have been named to administer the offices
and watch over their assets, which have been confiscated by the
government.
	   Abacha's five-year dictatorship was marked by an abysmal human
rights record, corruption and neglect. He died early in June of a
heart attack.

<TEXT>
	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ Olympics chief Juan Antonio Samaranch
decried the doping scandal that has hit the Tour de France and
lauded race officials Tuesday for expelling the Festina team.
	   ``We want to fight the doping problem. The International Olympic
Committee's position is clear and we support the various
organizations fighting this problem,'' Samaranch said in Florence,
where he attended the opening game of the World Baseball
Championships.
	   ``We must condemn what has happened at the Tour de France and we
support the decisions taken by the Tour organizers,'' the IOC
president said.
	   The Festina cycling team, including top rider Richard Virenque,
was kicked out of the Tour de France Friday after the team's
director admitted the team had supplied banned substances with
medical supervision to improve performances.
	   The scandal widened Tuesday, with a Festina doctor saying his
riders were ordered by their manager to pay for
performance-enhancing drugs. In addition, it was reported that
customs officials found the banned drug EPO in a car of officials
from the Dutch team TVM in March.

	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Three strong explosions _ nearly
simultaneous _ shook the Macedonian capital and two locations near
the Yugoslav border early Tuesday, a day before the scheduled visit
by NATO's top civilian official to this Balkan country.
	   The explosions, which caused considerable damage but no
injuries, raised fears of unrest in Macedonia, which borders
Yugoslavia's volatile Kosovo province, where the majority ethnic
Albanians are seeking secession from Serbia, the dominant republic
in Yugoslavia.
	   No group claimed responsibility for the blasts, which occurred
around 3 a.m. (0100 gmt). But the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is
fighting for independence for the Serbian province of Kosovo, had
claimed responsibility for a series of explosions in January in
Kumanovo and two other Macedonian towns populated by ethnic
Albanians.
	   Fears of a broader Balkan conflict also prompted the U.N.
Security Council on Tuesday to add about 300 troops to the
750-strong U.N. peacekeeping force already in Macedonia. The
council also agreed to extend the force's mandate until Feb. 28.
	   The majority of the new troops, 230, would be deployed at nine
new observation posts along the Kosovo and Albanian borders. In
addition, a reserve group of about 60 soldiers in two platoons
would patrol the ground and air.
	   One of Tuesday's blasts shattered windows at a downtown
publishing company in the capital, Skopje, and woke up residents
several kilometers (miles) from the scene.

 &UR; GM to resume production at Mexican plant next week &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with GM reopening its Silao plant. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ General Motors Corp. said it will resume
production Monday at its Silao assembly plant in central Mexico,
ending a stoppage caused by the United Auto Workers strike in the
U.S.
	   In a news release Tuesday, General Motors de Mexico SA said
engine production would remain suspended indefinitely at its Ramos
Arizpe plant in the northern Mexican state of Coahuila, idling
2,091 workers. Ramos Arizpe's vehicle assembly operations were
unaffected.
	   The Silao plant, which makes Silverado and Suburbans, was closed
June 23 by a parts shortage. All three GM plants in Mexico were
closed July 6 for an annual two-week maintenance break.
	   GM said parts from alternative suppliers enabled it to reopen
the Silao plant.
	   ``The company will continue to evaluate weekly its ability to
maintain production at levels that parts inventories will allow,''
GM de Mexico said. ``The objective of GM de Mexico is to minimize
the effects of the strike in the United States on our workers,
suppliers, dealerships and communities where we operate.''
	   GM said Monday it began assembling pickups this week at the
Ramos Arizpe plant, where it also produces Cavaliers, Chevys, Chevy
Monzas and Sunfires.
	   It said its engine plant in the central Mexican state of Mexico
continued to operate normally.
	   GM's three Mexican plants employ 9,389 people. Its 2,255
employees at Silao were scheduled to return to work Friday.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Gro Harlem Brundtland, the new U.N. health chief
started her promised shakeup of the World Health Organization on
Tuesday by naming a much-changed top team.
	   The former Norwegian prime minister pledged that ``we will not
be losing time'' in implementing new programs to combat smoking
among young people and malaria. She promised ``urgent attention''
to the fight against AIDS.
	   A packed hall of WHO staff watched as Brundtland named her new
``Cabinet.'' Hundreds more apparently anxious workers silently
followed her speech in the corridors outside.
	   ``What we do here in Geneva and in the regional offices matters
very little if it does not lead to a difference on the ground,''
Brundtland said.
	   WHO at 50 has faced criticism for being preoccupied with
internal problems and lack of focus. Outgoing Director-General
Hiroshi Nakajima, of Japan, was accused by opponents of bad
management and being a poor communicator.
	   At Brundtland's request, many senior managers ``made available
their posts.''
	   In their place, she named a team with members from all the WHO's
six regions. There are six women among the nine new senior
managers.
	   Germany's Michael Scholtz was recruited from pharmaceutical firm
SmithKline Beecham to take charge of the WHO's health technology
and drugs division.
	   ``We need the experience and the knowledge that is there in
private industry,'' Brundtland told a news conference later,
although stressing that WHO must be ``people-friendly.''
	   She stressed that raising funds for the agency must be a
priority.
	   Former Tunisian health minister Souad Lyagoubi-Ouahchi and U.S.
communicable diseases expert David Heymann, already with WHO, were
among other team members.
	   Brundtland's ``management skill and her dedication to the cause
of global health are already making a mark,'' said Donna Shalala,
U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, who also praised
Brundtland's determination to combat smoking.

British Virgin Islands ease restrictions on U.S. horses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ The British Virgin
Islands will ease restrictions for race horses from the neighboring
U.S. Virgin Islands under an agreement signed Monday.
	   Previously, U.S. horses had to be put in quarantine for two
weeks before being allowed to compete at the Little A Racetrack on
the island of Tortola. The agreement eliminates the requirement.
	   British officials said they are considering a similar agreement
with Puerto Rico, another U.S. territory.
	   The changes come as the British Virgin Islands prepares for its
annual August Monday Festival race on Aug. 3.
	   The Little A Racetrack has just undergone a three year, dlrs 2
million renovation.

Yemen tribesmen ambush official convoy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Armed tribesmen opened fire Tuesday on a
convoy carrying Yemen's interior minister and other high-ranking
officials, injuring one official. Six security guards were wounded
in an ensuing gun battle.
	   One of the officials, Gov. Naji al-Dhulaimi of al-Jawf province,
was injured in the right shoulder, the Interior Ministry said. It
did not give other details.
	   The ambush occurred in the hills that straddle al-Jawf and Marib
provinces, an oil-rich region 100 miles (160 kilometers) northeast
of San`a.
	   Al-Dhulaimi and the wounded guards were flown by helicopter to a
military hospital in San`a, police said. Three of the guards were
reportedly injured seriously.
	   The ambush was carried out by tribesmen protesting a 40 percent
government hike in fuel prices, said a tribal leader, who spoke
only on condition of anonymity.
	   He said the attackers hid behind rocks in the mountainous
terrain and began shooting as soon as the convoy of eight cars
appeared.
	   Security forces cordoned off the area after the attack and
helicopter gunships hovered in search of the attackers, witnesses
said.
	   Interior Minister Hussein Mohammed Arab and Local Administration
Minister Sadek Amin Abu Ras escaped injury. The head of the
national security organization, Ghaleb al-Qams, was also in the
convoy.
	   The ministers went to the region to check on government troops
sent in to quell the unrest, which started June 19 when the
government raised the prices of gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas
to meet International Monetary Fund demands to remove subsidies.
	   In its drive for financial reform, the government has cut other
subsidies and stepped up privatization of state-controlled
companies.
	   An official death toll from the violence has not been released,
but the Yemen Times newspaper said earlier this month that 52

Man charged with murder in arson killing of three brothers

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in penultimate graf with comment from government

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A 23-year-old man appeared in
court Tuesday on charges of murdering three young brothers in a
firebomb attack during a week of sectarian violence set off when
Protestant marchers were stopped from parading through a hostile
Catholic neighborhood.
	   Thomas Robert Garfield Gilmour of Ballymoney denied the charges,
police said during a hearing in Belfast Magistrates Court. Gilmour
had no criminal record and denied being a member of any
paramilitary organization, police said.
	   The Quinn brothers _ Richard, 11, Mark, 10, and Jason 9 _ were
killed in a July 12 arson attack on their home in Ballymoney, 40
miles (65 kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   A number of other people are being held for questioning in the
case, but police declined Tuesday to give a specific number.
	   Gilmour was ordered to be jailed pending a further court
appearance on Aug. 12.
	   Police believe the family was targeted because the boy's mother,
29-year-old Chrissie Quinn, was a Catholic who lived with a
Protestant boyfriend.
	   The attack was the worst incident of violence which followed a
violent standoff between Protestant marchers and security forces
blocking them from parading through a Catholic neighborhood in
Portadown, 25 miles (40 kms) southwest of Belfast.
	   Stunned by the killings, some leaders of the Orange Order called
for an end to the confrontation between its marchers and security
forces. The numbers of protesters camped near the Drumcree Anglican
church has dwindled to a token presence.
	   In Newry, 35 miles (55 km) south of Belfast, an explosion in a
police station parking lot late Tuesday afternoon _ apparently
caused by a mortar shell _ caused no injuries.
	   Police, who believed the device was fired from the back of a
van, called in a bomb disposal team to examine an object lying in
the parking area at Corry Square station.
	   There was no indication of who was responsible. But mortars were
a weapon used by the Irish Republican Army, so suspicion fell on
dissidents who oppose the present cease-fire and the participation
of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party in Northern Ireland's new
Assembly.
	   Government minister Paul Murphy described the attack as ``a
cold-blooded and utterly despicable attempt to murder members of
the security forces,'' and said that those responsible ``showed a
clear and callous contempt for the safety of the people of Newry.''
	   Police and soldiers were inside the base at the time of the
attack, a Royal Ulster Constabulary spokeswoman said, but no one
was reported hurt.

Commission accuses ministers of protectionism in AIDS test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The investigative commission of a special court
accused former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and two of his Cabinet
members of contributing to France's AIDS-tainted blood scandal by
trying to keep an American AIDS test off the market, The Associated
Press learned Tuesday.
	   Fabius, former Social Affairs Minister Georgina Dufoix and
former Health Minister Edmond Herve were ordered on Friday to stand
trial for involuntary homicide in connection with their roles in
the scandal in the mid-1980s.
	   The charges carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison and
a total of dlrs 130,000 in fines.
	   All three claim they never knowingly approved the use of
contaminated blood in transfusions. They served from 1984-86 in the
Socialist government under President Francois Mitterrand.
	   The trial before the special Court of Justice of the Republic,
which will climax a six-year saga that shook France's public health
system, will likely not be heard before next year, according to
judicial sources who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   While some 500 deaths, mainly hemophiliacs, are linked to
transfusions with blood contaminated by the AIDS virus, the
ministers could be held accountable for only seven, the others
proscribed with the passage of time. More than 1,000 people were
contaminated.
	   The decision to send the officials to trial was based on the
conclusion that the three carried out a ``strategy of favoritism''
that prevented Abbott laboratories from introducing its AIDS
detection test, according to the document obtained by The AP.
	   ``The delaying action of the government ... was motivated solely
by the fear -- justified -- of the invasion of the French market by
the American competitor of Diagnostics Pasteur,'' the document
said.
	   Diagnostics Pasteur, of the Pasteur Institute, was at the time
perfecting its own AIDS test, eventually made available.
	   The government ordered AIDS tests for all blood donors in August
1985. But, reads the decision, authorities were aware of potential
contamination of blood products at the beginning of 1985,
``sufficient time for a rapid reaction ....''
	   The ministers also are taken to task in the decision for failing
to import expensive heat-treated blood free of the AIDS virus.
	   The decision charged that Fabius ``imposed from the start a line
of governmental conducted dictated solely by the industrial
imperatives of Diagnostics Pasteur.''
	   Four health officials have already been convicted in the drama.
	   The Court of Justice of the Republic, made up of 12 lawmakers
and three judges, hears cases involving government officials
charged with crimes committed while in office. It will be the first
time it has judged ministers.

US and Britain considering trial in the Netherlands under Scottish
</HEADLINE>
law &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with new material, recasts &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Ten years after the bombing of a Pan Am
jetliner, the United States and Britain are considering a trial of
two Libyan suspects in the Netherlands under Scottish law.
	   Col. Moammar Gadhafi has refused to release the two suspects _
both Libyan intelligence agents _ for trial in the United States or
Britain on charges of planting the bomb on Pan Am 103 that killed
all 259 passengers and crew members and 11 people on the ground in
Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.
	   However, he has hinted he would be willing to send them to a
third country for trial.
	   There was no immediate word whether convening a Scottish court
in the Netherlands or elsewhere would overcome Gadhafi's
objections.
	   ``We're looking at it, but I don't know that it can be done,''
President Bill Clinton said Tuesday. ``We've tried to find some way
that has real integrity that will work, but there are all kinds of
practical difficulties.''
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said ``the onus would
be on Libya'' to turn over the suspects if a Scottish court were
convened in a third country.
	   ``If Libya were to do that, then Libya would be complying, and
the families and the United States that have sought justice would
be getting the justice that has been denied so long,'' Rubin said.
	   A ban on travel to Libya, imposed by the United Nations in 1992
as a pressure tactic, has not been enforced systematically.
	   For example, President Blaise Camaore of Burkina Faso flew to
Tripoli on Monday without notifying the sanctions committee. And
earlier this month, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt visited
Gadhafi, who was recuperating from hip surgery. The United States
supported Mubarak's request for an exemption on the grounds the
trip had a humanitarian purpose.
	   Rubin insisted the proposal for a trial in The Netherlands was
not a concession to Gadhafi nor the result of violations of the
travel ban.
	   The two suspects _ Libyan intelligence agents Abdel Basset
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ were indicted in Scotland and
the United States in 1991 for planting the bomb that exploded Dec.
21, 1988.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Sandy Berger,
assistant to President Clinton for national security, telephoned
about 10 members of families of American victims to tell them about
the development.
	   ``This is the usual whitewash,'' Susan Cohen told The Associated
Press afterward. ``This is really appalling. For years, they have
given us all their reasons why an international trial will threaten
American justice. And now it looks it good to them.''
	   ``It's a collapse,'' said Mrs. Cohen, whose daughter, Theodora,
died in the terrorist attack. ``Why would Gadhafi agree to anything
unless it is in his interest? He will manipulate the situation to
his interest.''
	   But Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora died in the attack and who
represents other British relatives, said it was time to break the
impasse. ``Common sense dictates that something has to be done,''
he said.
	   Rubin said the U.S. ``bottom line'' is that ``the accused
perpetrators of this heinous crime must face justice before U.S. or
Scottish courts.'' And, he said, ``we are working to achieve that
goal.''
	   Cohen said Berger told the families this ``might be a way to
call Gadhafi's bluff.''
	   The Guardian, a British newspaper, said Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook and Albright would announce in the next few days that the
trial could take place in The Hague, the Netherlands.
	   The New York Times reported the trial may be held in the World
Court. This was denied by State Department officials.

Author arrested for publishing censored book on the Internet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The author of a banned book detailing
the Israeli navy's search for a lost submarine, was briefly
arrested by police Tuesday for breaking military censorship by
publishing sections of his book on the Internet.
	   It was the first such arrest in Israel for publishing
information on the Internet, a justice ministry official said.
	   Police searched the home of former naval officer Mike Eldar and
confiscated his computer and personal documents before taking him
in for questioning and then to a Tel Aviv Magistrates court.
	   The court ordered Eldar to remove the sections from his Internet
site, which he did in front of police. He was then released on
16,000 shekels (dlrs 4,500) bail, Israel radio reported.

Argentina's President Menem won't seek third term
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By KEVIN GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Ending months of speculation,
President Carlos Menem on Tuesday renounced his intention to seek a
third straight term in next year's presidential race.
	   The question of whether Menem would seek another term has
dominated national politics for most of the year, creating friction
in his Peronist Party and stalling important legislation.
	   A third term would have required a constitutional amendment or a
special Supreme Court ruling. His term ends Dec. 10, 1999, and the
constitution currently bars him from running again.
	   ``After a prolonged analysis, I have resolved to exclude myself
from whatever course of action to compete in 1999,'' Menem said,
flanked by his ministers, governors and other members of his party
at the presidential palace.
	   ``I don't want anything or anybody to interfere with the
objective of making Argentina a country that's worth living in,''
he said.
	   Months of Menem re-election talk caused a rift among the
Peronists, particularly with supporters of his rival for the
presidential nomination, Buenos Aires Gov. Eduardo Duhalde.
	   It also stalled much-needed tax and labor code reforms.
	   A push by Menem supporters to have him run again outraged
Duhalde, who considered himself the party's ``natural'' candidate.
	   ``This ends the internal political fighting,'' said Antonio
Cafiero, a top Peronist official.
	   Opposition leaders were skeptical about the president's
announcement.
	   ``I don't believe one word he says,'' said Carlos Alvarez, a
leader of the left-leaning opposition party, Frepaso.
	   Menem was elected in 1989 for a single six-year term. The
constitution was amended to allow him to run for a second four-year
term.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The author of a banned book detailing
the Israeli navy's search for a lost submarine, was briefly
arrested by police Tuesday for breaking military censorship by
publishing sections of his book on the Internet.
	   It was the first such arrest in Israel for publishing
information on the Internet, a justice ministry official said.
	   Police searched the home of former naval officer Mike Eldar and
confiscated his computer and personal documents before taking him
in for questioning and then to a Tel Aviv Magistrates court.
	   The court ordered Eldar to remove the sections from his Internet
site, which he did in front of police. He was then released on
16,000 shekels (dlrs 4,500) bail, Israel radio reported.
	   Eldar's book ``Dakar,'' named after the Israel submarine that
disappeared off Crete in 1968 with 69 Israeli sailors, did not pass
through Israel's military censor and sales have been banned for the
past year. An appeal is currently pending in court.
	   The book describes the search for the sub as ``not serious'' and
paints an unflattering picture of the Navy.
	   Eldar, now a journalist and author, told reporters after the
court session that it was his duty to ``to expose what this country
refuses to expose out of completely irrelevant reasons.''
	   The censor in Israel rules on the publication of news and
pictures on topics defined as security-related _ including
everything from oil supplies to immigration to government loans.

Don't look for McGwire-Griffey-Bonds vs. world soon

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Italy-China game.
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A modern day Murderers' Row of McGwire, Griffey and
Bonds, backed by pitching from Maddux, Glavine and Cone will not be
taking on the world for several years, if at all.
	   Plenty of financial aspects need to be ironed out before U.S.
Major League players participate in the Olympics or other
international events, the head of the sport's world governing body
said Tuesday.
	   ``They have their long league season. It's not possible to bring
the major leaguers in without the right accords,'' said
International Baseball Association President Aldo Notari in a
telephone interview from Florence.
	   ``I am talking about economic values. There are huge interests
involved in their league.''
	   Notari met on Monday with Paul Beeston, Major League baseball's
chief operating officer, and Donald Fehr, head of the players'
union, to discuss the issue.
	   ``If the owners can reach an agreement with the players first,
then we can make progress,'' Notari said.
	   Notari was in Florence for the opening game Tuesday night of the
World Championships, in which Italy trounced first-time participant
China 10-2. Italy's Massimiliano Masin pitched a complete game,
allowing just four hits.

strike, 5th graf on gas stations running dry; 10th and 11th grafs
on harbor pilots' dispute &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Gas tanker truck drivers Tuesday
rejected a deal to end their two-day strike, while harbor pilots
began a 14-day stoppage which the government said could mean ``huge
losses'' for the country.
	   Labor leaders representing the 2,000 striking tanker drivers had
persuaded government officials and employers to agree to review
written testing procedures _ the strikers' main demand.
	   But the striking truckers were not convinced by the deal
negotiated by their leaders during a three-hour meeting, and
rejected the proposal.
	   They asked for more information about the proposed review, and
further talks between union leaders and the government were
scheduled for late Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, many gas stations in the suburbs of Lisbon ran dry in
a wave of panic-buying late Tuesday. The National Association of
Gas Vendors said up to 70 percent of gas stations could be out of
supplies on Wednesday.
	   Labor unrest also seriously disrupted imports and exports by sea
Tuesday _ the first of a 14-day stoppage by the country's 80 harbor
pilots who are responsible for steering large vessels into ports.
	   The pilots, whose action effectively closed ports to cargo
ships, demand the right to set their own working conditions.
	   Recent legislation forced them under the supervision of higher
officials. Infrastructure Minister Joao Cravinho told reporters
that the government ``would not yield'' to the pressure.
	   ``Only in a Banana republic can 80 individuals bend the country
to their corporate interests'' he said.
	   The government held an emergency cabinet meeting Tuesday evening
and afterwards announced that it was temporarily suspending the law
requiring ships' captains to contract a harbor pilot to guide their
vessels into port. The measure effectively made the harbor pilots'
job redundant.
	   The Harbor Pilots' Union warned the move could endanger
shipping, especially in Lisbon where large vessels carrying crude
oil must maneuver around a sandbank at the mouth of the River
Tagus.
	   Cravinho said more than 90 percent of harbor pilots were under
investigation for corruption, extortion and criminal association
linked to their work before it came under senior supervision. Of
the 30 pilots at Lisbon port, 22 are currently suspended pending
the outcome of police investigations.
	   The pilots also want a 5 percent pay hike, a risk subsidy and
revised career scales.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Tuesday he wanted Israeli-Palestinian negotiations over an American
peace proposal to include other issues besides a long overdue
Israeli troop withdrawal.
	   The Palestinians have said they agreed to enter the latest round
of direct talks with the understanding that only two issues _ the
scope of a West Bank troop withdrawal and the PLO covenant _ would
be on the agenda.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat complained that no progress had
been made in the first 48 hours of talks with Israel. ``Until now,
nothing has come out of all the sessions that have been held,
nothing that can give any positive indication of improving their
(the Israelis') position,'' Arafat said.
	   Netanyahu, however, said he was determined to reach an
agreement.
	   The direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians
began on Sunday at the urging of the United States, which has said
it has exhausted its role as a mediator.
	   The Palestinians have been attending the talks reluctantly,
setting a week's time limit and saying they would not accept any
changes in the U.S. proposal for a 13 percent pullback that was
first made in January.
	   But Netanyahu said in an interview with Israel TV that there
were more issues, such as the extradition of suspects and reduction
of the Palestinian police force, that he wanted discussed. ``There
are at least eight or nine other issues and I want specific answers
on all of them,'' he said.
	   ``When the Americans came out with their proposal ... it was
very specific about one thing only, the percentages of a withdrawal
which Israel is not willing to carry out in the next redeployment.
It wasn't clear what, if anything, would happen with the third
withdrawal. It wasn't clear or specific at all regarding the
obligations of the Palestinians, and we have advanced greatly on
these issues since then and we are trying to complete them,'' he
said.
	   In the first two sessions Sunday and Monday, Israel proposed
that only 10 percent of the land be handed over to full Palestinian
control, while the remaining 3 percent be declared a nature reserve
with a ban on construction.
	   ``We rejected the proposals,'' said Palestinian negotiator
Hassan Asfour. ``We are not here to negotiate with the Israelis. We
are here to hear from them a `yes' to the American initiative.''
	   Netanyahu referred to the proposal in an interview with Israel
TV as a ``bridging concept which came up between ourselves and the
United States some time ago,'' but would not elaborate on the
specifics.
	   Both Arafat and Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
consulted with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Tuesday and Israel
radio reported that Israel asked Mubarak to pressure the
Palestinians to take a more flexible position on the process.
	   Negotiators from both sides were meeting at a kibbutz outside
Jerusalem for further talks Tuesday.
	   Despite the ongoing deadlock, far-right members of Netanyahu's
government, apparently concerned that the prime minister would
eventually agree to a 13 percent pullback, threatened to topple the
government.
	   Chief among those threatening to leave were Cabinet hawk Ariel
Sharon, considered most capable of leading a right-wing revolt, and
Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan, leader of the far-right Tsomet
Party.
	   Netanyahu's coalition has 61 legislators in the 120-seat
parliament. A departure of Tsomet, which has five lawmakers, would
rob Netanyahu of his parliamentary majority.
	   Netanyahu's critics have said he has been avoiding a decision on
a troop pullback for months _ even at the cost of alienating the
United States _ because he fears losing power.

Council approves 50 percent increase for Macedonia peacekeepers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS lede to recast &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Concerned that violence in Kosovo could
spill into neighboring Macedonia, the Security Council unanimously
approved a 50 percent increase Tuesday in the strength of U.N.
peacekeepers to patrol the border between the restive province and
the former Yugoslav republic.
	   The 15-member council agreed to add about 300 troops to the
750-strong U.N. peacekeeping force for Macedonia. The council also
extended the force's mandate until Feb. 28.
	   The increase brings the force _ which includes about 340
Americans _ close to its original levels in 1992, when it was first
deployed during the Bosnian war to prevent the spread of the ethnic
conflict in other parts of the former Yugoslavia.
	   Austria's U.N. ambassador, Ernst Sucharipa, noted that the force
has since been used to contain the violence that swept through
Albania last year after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes.
	   ``Today the focus has shifted again: The conflict in Kosovo
poses a new, grave threat to peace and stability in the region,''
he said, speaking on behalf of the European Union.
	   Ethnic Albanian separatists are fighting for an independent
Kosovo from Serb-led Yugoslavia. Hundreds have been killed since a
Serb crackdown in Kosovo began in February. Guns from Albania are
widely believed to have been smuggled across the border for the
Kosovo separatists to use.
	   In its resolution, the council called on member states to
respect an embargo on Yugoslavia, ``including Kosovo, of arms and
related material of all types and shall prevent arming and training
for terrorist activities there.''
	   The majority of the new troops, 230, would be deployed at nine
new observation posts along the borders with Kosovo and Albania. In
addition, a reserve group of about 60 soldiers in two platoons
would patrol the ground and air.
	   The bulk of the new troops would come from Norway, and Sweden
also pledged to continue contributing to the force. Funding will
come from the existing U.N. peacekeeping budget.
	   China's ambassador, Qin Huasun, said he wouldn't object to the
new mandate in spite of China's belief that ``U.N. peacekepping
operations should have a proper beginning as well as a proper
conclusion.'' He called for the peacekeepers to ``respect the
political independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,'' of
Macedonia.
	   In a July 9 letter, Macedonian Foreign Minister Blagoj
Handzinski endorsed Secretary-General Kofi Annan's recommendation
for an extended mandate as well as the option of a greater troop
presence.
	   The council didn't act on Annan's other recommendations, calling
for an increase in the number of military observers and civilian
police, but said it would consider the suggestions later.
	   The U.N. operation, formally known as the United Nations
Preventive Deployment Force, includes troops from six nations. They
are Denmark, Finland, Indonesia, Norway and Sweden in addition to
the United States.

 &UR; Yemen tribesmen ambush official convoy &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: EDITS, TRIMS. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Armed tribesmen opened fire Tuesday on a
convoy carrying Yemen's interior minister and other high-ranking
officials, injuring one official. Six security guards were wounded
in an ensuing gun battle.
	   One of the officials, Gov. Naji al-Dhulaimi of al-Jawf province,
was injured in the right shoulder, the Interior Ministry said. It
did not give other details.
	   The ambush occurred in the hills that straddle al-Jawf and Marib
provinces, an oil-rich region 100 miles (160 kilometers) northeast
of San`a.
	   Al-Dhulaimi and the wounded guards were flown by helicopter to a
military hospital in San`a, police said. Three of the guards were
reportedly injured seriously.
	   The ambush was carried out by tribesmen protesting a 40 percent
government hike in fuel prices, said a tribal leader, who spoke
only on condition of anonymity.
	   He said the attackers hid behind rocks in the mountainous
terrain and began shooting as soon as the convoy of eight cars
appeared.
	   Security forces cordoned off the area after the attack and
helicopter gunships hovered in search of the attackers, witnesses
said.
	   Interior Minister Hussein Mohammed Arab and Local Administration
Minister Sadek Amin Abu Ras escaped injury. The head of the
national security organization, Ghaleb al-Qams, was also in the
convoy.
	   The ministers went to the region to check on government troops
sent in to quell the unrest, which started June 19 when the
government raised the prices of gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas
to meet International Monetary Fund demands to remove subsidies.
	   In its drive for financial reform, the government has cut other
subsidies and stepped up privatization of state-controlled
companies.
	   An official death toll from the violence has not been released,
but the Yemen Times newspaper said earlier this month that 52
people had been killed and 214 injured.

Guyana president begins Venezuela state visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Guyanese President Janet Jagan began a
two-day state visit to neighboring Venezuela Tuesday with trade and
a contentious territorial dispute high on the agenda.
	   Jagan took a Venezuelan military aircraft to Caracas, where she
was welcomed by President Rafael Caldera and his Cabinet.
	   Venezuela and Guyana have worked hard to patch up their
century-old border dispute in recent years. Venezuela claims
two-thirds of Guyana, or the entire mineral-rich Essequibo region.
	   Jagan on Tuesday visited the tomb of Venezuelan independence
hero Simon Bolivar and was attending a special session of Congress.
	   Venezuela's foreign minister, Miguel Burelli Rivas, said the
leaders hoped to sign accords on trade, drug trafficking and the
environment.

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Weary of racially charged riots,
firebombings and angry rhetoric, politicians in Guyana are looking
for answers in Northern Ireland.
	   A delegation of legislators, lawyers and Information Minister
Moses Nagamootoo left for Belfast on Monday on a 10-day trip to see
how British-controlled Northern Ireland is working to heal decades
of Protestant-Catholic division.
	   In Guyana, a former British colony on the northeast shoulder of
South America, friction between people of African and East Indian
descent erupted into violence after Afro-Guyanese accused President
Janet Jagan's party of rigging the Dec. 15 election.
	   Leaders from other Caribbean countries brokered a shaky peace
last month. Politicians agreed to rewrite Guyana's constitution to
better balance power between the ethnic groups.
	   The Guyanese delegation will meet with Irish President Mary
McAleese, former Irish Prime Minister John Bruton and other
officials, said the Washington-based National Democratic Institute,
which is sponsoring the trip.
	   The Guyanese, worried that foreign investors have been scared
away by the ethnic violence, said they were looking for new
perspectives on such conflicts.

	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Nomar Garciaparra hit a three-run home run and
helped the Boston Red Sox and Pedro Martinez defeat the Cleveland
Indians 10-7 in Tuesday in the first game of a day-night
doubleheader.
	   Garciaparra's 17th homer capped a six-run sixth inning off
Dwight Gooden (3-5) and Eric Plunk as Boston beat the Indians for
the seventh straight time this season.
	   Martinez (13-3) was not his usual overpowering self. Averaging
9.9 strikeouts per nine innings entering the game, he fanned three.
Pat Borders was the victim twice, once on a bunt attempt that went
foul for strike three with two on and none out in the fourth.
	   In his previous start July 15, Martinez struck out nine in a
four-hit, 1-0 win over Cleveland at Fenway Park.

Mexican treasury secretary seeks bank reform to avert crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Treasury Secretary Jose Angel Gurria said
Tuesday that financial reform bills before Congress could prevent a
recurrence of Mexico's typical end-of-presidency crises.
	   Gurria told the National Agricultural Council that past crises
involved budget and current account deficits, unmanageable debt,
dependence on oil exports, inadequate internal savings and the use
of reserves to support an unsustainable exchange rate.
	   He said the government has attacked those problems through
spending cuts, diversified exports and a free-floating currency.
	   Proposed banking reforms are now stalled in Congress, largely
due to controversy over a measure to absorb dlrs 65 billion in bank
bailout funds as public debt.
	   But Gurria said it could ward off a crisis in 2000, when
President Ernesto Zedillo's six-year term ends. A series of
economic crises have coincided with the end of recent presidential
terms, making many Mexicans jittery about the end of his term.
	   ``This package (of reforms) seems to us to be the way to counter
vulnerability,'' Gurria said.
	   ``We have seen how expensive bank crises are; to allow the
system to collapse would have been five or six times more
expensive,'' Gurria added.
	   Absorbing bank debt would raise public debt to 42 percent of
gross domestic product from around 28 percent, but Gurria said it
would still be below levels of other industrialized countries.
	   The opposition-dominated Congress wants to audit the bailout
fund, charging that the bailout fund includes bad loans extended to
large debtors who could pay them back but don't.

Undercover officer testifies at dominatrix trial in Canada
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEWMARKET, Ontario (AP) _ An undercover police officer testified
Tuesday about his experiences in the home of a dominatrix charged
with running a bawdy house in a Toronto suburb.
	   ``It was getting to me,'' Constable Stephen Baird of York Region
police said of watching a woman spank a man with a bamboo stick.
``I was shocked that this person was getting hit... But there were
no cries.''
	   A police videotape was played in court as Baird described the
inside of Terri-Jean Bedford's home, equipped with eight theme
rooms, including a doctor's office, a kitchen, a schoolroom and a
downstairs dungeon.
	   During his first visit there as an undercover customer, Baird
told court he saw two woman slapping and humiliating a man
introduced as Arthur.
	   Naked from the waist down, except for a pair of women's shiny
thigh-high stiletto boots, Arthur wore a straitjacket and a leather
hood. He was chained to a pole, while the women taunted and beat
him, Baird said.
	   Baird only appeared uncomfortable when he recounted an incident
in the candlelit dungeon in which Morgan ordered him to pull down
his pants and underwear.
	   ``I pulled down my jeans ... I was wearing a Coors Lite T-shirt
that day _ and I was thankful for the length of it,'' he said.
	   Baird told staff at the bungalow on later occasions that he
preferred voyeuristic activities and simply wanted to watch.
	   Police raided Bedford's home in Thornhill just north of Toronto
four years ago. She catered to her clients' elaborate fantasies as
Madame de Sade _ and earned dlrs 100,000 (dlrs 75,000 U.S.) a year
doing so.
	   She and three others were charged but the case was dismissed
when it was ruled the charges were too vague and prosecutors
refused to specify what Bedford, 39, had done to warrant arrest.
	   The Ontario Court of Appeal overturned the dismissal and ordered
her to stand trial. The Supreme Court of Canada upheld that
decision last year.
	   A person is guilty of keeping a bawdy house if it can be proven
that prostitution or indecent acts occurred there but at the heart
of the case is the delicate question of what actually constitutes
sex.
	   Defense lawyer Alan Young maintains that although whipping,
spanking and fantasy role play may sexually arouse some folks, the
aim isn't sexual gratification.
	   Bedford, who could face a maximum of two years behind bars if
found guilty, is adamant nothing illegal occurred in her home.
	   ``No sex took place,'' she said outside court.

Court investigates legislators who cleared President Samper of drug
</HEADLINE>
charges &QL; 
 &UR; By JARED KOTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombia's Supreme Court is opening an
investigation into 110 legislators who voted two years ago to clear
President Ernesto Samper in connection with a dlrs 6 million
campaign donation from the Cali drug cartel.
	   Legal experts are debating whether the inquiry exposes Samper,
who steps down in August, to possible new criminal charges in the
scandal that crippled and discredited his presidency.
	   ``There is no legal precedent in the history of the country,''
said a top Supreme Court official who spoke on condition he not be
identified.
	   But the Supreme Court action, which follows a two-year court
review of documents and testimony relating to the 1994 Samper
campaign, was seen as an implicit statement that Samper should not
have been absolved.
	   ``In Samper's case the evidence was overwhelming. They proved
his responsibility,'' said retired former Justice Minister Enrique
Parejo, one of a handful of citizens who filed for the Supreme
Court review.
	   A House of Representatives dominated by ruling Liberal Party
loyalists voted 111-to-43 on June 13, 1996 to drop charges of
illicit enrichment, falsifying documents, electoral fraud and
cover-up against Samper.
	   With the vote Samper survived what Colombians called the ``trial
of the century.'' But his government was weakened and discredited
internationally. Convinced of his guilt, the U.S. government
revoked Samper's visa.
	   Many accused the representatives _ one of whom is dead and only
47 of whom remain in congress_ of acting out of political loyalty
to Samper or in return for political favors, government posts and
pork-barrel projects.
	   Former representative Heyne Mogollon, who led Samper's defense
in Congress, was called to testify Tuesday, beginning a process
expected to last from 6 to 8 months and which could lead to prison
terms of 3 to 8 years for legislators who are convicted.
	   But Mogollon did not arrive in court, and his testimony was
rescheduled for Wednesday.
	   Samper, who steps down August 7, has stood by claims he was
unaware of the drug money entering his campaign and did not
improperly seek to influence the legislators who investigated him.

Judge blocks execution of murderer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago (AP) _ A judge on Tuesday
blocked the execution of a convicted murderer in Trinidad and
Tobago, saying he has already been subjected to cruel and inhuman
punishment in prison.
	   Darrin Thomas, 29, was on death row for slitting a taxi driver's
throat in 1993. High Court Justice Peter Jamadar ordered his death
sentence overturned, saying Thomas had been jailed without
sufficient light, handcuffed during exercise breaks and given
inadequate food.
	   Government lawyer Russell Martineau said he would appeal the
ruling to the Trinidad and Tobago Court of Appeals.
	   Jamadar rejected defense lawyers' arguments that the government
must wait for the Inter-American Court on Human Rights to hear an
appeal by Thomas. Trinidad and Tobago has accused the court of
dragging its feet on such appeals and has said it will drop out of
an Organization of American States accord allowing them.
	   Trinidad and Tobago has led recent resistence in the Caribbean
to pressure by Britain to eliminate the death penalty in former
British colonies.

Marlins pitcher drops objections to restraining order

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Florida Marlins pitcher Livan Hernandez decided
that one day of court testimony about his personal life was enough,
and he dropped objections Tuesday to a restraining order sought by
his former girlfriend.
	   The order means Hernandez must have no contact with Alina
Elgarresta for at least a year.
	   Hernandez initially contested the order, then changed his mind
after testimony Monday in Miami-Dade Circuit Court by Elgarresta,
who said the 23-year-old pitcher physically abused her.
	   Hernandez's attorney, Manny Vazquez, noted that his client
pitched poorly in a 5-3 loss Monday night to Milwaukee after
spending the day in court. The attorney said Hernandez was eager to
put the case and his relationship with Elgarresta in the past.
	   ``What she wants is that Livan doesn't bother her anymore, and
he has no problem with that,'' Vazquez told Judge Amy Karan. ``He
wants to get on with his life.''
	   Elgarresta, 25, said she was surprised that Hernandez at first
contested the restraining order.
	   ``I feel sorry for him,'' she said. ``I hope he sees what he's
done.''
	   Hernandez would be subject to arrest for violation of the order,
which requires that he stay at least 500 feet away from Elgarresta
and have no communication with her. Such an arrest could result in
a sentence of up to a year in jail.
	   Hernandez could have agreed to the order Monday and prevented
Elgarresta's damaging testimony. Failing to do so may have been a
mistake, Hernandez's attorney admitted.
	   ``We didn't want to prolong this,'' Vazquez said. ``It was
draining to him. It has affected his professional life. It has
affected his pitching. He wanted to end it.''
	   A clause was included in the order allowing Hernandez onto the
Biltmore Golf Course, where he plays regularly. Elgarresta has a
home on the third hole, a coincidence that prompted chuckles in the
courtroom.
	   ``Obviously, Mr. Hernandez, if any balls are hit into her yard,
start with new balls,'' the judge said. ``I don't want anybody
going on her property to get balls or otherwise.''
	   Hernandez, last year's World Series most valuable player, began
dating Elgarresta in November 1997. She testified Monday that
before they broke up in June, he punched her, slapped her, kicked
her and pinned her down and plucked the hairs off her head
one-by-one.
	   Hernandez didn't speak in court, but afterwards he denied the
allegations.
	   ``Nothing happened,'' he said. ``I didn't hit her nor did I push
or scratch her. Everybody knows how I am ... and I don't do that to
a woman because I don't have the need to. ...
	   ``My worry is baseball, and it's affecting it a bit now because
I had this problem in court,'' he said. ``I feel good and content,
and I will go on with my career. About the woman, that's all
forgotten.''
	   While Elgarresta signed legal papers following the hearing,
Hernandez signed autographs for spectators in the courtroom. Many
of them cheered when he headed for an exit.

John Bland, three others withdraw from Senior Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN NADEL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ John Bland, who finished second behind Graham
Marsh in the 1997 U.S. Senior Open, withdrew from this year's
competition on Tuesday because his wife is ill.
	   Bland returned to his home in South Africa.
	   The 19th U.S. Senior Open, the fourth and final major on the
Senior PGA Tour, begins Thursday at the 6,906-yard (6,284-meter),
par-71 Riviera Country Club. A purse of dlrs 1.5 million and a top
prize of dlrs 267,500 are being offered.
	   Marsh, who beat Bland by one shot with a 72-hole score of 280 at
the Olympia Fields, Illinois Country Club, last year, is back to
defend his title. The 54-year-old Australian is in search of his
first victory since that time.
	   Among others in the field of 156 are co-favorites Gil Morgan and
Hale Irwin, Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Larry Nelson, Jay Sigel,
Peter Oosterhuis, Isao Aoki, Dave Stockton, Jim Colbert and Bob
Charles.
	   Tommy Aaron withdrew from the tournament on Monday due to a
sprained ankle, and Bud Allin and Jim Dent also pulled out Tuesday.
Allin withdrew due to illness, while Dent didn't give a reason for
dropping out.
	   Morgan and Irwin have dominated the senior tour.
	   Irwin, 53, has earned a tour-leading dlrs 1,735,250, and has won
four tournaments including one major _ the PGA Seniors
Championship. He also won the Ameritech Senior last weekend.
	   His lowest finish in 13 tournaments this year is a tie for
fifth.
	   Morgan, 51, ranks second on the earnings list at dlrs 1,325,793.
He also has four wins including two majors _ The Tradition and the
Ford Senior Players Championship. He has finished in the top 10 in
10 of his 15 tournaments this year.
	   Morgan finished second in the PGA Seniors Championship, while
Irwin was fourth in The Tradition and second in the Ford Senior
Players Championship.
	   Irwin is averaging 68.58 strokes per round this year and Morgan
69.80. No other player is averaging less than 70.
	   ``It's going to come down to who makes putts,'' Marsh said. ``I
would give myself a reasonable chance of playing well here. Whether
it's going to be good enough to win, I don't know.''
	   Marsh said there's no question in his mind that Morgan and Irwin
are the players to beat.
	   ``I think it will be under par,'' Marsh said when asked his
opinion on what it will take to win. ``The way Gil and Hale have
been playing, it might be 10-under-par.''

With BC-Canada-Dominatrix Trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By the Associated Press

<TEXT>
	   Some facts about the legal battles of a dominatrix whose trial
opened Tuesday near Toronto.
	    &UR; WHO: Terri-Jean Bedford, 39, known professionally as Madame de
Sade, former proprietor of a nine-bedroom ``bondage bungalow'' in
Thornhill, Ontario, north of Toronto.
	    &UR; WHAT: Bedford specialized in fulfilling her clients' fantasies,
such as role-playing, domination, spanking and fetish work. Her
bungalow was divided into several theme rooms, including a
classroom, a nursery, a parlor, a dungeon and a theatre.
	    &UR; CLIENTS: Bedford catered to many wealthy patrons _ lawyers,
doctors, even judges _ as well as an assortment of cross-dressers
and middle-class sado-masochists.
	    &UR; LEGAL: The case against Bedford was originally dismissed when
it was ruled the 1994 charges against her for keeping a bawdy house
were too vague. The Ontario Court of Appeal overturned the
dismissal and the Supreme Court of Canada upheld that decision last
year. In April, her lawyers were removed from the case over a
conflict of interest.
	    &UR; QUOTE: ``I pulled down my jeans ... I was wearing a Coors Lite
T-shirt that day _ and I was thankful for the length of it.''
Undercover Const. Stephen Baird of York Region police testifies
about being told to disrobe.

1998 shaping up as the year of the amateur
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ The scene at the practice green looked
more like horseplay at a junior tournament, rather than preparation
for golf's oldest championship.
	   Four hours before he teed off in the final pairing of the third
round at the British Open, Justin Rose was hitting chip shots from
one side of the green to the other, landing the ball closer and
closer to where Sergio Garcia was putting.
	   As Rose walked across the green, he stopped one of Garcia's
putts from going in the hole, flipped up the ball with his wedge,
and flung it back at the Spaniard's feet.
	   Their eyes met and laughter erupted _ a couple of amateurs who
acted as if they owned the joint.
	   That seems to be the case this year at major championships.
	   First it was Matt Kuchar, who dazzled the Masters with his smile
and captivated U.S. Open with a game beyond his 20 years.
	   He missed the cut at Royal Birkdale, but roamed behind the ropes
in the third round as Rose, the 17-year-old from England, refused
to let the magnitude of the British Open spoil a good time.
	   Garcia, the 18-year-old British Amateur champion known as ``El
Nino,'' was never in contention after a first-round 69. But then,
he never came close to a round in the 80s, either _ the kind of
disaster that befell defending Open champion Justin Leonard, Phil
Mickelson and Fred Couples.
	   ``These players are young, they're strong, they start at early
ages, the intimidation factor is not there,'' said 41-year-old Mark
O'Meara, the Masters and British Open champion.
	   ``They're going out and letting it wing and having fun.''
	   Golf just seems to keep getting fresh faces to expand its
appeal.
	   That includes Jenny Chausiriporn, who came the closest to
pulling off the unthinkable of winning a major championship. She
took Se Ri Pak to a 20-hole playoff at the U.S. Women's Open three
weeks ago.
	   Until this year, golf hasn't had an amateur make this kind of an
impact since Tiger Woods. But even Woods never caused this much
stir at a major before turning pro.
	   When he was 17, like Rose, Woods missed the cut in all three of
his professional tournaments. His best finish at a major was a tie
for 22nd at the 1996 British Open, when he shot a 66 in the second
round to tie the record for lowest round by an amateur.
	   Rose became the third amateur to shoot 66 at an Open in the
second round at Birkdale. He tied for fourth, the best finish by an
amateur at the Open in 45 years, then said he was turning pro.
	   ``Being so young, I know that it would be very difficult for me
to turn pro at that age, because obviously my game really wasn't
ready for it,'' Woods said. ``The key for him right now is to be
consistent, because the media and the press are going to build him
up to be something pretty big.''
	   One British tabloid reported that Rose already has agreed to a
dlrs 526,000 deal with a club manufacturer.
	   Kuchar, should he decide to turn pro before the U.S. Amateur
next month at Oak Hill, could fetch at least four times that much
in the United States. Asked if his son could turn pro before
defending at the Amateur, Peter Kuchar nodded and said, ``Maybe.''
	   Garcia might not be far behind. Indications are he will play the
Masters next year as the British Amateur champion, then turn pro.
He'll be 19 in January, the same age Seve Ballesteros and Jose
Maria Olazabal turned pro.
	   Kuchar and Rose share that same wonderful smile _ a reminder to
casual fans and pros alike that golf is a game to be enjoyed.
	   Once they give up their amateur status, though, that sweet
innocence of youth will carry them only so far. Both have clearly
shown this year that they have a game to go head-to-head with
golf's best.
	   It could also be that they have played their best on golf's
biggest stages.
	   Kuchar wasn't even the best player at Georgia Tech. His
teammate, freshman Bryce Molder, was named the college player of
the year. And Rose only last month failed to advance out of the
first round of the British Amateur.
	   But those are questions for later. It's not often an amateur
like Rose can grab so much attention in a major, let alone four of
them in one year.
	   ``The kid is obviously playing great,'' said Nick Faldo. ``He
should just go out there and enjoy it.''

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A hand grenade uncovered near a soccer
field accidentally detonated, killing a mother and six children,
newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   The children dug up the grenade and brought it to one of their
mothers, who was trying to clean it when the explosive detonated,
the reports said.
	   A 30-year-old woman, her 10- and 12-year-old sons and their four
friends, ages 9 to 12, were all killed.
	   The accident occurred Sunday in the village of Caoba, about 140
miles (225 kilometers) north of Guatemala City.
	   The grenade was apparently left over from Guatemala's 36-year
civil war, which ended in 1996.
	   ___
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ President Alberto Fujimori's popularity has
fallen nine percentage points in the past month due to discontent
with high poverty and a lack of jobs, a poll released Tuesday
showed.
	   Fujimori was popular with 31 percent of those polled while 55
percent said they disapproved of his performance as president, a
poll of Lima residents by the private company Apoyo showed.
Fourteen percent had no opinion.
	   Fujimori was re-elected in a landslide in 1995, partly due to
his effectiveness in fighting leftist guerrillas and capturing
their top leaders.
	   But lingering poverty and the failure of his economic policies
to create well-paid jobs have eroded his support over the years,
Loli said.
	   Apoyo surveyed 510 people in the capital Lima on July 17, 18
with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ About two dozen federal anti-drug police
raided a municipal police station in the Pacific Coast resort of
Mazatlan to rescue three arrested colleagues, newspapers reported
Tuesday.
	   Mazatlan city police said three federal agents were arrested
Sunday night for shooting into the air while driving drunkenly
along a city street.
	   The government's Notimex news agency reported that later that
night, about 25 federal anti-drug agents, some armed with automatic
rifles, surrounded the city police station and forced the release
of the arrested men.
	   ___
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Officials said Tuesday that 14 inmates
fled a police station in western Managua as authorities were busy
guarding celebrations of a political anniversary.
	   The escape occurred Sunday night while police were concentrated
at the Plaza of the Republic to keep order during a celebration of
the 19th anniversary of the Sandinista guerrilla triumph over the
Somoza family dictatorship.
	   A policeman who arrived Monday morning discovered the escape.
The inmates apparently had cut through the iron bars of their
cells.
	   Several of the escapees were serving short sentences while
others were facing trial on charges of murder, armed robbery or
rape.

Strong finish puts Watts' career at a crossroads
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ The next step for Brian Watts could be
as difficult as that bunker shot he hit on the 72nd hole to force a
playoff with British Open champion Mark O'Meara.
	   Watts, who has played the Japanese tour the past six years, won
dlrs 329,000 for his runner-up finish at Royal Birkdale.
	   That was enough to place him 61st on the PGA Tour money list.
And with only 14 events left this year, that should be more than
enough to keep him in the top 125 at the end of the season, which
would make him eligible for the tour next year.
	   ``In an ideal situation, I think I would enjoy playing on the
U.S. tour,'' said Watts, who lives in Edmond, Oklahoma and makes
about six trips across the Pacific each year. ``I've got almost a
1-year-old boy now, and it would be nice to be closer to him. So I
would like to play here.''
	   But the Japanese tour has been awfully good to Watts, and he
doesn't want to turn his back on it that quickly.
	   Not only does he have Japanese sponsors, but he might have given
up on his career if not for that tour.
	   He played only one year on the PGA Tour, in 1991, and missed the
cut in half of the tournaments. The former NCAA champion from
Oklahoma State failed qualifying school in 1988, 1989, 1991 and
1992 before going to Asia in desperation _ and finding a pot of
gold waiting for him.
	   ``I'm very lucky to be playing in Japan right now,'' he said.
	   He has won 11 tournaments in Asia and averages about dlrs
800,000 a year in earnings.
	   Along with his British Open winnings, Watts will have even more
chances to move up the PGA Tour money list without playing in
America. His world ranking improved to No. 23, and he should be
eligible for the dlrs 5 million purses in the three World
Championship of Golf events next year.
	   But playing the PGA Tour could also cut into his bank account.
Watts concedes it is deeper, ``strong from No. 1 to 156 players
each week.'' He would probably have to finish around 35th on the
money list, not particularly easy, to earn what he makes in Japan.
	   Watts was in no mood to decide his future after losing by two
strokes to Mark O'Meara in Sunday's playoff.
	   ``I guess I'll make up my mind some other time,'' he said.
	   Whenever that is, the decision won't be as easy as it seems.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DALY DOINGS: &LR;  Along with his battle against alcoholism, John
Daly was showing plenty of fight on the golf course earlier this
year.
	   Not only was he playing the most consistent golf of his career,
his only final round over par was at Bay Hill _ he shot 85 thanks
to an 18 on the sixth hole, where he hit six 3-wood shots into the
water trying to cut the corner.
	   But ever since The Players Championship, where he celebrated one
year of sobriety with a closing 69 that tied him for 16th, Daly has
looked more like the player who often gave up when things didn't go
his way.
	   He has missed the cut in five of 10 tournaments since then, and
his best finish was a tie for 33rd at the Masters. In the five
tournaments in which he played on the weekend, his final-round
average is 77.4.
	   Daly laughed off his 18 at Bay Hill, but was in no mood to
discuss the 10 he took on the 18th hole of the second round at the
British Open _ five shots out of a greenside bunker, giving him an
80 and an early trip home.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; SAME LANGUAGE, DIFFERENT TRANSLATION: &LR;  In transcripts of
interviews and in some of England's newspapers, American players
sounded a wee bit British this week.
	   On a day when security was tight for players and fans alike, Ben
Crenshaw was quoted in one tabloid as saying that police had ``even
searched the boot.''
	   That's the trunk of a car, not a shoe.
	   And try to imagine these words from Jim Furyk, who couldn't get
a putt to fall in his final round of 70 that left him tied for
fourth: ``I'm rottenly mad.''
	   Indeed.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; WESTWOOD HO: &LR;  The manager for English star Lee Westwood
realizes there are fences to be mended, especially since the
25-year-old pulled out of the MCI Classic and the Western Open.
	   Both tournaments were the week after a major, and Westwood cited
fatigue.
	   But Andrew ``Chubby'' Chandler was offended by the remarks of
Greg McLaughlin, the Western Open tournament director who said that
Westwood would never be invited back.
	   ``When a guy comes out and says you're not welcome, he is just
not going to play,'' Chandler said. ``Lee doesn't fall out with
anybody. A nicer kid you won't find.''
	   Chandler said Westwood was emotionally drained after his tie for
seventh at the U.S. Open, and that he could not have properly
prepared for the British Open if he had stayed for the Western.
	   After returning from San Francisco, Westwood was 15th at the
Irish Open and then won his third European tour event in four
starts a week later at Loch Lomond. He tied for 64th at Royal
Birkdale.
	   Chandler said Westwood probably will play the MCI Classic next
year. And he could still show up at the Western.
	   By winning in New Orleans, Westwood earned a two-year exemption
on the PGA Tour if he wants to join _ and then he could play any
tournament he wants.

Puerto Rico sticks with GTE in telephone company sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Rico is sticking with GTE
Corp. as the lead buyer of its state-owned telephone company,
rejecting a rival bid by Spain's Telefonica Internacional S.A.,
Gov. Pedro Rossello said Tuesday.
	   A consortium led by Stamford, Connecticut-based GTE offered
about dlrs 2 billion for a controlling interest in Puerto Rico
Telephone Co. Rossello had signed a deal with the consortium in
May.
	   Pending its approval by U.S. federal agencies, the contract
allowed Puerto Rico to consider competing bids, and Telefonica
reportedly offered a similar amount earlier this month. GTE came
back with an ``enhanced'' counter-offer.
	   Rossello cited technology transfer and the ability to quickly
complete the deal in explaining his decision to stay with GTE.
	   ``This decision is final and firm,'' the governor said in a
broadcast message.
	   Some 6,400 union telephone workers went on strike June 18 to
protest the privatization and demand job guarantees. Talks to end
the strike have broken down.
	   More than 293,000 customers lacked intra-island long distance
service Tuesday because of strike-related sabotage, the telephone
company said.

Marlins pitcher drops objections to restraining order

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Florida Marlins pitcher Livan Hernandez decided
that one day of court testimony about his personal life was enough,
and he dropped objections Tuesday to a restraining order sought by
his former girlfriend.
	   The order means Hernandez must have no contact with Alina
Elgarresta for at least a year.
	   Hernandez initially contested the order, then changed his mind
after testimony Monday in Miami-Dade Circuit Court by Elgarresta,
who said the 23-year-old pitcher physically abused her.
	   Hernandez's lawyer, Manny Vazquez, noted that his client pitched
poorly in a 5-3 loss Monday night to Milwaukee after spending the
day in court. The lawyer said Hernandez was eager to put the case
and his relationship with Elgarresta in the past.
	   ``What she wants is that Livan doesn't bother her anymore, and
he has no problem with that,'' Vazquez told Judge Amy Karan. ``He
wants to get on with his life.''
	   Elgarresta, 25, said she was surprised that Hernandez at first
contested the restraining order.
	   ``I feel sorry for him,'' she said. ``I hope he sees what he's
done.''
	   Hernandez would be subject to arrest for violation of the order,
which requires that he stay at least 500 feet (150 meters) away
from Elgarresta and have no communication with her. Such an arrest
could result in a sentence of up to a year in jail.
	   Hernandez could have agreed to the order Monday and prevented
Elgarresta's damaging testimony. Failing to do so may have been a
mistake, Vazquez admitted.
	   ``We didn't want to prolong this,'' Vazquez said. ``It was
draining to him. It has affected his professional life. It has
affected his pitching. He wanted to end it.''
	   A clause was included in the order allowing Hernandez onto the
Biltmore Golf Course, where he plays regularly. Elgarresta has a
home on the third hole, a coincidence that prompted chuckles in the
courtroom.
	   ``Obviously, Mr. Hernandez, if any balls are hit into her yard,
start with new balls,'' the judge said. ``I don't want anybody
going on her property to get balls or otherwise.''
	   Hernandez, last year's World Series most valuable player, began
dating Elgarresta in November 1997. She testified Monday that
before they broke up in June, he punched her, slapped her, kicked
her and pinned her down and plucked the hairs off her head one by
one.
	   Hernandez didn't speak in court, but afterwards denied the
allegations.

Trinidad and Tobago judge blocks execution of convicted murderer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago (AP) _ A judge on Tuesday
blocked the execution of a convicted murderer in Trinidad and
Tobago, saying he has already been subjected to cruel and inhuman
punishment in prison.
	   Darrin Thomas, 29, was on death row for slitting a taxi driver's
throat in 1993. High Court Justice Peter Jamadar ordered his death
sentence overturned, saying Thomas had been jailed without
sufficient light, handcuffed during exercise breaks and given
inadequate food.
	   Government lawyer Russell Martineau said he would appeal the
ruling to the Trinidad and Tobago Court of Appeals.
	   Jamadar rejected defense lawyers' arguments that the government
must wait for the Inter-American Court on Human Rights to hear an
appeal by Thomas. Trinidad and Tobago has accused the court of
dragging its feet on such appeals and has said it will drop out of
an Organization of American States accord allowing them.
	   Trinidad and Tobago has led recent resistance to pressure by
Britain to eliminate the death penalty in former British colonies.

NBA and union: Let's talk
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The National Basketball Association and
locked-out players agree on one thing: It's time to start talking
again.
	   Commissioner David Stern and players' union director Billy
Hunter met Tuesday and agreed to resume collective bargaining.
Negotiations have been stalled since June 22.
	   They plan to speak Friday to set a date.
	   ``It was a very cordial meeting that didn't focus on the
specifics of our negotiation,'' Hunter said through a spokesman.
``Instead, we talked more generally about the desire on both our
parts to resume bargaining. I let David know that my ultimate goal
remains reaching an agreement that both sides can live with as soon
as possible.''
	   The sides probably won't schedule talks before the end of this
month. Stern has plans to take vacation next week, and deputy
commissioner Russ Granik is in Europe with the U.S. world
championship team.
	   Stern and Granik attended the nine negotiating sessions before
the lockout, but both do not necessarily have to be there when
talks resume.
	   Tuesday's development may have been a positive sign since Hunter
had indicated a day earlier there was no need to resume discussions
unless either side would show a willingness to move off its current
position.
	   The sides remain far apart on fundamental economic issues
related to divvying up the pile of money known as
basketball-related income, or BRI.
	   Owners had planned to devote between 48 and 52 percent of that
money to player salaries under the last labor agreement, but the
number rose to 57 percent _ about dlrs 950 million _ for the
1997-98 season.
	   In proposals exchanged before the July 1 imposition of the
lockout, the NBA was asking for a ``hard'' salary cap tied to no
more than 50 percent of BRI. The union proposed a reduction in
future salary cap growth if BRI hit 63 percent.
	   Stern has been demanding ``cost certainty'' in a new deal, while
the players say they should not be responsible for protecting
owners from themselves.
	   Other issues that have been discussed but not yet resolved
include changes to the rookie wage scale, increased minimum
salaries for veterans, player discipline and modifications to the
drug agreement
	   Curiously, neither side has yet proposed a luxury tax, such as
the one used in baseball, as a way of deterring high payrolls.
During labor talks in 1995, a luxury tax on over-the-cap teams was
agreed to before being stricken from the final deal.
	   On Monday, Hunter said owners have proposed a ``reverse luxury
tax'' under which players would give back a portion of their
salaries if the BRI percentage went too high.

Puppy in Canada needs US dlrs 871 surgery on smashed leg after
</HEADLINE>
beating

<TEXT>
	   CHATHAM, Ontario (AP) _ A Canadian youth has been charged after
a puppy was beaten so badly it needed dlrs 1,300 (US dlrs 871) of
surgery to repair its smashed leg.
	   A veterinarian had to pin one of the dog's hind legs together
after someone repeatedly kicked the six-month-old dog about three
weeks ago.
	   Cathy Crawford, a spokeswoman at the Ontario Society of the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said the number of animal abuse
cases are on the rise.
	   In 1997, there were 272 cases of neglect and abuse reported in
the Chatham area, up from 253 in 1996.
	   A new home is being sought for the dog.
	   The youth, who cannot be identified under provisions of the
Young Offenders Act, could be fined up to dlrs 2,000 (US dlrs 1300)
and spend six months in jail if found guilty.

``New creative thinking'' needed in parliaments, Jamaica PM says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Lawmakers need ``new creative
thinking'' to handle increasing international cooperation and
global business, Jamaican Prime Minister P.J. Patterson told a
conference of parliamentarians Tuesday.
	   Speaking at the 23rd regional conference of the Commonwealth
Parliamentary Association in Kingston, Patterson said
multi-national businesses were pushing governments to lower
tariffs, change quotas and alter exchange controls to eliminate
boundaries between countries.
	   Lawmakers will be challenged to find solutions that can retain
sovereign powers, he said.
	   ``It cannot be business as usual. It cannot be legislation as
usual,'' he said. ``There is now a compelling need for new creative
thinking. The new world order will render us obsolete unless we
prove ourselves adequate to the task.''

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A 23-year-old man appeared in
court Tuesday on charges of murdering three young brothers in a
firebomb attack during a week of sectarian violence set off when
Protestant marchers were stopped from parading through a hostile
Catholic neighborhood.
	   Thomas Robert Garfield Gilmour of Ballymoney denied the charges.
Police said during the hearing in Belfast Magistrates Court that
Gilmour had no criminal record and denied being a member of any
paramilitary organization.
	   The Quinn brothers _ Richard, 11, Mark, 10, and Jason 9 _ were
killed in a July 12 arson attack on their home in Ballymoney, 40
miles (65 kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   A number of other people are being held for questioning in the
case, but police declined Tuesday to give a specific number.
	   Gilmour was ordered to be jailed pending a further court
appearance on Aug. 12.
	   Police believe the family was targeted because the boy's mother,
29-year-old Chrissie Quinn, was a Catholic who lived with a
Protestant boyfriend.
	   The attack was the worst incident of violence which followed a
violent standoff between Protestant marchers and security forces
blocking them from parading through a Catholic neighborhood in
Portadown, 25 miles (40 kms) southwest of Belfast.
	   Stunned by the killings, some leaders of the Orange Order called
for an end to the confrontation between its marchers and security
forces. The numbers of protesters camped near the Drumcree Anglican
church has dwindled to a token presence.
	   Talks aimed at resolving the dispute that sparked the Drumcree
standoff continued Tuesday, but broke up without agreement,
although go-betweens said some progress had been made.
	   The talks were set up 10 days ago at the height of the standoff
when thousands of protesters amassed at the church, determined to
march down Portadown's Garvaghy Road.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair's chief of staff, Jonathan
Powell, again coordinated the session _ the third involving
Orangemen and the residents.
	   The two delegations remained in separate rooms with officials
shuttling communications between them.
	   Garvaghy Road residents criticized the Orange delegation for
refusing to meet them face to face and said they remained open to
continuing the process.

Kevin Spacey forsakes one marathon for another
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Talk about devotion!
	   Kevin Spacey is taking a night off from his marathon London
stage role in Eugene O'Neill's ``The Iceman Cometh'' in order to
undertake a separate kind of marathon - making it to Los Angeles
for the premiere Wednesday of his film ``The Negotiator'' and then
back to London in time for his play on Thursday.
	   As Spacey described it July 21, on Tuesday evening he performs
as usual his highly acclaimed performance at the Old Vic playing
anguished salesman, Hickey.
	   The next morning, he takes the Concorde to New York and changes
to a plane for Los Angeles. After the premiere, he boards the
so-called ``red eye'' back to New York in time for the morning
Concorde back to London on Thursday. That flight in turn gets him
to Heathrow Airport a scant 90 minutes before Thursday's
performance of the play starts.
	   ``Hopefully, nothing will be delayed,'' said Spacey, adding that
he and his colleagues ``have a good ending of the first act if I'm
not there.''
	   Spacey has agreed to an extra performance of the play on Sunday
- the Oscar-winning actor's 39th birthday - to make up for the
missed show. The sellout run of ``Iceman'' ends August 1.
	   ``The Negotiator'' opens across the United States on July 29.

Canadian police give prosecutors preview of evidence in 1985
</HEADLINE>
bombing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Indicating they have nearly
finished a 13-year investigation, Canadian police confirmed Tuesday
they have given prosecutors a summary of evidence related to the
1985 bombing of an Air India jet that killed 329 people.
	   The attack has been linked to Sikh militants in British Columbia
believed to have been seeking revenge on the Indian government for
its treatment of the country's Sikh minority _ especially a 1984
army assault on a Sikh temple.
	   Of those killed in the Air India disaster, 278 were Canadians _
mostly vacationing Hindus from Toronto and Montreal, which were the
jet's last stops before it was destroyed.
	   The initial summary of evidence compiled by the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police is a prelude to a full brief that will be submitted
later. Prosecutors will then have to decide if the 20 full-time
investigators on the case have gathered enough evidence to secure
convictions.
	   ``No time frame has been set for the approval of charges _ if
any _ by Crown counsel,'' RCMP Sgt. Russ Grabb said. ``The charge
approval process will only commence once the comprehensive court
brief has been submitted.''
	   No timetable has been set for that step, he said.
	   Air India Flight 182 was destroyed after it left Montreal for
New Delhi and Bombay. Over Ireland's southwest coast, a bomb
explosion sent the jet into the Atlantic.
	   The bombing coincided with an explosion in luggage at Tokyo's
Narita airport as it was being transferred to an Air India flight.
Two baggage handlers were killed.
	   Inderjit Singh Reyat, an electrician from the Vancouver Island
community of Duncan, was arrested and convicted in the Narita
bombing. He is serving a 10-year sentence at a jail east of
Vancouver.
	   Reyat, 45, is also considered a suspect in the Air India
bombing. Police told his parole hearing in March they wanted to
charge him in that attack. Reyat was denied parole.

British companies sign oil and construction deals in Azerbaijan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Petroleum PLC said Tuesday it plans to
invest at least dlrs 75 million in a new venture to explore for oil
offshore in Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea.
	   The agreement between BP and the State Oil Co. of the Azerbaijan
Republic was the biggest of four deals signed Tuesday by British
companies during a visit by Azerbaijan's president, Geidar Aliev.
	   Although the British government said the deals could be worth
billions, BP stayed cautious about how much it will invest, saying
it first needed to test the fields where it plans to explore for
oil. BP and Norway's Statoil will each have 15 percent of the
Caspian Sea deal, while the Azerbaijani company, known as SOCAR,
will hold 40 percent and allocate the rest of the equity later.
	   The deal is the third major BP project in Azerbaijan, after a
recent successful find that is producing 70,000 barrels of crude a
day and the start of drilling on another contract.
	   Also Tuesday, Ramco Energy PLC said it had signed an onshore
production sharing agreement for the rehabilitation, exploration
and development of three onshore oil fields in Azerbaijan, with an
option for further exploration.
	   A feasibility study concluded that the fields hold at least 5
billion barrels of oil, Ramco said in announcing the 50-50 deal
with SOCAR.
	   Terms were not disclosed.
	   The Foreign Office cited a third oil contract that was signed
Tuesday between Monument Oil and Gas and Azerbaijan for the British
firm to take a 12.5 percent stake in a project to develop the
offshore Inam block, 18 miles (30 kms) off the southeastern coast
of Azerbaijan.
	   The Azerbaijanis will hold 50 percent of the deal, while the
American oil giant Amoco Corp. will take a 25 percent stake and
Central Fuel Caspian Sea Ltd. will take the remaining 12.5 percent.
	   Morrison Construction Group also finalized an agreement for the
development of a Hilton Hotel and an office complex in the
Azerbaijani capital, Baku.

Jones trashes opponents' talking by winning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Marion Jones' success is turning off
opponents and turning on sponsors.
	   Jones is undefeated in 24 finals this year in six different
events _ the 100, 200 and 400 meters, the 400 relay, the long jump
and the indoor 60 meters. She has won with such relative ease that
her rivals are becoming resentful.
	   ``It began last year when I came out from basketball and stepped
on the track,'' Jones said Tuesday, one day after completing a
sensational sprint double at the Goodwill Games. ``I felt the
resentment.''
	   Jones has proven to be unbeatable, and the jealousy has turned
to intense trash-talking.
	   ``I've heard a lot of it the last couple of weeks,'' she said.
``There was always a lot of trash-talking among the men's
sprinters, but not so much among the women. Now, it's gotten to the
women.
	   ``They say things like, `We know your secret. One wrong move and
we'll beat you, and all your success will come crumbling down.' ''
	   Jones said all the psychological warfare was coming from the
sprinters, not the long jumpers, and none of it involved drugs.
	   ``I've had a lot of things to motivate me,'' Jones said, ``and
this is just another thing.''
	   Jones showed her motivation in Monday night's 200. She blasted
out of the blocks, made up the stagger when the field reached the
curve and powered down the stretch before slowing near the finish
to win in 21.80 seconds.
	   ``I had built up a lot of anticipation for this race,'' she
said. ``A couple of people, not everybody, had been saying a lot of
things. They didn't work. Maybe they'll have to try something else.
	   ``Maybe, in a way, it's good. It's putting a little excitement
into the women's events. That's what we need. But maybe they need
to look at their inner strength.''
	   Inner strength just happens to be the ad campaign of TAG Heuer,
the Paris-based sports watch company that recently signed Jones as
a spokeswoman. She also has contracts with Nike and Oakley, and has
rejected many other deals from companies anxious to sign her as she
heads toward the 2000 Olympics and her goal of winning a record
five gold medals _ in the 100, 200, long jump, and 400 and 1,600
relays.
	   Jones, who won the 100 in 10.90 Sunday night, is saddened by the
low state of track and field in the United States.
	   ``When I go to Europe, I get mobbed,'' she said, ``but when I
come back to the United States, it's more laid-back. Not many
people are aware of who I am. It's sad for a U.S. athlete. All the
hard work we put in is not recognized.
	   ``I hope I can carry the sport back to where it once was. The
enthusiasm at the Goodwill Games gives me a glimmer of hope. Next
year, I hope the bubble doesn't pop.''

Adviser says he didn't think Nevada would license boxer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ The adviser for Mike Tyson went to New Jersey
to seek a license for the boxer because he did not think he would
be re-licensed in Nevada, according to a published report.
	   ``If I believed Mike Tyson would be licensed in Nevada, I
wouldn't have gone to New Jersey first,'' Shelly Finkel told the
Las Vegas Sun from his New York office on Monday.
	   Finkel said he didn't believe his client would be re-licensed in
Nevada if and when he applied. Tyson's license was revoked by the
Nevada State Athletic Commission for at least one year for biting
Evander Holyfield's ears in a fight here last July. The one-year
period expired July 9.
	   Instead of applying in Nevada as expected, Finkel had Tyson
apply in New Jersey last Friday. A hearing on that application is
scheduled July 29.
	   Finkel's implications upset Dr. Elias Ghanem, NSAC chairman.
	   ``How does he know how we'd vote?'' Ghanem asked. ``What he said
doesn't make sense unless he has some other agenda.
	   ``This angers me,'' Ghanem told the Sun. ``I've had no contact
whatsoever with Shelly Finkel and I know for a fact no one could
have told him Mike Tyson has no chance to be re-licensed in
Nevada.''
	   Ghanem, vice chairman Dr. James Nave and NSAC executive director
Marc Ratner each said they have intentionally avoided discussing
the subject of Tyson's reinstatement.
	   ``I can't tell you how anyone would vote because we've made it a
point not to discuss it with anyone, including among ourselves,''
Ratner said. ``But if three of the five would have voted for
reinstating Tyson, he'd be reinstated. It's as simple as that.''
	   Finkel said if the Nevada commission would commit to
re-licensing Tyson, he would come to Nevada instead.
	   Tyson hasn't fought in New Jersey since defeating Alex Stewart
in 1990.
	   Ghanem said he feels Nevada should be the state to decide
Tyson's future.
	   ``I expect the state of New Jersey to honor our suspension,''
Ghanem said. ``If Mike Tyson is to be licensed, the place for him
to apply is in Nevada.
	   ``We have a mutual respect between states,'' the chairman said.
``We in Nevada expect them to honor our suspensions.''

Philippine Airlines ground crew union goes on strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The ground crew labor union of
financially troubled flag carrier Philippine Airlines Inc. began a
long-threatened strike Wednesday over recent mass layoffs.
	   The walkout was confirmed by Avelino Zapanta, senior vice
president of the airline, and Alex Barrientos, who heads the ground
crew union.
	   Zapanta said the strike forced Philippine Airlines to suspend
all flights Wednesday morning. A total of 40 domestic flights and
one international flight bound for Hong Kong were scheduled
Wednesday.
	   Philippine Airlines ground crew also service other international
carriers such as China Airlines, Singapore Airlines and Northwest
Airlines, according to radio reports.
	   In June, PAL was embroiled in a crippling three-week pilots'
strike that brought the company close to financial ruin.
	   At the height of the strike, PAL laid off 5,000 of its more than
13,000 workers to minimize its losses.
	   The ground personnel union then threatened to go on strike to
demand the reinstatement of the terminated workers but the labor
department assumed jurisdiction of the union's dispute with PAL on
July 10 and prohibited any work stoppage.
	   Labor officials also ordered the airline to suspend any more
layoffs.
	   The union, however, said it would go ahead with the strike
plans.
	   PAL officials have said another strike could force Asia's oldest
airline to close after 57 years of operation.

Ronaldo's Brazil team mate says only team doctor knows what
</HEADLINE>
happened to him &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Nine days after Brazil's loss to
France in the World Cup finals, speculation about what happened to
star forward Ronaldo continued to be a hot topic in the Brazilian
press Tuesday.
	   ``One day doctor Lidio (Toledo) is going have to reveal what
really happened to Ronaldo,'' said Roberto Carlos told the O Globo
newspaper.
	   Roberto Carlos was Ronaldo's room mate when he suffered a 30 to
40 second convulsion before the World Cup final.
	   ``Perhaps then people will stop asking me about what happened. I
don't know the name of what Ronaldo had. All I know is that it was
serious, very serious,'' O Globo quoted Roberto Carlos.
	   Ronaldo had been ``burdened with nerves and worries'' in the
days leading up to the final on July 12. He was chatting to him in
their hotel room before the big match when Ronaldo stopped talking,
went pale and started to sweat heavily, Roberto Carlos said.
	   As the convulsions started, his arms went crooked and his hands
looked deformed because of nervous tension. Other players say he
foamed at the mouth and swallowed his tongue.
	   In an interview with Brazilian newsweekly, Isto E, the team
doctor Toledo said it would be necessary to do ``detailed tests''
to find out what caused Ronaldo's fit.
	   He did not rule out the sudden illness being an epileptic fit,
saying it was possible that people without a history of epilepsy
could suffer a one time occurrence of it.
	   But he denied claims that Ronaldo had an adverse reaction to an
injection of painkiller, saying he would not have administered this
prior to a game as it would have contravened anti-doping
regulations.
	   Over the weekend, Toledo was shown on TV Globo saying he gave
Ronaldo a sedative before the game. On Monday, however, he said he
had given the sedative only after the game.

Rival parties split seven parliamentary by-elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The main opposition party won four of
seven parliamentary by-elections, retaining its slim majority in
the one-house National Assembly, final returns showed Wednesday.
	   The by-elections Tuesday increased the number of seats the main
opposition Grand National Party holds in the 299-member National
Assembly to 151, a two-seat majority.
	   President Kim Dae-jung's party, the National Congress for New
Politics, won two seats, boosting its parliamentary membership to
88.
	   The ruling coalition party, the United Liberal Democrats, picked
up one seat, raising the number of its national legislators to 48.
There are also 11 independent and minor opposition party members.
	   The rival parties equally split four seats at stake in Seoul and
Kyonggi province, which surrounds the capital. The main opposition
party won two seats in its provincial strongholds, while the ruling
coalition party picked up one seat in Pusan, the nation's second
largest city.
	   The by-elections were held to fill seats vacated by deaths as
well as court rulings that nullified previous elections over
various election law violations.
	   Before Tuesday's balloting, all of the seven seats were held by
opposition members.
	   For the ruling camp, the outcome of Tuesday's by-elections was
disappointing. It had hoped to sweep most of the seats at stake and
deprive the main opposition party of its parliamentary majority.
	   The ruling party has persistently complained that the opposition
has been a stumbling block to the government's reform policies.
	   The main opposition party largely represents South Korea's
conservative groups, which ruled the country for nearly a half
century until it was defeated in last December's presidential
elections.
	   A record-low voter turnout of 40.1 percent marked Tuesday's
by-elections, held in the midst of a deepening economic crisis.
South Korea's battered economy was bailed out by the International
Monetary Fund in December.

New money for pursuit of war criminals welcomed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Dollar amounts are in Canadian dollars
 &UR; By The Associated Press

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ The federal government is pumping $46.8 million
over three years into the pursuit of war criminals past and
present, a welcome move by groups critical of the government's
lacklustre performance in the past.
	   ``I think it's a very strong message that the Canadian
government is sending out that Canada is no longer open to war
criminals,'' said Irving Abella, a York University history
professor and chairman of the war crimes committee of the Canadian
Jewish Congress.
	   The money will allow the Justice Department to open 14 new
investigations of Second World War cases. It also lets the
Immigration Department step up its efforts against alleged war
criminals from contemporary conflicts.
	   The government said the money will also enhance co-ordination
among war-crimes investigators and those who prosecute or deport
war criminals, or those involved in investigating crimes against
humanity.

 &UR; Float plane crash lands with campers aboard
	   FITZROY HARBOR, Ontario (AP) _ An aerial field trip above the
lush Ottawa River valley turned terrifying for a group of
disadvantaged children Tuesday when the float plane carrying them
back to summer camp flipped over as it tried to land on water.
	   None of the eight passengers, including six children and their
camp counsellor, were injured. One girl suffered a minor cut and
two children were taken to hospital in nearby Shawville, Quebec,
for observation, said Const. David Young of the Ontario Provincial
Police.
	   Witnesses said the plane landed and then immediately went belly
up. Within minutes, one of the plane doors opened and the
passengers came out wearing life jackets.

 &UR; Drunk driver who killed son ordered jailed
	   BROCKVILLE, Ontario (AP) _ An impaired driver who killed his
four-year-old son and injured his two-year-old son in a single-car
accident will do time in a jail instead of at home, an appeal court
has ruled.
	   The Ontario Court of Appeal has overturned a conditional
sentence granted Stephen Blakeley by Provincial Court Judge Kenneth
Pedlar.
	   That sentence allowed Blakeley to serve his time at home except
for going to work and visiting his surviving son.
	   Blakeley, 39, a molecular biologist at Queen's University in
Kingston, pleaded guilty to impaired driving causing death and
impaired driving causing bodily harm for the Sept. 27 accident.
	   Pedlar agreed to allow Blakeley to serve his sentence of two
years less a day in the community rather than in a provincial
institution. He found Blakeley was not a danger to the public and
was working to correct his drinking problem.
	   However, the appeal court said the sentence was too lenient and
that Pedlar didn't put enough weight on the need to deter others
from committing similar crimes.

 &UR; Bone-marrow plea prompts significant response
	   HALIFAX (AP) _ The Red Cross in Nova Scotia has been swamped
with offers of help for a young Ottawa girl who might die without a
bone-marrow transplant.
	   Fourteen-month-old Haley MacDonald suffers from a rare and fatal
disorder called Hurler's disease. She's missing an enzyme in her
blood that breaks down mucus.
	   The girl's father, Mike MacDonald, was born in Antigonish, Nova
Scotia A Halifax newspaper story last weekend has prompted more
than 100 calls to the Red Cross.
	   Her father is asking people to register for bone-marrow
donations.
	   Unless a successful match is found within the next two months,
doctors fear the child might not live to see her 10th birthday.

 &UR; TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO: Judge blocks execution of murderer &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago (AP) _ A judge on Tuesday
blocked the execution of a convicted murderer in Trinidad and
Tobago, saying he has already been subjected to cruel and inhuman
punishment in prison.
	   Darrin Thomas, 29, was on death row for slitting a taxi driver's
throat in 1993. High Court Justice Peter Jamadar ordered his death
sentence overturned, saying Thomas had been jailed without
sufficient light, handcuffed during exercise breaks and given
inadequate food.
	   Government lawyer Russell Martineau said he would appeal the
ruling to the Trinidad and Tobago Court of Appeals.
	   Jamadar rejected defense lawyers' arguments that the government
must wait for the Inter-American Court on Human Rights to hear an
appeal by Thomas. Trinidad and Tobago has accused the court of
dragging its feet on such appeals and has said it will drop out of
an Organization of American States accord allowing them.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Passengers reported smoke long before ship
announcement
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Passengers aboard the giant cruise ship Ecstasy
pulled stewards into their cabins to show them smoke coming through
the vents and plumes rising from the ship's stern long before the
first announcement telling people to move to upper decks.
	   One passenger said Tuesday that an hour and 20 minutes passed
between when she first noticed the smoke and heard the first fire
alarm.
	   A welder's spark in a laundry room may have ignited lint in the
air-conditioning vents and touched off an ``explosive-type'' fire
that quickly spread two decks above to the outside mooring area,
where nylon rope fed the flames, Carnival Cruise Lines president
Bob Dickinson said.
	   Fifty-four of the nearly 3,500 people aboard suffered mostly
minor injuries.
	   Plumes of smoke shot out the back of the 855-foot-long ship
shortly after it left the Port of Miami Monday for a four-night
trip to Key West and Cozumel, Mexico.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Government sticks with GTE in telephone company sale
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Rico is sticking with GTE
Corp. as the lead buyer of its state-owned telephone company,
rejecting a rival bid by Spain's Telefonica Internacional S.A.,
Gov. Pedro Rossello said Tuesday.
	   A consortium led by Stamford, Connecticut-based GTE offered
about dlrs 2 billion for a controlling interest in Puerto Rico
Telephone Co. Rossello had signed a deal with the consortium in
May.
	   Pending its approval by U.S. federal agencies, the contract
allowed Puerto Rico to consider competing bids, and Telefonica
reportedly offered a similar amount earlier this month. GTE came
back with an ``enhanced'' counter-offer.
	   Rossello cited technology transfer and the ability to quickly
complete the deal in explaining his decision to stay with GTE.
	   ``This decision is final and firm,'' the governor said in a
broadcast message.
	   Some 6,400 union telephone workers went on strike June 18 to
protest the privatization and demand job guarantees.
 &UR; GUYANA: Guyanese turn to Northern Ireland for ideas on division
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Weary of racially charged riots,
firebombings and angry rhetoric, politicians in Guyana are looking
for answers in Northern Ireland.
	   A delegation of legislators, lawyers and Information Minister
Moses Nagamootoo left for Belfast on Monday on a 10-day trip to see
how British-controlled Northern Ireland is trying to heal decades
of Protestant-Catholic division.
	   In Guyana, a former British colony on the northeast shoulder of
South America, friction between people of African and East Indian
descent erupted into violence after Afro-Guyanese accused President
Janet Jagan's party of rigging the Dec. 15 election.
	   Leaders from other Caribbean countries brokered a shaky peace
last month. Politicians agreed to rewrite Guyana's constitution to
better balance power between the ethnic groups.
	   The Guyanese delegation will meet with Irish President Mary
McAleese, former Irish Prime Minister John Bruton and other
officials, said the Washington-based National Democratic Institute,
which is sponsoring the trip.
 &UR; VENEZUELA: Guyanese president begins Venezuela state visit
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Guyanese President Janet Jagan began a
two-day state visit to neighboring Venezuela Tuesday with trade and
a contentious territorial dispute high on the agenda.
	   Jagan took a Venezuelan military aircraft to Caracas, where she
was welcomed by President Rafael Caldera and his Cabinet.
	   Venezuela and Guyana have worked hard to patch up their
century-old border dispute in recent years. Venezuela claims
two-thirds of Guyana, or the entire mineral-rich Essequibo region.
	   Jagan on Tuesday visited the tomb of Venezuelan independence
hero Simon Bolivar and was attending a special session of Congress.
	   Venezuela's foreign minister, Miguel Burelli Rivas, said the
leaders hoped to sign accords on trade, drug trafficking and the
environment.
 &UR; JAMAICA: ``Creative thinking'' needed in parliaments, PM says
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Lawmakers need ``new creative
thinking'' to handle increasing international cooperation and
global business, Jamaican Prime Minister P.J. Patterson told a
conference of parliamentarians Tuesday.
	   Speaking at the 23rd regional conference of the Commonwealth
Parliamentary Association in Kingston, Patterson said
multi-national businesses were pushing governments to lower
tariffs, change quotas and alter exchange controls to eliminate
boundaries between countries.
	   Lawmakers will be challenged to find solutions that can retain
sovereign powers, he said.
	   ``It cannot be business as usual. It cannot be legislation as
usual,'' he said. ``There is now a compelling need for new creative
thinking. The new world order will render us obsolete unless we
prove ourselves adequate to the task.''
 &UR; GUYANA: Lost ranger returns home
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ A forest ranger lost in the Guyanese
jungle for 10 days returned home this week, bruised and
mosquito-bitten but otherwise in good health.
	   Raymond Houston, 51, disappeared July 4 while helping teen
volunteers work on a Guyana Forestry Commission station about 90
miles (140 kilometers) southwest of Georgetown.
	   Houston, a 20-year veteran of the forestry commission, had gone
into the bush to find some students he thought were lost. He lost
his bearings in heavy rain.
	   Fighting off fatigue and mosquitoes, he hiked for days through
swamps filled with caimans and poisonous snakes. ``Once, I was so
tired I slept in a swamp holding on to a tree,'' Houston said. ``I
prayed a lot and asked God for sustenance.''
	   He stumbled out of the jungle Wednesday at a logging camp 20
miles away. He was treated for dehydration and insect bites before
being brought home on Sunday.
 &UR; BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS: Government eases restrictions on U.S.
horses
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ The British Virgin
Islands will ease restrictions for race horses from the neighboring
U.S. Virgin Islands under an agreement signed Monday.
	   Previously, U.S. horses had to be put in quarantine for two
weeks before being allowed to compete at the Little A Racetrack on
the island of Tortola. The agreement eliminates the quarantine,
although horses will still have to be stabled separately.
	   British officials said they are considering a similar agreement
with Puerto Rico, another U.S. territory.
	   The changes come as the British Virgin Islands prepares for its
annual August Monday Festival race on Aug. 3.
	   The Little A Racetrack has just undergone a three year, dlrs 2
million renovation.

category codes:
	   VANIMO, Papua New Guinea _ As the official death toll from the
tsunami that wiped out coastal villages rose to 1,200 Tuesday,
officials feared rotting corpses would spread disease among those
who survived. Crocodiles, dogs and pigs were feasting on the
cadavers. Officials sent out hunting parties to shoot the
scavengers. Some 6,000 villagers were still missing after three
huge waves generated by a magnitude-7 undersea earthquake
devastated 18 miles (30 kilometers) of the north coast Friday
evening. Prime Minister Bill Skate said Tuesday after again touring
the stricken region that he has little hope of the missing being
found alive. So far, only 2,527 people have been found alive out of
the 8,000 to 10,000 believed to have lived in these remote coastal
fishing and subsistence farming villages. Some 700 bodies have been
buried, and Skate estimated 500 bodies are floating in Sissano
lagoon and the sea. (PAPUA NEW GUINEA-TSUNAMI)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Ten years after the bombing of a Pan Am
jetliner, the United States and Britain are considering a trial of
two Libyan suspects in the Netherlands under Scottish law. Col.
Moammar Gadhafi has refused to release the two suspects _ both
Libyan intelligence agents _ for trial in the United States or
Britain on charges of planting the bomb on Pan Am 103 that killed
all 259 passengers and crew members and 11 people on the ground in
Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. He has hinted he would be willing to
send them to a third country for trial. There was no immediate word
whether convening a Scottish court in the Netherlands or elsewhere
would overcome Gadhafi's objections. ``We're looking at it, but I
don't know that it can be done,'' President Bill Clinton said
Tuesday. ``We've tried to find some way that has real integrity
that will work, but there are all kinds of practical
difficulties.'' (BRITAIN-LOCKERBIE)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A 23-year-old man appeared in
court Tuesday on charges of murdering three young brothers in a
firebomb attack during a week of sectarian violence set off when
Protestant marchers were stopped from parading through a hostile
Catholic neighborhood. Thomas Robert Garfield Gilmour of Ballymoney
denied the charges. Police said during the hearing in Belfast
Magistrates Court that Gilmour had no criminal record and denied
being a member of any paramilitary organization. The Quinn brothers
_ Richard, 11, Mark, 10, and Jason 9 _ were killed in a July 12
arson attack on their home in Ballymoney, 40 miles (65 kms)
northwest of Belfast. Gilmour was ordered to be jailed until a
court appearance Aug. 12. The attack was the worst incident of
violence which followed a violent standoff between Protestant
marchers and security forces blocking them from parading through a
Catholic neighborhood in Portadown, 25 miles (40 kms) southwest of
Belfast. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ After years of conjecture about
apartheid's chain of command, a former Cabinet minister provided
details Tuesday on how former President P.W. Botha allegedly
ordered the destruction of a church headquarters. Adriaan Vlok, who
is seeking amnesty for violent acts he ordered as Botha's law and
order minister, said Botha dictated the Aug. 31, 1988, attack in
Johannesburg. Khotso House, home of the anti-apartheid South
African Council of Churches, was heavily damaged in the bombing.
The blast injured a few people but caused no deaths. Botha has
denied authorizing the bombing. (SOUTH AFRICA-BOTHA)
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Ending months of speculation,
President Carlos Menem on Tuesday renounced his intention to seek a
third straight term in next year's presidential race. The question
of whether Menem would seek another term has dominated national
politics for most of the year, creating friction in his Peronist
Party and stalling important legislation. A third term would have
required a constitutional amendment or a special Supreme Court
ruling. His term ends Dec. 10, 1999. (ARGENTINA-MENEM-RE-ELECTION)

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A late burst of profit-taking dragged stocks
lower Tuesday, slicing more than 100 points off the Dow and halting
a bid at a 10th straight Nasdaq record. The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 105 points to 9,190. An early 48-point gain had
briefly put the blue-chip barometer above Friday's closing record
of 9,337.97. Analysts said the selloff was at least partly
triggered by Tuesday's remarks to Congress by Alan Greenspan, in
which the U.S. Federal Reserve chairman dashed hopes the central
bank might cut interest rates in response to a slowing economy.
Notably, the Nasdaq composite index tumbled to a 35-point loss even
though the technology-dominated measure was still flirting with a
10th straight record close with less than two hours left in the
session. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, while
proclaiming that the U.S. economy's performance so far this year
has been impressive, declared Tuesday that the central bank stood
poised to ``resist vigorously'' any threatened increase in
inflation. During his midyear report to Congress, Greenspan
signaled that central bank policy-makers were more concerned about
a potential outbreak of inflation than they were about the current
dramatic slowdown in economic activity. Even with his added
warnings about inflation risks, Greenspan gave no indication that
an increase in interest rates is imminent. (US-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's government vowed Tuesday to ignore
resistance from parliament and push ahead with an austerity program
_ raising hopes that a new international bailout may be the last it
needs. Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said the government will
impose the economic reforms _ including spending cuts and tougher
tax collection _ by decree if necessary. The reforms were demanded
by the International Monetary Fund as a condition for a new dlrs
11.2 billion loan approved Monday. The loan _ part of a package
expected to reach dlrs 17 billion this year and next _ is the
latest in a series Russia has received since post-Soviet economic
reforms began in 1992. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ In an attempt to bolster its
shattered economy, Pakistan unveiled a package Tuesday it hopes
will curb imports, increase exports and encourage reluctant
depositors to invest dollars in Pakistan. The Pakistan government
is blaming its economic woes on U.S.-led economic sanctions imposed
against Pakistan and India to punish the two uneasy neighbors for
conducting tit-for-tat nuclear tests in May. Aziz criticized
international lending institutions for withholding loans because of
sanctions and attacked previous Pakistani governments for spending
foreign exchange to finance its balance of payments deficit. ``The
easiest thing for us would have been to print more money, but that
would only have fueled inflation,'' Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz
said in a televised news conference where he announced the new
package. Pakistan has barely dlrs 600 million in foreign exchange,
which covers about four weeks of imports. (PAKISTAN-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Cast aside as an election-year liability by
the White House, President Bill Clinton's 1997 proposal for ``fast
track'' authority to negotiate international trade deals was jolted
back to life Tuesday by a Senate committee. The administration was
less than enthusiastic about the reawakening. Senate Democrats
accused Republican leaders of political gamesmanship, but many went
along in the name of freer trade. The Senate Finance Committee
attached the measure and other trade initiatives to a popular
House-passed bill designed to expand trade with Africa, then passed
the whole package 18-2. The maneuver guaranteed votes before
congressional elections on a hotly contested measure endorsed by
the president and business groups but strongly opposed by labor and
environmental groups. (US-CONGRESS-TRADE)

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Actress Jodie Foster is a mother for the
first time.
	   The Oscar-winning actress gave birth to a boy at 5:53 a.m.
Monday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, publicist Pat Kingsley said.
Charles Foster weighed 7 1/2 pounds (3.2 kilos) and was 20 1/2
inches (51 centimeters) long.
	   ``She couldn't be happier. She's happy as a lark,'' Ms. Kingsley
said.
	   Foster, whose movie credits include ``Taxi Driver'' and
``Silence of the Lambs,'' isn't married and she hasn't revealed the
name of the father.
	   The 35-year-old actress returned to her Los Angeles home with
her son on Tuesday.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ She's not the first person to waste violin
lessons.
	   Madonna has decided not to play the lead in ``50 Violins,'' a
movie about an inner-city music teacher, Miramax said Tuesday.
	   Wes Craven, the film's director, said the problem was ``genuine
mutual creative differences.''
	   Madonna's spokeswoman, Liz Rosenberg, did not immediately return
a call Tuesday.
	   Madonna spent three months learning the violin so she could play
the role of Roberta Tzavaris, who taught kids in East Harlem, Daily
Variety said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Ground control to davidbowie.com.
	   David Bowie said Monday he is launching his own Internet service
provider _ BowieNet _ in September at dlrs 19.95 a month.
	   BowieNet, at www.davidbowie.com, will offer high-speed Internet
service across North America and expand worldwide later in the
year. It will also offer e-mail service and special music and
entertainment access.
	   ``I wanted to create an environment where not just my fans but
all music lovers could be a part of the same community _ a single
place where the vast archives of music information could be
accessed, views stated and ideas exchanged,'' Bowie said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ The city dropped charges that Grammy-winning
singer R. Kelly played his car stereo too loudly back in April.
	   Kelly, known for the rhythm and blues hit ``I Believe I Can
Fly,'' was arrested after he allegedly refused to a request from
police to turn it down.
	   Jennifer Hoyle, a spokeswoman for the city's law department,
would not say why prosecutors dropped the noise charges Monday.
	   Charges of disorderly conduct and failure to produce a valid
driver's license were dropped in May.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Logic stands between Tom Hanks and bad-guy
roles.
	   ``The problem is that I'm always in search of logic in
storytelling,'' he said in this week's USA Weekend. ``And the bad
guys always suffer from faulty logic.''
	   Hanks stars with Matt Damon in ``Saving Private Ryan,'' a World
War II film that left Hanks thankful he never had to go to war.
	   ``I'm glad I didn't have to fight in any war. I'm glad I didn't
have to pick up a gun. I'm glad I didn't get killed or kill
somebody,'' he said. ``I hope my kids enjoy the same lack of
manhood.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ROCHESTER, Minnesota. (AP) _ Jordan's King Hussein plans to stay
at the Mayo Clinic for more tests nearly a week after spells of
high fever.
	   ``His fever has been brought under control and he's feeling
better,'' hospital spokeswoman Jane Jacobs said Monday.
	   She did not know how long he would remain here.
	   The 62-year-old king left for Minnesota on July 14, telling
state-run television he had been having high fevers three times a
day.
	   Jordanian doctors said last week they thought the king's illness
was a recurrence of a bout of bacteria that attacked his lymph
glands in October, when he suffered fever, fatigue and weight loss.
	   ___
	   LONDON (AP) _ Talk about devotion.
	   Kevin Spacey is taking a night off from his marathon London
stage role in Eugene O'Neill's ``The Iceman Cometh'' to undertake a
separate kind of marathon: heading to Los Angeles for the premiere
Wednesday of his film ``The Negotiator'' and then back to London in
time for his play on Thursday.
	   Spacey was scheduled to perform as usual Tuesday night his
highly acclaimed performance at the Old Vic playing anguished
salesman, Hickey.
	   The next morning, he was to take the Concorde to New York and
change to a plane for Los Angeles. After the premiere, he flies
back to New York in time for the morning Concorde back to London on
Thursday. That flight in turn gets him to Heathrow Airport a scant
90 minutes before Thursday's performance of the play starts.
	   ``Hopefully, nothing will be delayed,'' said Spacey, adding that
he and his colleagues ``have a good ending of the first act if I'm
not there.''
	   Spacey has agreed to an extra performance of the play on Sunday
_ the Oscar-winning actor's 39th birthday _ to make up for the
missed show. The sellout run of ``Iceman'' ends Aug. 1.
	   ``The Negotiator'' opens across the United States on July 29.

Japan's trade surplus rises in June, first half of 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's trade surplus with the world jumped 27
percent in June, the government said Wednesday, while soaring 66
percent during the first six months of the year.
	   The merchandise trade surplus _ a tally of goods the country
exports minus its imports _ rose to 1.218 trillion yen (dlrs 8.68
billion) from the same period last year, the Finance Ministry
announced.
	   Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United
States, meanwhile, increased 48.6 percent to 555.58 billion yen
(dlrs 4.0 billion) in June.
	   Japan's trade surplus has been rising as it imports fewer goods
during a prolonged slump. The country has come under increasing
pressure to revive its recession-plagued economy and help
struggling Asian nations by importing more.
	   For the first six months of 1998, Japan's surplus with the world
rose 66 percent to 6.567 trillion yen (dlrs 46.8 billion) from the
same period last year, the ministry said.
	   With the United States, Japan posted a six-month surplus of
3.074 trillion yen (dlrs 21.9 billion), up 37.7 percent from last
year.

Tsunami survivors huddle in the jungle

<TEXT>
	   VANIMO, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ They are huddled in small groups
deep in the jungle, far away from the sea that claimed so many of
their loved ones and friends.
	   These are the lost people of Sissano, the survivors of one of
the century's most catastrophic tsunami that four days ago washed
away villages where up to 10,000 people lived.
	   They are not hungry or in most cases even badly sick. They are
simply afraid that another wave with the roar of a jet and the
power of a bomb will engulf them.
	   No one knows how many there are, but as the bodies of their
loved ones and neighbors bloat and bleach in the Sissano lagoon and
along the beach of death, they wait.
	   Tas Maketu, a senior staffer with former prime minister and
elder statesman Sir Michael Somare, says the people will not come
out until someone they trust tells them there will be no more tidal
waves.
	   Maketu has spent all his life in Nimas village, one of four that
were located between the Bismark Sea and the Sissano lagoon on the
edge of the ``ring of fire'' volcanic belt around the Pacific
Ocean.
	   The remains of all four villages and many of their residents can
be seen floating in the lagoon.
	   ``Our church was imported from Germany and stood for 80 years,
but now it and everything else is gone,'' Maketu said.
	   A tear wells in his eye as he remembered his mother. She also
survived for about 80 years in Nimas, but the wave took her as
well.
	   Maketu will spend Wednesday night in the bush with his people,
trying to reassure them and to encourage them out of their jungle
hideouts.
	   ``I don't think they will listen. They can hunt and gather food
and there is plenty of good water so they might stay away for a
long time.''
	   One thing they won't eat is their normal luxury food, wild boar.
Those scavengers, along with the village dogs, have been feasting
on the remains of the dead.
	   Small patrols from the Papua New Guinea army, with Australian
military help, are searching for the lost people of Sisano there is hope.
	   On Tuesday, two 9-year-old girls were found alive on the beach
that bore the brunt of the giant wave. Later in the day nine more
people were found alive and reasonably well amongst the mangroves
where they had washed up miles (kms) from their villages.
	   As Tas Maketu put it, the disaster has destroyed the fabric of
village life for an estimated 10,000 people.
	   ``It has destroyed the very heart of our village way of life.
Our oral history and many of the next generation are gone
forever,'' he said.

Philippine Airlines ground crew union goes on strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Ground personnel at ailing Philippine
Airlines went on strike Wednesday, demanding the company recall
thousands of workers who were laid off during a recent devastating
pilots' strike.
	   ``The strike will last until the airline closes unless PAL
changes its position and recalls the retrenched workers,'' ground
crew union president Alex Barrientos told The Associated Press.
``We will not stop the strike.''
	   PAL has said a strike by its ground personnel could force Asia's
oldest airline to close down after 57 years of operation.
	   The airline said it had canceled all but two of its flights
Wednesday.
	   Philippine Airlines ground crew also service other carriers such
as China Airlines, Singapore Airlines and Northwest Airlines,
according to radio reports.
	   In June, PAL was embroiled in a crippling three-week pilots'
strike that brought the company close to financial ruin.
	   At the height of the strike, PAL laid off 5,000 of its nearly
14,000 workers to minimize its losses.
	   The ground personnel union then threatened to go on strike to
demand the reinstatement of the terminated workers but the labor
department assumed jurisdiction of the union's dispute with PAL on
July 10 and prohibited any work stoppage.
	   The labor department also ordered the airline to suspend any
more layoffs.
	   The union, however, said it would go ahead with the strike
plans.
	   Barrientos said union and company officials met the past two
nights to discuss a possible compromise involving the return of all
5,000 laid-off workers, to be followed by a formalized retrenchment
plan. However, the talks broke down Tuesday night, he said.
	   The union filed a second strike notice with the labor department
Tuesday afternoon charging an illegal lockout, union busting and
termination of union officers.
	   PAL senior vice president Avelino Zapanta said management can't
give in to the workers' demand since the airline already has
whittled down its operations following the pilots' strike.
	   PAL says it is unable to make payments on about dlrs 2 billion
of debt and is discussing a rehabilitation program with Manila's
Securities and Exchange Commission.
	   SEC chairman Perfecto Yasay expressed pessimism Wednesday over
whether that plan would be viable with the strike by ground
personnel.

Lomu takes new coif and attitude into South African game
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Jonah Lomu takes a new haircut _
and a freshly etched No. 11 on his left eyebrow _ into Saturday's
Tri-Nations rugby union test against South Africa.
	   But he admits he's lucky to make his 24th test appearance at
Athletic Park, and that similar chances could start drying up soon
unless he justifies his selection.
	   Like the rest of the All Black fans, team coach John Hart hopes
his big winger will regain his explosive 1995 World Cup form. Lomu
has had a tough time coming back from a kidney ailment that forced
him out for almost all of last season.
	   But the high expectation for success and pressure mounting on
Hart and his team, much of it perhaps unfair in a rebuilding
season, could lead to harsher scrutiny by the All Black selection
panel.
	   ``I felt sorry for Joeli (Vidiri) because he wasn't given many
opportunities to show what he's got,'' Lomu said Wednesday.
	   His fellow Counties-Manukau and Auckland Blues winger Vidiri
started in the Melbourne test against Australia two weeks ago and
Lomu took over from him in the second half and completed the match.
New Zealand lost 24-16.
	   Lomu put an enthusiastic 20-odd minutes into the match after an
anemic first half against England in the second test two weeks
earlier. He was dumped for Vidiri then.
	   ``It was, I suppose, the nature of the game,'' said Lomu. ``The
guys just wanted to get it over and done with and look forward to
the Tri-Nations.''
	   His selection for Saturday, however, still seems to be one based
on reputation rather than form.
	   ``I've got to get out and give a complete performance,'' he
said. ``It's another opportunity given to me and I've got to do
what I have to do _ play 80 minutes of footy.'' (djp)

Nigerian leader promises democracy, so why do Nigerians shrug?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo LON114 of July 20 &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ It was a sweeping announcement,
replete with denunciations of the former dictator's plans, the
abolishment of politically subservient parties, a promise of free
elections and a return to civilian rule for Nigeria.
	   For a country in search of democracy, there wasn't much more
that Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar could have promised.
	   But the announcement left Nigerians used to years of crippling
military rule with several questions: Why did Abubakar set no date
for presidential elections, and why is the transition planned for
the end of next May instead of earlier?
	   This West African nation, the continent's most populous, has
heard countless promises of democracy in its 38 years of
independence. Even its most callous dictators quickly learn the
tunes of empty political promises. Gen. Sani Abacha, the dictator
whose death last month ushered Abubakar into power, staged his 1993
coup and quickly promised real democracy _ later.
	   In reality, though, Nigeria's post-colonial political history
has been a litany of coups and military rulers. Nigerians, in turn,
have become a people steeped in political cynicism.
	   So it was no surprise that reaction to Abubakar's announcement
Monday night was mixed, a combination of wait-and-see optimism and
utter disdain. The government's most ardent critics are furious
that no interim government was quickly brought in, and will have to
wait for elections Abubakar promised for the first quarter of 1999.
	   Much of the praise for the speech came from average Nigerians,
who saw more hope in promises of pay reform and better telephone
systems than in vows of democracy.
	   To many Nigerians, Abubakar's vows will remain empty promises
until he actually follows through.
	   But Abubakar has been warmly welcomed by Nigeria's international
critics and his speech was one more reason for praise. And it was
the West, in part, that Abubakar was addressing.
	   He rules a country that should be living the good life, thriving
on huge oil reserves. Instead, corruption, neglect and political
isolation have crippled the country, and only a tiny percentage of
Nigerians live well. With the West's help _ from debt relief and
trade agreements to an end to travel restrictions on junta leaders
_ Abubakar knows his country could flourish.
	   Abubakar does have an established track record. He has freed
dozens of political prisoners and met with some of the country's
best-known opposition leaders. He admits that corruption has harmed
his country.
	   He also has risked alienating his fellow soldiers, some of whom
would pay a financial price by the rise of a civilian government.
The corruption-driven income that has made many generals rich would
suddenly be cut off.
	   Abubakar apparently doesn't fear his fellow generals. Most of
the pro-Abacha military claque has been farmed out to the
provinces, retired or has simply disappeared from view.
	   The danger for Abubakar if he fails to deliver will be from the
other side of Nigerian society _ the people who could take to the
streets in revolt.
	   In Nigeria, political troubles have traditionally been met more
often with grumbling complacency than revolt. But the country did
see days of rioting earlier this month following the death of
Moshood Abiola, the apparent winner of 1993's presidential
elections who had been jailed since 1994.
	   And Nigerians insist they will not accept another Abacha-style
leader.

Judge orders arrest of former Mexican prosecutor now in United
</HEADLINE>
States &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's government, repeatedly rebuffed in
attempts to extradite a former deputy attorney general from the
United States, appears to be setting up another extradition effort,
newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   Criminal court Judge Olga Sanchez Contreras told the
government's Notimex news agency Monday that she has ordered the
arrest of Mario Ruiz Massieu on charges of taking bribes to permit
drug trafficking.
	   Newspapers said the government would likely use the new charge
to try again to extradite Ruiz Massieu, who fled Mexico in 1995 in
a scandal linked to the arrest of the brother of former President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
	   Ruiz Massieu, under house arrest in New Jersey, has successfully
fought four extradition requests. Ruiz Massieu says he is innocent
and a victim of political persecution.
	   The new arrest warrant is based on testimony by drug traffickers
that Ruiz Massieu received payments while serving as Mexico's top
anti-drug prosecutor.
	   The head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, Thomas
Constantine, told reporters in Washington on Monday that his agency
supported efforts to extradite Ruiz Massieu to Mexico.
	   Mexican officials at first accused Ruiz Massieu of covering up
evidence implicating Raul Salinas de Gortari in the murder of the
prosecutor's own brother, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, a senior
political official. They later accused him of charges relating to
corruption in repeated efforts to win his extradition.
	   The U.S. government won a jury verdict last year allowing it to
seize dlrs 7.9 million from dlrs 9 million Ruiz Massieu had in bank
accounts in Texas, claiming the money came from drug traffickers.

Ullrich takes lead Tour de France with impressive ride

<TEXT>
	   LUCHON, France (AP) _ Any thoughts about Jan Ullrich being out
of shape for this year's Tour de France were changed the way he
looked up the final climb in Tuesday's 10th stage.
	   Looking straight ahead, legs pumping like pistons, he moved away
from the main pack and went after a small group of riders that had
established a lead of more than five minutes on three previous
climbs.
	   He had to do the pace-setting chores by himself. But it didn't
matter. He led the charge impressively, looking straight ahead
never faltering.
	   At the end of the stage, Ullrich was less than a minute behind
Rodolfo Massi, who was trailing Ullrich by more than five minutes
entering the day.
	   Although he came in eighth for the day, Ullrich still had enough
of a lead over his major rivals to take over first place by 1
minute 18 seconds over American Bobby Julich.
	   Now the yellow jersey is back on the German and it might be a
long time before someone can take it away.
	   Third was Bo Hamburger of Denmark, 2:17 behind.
	   Yet Ullrich had done the work needed to take back the leader's
yellow jersey. He won Saturday's time ich said. ``I'm in a really
good position. I had a good time trial (third) and I've had a good
first stage in the mountains (fourth).''
	   After two days of scorching heat, the Tour de France had a
relatively cool day.
	   Wednesday's 11th stage is more of the same with five climbs
including the finish up 1,750 meters (5,720 feet).
	   There is an off day on Thursday before the route continues
slowly across southern France before reaching the Alps on Monday
July 27.
	   As race entered the mountains, the winner of the top climber
award for the last four years is missing from the race.
	   Richard Virenque and the rest of the Festina team were kicked
out of the race last Friday night in the aftermath of the doping
scandal that has plagued the Tour from the start.
	   The doctor for the banned Festina team, Erik Ryckaert, contended
that his riders were ordered by their manager to pay for
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   And now the Dutch TVM team is under suspicion. It was reported
that the same drug used by the Festina team was found in the car of
TVM officials in March.
	   The Tour, which already has ejected Festina, threatens to do the
same to the Dutch team if it is shown those riders took illegal
drugs.
	   Roussel, Ryckaert and team masseur Wily Voet were still under
police custody and are expected to have their first confrontation
in court on July 24.
	   Before that the rest of the Festina team may be summoned by
police in Lille. Originally the investigation would have waited
until the Tour was over before hearing the riders.

Could doping scandals scare off sponsors?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ With daily revelations - and accusations - about
the use of illegal drugs in the Tour de France, cycling is reeling.
	   Now, questions are being raised about whether cycling's image
problem will have an impact on its ability to attract the corporate
sponsors that bankroll the sport.
	   ``Drug scandals are staining the Tour de France,'' said Matthew
Patten, chief executive of M and C Saatchi, a London-based company
that advises corporations on sports sponsorship.
	   ``They will definitely impact sponsorship. Behind closed doors,
sponsors will be asking themselves `Is this the sort of sport we
want to be involved in,''' Patten said in a telephone interview.
	   The scandals that have rocked cycling's premier event began when
customs officials found a stash of the illegal drug EPO in the car
of the Festina team's physiotherapist days before the start of the
Tour July 11.
	   The Festina team was thrown out of the race on Saturday, but
that wasn't the end of the controversy.
	   In an article published Tuesday by the French daily Le Parisien,
the Festina team's doctor alleged that riders were ordered by the
team manager to contribute to a fund used to buy illegal
substances.
	   ``The riders were obliged to put part of their win bonuses into
a `black box' fund to buy banned substances,'' Arsene Ryckaert,
lawyer for team doctor Eric Ryckaert, to whom he is not related,
was quoted by the paper as saying. ``These products, like regular
drugs, were held at Festina's headquarters in Lyon.''
	   The debate heated up further Tuesday when the International
Union of Cycling (UCI), the sport's governing body, asked the Dutch
cycling federation to investigate reports that EPO had been found
in the car of an official of the TVM team.
	   ``This whole affair is very worrying from a commercial point of
view. If people are cheating -- and it is clear that they are --
ways must be found to beat it,'' said Alan Rushton, managing
director of Sport For TV, the company that organized the first leg
of the 1998 Tour de France, in Ireland.
	   ``If a concerted effort is made, the position can be
recovered,'' he said in a telephone interview.
	   Problem is, stopping the use of EPO doping seems a forlorn hope.
	   ``EPO is completely undetectable unless we test on the same day
that the rider has taken the drug. Even then, it is undetectable
when taken with a growth hormone,'' Anne-Laure Masson, the UCI's
anti-doping coordinator, told The Associated Press.
	   ``Scientists have been working on this for years but we still
have no solution. This is a very big problem for the sport.''
	   That won't go unnoticed among the big corporate sponsors that
contribute almost all the funding to the Tour de France, and other
big cycling competitions.
	   For the privilege of festooning their logos on cyclists during
the three-week spectacle, sponsors cough up about 30 million francs
(dlrs 5 million) each.
	   And increasingly, it is not just corporate backers that are
approached to fund cycling.
	   The Irish government put up about half the 4.5 million Irish
pounds (dlrs 6.4 million) needed to stage the first leg of this
year's tour there.
	   While the drug controversies continue, such financial backing
could be in danger, according to Patten, of M and C Saatchi.
	   ``There is no question that this is effecting the credibility of
the sport and the people involved.
	   ``Over the next 12 months, Tour organizers are going to have
very serious problems convincing organizations that the race
presents the right image for sponsors.''
	   For now, sponsors are justifying their investments.
	   ``We can't say too much at the moment, but we are absolutely
sure that our team is clean,'' said Stephan Altoff, a spokesman for
Deutsche Telekom in a telephone interview.
	   Deutsche Telekom sponsored last year's winner, Jan Ullrich, a
leading rider in this year's Tour.

Atler wins Goodwill gold

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Best in the vault in the United
States, Vanessa Atler added a Goodwill Games gold medal Tuesday
night.
	   And she thought she could have done better.
	   Atler, who is also the U.S. national champion in the all-around,
scored 9.662 as the second gymnast on the vault.
	   ``I didn't think it would stand up,'' she said. ``I thought I'd
be fifth.''
	   Throughout, though, Atler, from Canyon Country, Calif., stayed
in front and claimed the gold medal over six other competitors.
	   ``My performance on a 1-to-10 was maybe an 8,'' she said. ``It
was not spectacular. I thought I did well and I was proud of
myself, but I still felt there was room for improvement.''
	   The silver medal went to Elena Dolgopolova of Russia with 9.600.
Simona Amanar of Romania, winner of the bronze in the all-around
competition on Sunday, took another bronze in the vault with a
9.587.
	   In the men's floor exercise, Alexei Nemov of Russia won the gold
with a score of 9.725. American Jay Thornton of Augusta, Ga., took
the silver with 9.550 and the bronze went to Alexei Bondarenko of
Russia with 9.525.
	   For Nemov, the reigning world and European champion in floor
exercise, it was an impressive recovery after a disappointing
seventh in the men's all-around on Monday. He had scored well in
the opening floor routine with a 9.450 but struggled after that.
	   It was Bondarenko's second medal of the competition. He won a
silver in the all-around.
	   American Sean Townshend of Houston fell and tumbled out of
bounds in the floor routine and finished last among the eight
gymnasts with 8.450.
	   Lan Sang of China was injured during warmups on the vault and
was forced to withdraw.
	   Dominique Moceanu of the United States and Ivan Ivankov of
Belarus, winners of the Goodwill all-around gold medals on the
first two nights of the games, did not compete on Tuesday.

	   The crime caused public outrage in United States, which strongly
supported the Salvadoran government during the 1980-1992 civil war.
The women were apparently killed because military-backed death
squads suspected them of sympathizing with leftist guerrillas.
	   Two more guardsmen are also eligible for parole under the new
law and may be released soon. The other two did not qualify for
release because one previously had been convicted on weapons
charges and the other had participated in a prison disturbance.

<TEXT>
	   VANIMO, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Rescue workers Wednesday had
trouble counting the dead from the tsunami that wiped out coastal
villages because rotting bodies were falling apart and had to be
gathered from a lagoon with nets.
	   Some 6,000 of the 8,000 to 10,000 people who lived in the area
are still missing, and Prime Minister Bill Skate says he holds
little hope many will be found alive.
	   The official death toll is over 1,200, but West Sepik provincial
governor John Tekwi told The Associated Press more than 3,000 died
in the 23-foot (7-meter) earthquake-generated waves that crashed
down on the once-idyllic villages along 18 miles (30 km) of Papua
New Guinea's north coast last Friday.
	   ``Knowing the population base of the villages affected and the
people who are there, that is my conservative estimate,'' Tekwi
said.
	   ``At Warapu village, there were 3,000-plus (people), now there
are only 760. Where are the rest?'' he asked.
	   So far, only 2,527 people have been found alive.
	   In Australia, the Salvation Army on Wednesday launched an appeal
for clothing for the survivors, but only called for adult clothes _
nearly all the children in the villages were killed by the deadly
waves.
	   Most of the confirmed dead and many of the missing are children,
victims of furious waters that nearly wiped out the next generation
in the seconds it took to toss people into trees, hurl them into a
lagoon or pull them back into the ocean.
	   Most children were home on a holiday when the waves struck,
rather than in religious mission schools farther inland where they
might have been safe. So many children died that some schools were
not expected to reopen.
	   Now the dead are a threat to the living. Doctors fear new
outbreaks of disease could be caused by the thousands of bodies
rotting in the tropical heat.
	   Crocodiles, dogs and pigs are feasting on the cadavers, and
officials have sent out hunting parties to shoot the scavengers.
	   Burials gave way to gasoline-fueled cremations on the spot as
rescue and recovery workers found the rotting corpses falling apart
in the tropical heat as they tried to move them.
	   Skate on Tuesday invoked emergency powers under the constitution
to put Police Commissioner Peter Agilo in complete control of the
rescue and relief operation.
	   This was intended to end the chaotic scene at local airstrips
where dozens of light and medium aircraft, helicopters and military
planes jostle for runway space, with little or no air control.
	   Skate said stage one of the operation, finding and rescuing the
injured, was now almost complete.
	   Stage two, locating and burying the dead and preventing disease,
will begin with a more coordinated operation.
	   ``For three days we have been flat out. We haven't known what we
are doing. From today, the police commissioner will be in
control,'' Skate told a crowd at Sissano.
	   Skate had a good look at the cause of potential disease, the
hundreds of bloated bodies still drifting in the placid waters,
simmering in the tropical heat.
	   His boat passed more than a dozen bodies caught in the floating
debris of houses or impaled on tough mangrove roots.
	   ``We have to look at the environment, because it really could be
infested. The water is contaminated and it is very very unhealthy.
	   ``I have to sit with the National Disaster Committee and discuss
whether we should evacuate this area, otherwise we will have more
people who will get sick and eventually die,'' he said.
	   The thousands of people displaced by the tsunami have been
warned to stay away from the low-lying beach.
	   On shore, soldiers, missionaries, aid workers and the healthier
surviving villagers use spades to dig shallow graves in the sand,
then don surgical gloves to wrap the corpses in sheets of black
plastic.
	   The burials are unceremonious, with sand quickly shoveled in and
stamped down with their feet. Then the team moves on to the next
body, the next grave.
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, occupies the
eastern half of the island of New Guinea about 90 miles (145
kilometers) north of Australia. Some of its people live a
near-Stone Age existence in the jungles and swamps.
	   The remoteness of the region hampered emergency officials from
Australia, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand, who were coordinating
a rescue operation.
	   The first of three Royal Australian Air Force C-130 Hercules
transport aircraft arrived at Vanimo on Monday with emergency
supplies, including a field hospital and a 100-strong team of
doctors, nurses and engineers.
	   The medics set up a tent hospital on a sports field and cared
for victims sent by three overcrowded hospitals. Many survivors
underwent amputations because bacteria-filled coral sand had
infected wounds, causing gangrene, said Lt. Col. John Crozer, a
surgeon.
	   By Tuesday night, the Australian medics estimated they had dealt
with about 90 percent of the survivors who were injured. Not many
more survivors were expected to emerge from the jungle.

	   QUEZALTEPEQUE, El Salvador (AP) _ A former national guardsman
walked out of prison Tuesday, paroled after serving 17 years of a
30-year prison sentence for the 1980 rape and murder of three
American nuns and a layworker.
	   Jose Roberto Moreno Canjura, one of five guardsmen sentenced for
the crimes in 1984, left the La Esperanza prison four miles (six
kilometers) north of San Salvador after he was released under a new
law intended to ease prison overcrowding.
	   Reporters reached by telephone outside the La Esperanza prison
confirmed that Moreno Canjura had been released.
	   Moreno Canjura and the four other guardsmen were convicted of
kidnapping, raping and killing Roman Catholic nuns Ita Ford,
Dorothy Kazel and Maura Clark and layworker Jean Donovan on Dec. 2,
1980.
	   The crime caused outrage in United States, which strongly
supported the Salvadoran government during the 1980-1992 civil war.
The women were apparently killed because military-backed death
squads suspected them of sympathizing with leftist guerrillas.
	   Two more guardsmen are also eligible for parole under the new
law and may be released soon. The other two did not qualify for
release because one previously had been convicted on weapons
charges and the other had participated in a prison disturbance.

Unprecedented mission, but will access be adequate?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELAINE GANLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A U.N. delegation is heading to Algeria on an
unprecedented mission seeking the sources of more than six years of
bloodshed. But questions remain over the group's ability to conduct
its investigation.
	   The two-week mission, beginning Wednesday, comes against a
backdrop of new violence in the north African country. More than 50
people were killed in three days last week, including two
sunbathers killed in a new form of violence: bombs hidden under the
sand on Mediterranean beaches.
	   The presence of the six-member delegation, led by former
Portuguese President Mario Soares, represents a breakthough in
international efforts to carry out an independent inquiry into the
violence in Algeria, which has taken an estimated 75,000 lives
since 1992.
	   The North African nation long resisted an inquiry, saying such a
probe would amount to interference in the country's internal
affairs.
	   Authorities blame the bloodshed on Islamic insurgents waging a
terror campaign to topple the military-backed government.
	   But suspicions have been raised that security forces or
government-armed militias may have had at least a passive role in
violence. Such questions led to pressure from the United States and
other nations for an independent investigation.
	   The big question is how much freedom of movement the delegation
will be allowed.
	   Can delegates visit massacre sites _ access denied a European
parliamentary delegation last February _ and will they meet with
leaders of the banned Islamic Salvation Front, a potentially
critical source of information?
	   U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos Brandt said earlier this month that
delegates have been assured ``free and complete access to all
sources of information.''
	   But Algeria's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Abdelaziz Sbaa, made
clear Tuesday that members of the mission are not to contact those
``outside the law,'' an apparent reference to the Salvation Front.
	   Soares, in a telephone interview Monday with The Associated
Press in Lisbon, suggested that Algerian authorities may have a say
in setting the agenda.
	   ``When we get there, we'll discuss with the authorities what
they want and what we want and we'll take it from there,'' Soares
said, declining to give further information.
	   The Salvation Front's imminent victory in January 1992
legislative elections led to a military coup. The army aborted the
voting, dismissed President Chadli Bendjedid and carried out a
brutal crackdown on Muslim fundamentalists.
	   That move triggered the insurgency and a self-perpetuating cycle
of violence.
	   Just last week, up to 21 people in a village near Tiaret, 250
kms (150 miles) southwest of Algiers, were reported massacred by
armed men in a scenario that has become customary. Less usual was
the late-night attack Saturday on an army barracks in the Chlef
mountains, 200 kms (125 miles) south of Algiers.
	   Most startling were the bombs hidden in sand at beaches in Rais
Hamidou, near Algiers, and Tipaza, further down the coast. The
unprecedented attacks Friday killed at least two sunbathers.
	   The outside world has been largely shielded from the true
nature, and extent, of the violence. Algerian media accounts are
controlled and visas difficult to obtain for foreign journalists,
whose movements there are controlled.
	   The New York-based group Human Rights Watch said Tuesday the
visit shouldn't be seen as a substitute for more in-depth
investigations by U.N. human rights experts.
	   Algeria has steadfastly rejected claims of serious human rights
problems despite reports by human rights groups of torture,
disappearances, extrajudicial killings and other atrocities.
	   U.N. human rights experts in Geneva expressed dismay after
concluding a review this week of Algeria's report on its human
rights situation. Committee members said queries had not been
adequately addressed.
	   ``What we are looking for are some answers,'' said Thomas
Buergenthal, of the United States.
	   Accompanying Soares are: former Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral, former Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim Kabariti,
the attorney-general of Kenya, Amos Wako, the former American U.N.
ambassador Donald McHenry, and Simone Veil, France's former health
minister.

Dollar higher, Tokyo stocks fall in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen early
Wednesday as Tokyo stock prices opened lower, prompting Japanese
and overseas investors to buy back the U.S. currency.
	   The dollar bought 140.24 yen in early trading, up 0.76 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo but below its late New York rate of 140.40
yen overnight.
	   Traders said the yen came under pressure as a fall in the shares
of the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan also hurt sentiment.
	   LTCB shares have dropped dramatically in the last two months
amid rumors the bank was having trouble staying afloat, raising
renewed concern over Japan's financial system.
	   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments indicating
that the Fed had no plans to lower interest rates in the short term
also supported the dollar.
	   Greenspan made the remarks in mid-year testimony before the
Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday. His comments dashed traders'
hopes the Fed might reduce interest rates to stimulate the economy
if it falters.
	   On the stock market, an overnight tumble on Wall Street was
having a negative effect on the Tokyo market. The Dow Jones
industrial average closed at 9,190.19 points on Tuesday, down
105.56.
	   In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 115.68 points,
or 0.70 percent, to 16,441.01 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Tuesday, the average lost 14.09 points, or 0.09
percent.
	   The market was also being hurt by concerns that Foreign Minister
Keizo Obuchi will win the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's
election Friday for its next president, who will succeed Ryutaro
Hashimoto as prime minister.
	   ``What the market wants is drastic financial reforms, but Obuchi
seems to lack the ability to launch such reforms,'' said Sachio
Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities.
	   Opinion polls show greater public support for Health Minister
Junichiro Koizumi and veteran politician Seiroku Kajiyama. But the
mathematics of LDP factional politics suggest Obuchi is leading the
race, Japanese newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 9.89 points, or 0.77 percent, to 1,267.28.
On Tuesday, the TOPIX closed down 0.78 points, or 0.06 percent, the
day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.400 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.415 percent, driving its price up to 110.39 yen from 110.30 yen.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Four members of a U.N. observer mission
were ambushed, shot and killed while on patrol in Tajikistan, U.N.
officials said.
	   The U.N. report differed from that of Tajik officials, who said
the observers died in an accident when their car plunged off a
cliff in the Pamir Mountains about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east
of Dushanbe, capital of the Central Asian country.
	   The U.N. report came too late in the day for Tajik officials to
comment.
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said information from U.N. officials
at the site confirmed the four men were shot and killed Monday
while on the road from Tavildara to Garm, about 90 miles (144
kilometers) east of the capital. The four failed to report back to
headquarters Monday and were found Tuesday.
	   The U.N. special representative for Tajikistan, Jan Kubis,
recalled all field teams to Dushanbe and was in contact with the
president and opposition groups to ensure those responsible were
brought to justice, Eckhard said.
	   ``The members of the Security Council condemn this murder,''
council President Sergey Lavrov of Russia said after the council
was briefed on the deaths.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan was ``deeply depressed'' about the
deaths and condemned them, Eckhard said.
	   The dead were identified as military observers Maj. Ryszard
Szcwczyk of Poland and Maj. Adolfo Sharpegue of Uruguay; civil
affairs officer Yutaka Akino of Japan; and a Tajik translator,
Jourajon Mahramov.
	   ``With determination we denounce this act of murder and demand
that anyone involved be strictly punished,'' Japanese Foreign
Minister Keizo Obuchi said Wednesday.
	   About 70 U.N. observers are in Tajikistan to monitor a peace
deal reached last year that ended the former Soviet republic's
civil war.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A U.N. delegation is heading to Algeria on an
unprecedented mission seeking the sources of more than six years of
bloodshed. But questions remain over the group's ability to conduct
its investigation.
	   The two-week mission, beginning Wednesday, comes against a
backdrop of new violence in the north African country. More than 50
people were killed in three days last week, including two
sunbathers killed in a new form of violence: bombs hidden under the
sand on Mediterranean beaches.
	   The presence of the six-member delegation, led by former
Portuguese President Mario Soares, represents a breakthough in
international efforts to carry out an independent inquiry into the
violence in Algeria, which has taken an estimated 75,000 lives
since 1992.
	   The North African nation long resisted an inquiry, saying such a
probe would amount to interference in the country's internal
affairs.
	   Authorities blame the bloodshed on Islamic insurgents waging a
terror campaign to topple the military-backed government.
	   But suspicions have been raised that security forces or
government-armed militias may have had at least a passive role in
violence. Such questions led to pressure from the United States and
other nations for an independent investigation.
	   The big question is how much freedom of movement the delegation
will be allowed.
	   Can delegates visit massacre sites _ access denied a European
parliamentary delegation last February _ and will they meet with
leaders of the banned Islamic Salvation Front, a potentially
critical source of information?
	   U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos Brandt said earlier this month that
delegates have been assured ``free and complete access to all
sources of information.''
	   But Algeria's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Abdelaziz Sbaa, made
clear Tuesday that members of the mission are not to contact those
``outside the law,'' an apparent reference to the Salvation Front.
	   Soares, in a telephone interview Monday with The Associated
Press in Lisbon, suggested that Algerian authorities may have a say
in setting the agenda.
	   ``When we get there, we'll discuss with the authorities what
they want and what we want and we'll take it from there,'' Soares
said, declining to give further information.
	   The Salvation Front's imminent victory in January 1992
legislative elections led to a military coup. The army aborted the
voting, dismissed President Chadli Bendjedid and carried out a
brutal crackdown on Muslim fundamentalists.
	   That move triggered the insurgency and a self-perpetuating cycle
of violence.
	   Just last week, up to 21 people in a village near Tiaret, 250
kms (150 miles) southwest of Algiers, were reported massacred by
armed men in a scenario that has become customary. Less usual was
the late-night attack Saturday on an army barracks in the Chlef
mountains, 200 kms (125 miles) south of Algiers.
	   Most startling were the bombs hidden in sand at beaches in Rais
Hamidou, near Algiers, and Tipaza, further down the coast. The
unprecedented attacks Friday killed at least two sunbathers.
	   The outside world has been largely shielded from the true
nature, and extent, of the violence. Algerian media accounts are
controlled and visas difficult to obtain for foreign journalists,
whose movements there are controlled.
	   The New York-based group Human Rights Watch said Tuesday the
visit shouldn't be seen as a substitute for more in-depth
investigations by U.N. human rights experts.
	   Algeria has steadfastly rejected claims of serious human rights
problems despite reports by human rights groups of torture,
disappearances, extrajudicial killings and other atrocities.
	   U.N. human rights experts in Geneva expressed dismay after
concluding a review this week of Algeria's report on its human
rights situation. Committee members said queries had not been
adequately addressed.
	   ``What we are looking for are some answers,'' said Thomas
Buergenthal, of the United States.
	   Accompanying Soares are: former Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral, former Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim Kabariti,
the attorney-general of Kenya, Amos Wako, the former American U.N.
ambassador Donald McHenry, and Simone Veil, France's former health
minister.

Zagat arrives: Can the `people's guide' conquer Paris?

	   PARIS (AP) _ For a Paris chef, Edouard Carlier should be pretty
content. His Montmartre restaurant, A. Beauvilliers, is one of the
most lavish and romantic spots in this lavish and romantic city.
	   But there's one thing Carlier isn't happy about. Not at all.
	   It's a little burgundy-colored book that just hit Paris. It
rates restaurants not with stars or little chef's hats, but with
quotes _ from real customers. It's called the Zagat guide.
	   ``It is kind of a joke,'' Carlier says, though clearly he's not
very amused.
	   ``It's not objective at all,'' he continues. ``And the paper is
cheap, and the type is bad.''
	   Could this have something to do with his review? A. Beauvilliers
is ranked 27th out of 825 restaurants _ not shabby at all. But
along with praise for the ``delicious'' food come these
admonishments:
	   ``Pretentious.''
	   ``Odiously expensive.''
	   ``Irreproachable'' service _ ``when they recognize you.''
	   The Zagat guides are hugely successful in the United States,
used like bibles by urban food lovers from New York to Chicago to
San Francisco. There's one in London, too.
	   But Paris _ well, that's a whole different affair. In this
food-worshiping town, ``the customer is always right'' is not a
well-known concept.
	   Foreigners can wither under the gaze of a waiter who insists the
bloody meat is really ``medium.''
	   Send a dish back to the kitchen in New York, and you'll likely
get an apology and a new one. In Paris, you might get an indignant
look, or more: recently in the Marais district, a chef plopped down
at the complaining customer's table and ate the dish himself _ to
prove it was edible.
	   Carlier says he objects to the anonymity of the amateur critics.
``Imagine somebody doesn't like me,'' he said. ``All they have to
do is send a letter to Zagat.''
	   So can a food guide by the people and for the people survive in
Paris?
	   Emmanuel Nguyen, 28, was fingering the new guide at a
Champs-Elysees bookstore Tuesday, trying to decide whether the
upstart or the trusted Michelin would be more useful in planning a
friend's birthday outing.
	   ``This would be good for things you wouldn't normally think
of,'' he said of Zagat's. But he was still undecided.
	   Authors Tim and Nina Zagat say they're pleased with the
reception they've gotten in the Paris food world.
	   ``People have been much friendlier, much more accepting than we
thought,'' Tim Zagat said recently over a sandwich in the courtyard
of the Crillon Hotel. (He was safe; its restaurant ranked 13th.)
	   To compile the survey, editors sent questionnaires to law firms,
banks and the like. About 1,700 people responded, grading eateries
on cuisine, decor, service and wine.
	   The result is a guide that includes categories like
``Hip-Intellectual,'' ``For Expense Accounts,'' and ``See and Be
Seen.''
	   It was supposed to include a list of places that allow dogs, so
beloved to Parisians. ``But the list was too long _ it turned out
almost everybody allows dogs,'' Nina Zagat said.
	   Priced at 69 francs (dlrs 13), the guide has sold about 25,000
copies of an initial 40,000-volume printing since it debuted a
month ago, says its distributor, Alain Flammarion. ``That's pretty
good,'' Flammarion said. ``This is a new concept in France.''
	   The New York, Zagat's sells 50,000 copies a month.
	   The Paris guide includes pizza joints and cafes, but its top
rankings include the usual greats. In first place is the venerable
Taillevent, described as ``simply the best.''
	   Naturally, its chef is quite pleased.
	   ``I think it's a sensational concept _ letting the customer
decide,'' said Philippe Legendre.
	   ``I think I'd say that even if my place ranked third or
fourth.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The heaviest fighting in weeks has
cast new doubt on peace efforts in Kosovo and has increased fears
that the violence could spill into neighboring Macedonia.
	   A fourth day of clashes near the strategic town of Orahovac in
central Kosovo left at least 36 ethnic Albanians dead Tuesday,
Albanian sources said.
	   The fighting cast doubt on the possibility of a negotiated
settlement between Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia, and
the independence-minded ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of
Kosovo's population.
	   The continued fighting also led the U.N. Security Council to
vote Tuesday to expand the peacekeeping force in Macedonia.
	   In an attempt to cobble together peace talks in Kosovo,
Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, met Tuesday
with Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate ethnic Albanian leader. Hill had
conferred with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade on
Monday.
	   Before meeting with Rugova, Hill indicated no quick solution to
the Kosovo crisis was in sight.
	   Rugova's party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, on Tuesday
condemned what it called the ``violence and massacre by Serb forces
in Orahovac.'' The town appeared largely under Serb control after
the Kosovo Liberation Army launched a strong attack there Saturday.
	   The capture of Orahovac, located about 30 miles (50 kilometers)
southwest of the provincial capital, Pristina, would have expanded
the nearly 40 percent of Kosovo the KLA is said to control _ and
given the rebels command of a strategic road.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which is close to ethnic Albanian
politicians, claimed Serb forces were still shelling KLA positions
in Orahovac on Tuesday and that fighting was also raging in
outlying villages.
	   It said at least 36 Albanians had been killed, including women
and children.
	   Meanwhile, the Security Council on Tuesday unanimously agreed to
add about 300 troops to the 750-strong U.N. force and extended its
mandate until Feb. 28. Americans will make up about half of the
total force.

Brazilian record industry launches anti-piracy campaign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Kicking off an anti-piracy
campaign, Brazilian country singer Roberta Miranda drove a steam
roller over 5,000 illegally copied compact discs Tuesday.
	   Some 15 million pirated CDs and cassettes were sold in Brazil so
far in 1998, or five times more than were sold in 1997, said Marcio
Cunha G. Goncalves, executive secretary of the Association for
Protection of Phonographic Intellectual Rights.
	   ``The growth of digital piracy puts the whole record industry
and the growth of Brazilian music at risk. It also hurts jobs
created by the music industry,'' Cunha said.
	   The pirated discs and cassettes cost the record industry an
estimated 250 million reals (dlrs 217 million) this year, Cunha
said.
	   Cunha estimates 98 percent of the cassettes and 20 percent of
the CDs currently on the market are fakes.

Kidnappings, restive tribesmen _ and booming tourism _ in Yemen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo SAN101 &QL; 
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ In a travel brochure, it might give a
prospective tourist nightmares: a destination with three times as
many weapons as people, fearsome tribesmen with a nasty penchant
for kidnapping foreigners and a rugged outback well beyond the law.
	   In Yemen, despite all that _ and perhaps, just perhaps, because
of it _ tourism is booming. The number of visitors to the land of
the Queen of Sheba has doubled in three years, bringing dlrs 69
million to one of the Arab world's poorest countries.
	   For the daring, who come mostly from Europe, Yemen offers a
window on history, ancient but still stunning cities where caravans
of antiquity took on spices and incense. The country's coral reefs
are pristine, its mountains awesome.
	   ``Here, you discover the beauty of the country, the beaches, the
desert, the sea and the unique architecture,'' said Yahya Othman,
who organizes tours for Arabian Horizons in San`a, the capital.
	   But you might discover kidnappers, too.
	   Tribesmen across lawless swaths of Yemen have abducted more than
250 foreigners since 1991, often in broad daylight. The German
ambassador's daughter, a 3-year-old South Korean girl and a group
of seven Italians were among victims of this replay of traditional
tribal hostage-taking.
	   Kidnappers' demands range from compensation for money lost to a
crooked car dealer to freedom for kinsmen arrested for earlier
abductions. Often, they simply want more government services in
their neglected regions. Every tourist was released unharmed,
usually after a few days of rigorous bargaining.
	   But the problem remains _ what to do about the kidnappings?
	   Omar M. Omar, an owner of Universal Touring, one of Yemen's
largest tour companies, has his own solution. He pays the tribes
off _ sometimes as much as dlrs 150 for a convoy of three or four
cars. During peak season, the bribes may cost him dlrs 7,350 a
month.
	   ``I write the checks myself,'' he said, grinning.
	   His company even wrote tour operators a letter this month
titled, ``Kidnappings in Yemen: Myth and Reality.''
	   The abductions seem to have little effect on tourism. About
84,000 visitors came in 1997, the peak year for kidnappings. In
fact, in every year since 1994 that abductions increased, so did
tourism.
	   Othman lost two tourists one night to tribesmen in the northern
city of Saada, famous for its silver jewelry and situated on an old
caravan route. He said they emerged the next morning invigorated
after the kidnappers slaughtered a goat in their honor.
	   ``Some people ask me, `Can you arrange a kidnapping tour?''' he
said. ``I don't know if they're joking or telling the truth. Maybe
some of them are serious, but we can't do it.''
	   The tourists themselves take it in stride. Many are from a hardy
lot who have toured much of the Middle East.
	   Some say they were drawn by the towers of Hadrawmawt Valley,
where buildings of mud, straw and dung can rise eight stories.
Others are attracted to the soaring minarets frosted with gypsum in
San`a. Ma'rib, the ancient capital of Sheba, enchants others.
	   And few, it seems, prepare for possible trouble.
	   ``If you mean malaria tablets, yes, but that's the only
precaution we took. We don't carry a weapon,'' said Nancy
Passchier, a Dutch tourist visiting a palace improbably perched
atop a 60-foot-high (18-meter) outcropping outside San`a.
	   Kidnappings are not Yemen's only scourge. In provinces where
every man and more than a few boys carry a dagger and rifle,
tribesmen have escalated their fight with a government they believe
has failed to provide them with hospitals, schools and roads.
	   On Tuesday, tribesmen opened fire on a convoy carrying Yemen's
interior minister and other officials, injuring a provincial
governor and six security guards. A tribal leader said the ambush
was carried out by tribesmen protesting a 40 percent government
hike in fuel prices.
	   Protests had rocked Yemeni cities last month when the government
raised the fuel prices. And a simmering border dispute with Saudi
Arabia has threatened to flare up.
	   Government officials have promised to tighten security, saying
they will send bigger forces into lawless regions and propose
legislation to execute kidnappers.
	   But they say the violence can only dent a growing industry.
Tourism brings in 13 percent of government revenue, and Abdul Malek
Mansour, the tourism and culture minister, wants it to reach 50
percent in five years.
	   ``Oil runs out eventually,'' he said, ``but the supply of
tourists will never be exhausted.''
	   His ministry has begun publishing glossy, professional brochures
with maps, pictures and history.
	   The slogan on one: ``Yemen, be ready to be astounded.''

Lithuanian independence hero loses luster

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Ten years ago, Vytautas Landsbergis
galvanized his countrymen's desires for freedom from Soviet
domination and led them on the road to independence.
	   Today, most see him as an awkward relic. From the height of
popularity, he has fallen to being one of the country's
most-criticized politicians.
	   With the founding of the Sajudis movement in June 1988,
Landsbergis became the Baltic states' most prominent dissident. To
the West, he was the embodiment of the changes shaking the Soviet
Union into collapse.
	   Landsbergis' charisma stemmed from his prickly dignity, his
absolute confidence in his own beliefs and his gift for vivid,
moralizing rhetoric _ the same qualities that now plague him in his
political decline.
	   While grateful to him for fearlessly standing up to the Kremlin,
many Lithuanians now find Landsbergis' adamant approach out of step
with the country's nascent democracy, where compromise and
cooperation are more important than rigid determination.
	   ``Destiny gave him a great chance to become a political leader
in such an exciting time, but this opportunity was spoiled by his
own character,'' says Kazimieras Motieka, a former Landsbergis
ally.
	   How far Landsbergis, the speaker of Parliament, has fallen was
painfully clear in December's presidential election. He finished a
distant third behind two political newcomers, including winner
Valdas Adamkus, a Lithuanian-American regarded with wide skepticism
because he had lived abroad for more than 50 years.
	   Reflecting the differences between Lithuania's new and old
waves, Adamkus on July 10 vetoed a Landsbergis-drafted law that
would have denied a wide range of government and private jobs to
former KGB operatives.
	   In a poll published in June by the respected newspaper Lietuvos
Rytas, respondents gave Landsbergis the second-lowest approval
rating among 30 top politicians.
	   The 65-year-old Landsbergis' luster has been tarnished by a
number of incidents.
	   He lost much standing with Lithuanian news media after proposing
a government agency be set up to monitor the portrayal of sex and
violence on television _ a move criticized as tantamount to forming
a censorship board.
	   He met the opposition in a typically caustic way. ``It seems to
me that Lithuanian society is not mature enough for the proposals
we made,'' he said at the time.
	   Last year, he embarrassed many Lithuanians when he complained
the European Union's failure to invite their country to join was
like the Soviet-Nazi Germany pact that divided Europe into spheres
of influence.
	   His reputation was further hurt this spring when news reports
said he was behind an alleged Interior Ministry program to carry
out surveillance of journalists, political leaders and their
families.
	   The ministry unit that reportedly did the work has been
disbanded, but the controversy continues in the press and confirms
many people's belief that Landsbergis is a potentially disruptive
remnant of a more suspicious time.
	   ``Landsbergis does not have a serious political future,'' says
Rimvydas Valatka, political analyst at the newspaper Lietuvos
Rytas.
	   ``He has made the mistake of relying on a limited segment of
society for support and he cannot accept anyone who does not agree
with him 100 percent. His elderly electorate is dying out and the
younger generation will not accept someone who dictates to them.''
	   Landsbergis, however, expresses confidence he is on the right
track.
	   ``I also heard questions about whether I was tired of politics
in 1991 and 1992,'' he says. ``I did not go then, nor I am I going
to go now.''

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A third round of talks aimed at
resolving a standoff between Protestant marchers and security
forces blocking them from parading through a hostile Catholic
neighborhood has broken up without agreement.
	   But go-betweens said some progress had been made at Tuesday
night's talks between the Orange Order and residents of Garvaghy
Road in Portadown, 40 miles (65 kilometers) northwest of Belfast.
	   Police and soldiers, enforcing an order by the
government-appointed Parades Commission, prevented members of the
Orange Order from marching down the Garvaghy Road on July 5.
	   Orangemen gathered on a nearby hillside every night for a week,
underlining their determination to follow their traditional parade
route. But the number of protesters fell after arsonists killed
three young sons of a Catholic woman July 12 in the town of
Ballymoney, 40 miles (65 kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   Thomas Robert Garfield Gilmour, 23, of Ballymoney appeared in
court Tuesday on charges of murdering the Quinn brothers _ Richard
11, Mark, 10, and Jason, 9 _ in the firebombing. He denied the
charges and denied being a member of any paramilitary organization.
	   Gilmour was ordered jailed until a court appearance on Aug. 12.
	   A number of people are being held for questioning in the case,
but police declined Tuesday to give a specific number.
	   Police believe the family was targeted because the boy's mother,
29-year-old Chrissie Quinn, was a Catholic who lived with a
Protestant boyfriend.
	   The attack was the worst incident of violence during the
standoff, in which churches were burned, vehicles set ablaze, homes
firebombed and police pelted with gasoline bombs. Police used
plastic bullets to repel protesters who attacked them and tried to
breach the barriers separating them from the Catholic neighborhood.
	   Stunned by the killings of the Quinn brothers, some leaders of
the Orange Order called for an end to the confrontation between its
marchers and security forces.
	   The talks were set up 10 days ago at the height of the
confrontation.
	   On Tuesday, the two delegations remained in separate rooms, with
officials shuttling communications between them.
	   Garvaghy Road residents criticized the Orange delegation for
refusing to meet them face to face but said they remained open to
continuing the process.

Ducks hire Hartsburg as coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANAHEIM, California (AP) _ Craig Hartsburg, fired by the Chicago
Blackhawks after they failed to make the National Hockey League
playoffs for the first time since 1969, was hired Tuesday as coach
of the Anaheim Mighty Ducks.
	   Hartsburg, 39, was the second choice of Ducks general manager
Jack Ferreira, who initially offered the job to minor-league coach
Butch Goring. Goring turned it down in a salary disagreement.
	   He replaces Pierre Page, who was fired in June after 10 months
on the job. The Ducks were 26-43-13 and failed to make the playoffs
last season.
	   Hartsburg played 10 years in the NHL with the Minnesota North
Stars before injuries forced him to retire during the 1988-89
season. Ferreira, then the North Stars general manager, immediately
hired Hartsburg as an assistant. From there, Hartsburg spent four
seasons an an assistant in Philadelphia and coached one season in
the Ontario Hockey League before becoming coach of the Blackhawks
in 1995.
	   ``It's a fresh start for myself, for the organization and for
the players,'' said Hartsburg, who had a 104-102-40 record in
Chicago.
	   He led the Hawks to the playoffs in his first two seasons, but
they finished five points out of a playoff spot last season.
	   The Ducks finished next-to-last in the Western Conference and
23rd out of 26 NHL teams overall last season. Injuries to stars
Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne, along with forwards Steve Rucchin,
Travis Green and Scott Young, didn't help.

Hero or traitor? Ex-NATO spy fights for rehabilitation in Hungary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY302 &QL; 
 &UR; By EVA KEKES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ He says he was looking for adventure
and excitement, guided by the conviction that spying for the West
behind the Iron Curtain was a just cause.
	   Now, after serving nine years in prison for espionage, Gabor
Rimner just wants a clean slate in his native country.
	   Fed up with being a second-class citizen long after the collapse
of communism, the 44-year-old Hungarian is seeking legal
rehabilitation for himself and a dozen others accused as Western
spies.
	   ``I always felt that what I did deserved a pat on the back,
rather than punishment,'' says Rimner, who claims to have spied on
Hungary's communist regime for the United States from 1973 to 1981.
	   American officials in Budapest and Washington declined to
comment on Rimner's story.
	   A tall, thin man with glasses, Rimner looks more like a
schoolteacher than James Bond. But in a recent interview, while
smoking cigarette after cigarette, he told tales of intrigues and
risks from a spy's career he still hopes will have a happy ending.
	   It looked that way in 1990, when he and everyone else held in
jail by the communists for spying were released on parole. But
under terms of his conviction, he remains deprived of full
citizenship rights until 2003, along with the others in similar
situations.
	   Rimner, who claims to have accepted only token pay for his years
providing information to the West, is leading a lonely campaign to
get authorities _ and the Hungarian public _ to recognize that
espionage isn't always treason.
	   ``They say we sold our homeland. Those who say this don't know
the difference between homeland and regime,'' he says, expressing
pride for his small role in the fight against Soviet ideology.
	   The debate isn't limited to Hungary. A former Polish army
officer who spied for the West before defecting in 1981 visited his
homeland in early May and set off contentious discussions about his
acts. Some Poles praised him for helping communism's opponents, but
many disdained him as a traitor.
	   Rimner was raised in Sudan after his father, an architect, got a
UNESCO job in the African nation in 1965.
	   A speaker of Arabic, English and French, he says he was
approached after high school graduation by an American diplomat who
asked him to work for the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency. The
glamour of spying appealed to him; so did the idea of working
against the communists his family despised.
	   ``When I was a kid I was taught by my parents that whatever goes
on in Hungary under the Soviets is colonization,'' he says.
	   Following secret training at military bases in Greece and
elsewhere in Europe, while ostensibly living in Sudan, he returned
to Hungary in 1973. His task: infiltrate the defense and interior
ministries and provide information about the 70,000 Soviet military
personnel in Hungary.
	   Translating jobs at the ministries were easy to find, useful
information not so easy. But one day, by chance, he made what he
calls ``a huge catch.''
	   While escorting a foreign military delegation to a high-security
Soviet army base, he saw military vehicles that were designed to
carry intercontinental ballistic missiles.
	   ``They had always denied the existence of ICBMs in Hungary, but
this was clear proof, as those vehicles could not have been used to
carry anything else,'' Rimner says.
	   He says he burst with pride when those ``nonexistent'' missiles
were withdrawn after communism ended in Hungary.
	   He says he communicated with his spymasters by marking lines or
circles on a wall or tree. Similar markings left in response meant
he was to go to a prearranged spot to pick up or leave parcels.
	   His spying career came to an end in 1981 after a police officer
acted on suspicions voiced out loud in a bar by Rimner's bitter
ex-girlfriend.
	   A few days later, he was walking in downtown Budapest in broad
daylight when two men grabbed him, pushed him into a car and drove
to his home _ ``exactly like in the spy movies,'' he says. There,
they tied him to a chair and searched his apartment all night until
they found incriminating evidence: a microfilm reader, a camera and
maps.
	   He was convicted and sentenced to 12 years in prison, plus an
additional 10 years during which he cannot vote or hold certain
jobs.
	   In jail, he put together a Hungarian-Arabic dictionary
containing 17,000 words.
	   When he was released, he says, he refused an offer of asylum in
the United States so he could live under a political system he had
long awaited at home. But eight years later, he's still
dissatisfied.
	   Most of the other ex-Western spies keep a low profile, wary of
repercussions for their families.
	   Not Rimner.
	   ``Despite all the negative aspects, if I could start my life
again, I would make the same decisions,'' he says. ``I'm convinced
that what I did was right.''

Annan lauds Guatemala's progress in moving toward peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo GUA108 &QL; 
 &UR; By KEN GUGGENHEIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan lauded
Guatemala's progress since its civil war ended 1 1/2 years ago, but
said more work needs to be done.
	   ``When one signs a peace agreement, the pact in itself is not
the end of it,'' he said Tuesday, ending a 24-hour visit to the
Central American country.
	   ``To get the peace to take root, to get a society that has been
at war for so long to accept the culture of peace ... you have to
work at it. It takes time,'' he said.
	   Annan visited Guatemala to examine the progress made since a
December 1996 peace agreement ended at 36-year civil war that left
an estimated 200,000 people dead or missing. The United Nations
helped negotiate an end to the conflict and has played a major role
in overseeing the execution of the peace accords.
	   Annan's visit included meetings with President Alvaru Arzu and
government officials, leaders of the former guerrillas, church
officials, and members of the truth commission.
	   Those he met with ``believe that the Guatemala of today is not
the Guatemala of 1996'' and that social, political and economic
process has been made.
	   ``Despite the obstacles and the struggles, you have achieved a
lot from the reports I have read and from the discussions I have
had,'' he said. ``But the road is by no means going to be easy. ''
	   Many of the obstacles were apparent in the days leading up to
Annan's visit.
	   Hours before Annan arrived, an Italian priest, Pablo Sebastiano
Crestani, was wounded as he left a church in the capital. The
motive is unknown. The shooting follows the April killing of Bishop
Juan Gerardi, who was bludgeoned to death days after presenting a
report blaming the army for most of the wartime atrocities. That
crime has not been solved.
	   In northern Guatemala, a grenade apparently left over from the
war exploded Sunday in a soccer field, killing six children and an
adult.
	   And days before Annan's arrival, an army colonel was jailed
after telling a Radio Netherlands interviewer that the army should
recognize its ``excesses'' committed during the war. Rights
advocates fear the arrest may discourage soldiers from discussing
wartime abuses.
	   Annan denounced the shooting of the priest and the Gerardi
killing. ``I think this sort of brutal, senseless and cowardly
killing has no place in a nation that is searching for peace.''
	   Annan left Guatemala for Mexico, the last stop on his
five-nation Latin American tour.
	   He said he planned to discuss the recent U.N. drug conference
and the agreement signed in Rome on Saturday creating a permanent
war crimes tribunal.
	   Annan's last-minute trip to Rome to attend the signing ceremony
forced him to cut short what had been planned as a three-day trip
to Guatemala.

Media polls show Obuchi leading in Japanese prime minister race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi is leading in the
three-way race for the Japan's ruling party nomination for prime
minister, but is short of winning a majority in the first balloting
by lawmakers, surveys by Japanese media showed Wednesday.
	   The vote Friday by 366 Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers and 47
prefectural representatives will choose the party president. The
winner is virtually assured of becoming prime minister because the
party commands a majority in the lower house of Parliament.
	   If none of the three candidates wins a majority in the first
balloting, or at least 207 votes, a run-off between the two top
candidates will be held to pick a successor to Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto, who is quitting after party losses in the July
12 upper house election.
	   The media companies _ two major papers and a TV network _
surveyed LDP delegates to see how they would vote.
	   The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reported that nearly 180 LDP
delegates support Obuchi. About 95 said they support Health
Minister Junichiro Koizumi, and 65 were for former Chief Cabinet
Secertary Seiroku Kajiyama.
	   Obuchi's camp is wooing support from the undecided voters to
clinch a majority, the newspaper said.
	   The Mainichi Shimbun showed Obuchi at between 170 and 180 votes,
Koizumi with 80 or 90, and Kajiyama with 55 or 65. Ninety were
still undecided. Fuji TV estimated Obuchi had 170 votes, Koizumi
100 and Kajiyama 50.
	   The ruling party has customarily decided the leader in deals
among the groups in the party called ``habatsu.'' Obuchi, 61, who
heads the biggest habatsu, was next in line for the job.
	   But some lawmakers are worried he lacks the flash and voter
appeal to reverse the party's flagging popularity. There is
widespread speculation that if Obuchi fails to win in the first
vote, the other two camps may unite to foil Obuchi's bid.
	   The July 12 election was widely viewed as a backlash from voters
angry about the government's failure to put the stagnating economy
back on track.
	   Kajiyama, 72, is being perceived as tough on economic reforms,
while Koizumi, 56, is more popular with his maverick image.

Japan's trade surplus rises in June, first half of 1998
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's trade surplus with the world jumped 27
percent in June for the 15th straight month and soared 66 percent
during the first six months of the year, the government said
Wednesday.
	   The merchandise trade surplus, a tally of goods exported minus
imports, rose to 1.22 trillion yen (dlrs 8.68 billion) in June from
the same period last year, the Finance Ministry said.
	   Exports _ buoyed mostly by increased auto shipments to the
United States and Europe _ rose 5.2 percent to 4.36 trillion yen
(dlrs 31.1 billion), it said. Imports fell 1.4 percent to 3.12
trillion yen (dlrs 22.2 billion).
	   Still, the ministry said the pace of growth in the trade surplus
last month was the slowest in more than a year.
	   The increase in the surplus _ which is measured as goods pass
customs but before adjustment for seasonal factors _ was also
moderately lower than economists had forecast.
	   Japan's politically sensitive surplus with the United States,
meanwhile, climbed for the 21st straight month, rising 48.6 percent
in June to 555.58 billion yen (dlrs 4.0 billion).
	   The trade surplus has been rising as Japan has increased its
reliance on exports to pull itself out of a prolonged slump. The
weak domestic economy has also crimped demand for foreign goods.
	   Japan has come under increasing pressure to revive its
recession-plagued economy and help struggling Asian nations by
importing more from the region.
	   In a sign of the regional economic troubles, Japan's trade
surplus with Asia dropped 36.3 percent in June to 374.3 billion yen
(dlrs 2.7 billion).
	   Also Wednesday, the Finance Ministry said that for the first six
months of 1998, Japan's surplus with the world rose 66 percent on
the year to 6.567 trillion yen (dlrs 46.8 billion).
	   With the United States, Japan posted a six-month surplus of
3.074 trillion yen (dlrs 21.9 billion), up 37.7 percent from last
year.

Argentina's President Menem won't seek third term
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds; RECAPS pvs, UPDATING with Menem's announcement opening field
for Peronist party nomination; ADDS reaction and background on
re-election controversies in South America. &QL; 
 &UR; By KEVIN GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ President Carlos Menem's
announcement that he would not seek a third straight term in next
year's election has ended speculation that dominated national
politics for most of the year.
	   ``After a prolonged analysis, I have resolved to exclude myself
from whatever course of action to compete in 1999,'' Menem said
Tuesday, addressing a question that created friction in his
Peronist Party and stalled important legislation.
	   A third term would have required a constitutional amendment or a
special Supreme Court ruling. His term ends Dec. 10, 1999, and the
constitution currently bars him from running again.
	   If Menem had sought such an amendment, his effort would have
been one of several by South American presidents looking to extend
their time in office. Peru's Alberto Fujimori and Brazil's Fernando
Henrique Cardoso are also exploring ways to around their countries'
constitutional term limits.
	   Months of Menem re-election talk caused a rift among the
Peronists, particularly with supporters of his rival for the
presidential nomination, Buenos Aires Gov. Eduardo Duhalde.
	   It also stalled much-needed tax and labor code reforms.
	   A push by Menem supporters to have him run again outraged
Duhalde, who considered himself the party's ``natural'' candidate.
	   ``This ends the internal political fighting,'' said Antonio
Cafiero, a top Peronist official.
	   Opposition leaders were skeptical about the president's
announcement.
	   ``I don't believe one word he says,'' said Carlos Alvarez, a
leader of the left-leaning opposition party, Frepaso.
	   Menem was elected in 1989 for a single six-year term. The
constitution was amended to allow him to run for a second four-year
term.

	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ On July 10, Kelly Perkins, an American heart
transplant recipient, climbed to the top of Mount Fuji, Japan's
tallest peak, to perform an unusual and moving act of thanksgiving.
Associated Press Correspondent Eric Talmadge and Photographer Junji
Kurakawa climbed with her.
 &UR; By ERIC TALMADGE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   ATOP MOUNT FUJI, Japan (AP) _ The climb was over.
	   Kelly Perkins stood on the summit of Mount Fuji, a freezing wind
whipping through her short blonde hair, a mix of tears and rain
streaming down her cheeks.
	   In her hand she held the photo of a person she had never met,
never spoken to, never seen.
	   She knew only a few things about this woman.
	   She knew that the woman was about 40 years old when she was
thrown from a horse and that she had died somewhere in southern
California 2 1/2 years previously.
	   Kelly knew these things because she now carries that woman's
heart in her chest. And as she stood on the rim of Mount Fuji's
volcanic crater, she also carried the ashes of this woman, whose
death saved her life.
	   ___
	   In November 1995, Kelly Perkins was at the UCLA Medical Center
dying of viral cardiomyopathy. Three years earlier, a virus had
somehow infected her heart, done its damage and vanished.
	   She first noticed the problem one night when her heart began to
race. Her family doctor found nothing wrong. He suspected stress.
	   Kelly knew that wasn't it.
	   ``I knew something was up,'' she said. ``And I knew it wasn't in
my head.''
	   Before going on a backpacking trip, she had herself checked
again. This time, tests showed her heart was running amok. She was
taken to a nearby hospital for a more advanced test, which showed
the left ventricle was scarred and swollen to about four times
normal size.
	   A device was implanted in her side to shock her heart into the
proper rhythm.
	   For two years, she learned to live with the problem and a very
unpleasant side-effect; the device tended to shock her when she
laughed. So she learned not to.
	   But a change in medication put an end to even that modicum of
stability she had found in life.
	   To switch, she had to stay off her old medication for a full
day. Without it, however, she was unable to function. Her heart ran
wild, she collapsed. She was admitted to the medical center at UCLA
and put at the top of their list for a heart transplant.
	   Somewhere, not too far away, a 40-year-old woman was thrown from
her horse.
	   ___
	   Kelly got her new heart in November 1995 and recovered so well
that within a few months she was able to return to a favorite hobby
_ hiking in the mountains.
	   She and her husband, Craig, real estate appraisers both aged 36,
started out on the gentler slopes near their home in Laguna Niguel,
California. Soon they were making more serious climbs.
	   Just 10 months after her transplant, Kelly climbed Yosemite's
Half Dome. The 17-mile (27 kms) hike to the 4,100-foot
(1,250-meter) summit took her 11 1/2 hours.
	   Next came Mount Whitney.
	   At 14,494 feet (4,418 meters), Whitney is the highest U.S. peak
outside Alaska. Kelly had done it before, with her old heart. ``I
wanted to prove that I could do it with my new heart,'' she said,
``to prove that to myself.''
	   With Craig and a four-person support team, she made the
three-day, 22-mile (35 kms) round-trip last September.
	   It put her in the national spotlight.
	   Kelly was the first heart transplant recipient known to have
climbed Whitney. She was sought out for interviews. She appeared on
``Good Morning America.'' a popular morning television show
broadcast nationwide in the United States.
	   Among the millions of people who read Kelly's story, one was
particularly touched.
	   ``The donor's daughter read an Associated Press story about
Kelly and put two and two together,'' Craig said. ``She found our
number through information and called our home.''
	   ``It was totally unexpected, I was totally taken aback,'' he
said of the message recorded on his answering machine.
	   ___
	   While Kelly was making her Whitney climb, a debate over
transplants raged in Japan.
	   For years, the Japanese medical community had urged the
recognition of brain death, the condition that makes heart, lung
and liver transplants possible.
	   But opposition was intense.
	   Critics claimed doctors shouldn't be trusted to make such a
judgment, that transplant advocates would rush to harvest organs
instead of struggling to save a dying patient. Others simply felt
uncomfortable with the idea, for reasons of religion or
superstition.
	   Now, after being repeatedly shot down in Parliament, a bill
recognizing brain death was about to become law.
	   Even so, Japan had virtually no infrastructure for actually
carrying out transplants. Legal obstacles threatened to make
harvesting organs extremely difficult and potential donors were
few.
	   For many Japanese in need of a transplant, going abroad remained
the only real option.
	   ``I had seen little Japanese kids at UCLA waiting for a
transplant,'' Kelly said. ``It's heartbreaking.''
	   So, after Whitney, she decided to climb Mount Fuji. Maybe, she
thought, her climb could change the way some people in Japan felt
about transplants.

ATOP MOUNT FUJI: about transplants.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The ascent was split into two legs.
	   It began at station 5, a little base camp 8,250 feet (2,515
meters) up, complete with restaurants, lodges and a post office.
	   From there Kelly, who is 5 feet 3 inches 63 (1.60 meters) and
weighs 95 pounds (43 kilos), hiked for four hours with her husband
and a personal trainer to station 8. There they rested and
acclimatized for several hours.
	   Mount Fuji, Japan's highest peak at 12,388 feet (3.776 meters),
is an almost perfect cone. The volcano is a symbol of beauty in
Japan and has been worshipped for centuries.
	   Seeing sunrise from the summit is considered by many to be a
sacred experience.
	   The four-hour final trek began just after midnight under a full
moon.
	   The climb is not technically challenging. Pilgrims need no
mountain-climbing skills. But Fuji's slopes are covered with a
muscle-grinding mixture of ash and loose stone.
	   That was a problem for Kelly.
	   Because its nerves were severed for her transplant, Kelly's
heart does not ``know'' immediately when to start beating faster to
match the exertion of her body. Adrenaline kicks in after a few
minutes, but until then she must endure an oppressive feeling of
fatigue.
	   And, unlike her previous climbs, the trail up Fuji offers
virtually no level ground.
	   ``I'd heard people climbed it in sandals,'' she said. ``But it's
a hard climb.''
	   ___
	   After the call from the daughter, Craig had kept most of his
dealings with the donor's family to himself. (He and Kelly do not
want the family's name published).
	   Kelly had spoken to her donor's daughter on the phone, but it
was a rather brief conversation, and they had never met.
	   Fear was part of the reason.
	   ``I had mixed feelings. When you need a transplant, you think of
it sort of like a pill. It's the medicine that will make you
well,'' Kelly said. ``It's not until everything is OK for you that
you can start grieving for the donor. It's hard.''
	   ``It isn't just a pill that saved her life anymore,'' her
husband added.
	   ``When you have a family associated with it,'' he said, ``it
becomes more than a medication, it becomes a gift.
	   ``It's a real gift.''
	   Before coming to Japan, Craig told the donor's daughter about
the trip. She asked if he and Kelly would take her mother's ashes
and picture to the summit.
	   He agreed.
	   But he didn't tell his wife until they had reached their goal.
	   Just after sunrise, crouching on Fuji's rugged rim, they opened
the small leather pouch.
	   Clutching the photo and weeping, Kelly watched the gray remains
of the woman who gave her heart swirl from the pouch and disperse
over Japan's sacred volcano, vanishing into the alpine storm.
	   ``It's almost like seeing an angel,'' she said. ``She has been a
kind of mysterious figure in my life for so long. But now it's
real.''

Storm postpones tennis tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A heavy thunderstorm derailed the ATP Tour
comeback of Jimmy Arias on Tuesday and left the Legg Mason Classic
in the dark.
	   Arias, 34 next month, led Wade McGuire 6-4, 2-5 when the storm
struck. The Fitzgerald Tennis Center and the surrounding 30-block
area was left without power.
	   The outage delayed or postponed 14 of the 19 matches scheduled
Tuesday, including second-seeded Andre Agassi's second-round match.
	   Tournament officials added a session Wednesday morning to make
up the matches. But Agassi was not scheduled to play until the
regular late afternoon session Wednesday. That session will also
feature a match involving top-seeded Michael Chang.
	   Arias, playing in his first tour match since 1994, breezed in
the first set Tuesday despite a temperature on the court of 112
degrees Fahrenheit (44 degress Celsius). But he was about to lose
the second set when the fast-moving storm blew in.
	   The only seed to finish play Tuesday, ninth-seeded Jeff Turango,
advanced with a 6-1, 6-2 victory over Johan Van Herck of Belgium.

Greene wins 100, Johnson takes 400, Bubka no-heights
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Michael Johnson showed he's still the
boss. Maurice Greene left Donovan Bailey almost speechless. And one
of track's most enduring stars showed he might at last be finished.
	   It was some night of track at the Goodwill Games.
	   Johnson, the 1996 Olympic 200 and 400 champion, erased any
thoughts that his career might be on a downslide, winning the 400
in a meet-record 43.76 seconds.
	   Greene, who has been bad-mouthed by Bailey since winning last
year's 100-meter world championship, quieted the feisty Canadian by
racing to victory in 9.96.
	   Bailey, coming off a series of injuries and illnesses, appeared
to shut down with 80 meters left and finished seventh at 10.30, far
off his world record of 9.84.
	   But amid those highlights, Sergei Bubka, the greatest
pole-vauler in history, gave more signs that the end of his career
is near.
	   The 34-year-old Ukrainian who has set the world record 35 times
and is the only one to clear 20 feet (6 meters), no-heighted for
the second time in three meets. On his final try at 18 feet, 8 1/4
inches (5.69), the 90-second time limit ran out and Bubka did not
even make an attempt at the bar.
	   Jeff Hartwig won the pole vault at 19-8 1/2 (6.01), breaking his
American record by one-quarter inch (.64 cms).
	   Greene and training partner Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago,
who finished second at 10.00, both stared down Bailey before the
ballyhooed 100.
	   ``There were a whole lot of mind games going on,'' said Jon
Drummond, the fourth-place finisher.
	   Bailey took it lightly, smiling, then saying, ``Everyone's
taking this too seriously. It's time to relax.''
	   Once they got into the blocks, there was no relaxing.
	   Greene blasted out quickly, established the lead and maintained
it throughout, beating Boldon by one yard.
	   ``I knew I had to capitalize on the start to win,'' Greene said.
	   Bailey offered no excuses.
	   ``My preparation was exceptional,'' he said. ``I guess I lost my
concentration out of the blocks. Then, I was down so bad _ maybe 10
or 15 meters _ I thought I'd just run through.''
	   Greene summed up the outcome: ``I guess I'm the world's fastest
man. I'm just getting started.''
	   Johnson's time was the 12th-fastest in history _ he holds nine
of the best _ and the fastest in the world since he ran 43.75 at
Waco, Texas, on April 19, 1997.
	   He broke from the blocks quickly, took a slight lead until the
eight-man field reached the final stretch, then blazed to a
six-yard record.
	   Johnson's future had been clouded by two losses in his three
previous races, but after winning at Rome last week, he said he
felt healthy for the first time in more than a year.
	   ``The two races in Europe did me a lot of good,'' Johnson said,
before being presented the gold medal by heavyweight champion
Evander Holyfield.
	   Tyree Washington, the runner-up in 44.43, said, ``I tried to
come up at the end, but Michael was very strong. Michael ran a
great race.''
	   Jackie Joyner-Kersee, the 36-year-old world record-holder in the
heptathlon who has not completed a multi-event since the 1996
Olympic trials, looked woefully out of shape at the start of her
final heptathlon. The two-time Olympic gold medalist finished her
first four events in second place with 3,833 points, 34 behind
leader DeDee Nathan.
	   ``It's been diffdicult,'' Joyner-Kersee said. ``I'm trying to
stay positive and execute. I'm a fighter.''
	   The final three heptathlon events _ the long jump, javelin and
800 _ are Tuesday.
	   Noureddine Morceli, the world mile record-holder from Algeria,
swept into the lead just before the final lap and beat Kenya's
William Tanui by six yards in 3:53.39, nine seconds slower than his
record.
	   Britain's Jonathan Edwards, the world record-holder in the men's
triple, won at 57-11 (17.65), matching the second-best in the world
this year. Olympic champion Kenny Harrison finished last at 54-2
3/4 (16.53).
	   The gymnastics competition was marred by an injury to Lan Sang,
a Chinese competitor in the women's vault.
	   Officials said Lan apparently injured her head or neck during a
practice vault. She was carried off the floor of Nassau Coliseum on
a stretcher and taken to Nassau County Medical Center for a CAT
scan of her neck and head, authorities said.
	   Her condition was not known.
	   Vanessa Atler, the U.S. national champion in the vault, added
the Goodwill Games gold medal. Atler, the national all-round
champion from Canyon Country, California scored 9.662 to win.
	   In the men's floor exercise, Alexei Nemov of Russia won the gold
with a score of 9.725. American Jay Thornton took the silver with
9.550.
	   Two other Americans won gymnastics medals _ Elise Ray, silver in
the women's uneven bars and Yewki Tomita, bronze in the pommel
horse.
	   Australia advanced to the medal round in basketball with an
82-64 victory over Lithuania. Andrew Gaze scored 26 points for the
Aussies. Lithuania also advanced despite its first loss.
	   In water polo, the United States lost twice by 10-5 scores.
World-champion Spain defeated the Americans with Salvador Gomez and
Ivan Perez each scoring twice. Americans Brad Schumacher, Wolf
Wigo, Chi Kredell, Chris Oeding and Todd Hosmer had one goal each.
Then Russia advanced to the gold-medal game by beating the United
States in the final round-robin match, and will meet Spain for the
title.
	   Italy upset Spain 6-5 Tuesday night on a fourth-period goal by
Leonardo Sotanni. Russia earlier beat Italy 7-4. The United States
will play for the bronze against Italy, which it beat on Monday.

Chinese gymnast injured in Goodwill vault

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES throughout with gymnast paralyzed &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Chinese gymnast Lan Sang was
paralyzed after damaging her spine while practicing for the women's
vault in the Goodwill Games.
	   ``At this time, she is paralyzed and cannot move her legs and
she has a minimal amount of motion in her arms,'' said Dr. Brock
Schnebel, chief physician of the Goodwill Games.
	   Lan, 17, injured her neck during warm-ups Tuesday for the
women's individual apparatus events, officials said. She was
carried off the floor of Nassau Coliseum on a stretcher and taken
to Nassau County Medical Center for a CAT scan.
	   Lan is one of three Chinese women gymnasts competing in the
Goodwill Games. Officials were trying to contact her family in
China.
	   Schnebel said Lan's spine was injured when her chin was forced
down and forward onto her chest.
	   She was conscious and awake after the accident but had no motion
in her legs and was barely able to move her hands, Schnebel said.
	   ``She has communicated through her interpreter but she is quite
scared,'' said Schnebel, an orthopedic surgeon.
	   Doctors were performing tests and evaluating Lan late Tuesday
and planned to make a treatment plan after the examinations were
complete, Schnebel said.
	   He said it was too early to predict if Lan could recover from
her injuries and be able to walk again.
	   ``I'm very concerned about her ability to have neurological
function in the future but it's too early to say,'' Schnebel said.

Stocks fall sharply in morning trading, dollar higher in Tokyo

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday stocks, late morning bond and currency
prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks fell sharply in early trading
Wednesday on worry about the outcome of a ruling party contest to
select a new prime minister. The dollar rose against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average declined 220.38
points, or 1.33 percent, to 16,336.31 as of midday. On Tuesday, the
average lost 14.09 points, or 0.09 percent.
	   Stocks were sold off on concern that Foreign Minister Keizo
Obuchi will win a three-way race to succeed outgoing Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto. The ruling party plans to elect a new president
Friday, who will then become the next prime minister.
	   ``What the market wants is drastic financial reforms, but Obuchi
seems to lack the ability to launch such reforms,'' said Sachio
Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities
Co.
	   Opinion polls show greater public support for Health Minister
Junichiro Koizumi and veteran politician Seiroku Kajiyama. But the
mathematics of ruling party factional politics suggest that Obuchi
is leading the race, Japanese newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   Led lower by bank stocks, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of
all issues listed on the first section lost 14.66 points, or 1.15
percent, to 1,262.51. On Tuesday, the TOPIX closed down 0.78
points, or 0.06 percent, the day before.
	   A sharp drop overnight on Wall Street also weighed on the Tokyo
market, traders said, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed
at 9,190.19 points on Tuesday, down 105.56.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, meanwhile, the dollar
bought 140.66 yen in late morning trading, up 1.18 yen from late
Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of 140.40
yen overnight.
	   The U.S. currency strengthened as buying from investment trusts
offset dollar selling by overseas funds and Japanese exporters,
traders said.
	   In the fixed-income market, the yield on the benchmark No. 182
10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.420 percent from
Tuesday's finish of 1.415 percent, driving its price down to 110.25
yen from 110.30 yen.

Australia's Packer en route to United States for surgery: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian media baron Kerry Packer
plans to fly to the Cornell Medical Center in New York for heart
surgery, a local media report said Wednesday.
	   Packer, who has been a patient at Sydney's Royal Prince Alfred
Hospital for more than a week, will be accompanied Wednesday by a
team of medical staff, the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper
reported.
	   The report said Packer, Australia's richest man, was believed to
have already undergone an operation in which his main kidney artery
was unblocked with a balloon.
	   If the kidney procedure proved successful, he will not need to
continue dialysis, it said. But if not, Packer will need a renal
transplant with a family member likely to provide a kidney.

Dengue fever, malaria on the rise in Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Cases of dengue fever and malaria, the two most
common tropical mosquito-borne diseases, increased in Singapore
during the first half of the year, the country's Environment
Ministry said Wednesday.
	   The number of dengue fever cases rose by 800 to more than 2,800
between January and July this year, compared to the same period
last year.
	   Malaria cases also rose from 207 cases in the first half of
1997, to 236 cases in the same period this year. One person
succumbed to the parasitic disease last month.
	   Malaria is transmitted by the bite of a female Anopheles
mosquito. The Aedes mosquito can carry the dengue virus, which
causes fever, joint pains, chills and in some strains, brain
hemorrhaging and death.
	   Singapore has launched an island-wide campaign against the two
types of mosquitoes, with heavy fines for those who allow the
mosquitoes to breed on their property.

Myanmar sentences 38 Thais to 20 years in jail for illegal logging
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Myanmar court has sentenced 38 Thais
to 20 years in jail each for illegally entering Myanmar and
engaging in illegal logging, Thailand's Bangkok Post reported
Wednesday.
	   The paper cited a district chief in northern Thailand as the
source of the information. Immediate confirmation was not available
from Myanmar's military government.
	   The 38 Thais were sentenced to five years each for illegally
entering Myanmar, and 15 years each for illegal logging. They were
tried and jailed in the town of Mong Hsat in Shan State, about 20
miles (32 kilometers) from the Thai border.
	   Thailand, which is severely deforested, has had a hardwood
logging ban in place since 1989. Most timber for Thai industries is
imported or smuggled from neighboring Myanmar and Cambodia.
	   Tensions between the two countries have risen sharply in recent
weeks after Thailand voiced concern over the deteriorating
political and human rights situation in Myanmar.

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Chinese gymnast Sang Lan was
paralyzed after damaging her spine while practicing for the women's
vault in the Goodwill Games.
	   ``At this time, she is paralyzed and cannot move her legs and
she has a minimal amount of motion in her arms,'' said Dr. Brock
Schnebel, chief physician of the Goodwill Games.
	   Sang, 17, injured her neck Tuesday during warm-ups for the
women's individual apparatus events. Officials said she was
attempting a forward vault and lost control in mid-air, striking
the ground head first. She was carried off the floor of Nassau
Coliseum on a stretcher and taken to Nassau County Medical Center
for a CAT scan.
	   Sang is one of three Chinese women gymnasts competing in the
Goodwill Games. Officials were trying to contact her family in
China.
	   Schnebel said Sang's spine was injured when her chin was forced
down and forward onto her chest.
	   ``I have been able to evaluate and speak with Sang Lan through
an interpreter and evaluate her X-rays and CAT scans,'' Schnebel
said.
	   He said she had a ``fractured-dislocation'' of the sixth and
seventh cervical vertabrae.
	   ``This has resulted in an injury to her spinal cord,'' Schnebel
said.
	   ``At this time, she cannot move her legs. She has minimal motion
of her arms. She cannot feel from her mid-chest down. This is
consistent with a spinal cord injury at the level of C-6, C-7. At
present, she is receiving an MRI and treatment plans will be made
based on the results.''
	   Sang was conscious and awake after the accident but had no
motion in her legs and was barely able to move her hands, Schnebel
said.
	   ``She has communicated through her interpreter but she is quite
scared,'' said Schnebel, an orthopedic surgeon.

<TEXT>
	   SAN VICENTE, El Salvador (AP) _ A former national guardsman
convicted in the rapes and murders of three American nuns and a
layworker walked out of prison, paroled after serving 17 years of a
30-year prison sentence.
	   Jose Roberto Moreno Canjura, one of five guardsmen sentenced for
the crimes in 1984, left the La Esperanza prison four miles (six
kilometers) north of San Salvador after he was released Tuesday
under a new law intended to ease prison overcrowding.
	   A La Esperanza prison official confirmed that Moreno Canjura had
been released.
	   Moreno Canjura and the four other guardsmen were convicted of
kidnapping, raping and killing Roman Catholic nuns Ita Ford,
Dorothy Kazel and Maura Clark and layworker Jean Donovan on Dec. 2,
1980.
	   The crime caused outrage in United States, which strongly
supported the Salvadoran government during the 1980-1992 civil war.
The women were apparently killed because military-backed death
squads suspected them of sympathizing with leftist guerrillas.
	   The guardsmen have claimed in recent interviews that
``higher-ups'' ordered the killing of the four American church
workers.
	   Ford's brother said in a telephone interview late Tuesday that
the families of the slain women opposed the release.
	   ``The government of El Salvador should certainly not have
released these men before closely questioning them on ... who
ordered this crime and who covered it up,'' said William Ford of
Upper Montclair, New Jersey.
	   ``The people in jail were not the intellectual authors of the
murders. They were triggermen sent to do a job by someone else,''
he said.
	   Two more guardsmen are also eligible for parole under the new
law and may be released soon, one from a prison in San Vicente, 40
miles (65 kilometers) southeast of the capital. The other two did
not qualify for release because one previously had been convicted
on weapons charges and the other had participated in a prison
disturbance.
	   The guardsmen were sentenced to 30 years in prison in May 1984
and have been jailed since 1981. They were to be given credit for
time served before their convictions.
	   The U.S. State Department criticized the decision to order the
release of three national guardsmen when it was first announced in
June. The releases have been held up by appeals by prosecutors.
	   ``We think that's a bad idea,'' State Department spokesman James
P. Rubin said at the time, citing the ``heinous'' nature of the
crimes.
	   The national guard was disbanded after a 1992 peace agreement
ended the civil war, which killed an estimated 75,000 people.

<TEXT>
	   VANIMO, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Rescue workers Wednesday had
trouble counting the dead from a tsunami that wiped out coastal
villages in Papua New Guinea because rotting bodies were falling
apart and had to be gathered from a lagoon with nets.
	   The official death toll is over 1,200, but West Sepik provincial
governor John Tekwi told The Associated Press more than 3,000 died
as 23-foot (7-meter) earthquake-generated waves swept over
once-idyllic villages along 18 miles (30 km) of Papua New Guinea's
north coast last Friday.
	   Some 6,000 of the 8,000 to 10,000 people who lived in the area
are still missing, and Papua New Guinean Prime Minister Bill Skate
says he holds little hope many will be found alive.
	   ``Knowing the population base of the villages affected and the
people who are there, that is my conservative estimate,'' Tekwi
said.
	   ``At Warapu village, there were 3,000-plus (people), now there
are only 760. Where are the rest?'' he asked.
	   As of Tuesday, Skate said, only 2,527 people have been found
alive.
	   But Brother Jim Coucher, a relief worker from the Roman Catholic
Diocese of Vanimo, said Wednesday that more survivors had
apparently been found.
	   ``I heard yesterday there's 3,500 survivors -- and that's out of
a population of around about 8,000,'' Coucher said.
	   In Australia, the Salvation Army on Wednesday launched an appeal
for clothing for the survivors, but only called for adult clothes _
nearly all the children in the villages were killed by the deadly
waves.
	   Most of the confirmed dead and many of the missing are children,
victims of furious waters that nearly wiped out the next generation
of Papua New Guineans in the seconds it took to toss people into
trees, hurl them into a lagoon or pull them back into the ocean.
	   Most children were home on a holiday when the waves struck,
rather than in religious mission schools farther inland where they
might have been safe. So many children died that some schools were
not expected to reopen.
	   Now the dead are a threat to the living. Doctors fear new
outbreaks of disease could be caused by the thousands of bodies
rotting in the tropical heat.
	   Crocodiles, dogs and pigs are feasting on the cadavers, and
officials have sent out hunting parties to shoot the scavengers.
	   Burials gave way to gasoline-fueled cremations on the spot as
rescue and recovery workers found the rotting corpses falling apart
in the tropical heat as they tried to move them.
	   Skate on Tuesday invoked emergency powers under the constitution
to put Police Commissioner Peter Agilo in complete control of the
rescue and relief operation.
	   This was intended to end the chaotic scene at local airstrips
where dozens of light and medium aircraft, helicopters and military
planes jostle for runway space, with little or no air control.
	   Skate said stage one of the operation, finding and rescuing the
injured, was now almost complete.
	   Stage two, locating and burying the dead and preventing disease,
will begin with a more coordinated operation.
	   ``For three days we have been flat out. We haven't known what we
are doing. From today, the police commissioner will be in
control,'' Skate told a crowd at Sissano.
	   Skate had a good look at the cause of potential disease, the
hundreds of bloated bodies still drifting in the placid waters,
simmering in the tropical heat.
	   His boat passed more than a dozen bodies caught in the floating
debris of houses or impaled on tough mangrove roots.
	   ``We have to look at the environment, because it really could be
infested. The water is contaminated and it is very very unhealthy.
	   ``I have to sit with the National Disaster Committee and discuss
whether we should evacuate this area, otherwise we will have more
people who will get sick and eventually die,'' he said.
	   The thousands of people displaced by the tsunami have been
warned to stay away from the low-lying beach.
	   On shore, soldiers, missionaries, aid workers and the healthier
surviving villagers use spades to dig shallow graves in the sand,
then don surgical gloves to wrap the corpses in sheets of black
plastic.
	   The burials are unceremonious, with sand quickly shoveled in and
stamped down with their feet. Then the team moves on to the next
body, the next grave.
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, occupies the
eastern half of the island of New Guinea about 90 miles (145
kilometers) north of Australia. Some of its people live a
near-Stone Age existence in the jungles and swamps.
	   The remoteness of the region hampered emergency officials from
Australia, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand, who were coordinating
a rescue operation.
	   The first of three Royal Australian Air Force C-130 Hercules
transport aircraft arrived at Vanimo on Monday with emergency
supplies, including a field hospital and a 100-strong team of
doctors, nurses and engineers.
	   The medics set up a tent hospital on a sports field and cared
for victims sent by three overcrowded hospitals. Many survivors
underwent amputations because bacteria-filled coral sand had
infected wounds, causing gangrene, said Lt. Col. John Crozer, a
surgeon.
	   By Tuesday night, the Australian medics estimated they had dealt
with about 90 percent of the survivors who were injured. Not many
more survivors were expected to emerge from the jungle.

British pilot celebrates record-breaking circle of the globe in
</HEADLINE>
aviation first

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ After surviving a 120-day adventure, a British
pilot has completed his record-breaking journey around the world to
become the first to circumnavigate the globe by microlight aircraft
_ essentially a hang glider with a motorcycle slung underneath.
	   Although he failed to complete the odyssey in time to match
Phileas Fogg's fictional trip around the world in 80 days, he also
smashed the previous record for a round-the-world flight in an
open-cockpit single-engined aircraft. That was set in 1924 by four
U.S. Army pilots who completed the trip in 175 days in a Douglas
biplane.
	   Brian Milton celebrated the completion of his 23,000-mile
(3,7000-kilometer) trip with champagne Tuesday night at the Reform
Club, the London gentlemen's club where Fogg toasted his successful
circumnavigation in Jules Verne's novel ``Around the World in
Eighty Days.''
	   Milton, a 55-year-old former journalist for the BBC, set off
from England March 24 with copilot Keith Reynolds, who was forced
to drop out in Russia after authorities insisted the pair either
take on a native navigator or pay for a plane to accompany them.
	   But even though he survived Alaskan blizzards, being buzzed by a
Syrian MiG jet and an engine blowing up, Milton said his final
landing was among the worst of the whole trip.
	   ``I had about 14 really hairy landings and that was one of the
top five,'' he said. ``It could have ruined the story having got it
all the way round the world.''
	   Milton was in the last of a flotilla of eight microlights to
touch down in high winds after the five-hour final leg of his
journey from Derbyshire in Northern England.
	   The trip, inspired by the 125th anniversary of the Jules Verne
novel, was plagued by numerous delays and difficulties caused by
the weather and bureaucratic wrangling.
	   As he sipped champagne from a bottle, Milton said he would never
make the journey again, but his next challenge might be a
round-the-world race in a fixed wing microlight.
	   He said he plans to write a book about the adventure and hopes
to make a television documentary with some of the 200 hours of
video footage he recorded.
	   The GT Global Flyer, a single-engine Pegasus Quantum 912
aircraft, was powered by an engine equivalent to a small car's. It
had a wing span of 33 feet, 8 inches (10 meters) and an open
cockpit that was 9 feet, 2 inches (3 meters) long.
	   The trip included stops in France, Germany, Italy, Greece,
Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Laos,
Vietnam, China, South Korea and Japan.
	   From there, he flew to Russia, the United States, Canada,
Greenland, Denmark, Iceland and Scotland before he returned to
England.
	   The trip broke the record for the longest and fastest microlight
flight, which Milton set in 1987 when he flew solo from London to
Sydney in 59 days.

Thai Defense Ministry: too many generals with too little to do
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's military has become
top-heavy as nearly 700 of the country's 2,646 generals have little
daily work to keep them busy, a local media report said Wednesday.
	   As a result, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, who is also the
country's first civilian defense minister in more than 20 years, is
limiting promotions to the rank of general, the Bangkok Post
reported Wednesday.
	   The paper cited a Defense Ministry report which said 689
generals lacked specific assignments. They were all attached to the
offices of the Supreme Command and army, navy and air force
headquarters.
	   In addition, 1,009 of the military's 3,098 colonels also have no
specific job assignments.
	   Thailand's military has approximately 275,000 men, and is one of
the better equipped armed forces in Southeast Asia.

Philippine Airlines ground crew union goes on strike

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Ground personnel at ailing air
carrier Philippine Airlines went on strike Wednesday, demanding the
company recall thousands of workers who were laid off during a
recent pilots' strike.
	   The latest strike came as foreign ministers from the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations were preparing to arrive for an annual
meeting in Manila on Friday.
	   ``The strike will last until the airline closes unless PAL
changes its position and recalls the retrenched workers,'' ground
crew union president Alex Barrientos told The Associated Press.
``We will not stop the strike.''
	   PAL warned the strike could be a fatal blow for the troubled
flag carrier.
	   The 57-year-old airline, Asia's oldest, said it was forced to
cancel all but two of its flights Wednesday.
	   Its ground crew also service 19 out of 35 international carriers
at Manila's airport, including Japan Airlines, Singapore Airlines
and Northwest Airlines.
	   A Singapore Airlines official said flights were delayed by the
strike, with PAL caterers refusing to load food. Managers and a few
extra workers were handling passengers' baggage, she said.
	   Foreign ministers from Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam were
scheduled to arrive later Wednesday, with other ASEAN ministers set
to arrive Thursday.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada called the strike
unfortunate and said he hoped to meet with union officials.
	   ``This will have a big effect on our economy and on our
tourism,'' he said.
	   In June, PAL was embroiled in a crippling three-week pilots'
strike that brought the company close to financial ruin.
	   At the height of the strike, the flag carrier laid off 5,000 of
its nearly 14,000 workers to minimize its losses.
	   The ground personnel union then threatened to go on strike to
demand the reinstatement of the terminated workers, but the labor
department assumed jurisdiction of the dispute on July 10 and
prohibited any work stoppage.
	   The labor department also ordered the airline to suspend any
more layoffs.
	   The union, however, said it would go ahead with the strike
plans.
	   Union and company officials met Monday and Tuesday nights to
discuss a possible compromise involving a return of the laid-off
workers and review of the retrenchment plans. However, the airline
insisted the layoffs could be suspended only until Aug. 15, while
the union demanded an unconditional recall of the workers, with
talks on retrenchment to resume later, participants said.
	   PAL senior vice president Avelino Zapanta said management was
unable to give in to the union's demand for a return of the workers
since the airline already has slashed its operations following the
pilots' strike.
	   PAL says it is unable to make payments on about dlrs 2 billion
of debt and is discussing a rehabilitation program with Manila's
Securities and Exchange Commission.
	   The plan includes layoffs, the disposal of most of the airline's
planes, and a sharp reduction of flights.
	   SEC chairman Perfecto Yasay expressed pessimism Wednesday over
whether that plan would be viable with the strike by ground
personnel.

South Korea's militant workers begin new strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Thousands of South Korean metal
workers in the auto, shipbuilding and other heavy industries walked
off their jobs Wednesday to protest rising layoffs.
	   Organizers of the indefinite strike said about 60,000 workers
were participating, but the government put the figure at fewer than
10,000 people.
	   Lee Gap-yong, head of the maverick Confederation of Korean Trade
Unions, said telephone, subway and hospital workers would join the
walkout on Thursday.
	   The government called the strikes illegal and threatened to send
in riot police to break them up. It fears labor unrest will scare
away needed foreign investment.
	   It was the second strike in a week called by the militant labor
confederation to protest layoffs by manufacturers seeking to cut
costs in the face of plummeting sales.
	   The walkout was led by thousands of unionized workers at South
Korea's two largest auto plants _ Hyundai Motor Co. and Daewoo
Motor Co. Both have announced plans to dismiss thousands of
workers.
	   Labor leaders said thousands of laid-off workers will pack
blankets and tents and travel to Seoul this week to stage sit-down
protests in subway stations and plazas.
	   Armed with arrest warrants, police already were seeking some 100
union leaders accused of instigating a series of illegal,
short-lived strikes earlier this month.
	   The number of jobless people has doubled to nearly 1.5 million
since the government accepted a dlrs 58 billion bailout of the
economy in December and began the task of restructuring.
	   One of the hardest hit sectors is the automobile industry, which
has seen sales drop by more than 50 percent. Hyundai, for example,
is operating at 40 percent of its capacity of 1.25 million vehicles
a year.

Bangkok closes Austrian firm until it cleans up water supply
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Bangkok's Metropolitan Waterworks
Authority has ordered an Austrian company to close down until the
water it supplies to one of the city's districts is clean and free
from contaminants.
	   The MWA shut down Austria's Hydro Compact Company on July 17
because residents of Bang Phli district had been complaining since
March that their tap water was yellow and salty, an official with
the authority said Wednesday.
	   The official said the problem was caused by low fresh water
levels and contaminants from factories. Sea water had seeped into
canals used for the water supply, particularly during the hot
season which lasts from March through May, he said.
	   He added that the water was also being fouled by meat processing
plants in the area that were releasing waste water into the canals.
	   No lead or other chemical poisons were found in the water, said
the official who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
	   Hydro Compact Company was awarded a 15-year concession to supply
water to the district in 1990. The official said the closure was
only temporary until the problems were cleared up.
	   Until then, the MWA would supply the district with water from
other areas of Bangkok.
